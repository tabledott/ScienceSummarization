#8212;for the optimization of the referent selection process based on preferential choices.
    An elaborate description of several of these preference criteria is supplied by Carbonell and Brown (1988) who discuss, among others, heuristics involving case role filling, semantic and pragmatic alignment, syntactic parallelism, syntactic topicalization, and intersentential recency.
    Given such a wealth of criteria one may either try to order them a priori in terms of importance or&#8212;as was proposed by the majority of researchers in this field&#8212; define several scoring functions that compute flexible orderings on the fly.
    These combine the variety of available evidence, each one usually annotated by a specific weight factor, and, finally, map the weights to a single salience score (Rich and LuperFoy 1988; HajRova, Kubori, and Kubori 1992; Lappin and Leass 1994) These heuristics helped to improve the performance of discourse-understanding systems through significant reductions of the available searc
