mulas is simply their conjunction.
    This allows the maximum flexibility in learning.
    In particular, lexical entries are no longer limited to be adjacent words as in Zettlemoyer and Collins (2005), but can be arbitrary fragments in a dependency tree.
    For every sub-formula F, we define a corresponding lambda form that can be derived by replacing every Skolem constant ni that does not appear in any unary atom in F with a unique lambda variable xi.
    Intuitively, such constants represent objects introduced somewhere else (by the unary atoms containing them), and correspond to the arguments of the relation represented by F. For example, the lambda form for borders(n1) &#8743; nsubj(n1, n2) &#8743; dobj(n1, n3) is Ax2Ax3. borders(n1) &#8743; nsubj(n1, x2) &#8743; dobj(n1, x3).
    Conceptually, a lambda-form cluster is a set of semantically interchangeable lambda forms.
    For example, to express the meaning that Utah borders Idaho, we can use any form in the cluster representing the next-to relation
