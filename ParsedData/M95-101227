 in the modifiers slot, an approach adopted from the standard linguistic account o f phrase modification.
  Inference in Alembic is actually performed directly on interpretation structures, an d there is no need for a separate translation from interpretations to more traditional-looking propositions .
  The propositional notation is more perspicuous to the reader, and we have adopted it here .
  Finally, note that the phrase interpretation machinery maintains pointers between semantic individual s and the surface strings from which they originated .
  One of the fortunate?if unexpected?consequences o f the phrasers semantic grammar is that maintaining these cross-references is considerably simpler than was th e case in our more linguistically-inspired categorial parser of old .
  Except for the ORG_DESCRIPTOR slot, the fil l rules line up more readily with semantic notions than with syntactic considerations, e .g., maximal projections .
