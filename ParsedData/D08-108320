al semantics is also statistically significant.
    In addition, the difference between CCICOMPOPR (learning-based) and COMPOMC (non-learning-based) is statistically significant, as is the difference between NEGEX and VOTE.
    One might wonder whether employing additional context outside the annotated expression boundaries could further improve the performance.
    Indeed, conventional wisdom would say that it is necessary to employ such contextual information (e.g., Wilson et al. (2005)).
    In any case, it is important to determine whether our results will apply to more real-world settings where human-annotated expression boundaries are not available.
    To address these questions, we gradually relax our previous assumption that the exact boundaries of expressions are given: for each annotation boundary, we expand the boundary by x words for each direction, up to sentence boundaries, where x E 11, 5, ocI.
    We stop expanding the boundary if it will collide with the boundary of an expression with a diff
