 the percentage of NEs correctly identified by the algorithm.
    In the multi-word NE experiment, 282 random multi-word (2 or more) NEs and their transliterations/translations discovered by the algorithm were verified by a language expert.
    Figure 3 shows the proportion of correctly discovered NE transliteration equivalence classes throughout the training stage.
    The figure also shows the accuracy if transliterations are selected according to the current transliteration model (top scoring candidate) and temporal sequence matching alone.
    The transliteration model alone achieves an accuracy of about 38%, while the time sequence alone gets about 41%.
    The combined algorithm achieves about 63%, giving a significant improvement. vs. sliding window size ( ) for each of the three measures.
    In order to understand what happens to the transliteration model as the training proceeds, let us consider the following example.
