, let T = (Q, i, F, E, L, 6, a, p) be a p-subsequential transducer representing f , where p = (p1,.
    , pp) is the output function mapping Q to (A*)P. Let N and M be defined by: We denote by Dom(T) the set of strings accepted by T. Let k &gt; 0 and (ui, u2) E [Dom(T)12 such that d(ui, u2) &lt;k.
    Then, there exists u E E* such that: Thus, f has bounded variation using dip.
    This ends the proof of the theorem.
    We briefly mentioned several theoretical and computational properties of sequential and p-subsequential transducers.
    These devices are used in many areas of computational linguistics.
    In all those areas, the determinization algorithm can be used to obtain a p-subsequential transducer (Mohri 1996b), and the minimization algorithm to reduce the size of the p-subsequential transducer used (Mohri 1994b).
    The composition, union, and equivalence algorithms for subsequential transducers are also useful in many applications.
