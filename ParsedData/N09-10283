lating languages like Chinese and Arabic into English.
    A simpler alternative, the hierarchical phrase-based approach (Chiang, 2005; Wu, 1997) also showed promising results for translating Chinese to English.
    Similar to the distance based reordering models, the syntactical or hierarchical approaches also rely on other models to get word alignments.
    These models typically combine machine translation decoding with chart parsing, therefore significantly increase the decoding complexity.
    Even though some recent work has shown great improvements in decoding efficiency for syntactical and hierarchical approaches (Huang and Chiang, 2007), they are still not as efficient as phrase-based systems, especially when higher order language models are used.
    Finally, researchers have also tried to put source language syntax into reordering in machine translation.
    Syntactical analysis of source language can be used to deterministically reorder input sentences (Xia and McCord, 2004; Collins et.al., 2005;
