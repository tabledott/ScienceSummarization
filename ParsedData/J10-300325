    Most, if not all, such methods usually perform paraphrase induction by employing the idea of distributional similarity as outlined in the previous section.
    Besides the obvious caveat discussed previously regarding distributional similarity, we find that the other most important factor affecting the performance of these methods is the choice of distributional ingredients&#8212;that is, the features used to formulate the distribution of the extracted units.
    We consider three commonly used techniques that generate phrasal paraphrases (or paraphrastic patterns) from a single monolingual corpus but use very different distributional features in terms of complexity.
    The first uses only surface-level features and the other two use features derived from additional semantic knowledge.
    Although the latter two methods are able to generate more sophisticated paraphrases by virtue of more specific and more informative ingredients, we find that doing so usually has an adverse effect on their coverage
