    Subjective terms have many different semantic meanings, but we believe that the same contextual principle applies to subjectivity.
    In this section, we briefly overview these bootstrapping algorithms and explain how we used them to generate lists of subjective nouns.
    The Meta-Bootstrapping (&#8220;MetaBoot&#8221;) process (Riloff and Jones, 1999) begins with a small set of seed words that represent a targeted semantic category (e.g., 10 words that represent LOCATIONS) and an unannotated corpus.
    First, MetaBoot automatically creates a set of extraction patterns for the corpus by applying and instantiating syntactic templates.
    This process literally produces thousands of extraction patterns that, collectively, will extract every noun phrase in the corpus.
    Next, MetaBoot computes a score for each pattern based upon the number of seed words among its extractions.
    The best pattern is saved and all of its extracted noun phrases are automatically labeled as the targeted semantic cate
