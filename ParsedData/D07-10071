			Common assumptions about the role and useful ness of word sense disambiguation (WSD) models in full-scale statistical machine translation (SMT) systems have recently been challenged.
			On the one hand, in previous work (Carpuat and Wu, 2005b) we obtained disappointing results when using the predictions of a Senseval WSD system inconjunction with a standard word-based SMT system: we reported slightly lower BLEU scores de spite trying to incorporate WSD using a number of apparently sensible methods.
