rther classification of opinions according to subject and opinion holder and for refining the original positive/negative attitude determination.
    We review related work in Section 2, and then present our document-level classifier for opinion or factual articles (Section 3), three implemented techniques for detecting opinions at the sentence level (Section 4), and our approach for rating an opinion as positive or negative (Section 5).
    We have evaluated these methods using a large collection of news articles without additional annotation (Section 6) and an evaluation corpus of 400 sentences annotated for opinion classifications (Section 7).
    The results, presented in Section 8, indicate that we achieve very high performance (more than 97%) at document-level classification and respectable performance (86&#8211;91%) at detecting opinion sentences and classifying them according to orientation.
  
  
    Much of the earlier research in automated opinion detection has been performed by Wiebe and colleagues
