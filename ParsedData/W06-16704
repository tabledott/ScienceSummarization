d learning approach, which takes local dependencies between labels into account.
    To this extent, we cast the supersense tagging problem as a sequence labeling task and train a discriminative Hidden Markov Model (HMM), based on that of Collins (2002), on the manually annotated Semcor corpus (Miller et al., 1993).
    In two experiments we evaluate the accuracy of the tagger on the Semcor corpus itself, and on the English &#8220;all words&#8221; Senseval 3 shared task data (Snyder and Palmer, 2004).
    The model outperforms remarkably the best known baseline, the first sense heuristic &#8211; to the best of our knowledge, for the first time on the most realistic &#8220;all words&#8221; evaluation setting.
    The paper is organized as follows.
    Section 2 introduces the tagset, Section 3 discusses related work and Section 4 the learning model.
    Section 5 reports on experimental settings and results.
    In Section 6 we summarize our contribution and consider directions for further research.
