    We identified six operations that can be used alone or together to transform extracted sentences into sentences in human-written abstracts.
    The operations were identified based on manual and automatic comparison of human-written abstracts and the original articles.
    Examples include sentence reduction, sentence combination, syntactic transformation, and lexical paraphrasing.
    (2) Development of an automatic system to perform cut and paste operations.
    Two operations - sentence reduction and sentence combination - are most effective in transforming extracted sentences into summary sentences that are as concise and coherent as in human-written abstracts.
    We implemented a sentence reduction module that removes extraneous phrases from extracted sentences, and a sentence combination module that merges the extracted sentences or the reduced forms resulting from sentence reduction.
    Our sentence reduction model determines what to cut based on mu
