uantity the left outside probability, and denote it aL (see Figure 6).
    The following recursive formula can be used to compute aL.
    Let Elk be the set of all edges, or rule expansions, in which the nonterminal 1\1k appears.
    For each edge e in E' we compute the product of cti, of the nonterminal appearing on the left-hand pc, side (lhs) of the rule, the probability of the rule itself, and 13 of each nonterminal Ks appearing to the left of NI hk in the rule.
    Then aL(Nk) is the sum of these products: Given a complete parse of the sentence, the formula above gives an exact value for aL.
    During parsing, the set Elk is not complete, and so the formula gives an approximation of aL.
    This formula can be infinitely recursive, depending on the properties of the grammar.
    A method for calculating aL more efficiently can be derived from the calculations given in Jelinek and Lafferty (1991).
    A simple extension to the normalized 0 model allows us to estimate the perword probability of all tags i
