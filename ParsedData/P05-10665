t uses the original IBM models to derive word-to-word alignments in the corpus of example translations.
    Heuristics are then used to grow these alignments to encompass phrase-tophrase pairs.
    The end result of the training process is a lexicon of phrase-to-phrase pairs, with associated costs or probabilities.
    In translation with the system, a beam search method with left-to-right search is used to find a high scoring translation for an input sentence.
    At each stage of the search, one or more English words are added to the hypothesized string, and one or more consecutive German words are &#8220;absorbed&#8221; (i.e., marked as having already been translated&#8212;note that each word is absorbed at most once).
    Each step of this kind has a number of costs: for example, the log probability of the phrase-tophrase correspondance involved, the log probability from a language model, and some &#8220;distortion&#8221; score indicating how likely it is for the proposed words in the English string to be
