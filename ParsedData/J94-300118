 single transducer that works with only two tapes, one containing the abstract phonological string and the other containing its phonetic realization.
    General methods for constructing transducers such as these rely on fundamental mathematical notions that we develop in the next section.
  
  
    Formal languages are sets of strings, mathematical objects constructed from a finite alphabet E by the associative operation of concatenation.
    Formal language theory has classified string sets, the subsets of E*, in various ways and has developed correspondences between languages, grammatical notations for describing their member strings, and automata for recognizing them.
    A similar conceptual framework can be established for string relations.
    These are the collections of ordered tuples of strings, the subsets of E* x x E*.
    We begin by defining an n-way concatenation operation in terms of the familiar concatenation of simple strings.
    If X = (x1, x2,... xn) and Y = &#8226; &#8226; &#8226; yn) ar
