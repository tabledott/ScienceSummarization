re is a remarkable difference between the algorithms with respect to strategic errors and error chains.
    Strategic errors occur whenever the preference given by the algorithm under consideration leads to an error.
    Most of the strategic errors implied by the FunC algorithm also show up as errors for the BFP algorithm.
    We interpret this finding as an indication that these errors are caused by a lack of semantic or world knowledge.
    The remaining errors of the BFP algorithm are caused by the strictly local definition of its criteria and because the BFP algorithm cannot deal with some particular configurations leading to ambiguities.
    The FunC algorithm has fewer error chains not only because it yields fewer strategic errors, but also because it is more robust with respect to real texts.
    An utterance U1, for instance, which intervenes between Lti_i and /11+1 without any relation to Ui_i does not affect the preference decisions in Ui+2 for FunC, although it does affect them for the BFP algorit
