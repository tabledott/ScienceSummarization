    The advantages of training are apparent in Table 2.
    Note the astounding improvement in performance.
    Despite a few decoding problems, which indicate limitations in the heuristic search procedure employed by the recognizer, sentence accuracy had improved from 35% to 82-83%.
    Moreover, training turned out to be important for speeding up the search.
    The first row shows the results for the initial estimates, which were very carefully prepared by two members of the group over several weeks.
    Despite all of the careful hand work, the search was so slow that only 10 of the 100 test sentences could be recognized.
    The initial estimates were unusable without at least some training.
    These days, most researchers find that they do not need to be nearly so careful in obtaining initial estimates.
    Emboldened by this success, the group began to explore other areas where training might be helpful.
    They began by throwing out the phonological rules.
    Thus, they accepted on
