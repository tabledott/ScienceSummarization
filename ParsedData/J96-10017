    The recent availability of large amounts of bilingual data has attracted interest in several areas, including sentence alignment (Gale and Church 1991b; Brown, Lai, and Mercer 1991; Simard, Foster and Isabelle 1992; Gale and Church 1993; Chen 1993), word alignment (Gale and Church 1991a; Brown et al. 1993; Dagan, Church, and Gale 1993; Fung and McKeown 1994; Fung 1995b), alignment of groups of words (Smadja 1992; Kupiec 1993; van der Eijk 1993), and statistical translation (Brown et al.
    1993).
    Of these, aligning groups of words is most similar to the work reported here, although, as we shall show, we consider a greater variety of groups than is typical in other research.
    In this section, we describe work on sentence and word alignment and statistical translation, showing how these goals differ from our own, and then describe work on aligning groups of words.
