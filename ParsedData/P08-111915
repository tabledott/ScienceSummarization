and the extracted instance is underlined: Countries such as China and Laos have been...
    In the HPLG, an edge e = (China, Laos) would be created because the pattern anchored by China extracted Laos as a new candidate instance.
    If this pattern extracted Laos from 15 different snippets, then the edge&#8217;s weight would be 15.
    The in-degree of a node represents its popularity, i.e., the number of instance occurrences that generated it.
    The graph is constructed dynamically as bootstrapping progresses.
    Initially, the seed is the only trusted class member and the only vertex in the graph.
    The bootstrapping process begins by instantiating the doubly-anchored pattern with the seed class member, issuing a web query to generate new candidate instances, and adding these new instances to the graph.
    A score is then assigned to every node in the graph, using one of several different metrics defined below.
    The highest-scoring unexplored node is then added to the set of trusted class members,
