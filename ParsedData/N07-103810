nt model makes a prediction regarding rank consensus based on a &#183; x.
    However, the default aspect predictions 9[1] ... y[m] may not accord with the agreement model.
    For example, if a &#183; x &gt; 0, but 9[i] =&#65533; y[j] for some i, j E 1...m, then the agreement model predicts complete consensus, whereas the individual aspect models do not.
    We therefore adopt a joint prediction criterion which simultaneously takes into account all model components &#8211; individual aspect models as well as the agreement model.
    For each possible prediction r = (r[1], ..., r[m]) this criterion assesses the level of grief associated with the ith-aspect ranking model, gi(x, r[i]).
    Similarly, we compute the grief of the agreement model with the joint prediction, ga(x, r) (both gi and ga are defined formally below).
    The decoder then predicts the m ranks which minimize the overall grief: &#65533; (2) If the default rank predictions for the aspect models, y&#65533; = (0[1], ..., y[m]), are in accord wi
