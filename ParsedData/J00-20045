in this fashion are significantly more accurate than a baseline knowledge-free model.
    This article also shows how a statistical translation model can take advantage of preexisting knowledge that might be available about particular language pairs.
    Even the simplest kinds of languagespecific knowledge, such as the distinction between content words and function words, are shown to reliably boost translation model performance on some tasks.
    Statistical models that reflect knowledge about the model domain combine the best of both the rationalist and empiricist paradigms.
  
  
    The idea of a computer system for translating from one language to another is almost as old as the idea of computer systems.
    Warren Weaver wrote about mechanical translation as early as 1949.
    More recently, Brown et al. (1988) suggested that it may be possible to construct machine translation systems automatically.
    Instead of codifying the human translation process from introspection, Brown and his colleagues prop
