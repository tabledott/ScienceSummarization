e in which the weak learner can afford to exhaustively search through the space of possible features.
    Future work on reranking approaches might consider other approaches&#8212;such as boosting of decision trees&#8212;which can effectively consider more complex features.
  
  
    This section describes how the ideas from classification problems can be extended to reranking tasks.
    A baseline statistical parser is used to generate N-best output both for its training set and for test data sentences.
    Each candidate parse for a sentence is represented as a feature vector which includes the log-likelihood under the baseline model, as well as a large number of additional features.
    The additional features can in principle be any predicates over sentence/tree pairs.
    Evidence from the initial loglikelihood and the additional features is combined using a linear model.
    Parameter estimation becomes a problem of learning how to combine these different sources of information.
    The boosting algorit
