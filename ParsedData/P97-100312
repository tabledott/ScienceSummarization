 is fulfilled (and removed from the subcat list) when a trace or a modifier non-terminal which has the +gap feature is generated.
    For example, Rule (2), SBAR(that) (+gap) -&gt; WHNP (that ) S-C (bought ) (+gap) , has probability In rule (2) Right is chosen, so the +gap requirement is added to RC.
    Generation of S-C (bought) (+gap) :ulfills both the S-C and +gap requirements in RC.
    In rule (4) Right is chosen again.
    Note that generation of trace satisfies both the NP-C and +gap subcat requirements.
  
  
    Table 1 shows the various levels of back-off for each type of parameter in the model.
    Note that we decompose P L(L,(1ws, Its) I P, H, w, t, A, LC) (where /wi and /t, are the word and POS tag generated with non-terminal Ls, A is the distance measure) into the product 'PLI(Li(itz) I P,H,w,t,A,LC) x PL,2(hoi I Ls, its, P, H, w, t, A, LC), and then smooth these two probabilities separately (Jason Eisner, p.c.).
    In each case' the final estimate is where e1, e2 and e3 are maximum likelihoo
