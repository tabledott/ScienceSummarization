    A major-node can be connected from different subnodes.
    The arc weights between-subnodes and major-nodes are always 1.0. .
    A trace starting from the graph root, selecting one of the arcs from major-nodes,-subnodes, and-subnodes, and all the arcs from -subnodes, corresponds to a particular, and the product of the weight on the trace corresponds to P .
    Note that a trace forms a tree, making branches at the -subnodes.
    We define an alpha probability and a beta probability for each major-node, in analogy with the measures used in the inside-outside algorithm for probabilistic context free grammars (Baker, 1979).
    The alpha probability (outside probability) is a path probability from the graph root to the node and the side branches of the node.
    The beta probability (inside probability) is a path probability below the node.
    Figure 4 shows formulae for alphabeta probabilities.
    From these definitions, .
