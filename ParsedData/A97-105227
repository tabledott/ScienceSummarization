 plus PP with non-finite clausal complement.
    The system could be applied to corpus data by first sorting sentences into groups containing instances of a specified predicate, but we use a different strategy since it is more efficient to tag, lemmatize and parse a corpus just once, extracting patternsets for all predicates in each sentence; then to classify the patterns in all patternsets; and finally, to sort and recombine patternsets into sets of patternsets, one set for each distinct predicate containing patternsets of just the patterns relevant to that predicate.
    The tagger, lemmatizer, grammar and parser have been described elsewhere (see previous references), so we provide only brief relevant details here, concentrating on the description of the components of the system that are new: the extractor, classifier and evaluator.
    The grammar consists of 455 phrase structure rule schemata in the format accepted by the parser (a syntactic variant of a Definite Clause Grammar with iterative (Kleene) op
