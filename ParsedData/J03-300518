second, independent standard against which to compare Web counts.
    At the same time the correlation found between the counts obtained from the two corpora can serve as an upper limit for the correlation that we can expect between corpus counts and Web counts.
    The NANTC corpus was parsed using MINIPAR (Lin 1994, 2001), a broad-coverage parser for English.
    MINIPAR employs a manually constructed grammar and a lexicon derived from WordNet with the addition of proper names (130,000 entries in total).
    Lexicon entries contain part-of-speech and subcategorization information.
    The grammar is represented as a network of 35 nodes (i.e., grammatical categories) and 59 edges (i.e., types of syntactic [dependency] relationships).
    MINIPAR employs a distributedchart parsing algorithm.
    Instead of a single chart, each node in the grammar network maintains a chart containing partially built structures belonging to the grammatical category represented by the node.
    Grammar rules are implemented as c
