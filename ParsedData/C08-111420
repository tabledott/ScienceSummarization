			The four experiments are summarized in Tables 8 and 9.
			For the first two experiments, where there are previous results, PairClass is not the best, butit performs competitively.
			For the second two ex periments, PairClass performs significantly abovethe baselines.
			However, the strength of this ap proach is not its performance on any one task, but the range of tasks it can handle.As far as we know, this is the first time a standard supervised learning algorithm has been ap plied to any of these four problems.
			The advantageof being able to cast these problems in the frame work of standard supervised learning problems isthat we can now exploit the huge literature on su pervised learning.
			Past work on these problems has required implicitly coding our knowledge ofthe nature of the task into the structure of the algo rithm.
			For example, the structure of the algorithmfor latent sem
