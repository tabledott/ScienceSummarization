 general, this is a difficult open problem that only recently has started to receive some attention (Mohammad et al., 2008).
    Resolving this is not the focus of this paper, but we describe a general heuristic for fixing this problem.
    We observe that the problem stems from the lack of negative features for discovering meanings in contrast.
    In natural languages, parallel structures like conjunctions are one such feature.5 We thus introduce an exponential prior with weight &#946; on the number of conjunctions where the two conjunctive parts are assigned to the same cluster.
    To detect conjunction, we simply used the Stanford dependencies that begin with &#8220;conj&#8221;.
    This proves very effective, fixing the majority of the errors in our experiments.
  
  
    Given a sentence and the quasi-logical form Q derived from its dependency tree, the conditional probability for a semantic parse L is given by Pr(L|Q) a exp (Ei wini(L, Q)).
    The MAP semantic parse is simply arg maxL &amp; wini(L, Q
