 the LLL challenge submission, we optimized the regularization parameter C by 10-fold cross validation; while we used its default value for the AImed experiment.
    In both experiments, we set the cost-factor WZ to be the ratio between the number of negative and positive examples.
    KSL performance was first evaluated on the AImed data set (Section 4.1).
    We first give an evaluation of the kernel combination and then we compare our results with the Subsequence Kernel for Relation Extraction (ERK) described in (Bunescu and Mooney, 2005b).
    All experiments are conducted using 10-fold cross validation on the same data splitting used in (Bunescu et al., 2005; Bunescu and Mooney, 2005b).
    Table 1 shows the performance of the three kernels defined in Section 3 for protein-protein interactions using the two evaluation methodologies described above.
    We report in Figure 4 the precision-recall curves of ERK and KSL using OARD evaluation methodology (the evaluation performed by Bunescu and Mooney (2005b)
