    The MUC F-score is also the harmonic mean of precision and recall.
    However, the MUC precision counts precision errors by computing the minimum number of links that must be added to ensure that all mentions referring to a given entity are connected in the graph.
    Recall errors are the number of links that must be removed to ensure that no two mentions referring to different entities are connected in the graph.
    We train a regularized average perceptron using examples selected as described in Section 2.2.1.
    The learning rate is 0.1 and the regularization parameter (separator thickness) is 3.5.
    At training time, we use a threshold of 0.0, but when evaluating, we select parameters to optimize B-Cubed F-Score on a held-out development set.
    We sample all even integer thresholds from -16 to 8.
    We choose the number of rounds of training similarly, allowing any number from one to twenty.
  
  
    In Table 4, we compare our performance against a system that is comparab
