s, and direct application of MSA in the presence of different constituent orderings can be problematic.
    For example, when given as input the same sentences in Figure 1, one instantiation of the MSA algorithm produces the FSA in Figure 3, which contains many &#8220;bad&#8221; paths such as the battle of last week&#8217;s fighting took at least 12 people lost their people died in the fighting last week&#8217;s fighting (See Section 4.2.2 for a more quantitative analysis.).
    It&#8217;s still possible to use MSA if, for example, the input is pre-clustered to have the same constituent ordering (Barzilay and Lee (2003)).
    But we chose to approach this problem from another direction.
    As a result, we propose a new syntax-based algorithm to produce FSAs.
    In this paper, we first introduce the multiple translation corpus that we use in our experiments (see Section 2).
    We then present the algorithms that we developed to induce finite-state paraphrase representations from such data (see Section 3).
