    Allowing to learn phrase translations over such sentence fragments is important for achieving high performance.
    How long do phrases have to be to achieve high performance?
    Figure 2 displays results from experiments with different maximum phrase lengths.
    All phrases consistent with the word alignment (AP) are used.
    Surprisingly, limiting the length to a maximum of only three words show that length 3 is enough per phrase already achieves top performance.
    Learning longer phrases does not yield much improvement, and occasionally leads to worse results.
    Reducing the limit to only two, however, is clearly detrimental.
    Allowing for longer phrases increases the phrase translation table size (see Table 2).
    The increase is almost linear with the maximum length limit.
    Still, none of these model sizes cause memory problems.
    One way to validate the quality of a phrase translation pair is to check, how well its words translate to each other.
    For this, we need a lexi
