 0.0103 WPR wh-pronoun 0.0137 When combining the taggers, every tagger pair is taken in turn and allowed to vote (with a weight equal to the probability P(tag, I tag1,tag2) as described above) for each possible tag (Figure 2).
    If a tag pair tag1-tag2 has never been observed in the training data, we fall back on information on the individual taggers, i.e., P(tag, I tag]) Let Ti be the component taggers and S,(tok) the most probable tag for a token tok as suggested by Ti.
    Then the vote V(tag, tok) for tagging token tok with tag tag is given by: The TagPair algorithm for voting between component taggers.
    If the case to be classified corresponds to the feature-value pair set with the weight WFsub for an Fsub containing n elements equal to wn, where Wm', is a normalizing The Weighted Probability Distribution Voting classification algorithm, as used in the combination experiments. and P(tagx I tag2).
    Note that with this method (and all of the following), a tag suggested by a minority (or even none)
