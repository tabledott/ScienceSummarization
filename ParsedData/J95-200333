ferences in inference load of alternative multi-utterance sequences that differentially realize the same content.
    Although several cross-linguistic studies have investigated Rule 2 (see Section 9), there are as yet no psycholinguistic results empirically validating it.
    The two centering rules along with the partial ordering on the forward-looking centers described in Section 5 constitute the basic framework of center management.
    These rules can explain a range of variations in local coherence.'
    A violation of Rule 1 occurs if a pronoun is not used for the backward-looking center and some other entity is realized by a pronoun.
    Such a violation occurs in the following sequence presumed to be in a longer segment that is currently centered on John (cf. also examples (9) and (10) in Section 5): The violation of Rule 1 leads to the incoherence of the sequence.
    The only possible interpretation is that the &amp;quot;John&amp;quot; referred to in (15c) is a second person named &amp;quot;John,&a
