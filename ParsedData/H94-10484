 Noun of the Object of the Preposition (N2) For example, questions on the history "imposed a gradual ban on virtually all uses of asbestos", can only ask about he following four words: At the maximum of the training data log-likelihood, the model has the property that its k parameters, namely the Ats, satisfy k constraints on the expected values of feature functions, where the ith constraint is, EmA = #.f~ imposed ban  on uses The notion of a "head" word here corresponds loosely to the notion of a lexical head.
  We use a small set of rules, called a Tree Head Table, to obtain the head word of a constituent [12].
  We allow two types of binary-valued questions: The model expected value is, Emf~ = ~(h)p(d lh ) f i (h ,  d) h,d 1.
  Questions about the presence of any n-gram (n _&lt; 4) of the four head words, e.g., a bigram maybe {V == i s    ,  P ==   o f    }.
  Features comprised solely of questions on words are denoted as "word" features.
  and the training data expected value, also called the desired valu
