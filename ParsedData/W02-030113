., 2001) for the experiments, which is a variant of (Ratnaparkhi, 1996) modified to use HMM state features.
  
  
    In the above definitions, k is a relative word position from the word to be classified.
    A negative value represents a preceding word&#8217;s position, and a positive value represents a following word&#8217;s position.
    Note that we assume that the classification proceeds left to right as can be seen in the definition of the preceding class feature.
    For the SVM classification, we does not use a dynamic argmax-type classification such as the Viterbi algorithm, since it is difficult to define a good comparable value for the confidence of a prediction such as probability.
    The consequences of this limitation will be discussed with the experimental results.
    Features usually form a group with some variables such as the position unspecified.
    In this paper, we instantiate all features, i.e., instantiate for all i, for a group and a position.
    Then, it is convenient to denote a
