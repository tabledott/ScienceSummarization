in September, [NP nearly the same (18) as the $236.79 billion in August] Because any predicative noun phrase could be used in this manner, this construction is also potentially problematic for the coverage of our grammar and lexicon.
    However, the fact that a comma is required allows us to use a small number of binary type-changing rules (which do not project any dependencies), such as:
  
  
    The translation algorithm presumes that the trees in the Penn Treebank map directly to the desired CCG derivations.
    However, this is not always the case, either because of noise in the Treebank annotation, differences in linguistic analysis, or because CCG, like any other expressive linguistic formalism, requires information that is not present in the Treebank analysis.
    Before translation, a number of preprocessing steps are therefore required.
    Disregarding the most common preprocessing step (the insertion of a noun level, which is required in virtually all sentences), preprocessing affects almost 43%
