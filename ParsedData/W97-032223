ple (Pedersen and Bruce, 1997b).
    Here, our best performance using a larger sample with a natural distribution of senses is only an increase of 20 percentage points over the accuracy of the majority classifier.
    Because skewed distributions are common in lexical work (Zipf, 1935), they are an important consideration in formulating disambiguation experiments.
    In future work, we will investigate procedures for feature selection that are more sensitive to minority classes.
    Reliance on frequency based features, as used in this work, means that the more skewed the sample is, the more likely it is that the features will be indicative of only the majority class.
    Despite varying the feature sets, the relative accuracy of the three algorithms remains rather consistent.
    For 6 of the 13 words there was a single algorithm that was always significantly more accurate than the other two across all features.
    The EM algorithm was most accurate for last and line with all three feature sets.
