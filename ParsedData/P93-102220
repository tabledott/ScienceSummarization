higher than that of a naive, Word Frequency method, which always selects the most frequent translation.
    It should be noted that the Word Frequency method is equivalent to using the frequency based estimate, in which higher word frequencies entail a higher estimate for the corresponding cooccurrence.
    The results of the experiment are summarized in Table 4.
    In the second evaluation, the estimation method had to distinguish between members of two sets of 61t should be emphasized that the TWS method uses only a monolingual target corpus, and not a bilingual corpus as in other methods ((Brown et al., 1991; Gale et al., 1992)).
    The alternative cooccurrence patterns in the target language, which correspond to the alternative translations of the ambiguous source words, are constructed using a bilingual lexicon. cooccurrence pairs, one of them containing pairs with relatively high probability and the other pairs with low probability.
    To a large extent, this task simulates a typical scenario in disa
