els that reflect knowledge about the model domain combine the best of both the rationalist and empiricist paradigms.
    The idea of a computer system for translating from one language to another is almost as old as the idea of computer systems.
    Warren Weaver wrote about mechanical translation as early as 1949.
    More recently, Brown et al. (1988) suggested that it may be possible to construct machine translation systems automatically.
    Instead of codifying the human translation process from introspection, Brown and his colleagues proposed machine learning techniques to induce models of the process from examples of its input and output.
    The proposal generated much excitement, because it held the promise of automating a task that forty years of research have proven very labor-intensive and error-prone.
    Yet very few other researchers have taken up the cause, partly because Brown et al. 's (1988) approach was quite a departure from the paradigm in vogue at the time.
