no semantic information is dropped during composition): this makes it impossible to guarantee that certain generation algorithms will work effectively.
    Finally, from a theoretical perspective, it seems clear that substantive generalizations are being missed.
    Minimal Recursion Semantics (MRS: Copestake et al (1999), see also Egg (1998)) tightens up the specification of composition a little.
    It enforces monotonic accumulation of EPs by making all rules append the EPs of their daughters (an approach which was followed by Sag and Wasow (1999)) but it does not fully spectics in TFSs d to other work on unification based grammar. and abstracts away from the specific feature architecture used in individual grammars, but the essential features of the algebra can be encoded in the hierarchy of lexical and constructional type constraints.
    Our work actually started as an attempt at rational reconstruction of semantic composition in the large grammar implemented by the LinGO project at (available via Seman
