airly early example).
    It is in many ways easier to work with than A-calculus based approaches (which we discuss further below) and has the great advantage of allowing generalizations about the syntax-semantics interface to be easily expressed.
    But there are problems.
    The operations are only specified in terms of the TFS logic: the interpretation relies on an intuitive correspondence with a conventional logical representation, but this is not spelled out.
    Furthermore the operations on the semantics are not tightly specified or constrained.
    For instance, although HPSG has the Semantics Principle (Pollard and Sag, 1994) this does not stop the composition process accessing arbitrary pieces of structure, so it is often not easy to conceptually disentangle the syntax and semantics in an HPSG.
    Nothing guarantees that the grammar is monotonic, by which we mean that in each rule application the semantic content of each daughter subsumes some portion of the semantic content of the mother (i.e.,
