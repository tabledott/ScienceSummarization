g, ranking, cosine metric, LSA) and segmentation error rate.
    The test procedure is based on that presented in (Choi, 2000a) which was derived from work in TDT (Allan et al., 1998) and previous experiments in text segmentation (Reynar, 1998, 71-73).
    The task is to find the most prominent topic boundaries in a concatenated text.
    The accuracy of a segmentation algorithm is assessed by the experiment package' described in (Choi, 2000a).
    A test sample is a concatenation of ten text segments.
    Each segment is the first n sentences of a randomly selected document from a subset2 of the Brown corpus (Marcus et al., 1993).
    Table 1 presents the corpus statistics.
    A sample is characterised by the range of n. Ti,j is a set of samples with i &lt;n &lt;j.
    T is the union of the other four test sets.
    Segmentation accuracy is measured by the metric proposed in (Beeferman et al., 1999).
    Let Tr and Tp be the reference segmentation and that proposed by an automatic procedure. k is the averag
