    For example, the coordinated NP in the sentence C-7 consists of the U.S., japan, Britain, West Germany, Canada, France and Italy has the structure in (51).
    Copula.
    This heuristic was difficult to evaluate because there few examples, and the precision in the two data sets is very different (see Tables 13 and 15 above).
    One problem is that the descriptions in copula constructions might also be interpreted as bridging descriptions.
    For instance, the description the result in (52a) below is the result of something mentioned previously, while the copula construction specifies its referent.
    Other ambiguous examples are (52b) and (52c): (52) a.
