ier tree-building theory that we retain is the notion that a natural language parser can buffer and examine some small number (e.g. up to three) unattached constituents before being forced to add to its existing structures.
    (In 0-theory, the node named X is attached to Y if the parser's description of the existing structure includes a predication of the form &amp;quot;Y dominates X&amp;quot;, or, as we will henceforth write, &amp;quot;D(Y,X).&amp;quot; X is unattached if the parser's description of the existing structure includes no predication of the form &amp;quot;D(Y, X)&amp;quot;, for any name Y.)
    We thus assume that such a parser will have the two principle data structures of these earlier deterministic parsers, a stack and a buffer.
    However, the stack and the buffer in a D-theory parser will contain names rather than constituents, and these data structures will be augmented by a data base where the description of the syntactic structure itself is built up by the parser.
    (While this might
