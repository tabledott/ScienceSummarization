  One final wrinkle must be noted .
  Inference is generally a non-deterministic search problem, with no firm guarantee as to whether facts will be derived in the same chronological order as the sentences which underli e the facts .
  Rules that require contextualized facts, however, crucially rely on the chronological order of th e sentences underlying these facts.
  We have thus pulled these rules out of the main fray of inference, and apply them only after all other forward chaining is complete .
  In fact, these rules are organized as a Brill-style rule sequence, where each rule is allowed to run to quiescence at only one point in the sequence before the nex t rule becomes active.
  It is our hypothesis, though, that alldomain inference rules can be so organized, not jus t contextualized ones, and that by this organizational scheme, rules can be automatically learned from example .
