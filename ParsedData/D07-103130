clustering to group similar HMM states; these clusters, rather than the underlying states, would be in terpreted as the POS tag labels.
			Also, the Bayesian framework permits a wide variety of different priors besides Dirichlet priors explored here.
			For example, it should be possible to encode linguistic knowledge such markedness preferences in a prior, and there are other linguistically uninformative priors, such the ?entropic priors?
			of Brand (1999), that may be worth exploring.
