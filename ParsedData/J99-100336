c sets of points.
    It would be incorrect to simply connect the dots left to right, because the resultTwo text segments at the end of Sentence A were switched during translation, resulting in a nonmonotonic segment.
    To interpolate injective bitext maps, nonmonotonic segments must be encapsulated in Minimum Enclosing Rectangles (MERs).
    A unique bitext map can then be interpolated by using the lower left and upper right corners of the MER (map M2), instead of using the nonmonotonic correspondence points (function M1). irtg function may not be injective.
    To interpolate injective bitext maps, nonmonotonic segments must be encapsulated in Minimum Enclosing Rectangles (MERs), as shown in Figure 9.
    A unique bitext map results from interpolating between the lower left and upper right corners of the MER, instead of using the nonmonotonic correspondence points.
    SIMR's parameters were optimized by simulated annealing, as described in the previous section.
    A separate optimization was performed o
