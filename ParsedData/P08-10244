nges that discriminative SMT must face above and beyond the current systems.
    We situate our work, and previous work, on discriminative systems in this context.
    We present our model in Section 3, including our means of training and decoding.
    Section 4 reports our experimental setup and results, and finally we conclude in Section 5.
  
  
    Discriminative models allow for the use of expressive features, in the order of thousands or millions, which can reference arbitrary aspects of the source sentence.
    Given most successful SMT models have a highly lexicalised grammar (or grammar equivalent), these features can be used to smuggle in linguistic information, such as syntax and document context.
    With this undoubted advantage come four major challenges when compared to standard frequency count SMT models: 1.
    There is no one reference derivation.
    Often there are thousands of ways of translating a source sentence into the reference translation.
