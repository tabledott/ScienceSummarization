mata is intended to capture as general language regularities rather than properties of rare or corpusspecific words only.
    This significantly simplifies training data requirements: we can induce guessing rules from a general-purpose lexicon.'
    First, we no longer depend on the size or even existence of an annotated training corpus.
    Second, we do not require any annotation to be done for the training; instead, we reuse the information stated in the lexicon, which we can automatically map to a particular tag set that a tagger is trained to.
    We also use the actual frequencies of word usage, collected from a raw corpus.
    This allows for the discrimination between rules that are no longer productive (but have left their imprint on the basic lexicon) and rules that are productive in real-life texts.
    For guessing rules to capture general language regularities, the lexicon should be as general as possible (i.e., should list all possible POS-tags for a word) and large.
