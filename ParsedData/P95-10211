    In addition, remain tractable, yet their generative capacity is sufficient to account for certain syntactic phenomena that, it has been argued, lie beyond Context-Free Grammars (CFG) (Shieber, 1985).
    TAG, however, has two limitations which provide the motivation for this The first problem (discussed in Section that the of substitution and adjunction do not map cleanly onto the relations of complementation and modification.
    A second problem (discussed in Section 1.2) has to do with the of provide analyses for certain syntactic phenomena.
    In developing DTG we have tried to overcome these problems while remaining faithto what we see as the key advantages of particular, its enlarged domain of locality).
    In Section 1.3 we introduce some of the key features of explain how they are intended to address problems that we have identified with 1.1 Derivations and Dependencies operations of substitution and
