    On the other hand, the new algorithm has indeed proven to be much faster.
    At present we are unable to use direct measurement to compare the speed of the systems meaningfully, because of vast implementational differences between the systems.
    However, the order-of-magnitude improvements are immediately apparent.
    In the earlier system, translation of single sentences required on the order of hours (Sun Sparc 10 workstations).
    In contrast the new algorithm generally takes less than one minute&#8212;usually substantially less&#8212;with no special optimization of the code.
    6 Conclusion We have introduced a new algorithm for the runtime optimization step in statistical machine translation systems, whose polynomial-time complexity addresses one of the primary obstacles to practicality facing statistical MT.
    The underlying model for the algorithm is a combination of the stochastic BTG and bigram models.
    The improvement in speed does not appear to impair accuracy significantly.
