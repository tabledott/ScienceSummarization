at would result from providing a parser with entries built using the system, shown in Figure 5.
    Further evaluation of the results for these seven verbs reveals that the filtering phase is the weak link in the systeni.
    There are only 13 true negatives which the system failed to propose, each exemplified in the data by a mean of 4.5 examples.
    On the other hand, there are 67 false negatives supported by an estimated mean of 7.1 examples which should, ideally, have been accepted by the filter, and 11 false positives which should have been rejected.
    The performance of the filter for classes with less than 10 exemplars is around chance, and a simple heuristic of accepting all classes with more than 10 exemplars would have produced broadly similar results for these verbs.
    The filter may well be performing poorly because the probability of generating a subcategorization class for a given verb is often lower than the error probability for that class.
    In addition to evaluating the acquired subca
