A statistical approach is present in the discourse module only where it is used to determine the probability that a noun (verb) phrase is the center of a sentence.
    The system also contains domain knowledge including the domain concepts, specific list of subjects and verbs, and topic headings.
    The evaluation was conducted on 133 paragraphs of annotated Computer Science text.
    The results show an accuracy of 83% for the 512 occurrences of it.
    Lappin and Leass (1994) report on a (essentially non-statistical) approach that relies on salience measures derived from syntactic structure and a dynamic model of attentional state.
    The system employs various constraints for NPpronoun non-coreference within a sentence.
    It also uses person, number, and gender features for ruling out anaphoric dependence of a pronoun on an NP.
    The algorithm has a sophisticated mechanism for assigning values to several salience parameters and for computing global salience values.
