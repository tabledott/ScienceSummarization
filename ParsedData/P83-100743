    More importantly, when N is a pronoun, the principles that govern which c are such that N realizes c derive from neither semantics nor pragmatics exclusively.
    They are principles that must be elicited from the study of discourse itself.
    A tentative formulation of some such principles is given below.
    Though it is typical that, when c is a center of S, S contains an N such that N realizes c, it is by no means necessary.
    In particular, for sentences containing noun In 3 hiller treatment of our theory we will consider centers that are realized by constituents in other syntactic categories.
    8Israel 119831 discusses some of these issues and compares several properties of situation semantics with Montague semantics. phrases that express functional relations (e.g., 'the door,' 'the owner') whose arguments are not exhibited explicitly (e.g., a house is the current center, but so far neither its door nor its owner has been mentioned),9
