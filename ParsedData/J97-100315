 to partition each document, in advance, into a set of multi-paragraph subtopical segments.
    Figure 1 shows an example query about automated systems for medical diagnosis, run over the ZIFF portion of the TIPSTER collection (Harman 1993).
    Each large rectangle next to a title indicates a document, and each square within the rectangle represents a TextTile in the document.
    The darker the tile, the more frequent the term (white indicates 0, black indicates 8 or more hits; the frequencies of all the terms within a term set are added together).
    The top row of each rectangle corresponds to the hits for Term Set 1, the middle row to hits for Term Set 2, and the bottom row to hits for Term Set 3.
    The first column of each rectangle corresponds to the first TextTile of the document, the second column to the second TextTile, and so on.
    The patterns of graylevel are meant to provide a compact summary of which passages of the document matched which topics of the query.
