{airline, american eagle, airbus, ... }.
    For each proposed hypernym or coordinate link involved with the novel hyponym i, we compute the set of candidate hypernyms for i; in practice we consider all senses of the immediate hypernym j for each potential novel hypernym, and all senses of the coordinate term k and its first two hypernym ancestors for each potential coordinate.
    In the continental example, from the 26 individual pieces of evidence over words we construct the set of 99 unique synsets that we will consider as possible hypernyms; these include the two senses of the word airline, the ten senses of the word carrier, and so forth.
    Next, we iterate through each of the possible hypernym synsets l under which we might add the new word i; for each synset l we compute the change in taxonomy score resulting from adding the implied relations I(H1il) required by the taxonomic constraints of T. Since typically our set of all evidence involving i will be much smaller than the set of possible relations
