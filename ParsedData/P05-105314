    We use the official ACE corpus from LDC.
    The training set consists of 674 annotated text documents (~300k words) and 9683 instances of relations.
    During development, 155 of 674 documents in the training set are set aside for fine-tuning the system.
    The testing set is held out only for final evaluation.
    It consists of 97 documents (~50k words) and 1386 instances of relations.
    Table 1 lists the types and subtypes of relations for the ACE Relation Detection and Characterization (RDC) task, along with their frequency of occurrence in the ACE training set.
    It shows that the 6 Those words that have the semantic classes &#8220;Parent&#8221;, &#8220;GrandParent&#8221;, &#8220;Spouse&#8221; and &#8220;Sibling&#8221; are automatically set with the same classes without change.
