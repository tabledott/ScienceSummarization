thin a small window of text (5 to 7 words).
    This work does not incorporate the notion of multiple simultaneous themes but instead just tries to find breaks in semantic similarity among a small number of terms.
    A good strategy may be to substitute this kind of similarity information for term repetition in algorithms like those described here.
    Another possibility would be to use semantic similarity information as computed in Schiitze (1993), Resnik (1993), or Dagan et al. (1993).
    The use of discourse cues for detection of segment boundaries and other discourse purposes has been extensively researched, although predominantly on spoken text (see Hirschberg &amp; Litman (1993) for a summary of six research groups' treatments of 64 cue words).
    It is possible that incorporation of such information may provide a relatively simple way improve the cases where the algorithm is off by one paragraph.
