    It makes sense then to incorporate the local model into our final score.
    Our final score is given by: where &#945; is a tunable parameter 2 for how much influence the local score has in the final score.
    Such interpolation with a score from a first-pass model was also used for parse re-ranking in (Collins, 2000).
    Given this score, at test time we choose among the top N local assignments L1, ... , LN according to: arg max &#945; log P`SRL(L|t, v) + log PrSRL(L|t, v) LE{L1,...,LN}
  
  
    For our experiments we used the February 2004 release of PropBank.
    3 As is standard, we used the annotations from sections 02&#8211;21 for training, 24 for development, and 23 for testing.
    As is done in some previous work on semantic role labeling, we discard the relatively infrequent discontinuous arguments from both the training and test sets.
    In addition to reporting the standard results on individual argument F-Measure, we also report Frame Accuracy (Acc.
    ), the fraction of sentences for w
