3) attempts to delimit and correct repairs in spontaneous human-human dialog, based on transcripts containing an &amp;quot;edit signal,&amp;quot; or external and reliable marker at the &amp;quot;expunction point,&amp;quot; or point of interruption.
    Carbonell and Hayes (1983) briefly describe recovery strategies for broken-off and restarted utterances in textual input.
    Ward (1991) addresses repairs in spontaneous speech, but does not attempt to identify or correct them.
    Our approach is most similar to that of Hindle.
    It differs, however, in that we make no assumption about the existence of an explicit edit signal.
    As a reliable edit signal has yet to be found, we take it as our problem to find the site of the repair automatically.
    It is the case, however, that cues to repair exist over a range of syllables.
    Research in speech production has shown that repairs tend to be marked prosodically (Levelt and Cutler, 1983) and there is perceptual evidence from work using lowpassfiltered spe
