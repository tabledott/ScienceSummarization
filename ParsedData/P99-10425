ws stories, followed by short-answer &amp;quot;5W&amp;quot; questions: who, what, when, where, and why questions.'
    We developed a simple, modular, baseline system that uses pattern matching (bag-of-words) techniques and limited linguistic processing to select the sentence from the text that best answers the query.
    We used our development corpus to explore several alternative evaluation techniques, and then evaluated on the test set, which was kept blind.
  
  
    We had three goals in choosing evaluation metrics for our system.
    First, the evaluation should be automatic.
    Second, it should maintain comparability with human benchmarks.
    Third, it should require little or no effort to prepare new answer keys.
    We used three metrics, P&amp;R, HumSent, and AutSent, which satisfy these constraints to varying degrees.
    P&amp;R was the precision and recall on stemmed content words2, comparing the system's response at the word level to the answer key provided by the test's publisher.
