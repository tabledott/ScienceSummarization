    An early attempt from the Edinburgh project at wide-coverage CCG parsing is presented in Clark, Hockenmaier, and Steedman (2002).
    In order to deal with the problem of the additional, nonstandard CCG derivations, a conditional model of dependency structures is presented, based on Collins (1996), in which the dependencies are modeled directly and derivations are not modeled at all.
    The conditional probability of a dependency structure &#960;, given a sentence S, is factored into two parts.
    The first part is the probability of the lexical category sequence, C, and the second part is the dependency structure, D, giving P(&#960;|S) = P(CIS)P(DIC,S).
    Intuitively, the category sequence is genClark and Curran Wide-Coverage Efficient Statistical Parsing erated first, conditioned on the sentence, and then attachment decisions are made to form the dependency links.
    The probability of the category sequence is estimated using a maximum en
