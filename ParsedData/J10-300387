ght-verb constructions and transitivity alternations (using intransitive verbs in place of transitive verbs).
    The corpus indeed captures almost all examples of both types of paraphrastic phenomena and any that are absent can be easily covered by adding one or two more patterns to the class.
    The claim of reduced annotation cost is not necessarily borne out by the observations.
    Despite partitioning the annotation task by types, it was still difficult to provide accurate annotation guidelines.
    This led to a significant difference in annotation time&#8212;with some annotations taking almost twice as long as others.
    Given the small size of the corpus, it is unlikely that it may be used as training data for corpus-based paraphrase generation methods and, like the MSRP corpus, would be best suited to the evaluation of paraphrase recognition techniques.
    Most recently, Cohn, Callison-Burch, and Lapata (2008) describe a different take on the creation of a monolingual parallel corpus containing 9
