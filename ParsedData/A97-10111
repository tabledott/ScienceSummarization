ar framework from which many of the ideas are derived.
    Then, we give some linguistic background to the notations we are using, with a brief comparison to other current dependency formalisms and systems.
    New formalism is described briefly, and it is utilised in a small toy grammar to illustrate how the formalism works.
    Finally, the real parsing system, with a grammar of some 2 500 rules, is evaluated.
    The parser corresponds to over three man-years of work, which does not include the lexical analyser and the morphological disambiguator, both parts of the existing English Constraint Grammar parser (Karlsson et al., 1995).
    The parsers can be tested via WWW'.
  
  
    Our work is partly based on the work done with the Constraint Grammar framework that was originally proposed by Fred Karlsson (1990).
    A detailed description of the English Constraint Grammar (ENGCG) is in Karlsson et al. (1995).
    The basic rule types of the Constraint Grammar (Tapanainen, 1996)2 are REMOVE and SELECT for d
