;divergent&#8221; summaries in order to determine what order of pyramid is required to reliably discriminate them.
    The expected value for the point of divergence of scores, in terms of number of summaries in the pyramid, is 5.5.
    We take the scores assigned at order 9 pyramids as being a reliable metric on the assumption that the pattern we have observed in our data is a general one, namely that variance always decreases with increasing orders of pyramid, and that once divergence of scores occurs, the better summary never gets a lower score than the worse for any model of higher order.
    We postulate that summaries whose scores differ by less than 0.06 have roughly the same informativeness.
    The assumption is supported by two facts.
    First, this corresponds to the difference in PAL scores (D31041) we find when we use a different one of our three PAL annotations (see Table 1).
    Second, the pairs of summaries whose scores never clearly diverged had scores differing by less than 0.06 at pyramid
