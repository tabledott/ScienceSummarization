r each adjective, Gsearch was used to compile a list of all nouns that did not co-occur in a head-modifier relationship with the adjective.
    Again, proper nouns and low-frequency nouns were discarded from this list.
    Then each adjective was paired with three randomly chosen nouns from its list of non-co-occurring nouns.
    Examples of seen and unseen adjective-noun bigrams are shown in Table 2.
    For the present study, we applied the procedure used by Lapata, McDonald, and Keller (1999) and Lapata, Keller, and McDonald (2001) to noun-noun bigrams and to verb-object bigrams, creating a set of 90 seen and 90 unseen bigrams for each type of predicate-argument relationship.
    More specifically, 30 nouns and 30 verbs were chosen according to the same criteria proposed for the adjective study (i.e., minimal sense ambiguity and unambiguous part of speech).
    All nouns modifying one of the 30 nouns were extracted from the BNC using a heuristic from Lauer (1995) that looks for consecutive pairs of nouns t
