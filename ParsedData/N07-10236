G rule lj &#8212;* (&#945;jf, &#945;jc), we get: The question we will now address is how to estimate the probability p(&#945;j f, &#945;jc lj) of each SCFG production.
    A main issue in our enterprise is to reliably estimate productions of deletion SCFGs.
    In a sentence compression framework as the one presented by K&amp;M, we use aligned trees of the form of the Penn Treebank (PTB) (Marcus et al., 1994) to acquire and score SCFG productions.
    However, the use of the PTB structure faces many challenges also encountered in probabilistic parsing.
    Firstly, PTB tree structures are relatively flat, particularly within noun phrases.
    For instance, adjective phrases (ADJP)&#8212;which are generally good candidates for deletions&#8212;appear in 90 different NProoted SCFG productions in Ziff-Davis,2 61 of which appear only once, e.g., NP , (DT ADJP JJ NN NN, DT JJ NN NN).
    While it may seem advantageous to maintain many constituents within the same domain of locality of an SCFG production, as we may
