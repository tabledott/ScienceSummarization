iani, 2005).
    Of all those combinations, in the present paper we always use the DGS- combination, since this is the one that has been shown to perform best in (Esuli and Sebastiani, 2005).
    DGS- corresponds to using the entire gloss and performing negation propagation on its text, i.e. replacing all the terms that occur after a negation in a sentence with negated versions of the term (see (Esuli and Sebastiani, 2005) for details). ter removing 17 terms appearing in both categories (e.g. deal) and reducing all the multiple entries of the same term in a category, caused by multiple senses, to a single entry.
    Likewise, we take all the 7,582 GI terms that are not labelled as either Positive or Negative, as being (implicitly) labelled as Objective, and reduce them to 5,009 terms after combining multiple entries of the same term, caused by multiple senses, to a single entry.
    The effectiveness of our classifiers will thus be evaluated in terms of their ability to assign the total 8,605 GI terms to the
