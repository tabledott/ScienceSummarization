ces; using this grammar, sentences in this length range have produced up to 130,000 edges.
    As a basis for comparison, we measured the CPU time for a non-best-first version of the parser to completely parse all 500 sentences.
    The CPU time needed by this version of the parser was 4,882 seconds.
    For a best-first version of the parser to be useful, it must be able to find the most probable parse (or a reasonably good parse, depending on the application) in less than this amount of time.
    Here, for the best-first parsers, we will use for convenience the time needed to get 95% of the sentence's total probability mass.
  
  
    It seems reasonable to base a figure of merit on the inside probability 0 of the constituent.
    Inside probability is defined as the probability of the words or tags in the constituent given that the constituent is dominated by a particular nonterminal symbol; see Figure 2.
    This seems to be a reasonable basis for comparing constituent probabilities, and has the additiona
