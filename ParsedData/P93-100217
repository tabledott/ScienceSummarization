 can align adequately.
    At this point, we can process unaligned text and use the alignments we produce to further train the model.
    We update parameters based on the newly aligned text in the same way that we update parameters based on the initial training data.2 To align a corpus in a single pass the model must be fairly accurate before starting or else the beginning of the corpus will be poorly aligned.
    Hence, after bootstrapping the model on one hundred sentence pairs, we train the algorithm on a chunk of the unaligned target bilingual corpus, typically 20,000 sentence pairs, before making one pass through the entire corpus to produce the actual alignment.
    It is natural to use dynamic programming to search for the best alignment; one can find the most probable of an exponential number of alignments using quadratic time and memory.
    Alignment can be viewed as a &amp;quot;shortest distance&amp;quot; problem, where the &amp;quot;distance&amp;quot; associated with a sentence bead is the negati
