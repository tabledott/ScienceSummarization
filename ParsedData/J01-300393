.&amp;quot; This is a very important property of lexical acquisition algorithms to be used for lexicon organization, as their main interest lies in being applied to unknown words.
    On the other hand, our approach is similar to the approaches of Siegel, and Lapata and Brew (1999), in attempting to learn semantic notions from distributions of indicators that can be gleaned from a text.
    In our case, we are trying to learn argument structure, a finer-grained classification than the dichotomic distinctions studied by Siegel.
    Like Lapata and Brew, three of our indicators&#8212;TRANS, VBN, PASS&#8212;are based on the assumption that distributional differences in subcategorization frames are related to underlying verb class distinctions.
    However, we also show that other syntactic indicators&#8212;cAus and ANim&#8212;can be devised that tap directly into the argument structure of a verb.
    Unlike Schulte im Walde (2000), we find the use of these semantic features helpful in classification&#8212;using
