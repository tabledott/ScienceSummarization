 answer contains the verb develop.
    In order to prove that this answer is in fact correct, we need to detect and use a lexical chain between develop and create.
    WordNet supplies us with that chain such that develop make and make create Using WordNet glosses, this chain is transformed into two axioms: Furthermore, the question asks about the Internet browser Mosiac, while the candidate answer refers to Mosaic.
    To provide the knowledge that the Internet browser Mosaic refers to the same thing as Mosaic, the head of the complex nominal, Internet browser Mosaic, implies its remaining components.
    (6) all x1 (mosaic nn(x1) internet nn(x1) &amp; browser nn(x1)).
    (7) all x1 x2 x3 x4 (mosaic nn(x1) &amp; internet nn(x1) &amp; browser nn(x1) nn nnc(x1,x1,x1,x1)).
    The next step is to build the Set of Support Axiom(s) for the Question.
    The question is negated to invoke the proof by contradiction -(exists e1 x2 x3 x5 x6 ( organization at(x2) &amp; company nn(x2) &amp; create vb(e1,x2,x6) &amp; i
