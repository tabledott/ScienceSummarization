outliers, its value can be misleading, we also report Spearman&#8217;s correlation.
    The latter is a nonparametric robust measure of association which is sensitive only to the ordinal arrangement of values.
    As our data contains some tied values, we calculate Spearman&#8217;s correlation by using Pearson&#8217;s correlation on the ranks.
    Table 1 presents the Pearson&#8217;s and Spearman&#8217;s correlation between the CLC scores and the AA system predicted values, when incrementally adding to the model the feature types described in Section 3.2.
    Each feature type improves the model&#8217;s performance.
    Extending our language model with frequent trigrams extracted from the CLC improves Pearson&#8217;s and Spearman&#8217;s correlation by 0.006 and 0.015 respectively.
    The addition of the error-rate obtained from the manually annotated CLC error tags on top of all the features further improves performance by 0.01 and 0.016.
    An evaluation of our best error detection method shows a Pearson
