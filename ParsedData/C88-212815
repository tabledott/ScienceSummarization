-side nonterminal.
  That is, if S is the start nonterminal nd S ~ C1 .~.C, is a rule and 0 = mgu(S,S), then [0, S0 *- C18... C,8, 0] is an initial prediction.
  5Again, for formalisms with complex structured nontermiuals, the staxt symbol need only subsume the items nontermiual.
  SAssuming that the prediction inference rule uses the restriction mechanism, the architecture actually mimics the variant of Earieys algorithm previously described in [Shieber, 1985].
  615 however, the closure here is computed at run time rather than being preeomptled.
  The last two Conditions correspond to disambiguation of shift/reduce and reduce/reduce onflicts in LR parsing respectively.
  The former equires that shifts be preferred to reductions, the latter that longer reductions receive preference.
  In sum, this ordering strategy implements a sentence-disambigua- tio n parsing method that has previously been argued [Shieber, 1983] to model certain psycholinguistic phenomena--for instance, right asso- ciation and minimal at
