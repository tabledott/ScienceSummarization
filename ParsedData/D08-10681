ntities.
    This is a key subtask in many NLP applications, including information extraction, question answering, machine translation, and others.
    Supervised learning approaches treat the problem as one of classification: for each pair of mentions, predict whether they corefer or not (e.g., McCallum &amp; Wellner (2005)).
    While successful, these approaches require labeled training data, consisting of mention pairs and the correct decisions for them.
    This limits their applicability.
    Unsupervised approaches are attractive due to the availability of large quantities of unlabeled text.
    However, unsupervised coreference resolution is much more difficult.
    Haghighi and Klein&#8217;s (2007) model, the most sophisticated to date, still lags supervised ones by a substantial margin.
    Extending it appears difficult, due to the limitations of its Dirichlet process-based representation.
    The lack of label information in unsupervised coreference resolution can potentially be overcome by perfor
