s relevance is determined by first assigning each position to a node in the parse tree, namely the node which is on the top of the parser&#8217;s stack when that decision is made.
    Then the relevant earlier positions are chosen based on the structural locality of the current decision&#8217;s node to the earlier decisions&#8217; nodes.
    In this way, the number of representations which information needs to pass through in order to flow from history representation i to history representation j is determined by the structural distance between i&#8217;s node and j&#8217;s node, and not just the distance between i and j in the parse sequence.
    This provides the neural network with a linguistically appropriate inductive bias when it learns the history representations, as explained in more detail in (Henderson, 2003b).
    When computing the lookahead representation l(yield(di,..., dm)), there is no structural information available to tell us which positions are most relevant to choosing the decision di.
