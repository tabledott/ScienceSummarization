 One challenge is to build technology to detect and summarize an overall sentiment.
    In this paper, we look at one such popular microblog called Twitter and build models for classifying &#8220;tweets&#8221; into positive, negative and neutral sentiment.
    We build models for two classification tasks: a binary task of classifying sentiment into positive and negative classes and a 3-way task of classifying sentiment into positive, negative and neutral classes.
    We experiment with three types of models: unigram model, a feature based model and a tree kernel based model.
    For the feature based model we use some of the features proposed in past literature and propose new features.
    For the tree kernel based model we design a new tree representation for tweets.
    We use a unigram model, previously shown to work well for sentiment analysis for Twitter data, as our baseline.
    Our experiments show that a unigram model is indeed a hard baseline achieving over 20% over the chance baseline for both cla
