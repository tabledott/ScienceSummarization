Bl is a multiset), disallowing duplicates (Bl is a set), or only allowing one example per input sentence (kBlk = 1).
    We adopt the first approach in this paper.2 There is important implicit information which the direct approach ignores.
    It is implicit that when the teacher indicates an input paired with an alignment and logical form is good (+1 feedinitial weight vector w back) that in order to repeat this behavior all other competing structures should be made suboptimal (or bad).
    To leverage this implicit information we adopt a structured learning strategy in which we consider the prediction as the optimal structure and all others as suboptimal.
    This is in contrast to the direct approach where only structures that have explicitly received negative feedback are considered subopitmal.
    When a structure is found with positive feedback it is added to the training pool for a structured learner.
    We consider this approach aggressive as the structured learner implicitly considers all other stru
