ch examples indicate that in order to capture the systematicity of such ambiguity, something else is at play, where a richer notion of composition is operative.
    What then accounts for the polysemy of the verbs in the examples above?
    The basic idea I will pursue is the following.
    Rather than treating the expressions that behave as arguments to a function as simple, passive objects, imagine that they are as active in the semantics as the verb itself.
    The product of function application would be sensitive to both the function and its active argument.
    Something like this is suggested in Keenan and Faltz (1985), as the Meaning&#8212;Form Correlation Principle.
    I will refer to such behavior as cocompositionality (see below).
    What I have in mind can best be illustrated by returning to the examples in 28. a. John baked the potato. b. John baked the cake.
    Rather than having two separate word senses for a verb such as bake, suppose there is simply one, a change-of-state reading.
