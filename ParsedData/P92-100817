    While acoustics alone cannot tackle the problem of locating repairs, since any prosodic patterns found in repairs are likely to be found in fluent speech, acoustic information can be quite effective when combined with other sources of information, in particular with pattern matching.
    In studying the ways in which acoustics might help distinguish repairs from false positives, we began by examining two patterns conducive to acoustic measurement and comparison.
    First, we focused on patterns in which there was only one matched word, and in which the two occurrences of that word were either adjacent or separated by only one word.
    Matched words allow for comparison of word duration; proximity helps avoid variability due to global intonation contours not associated with the patterns themselves.
    We present here analyses for the M1 Mi (&amp;quot;flights for &lt;one&gt; one person&amp;quot;) and MI (&amp;qu
