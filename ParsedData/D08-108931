eterization of our models to not only predict phrase orientation, but also the length of each displacement as in (Al-Onaizan and Papineni, 2006).
			We believe such an extension would improve translation quality in the case of larger distortionlimits.
			We also plan to experiment with discriminative approaches to estimating reordering probabil ities (Zens and Ney, 2006; Xiong et al, 2006), whichcould also be applied to our work.
			We think the abil ity to condition reorderings on any arbitrary featurefunctions is also very effective in the case of our hi erarchical model, since information encoded in thetrees would seem beneficial to the orientation pre diction task.
