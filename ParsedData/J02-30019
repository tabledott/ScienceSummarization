    Section 7 examines techniques for adding knowledge about systematic alternations in verb argument structure with sentence-level features.
    We combine syntactic parsing and semantic role identification into a single probability model in Section 8.
    Section 9 addresses the question of generalizing statistics from one target predicate to another, beginning with a look at domain-independent thematic roles in Section 9.1.
    Finally we draw conclusions and discuss future directions in Section 10.
  
  
    Semantic roles are one of the oldest classes of constructs in linguistic theory, dating back thousands of years to Panini&#8217;s k&#175;araka theory (Misra 1966; Rocher 1964; Dahiya 1995).
    Longevity, in this case, begets variety, and the literature records scores of proposals for sets of semantic roles.
    These sets of roles range from the very specific to the very general, and many have been used in computational implementations of one type or another.
