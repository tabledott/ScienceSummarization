eir ability to model semantic similarity relations, e.g., synonymy or priming.
    Thus, it seems appropriate to evaluate phrase representations in a similar manner.
    Specifically, we used the dataset from Mitchell and Lapata (2010) which contains similarity judgments for adjective-noun, noun-noun and verb-object phrases, respectively.2 Each item is a phrase pair phr1, phr2 which has a human rating from 1 (very low similarity) to 7 (very high similarity).
    Using the composition models described above, we compute the cosine similarity of phr1 and phr2: Model similarities were evaluated against the human similarity ratings using Spearman&#8217;s p correlation coefficient.
    Table 3 summarizes the performance of the various models on the phrase similarity dataset.
    Rows in the table correspond to different vector representations: the simple distributional semantic space (SDS) from Mitchell and Lapata (2010), Baroni and Lenci&#8217;s (2010) distributional memory tensor (DM) and the neural language mode
