ds left (Tieft) or right (Tright).
    Note that the expressive power of a method is not purely determined by the features it has access to, but also by its algorithm, and what combinations of the available features this allows it to consider. popular type of learning method, each uses slightly different features of the text (see Table 1), and each has a completely different representation for its language model.
    All publicly available systems are used with the default settings that are suggested in their documentation.
    3.2.1 Error-driven Transformation-based Learning.
    This learning method finds a set of rules that transforms the corpus from a baseline annotation so as to minimize the number of errors (we will refer to this system as TBL below).
    A tagger generator using this learning method is described in Brill (1992, 1994).
    The implementation that we use is Eric Brill's publicly available set of C programs and Ped scripts.'
    When training, this system starts with a baseline corpus ann
