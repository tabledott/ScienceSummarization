stinguished in the following way.
    A coherence relation is a relation among clauses or sentences, such as elaboration, support, cause, or exemplification.
    There have been various attempts to classify all possible coherence relations, but there is as yet no widespread agreement.
    There does not exist a general computationally feasible mechanism for identifying coherence relations.
    In contrast, cohesion relations are relations among elements in a text: reference, ellipsis, substitution, conjunction, and lexical cohesion.
    Since cohesion is well defined, one might expect that it would be computationally easier to identify, because the identification of ellipsis, reference, substitution, conjunction, and lexical cohesion is a straightforward task for people.
    We will show below that lexical cohesion is computationally feasible to identify.
    In contrast, the identification of a specific coherence relation from a given set is not a straightforward task, even for people.
