as M links.
			Define L to be the set of all possible valid link configurations, and L to be a member of that set.
			We seek to maximize the alignment probability by finding the optimum link configuration Lopt, p(Lopt|S, T ) = argmax L?L p(L|S, T ) = p(lMi |tM1 , sK1 ) = M ? i=0 p(li|tM1 , sK1 , li?11 ).We factor this into a transition model and an obser vation model, p(L|S, T ) = 1Z M ? i=0 p(li|li?1)?p(li|tM1 , sK1 , li?11 )1??.
			where Z is the normalizing constant.We factor the model as above so that the tran sition model computation, which uses information available on the search hypotheses, is reduced during the search process.
			In the aligner presented here, ?is always set to 0.5.
			Next we will describe the tran sition model, then the observation model and finallythe experiments in alignment and machine transla tion.In the IBM Model 1 aligner, the choice of the lan guage to serve as states of the search algorithm is not prescribed, but practically the choice is important asit affects performance.
