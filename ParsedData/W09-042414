ion, which considers all the derivations but still allows tractable decoding.
    More details will be provided in Li et al. (2009b).
    In this system, we have used both deterministic annealing (for training) and variational decoding (for decoding).
  
  
    We have described a scalable toolkit for parsingbased machine translation.
    It is written in Java and implements all the essential algorithms described in Chiang (2007) and Li and Khudanpur (2008b): chart-parsing, n-gram language model integration, beam- and cube-pruning, and k-best extraction.
    The toolkit also implements suffixarray grammar extraction (Callison-Burch et al., 2005; Lopez, 2007) and minimum error rate training (Och, 2003).
    Additionally, parallel and distributed computing techniques are exploited to make it scalable.
    The decoder achieves state of the art translation performance.
