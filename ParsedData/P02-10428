 to the words, and D hfi fi si hai i 1 m is the set of dependencies.
    The probability of a dependency structure can be written as follows: The probability PCS can be approximated as follows: where Xi is the local context for the ith word.
    We have explained elsewhere (Clark, 2002) how suitable features can be defined in terms of the word, pos-tag pairs in the context, and how maximum entropy techniques can be used to estimate the probabilities, following Ratnaparkhi (1996).
    We assume that each argument slot in the category sequence is filled independently, and write PDC S as follows: rj m where hai is the head word filling the argument slot of the ith dependency, and m is the number of dependencies entailed by the category sequence C. The estimation method is based on Collins (1996).
    We assume that the probability of a dependency only depends on those words involved in the dependency, together with their categories.
    We follow Collins and base the estimate of a dependency probability on the f
