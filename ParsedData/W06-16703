    Lastly, even if the methods would scale up, there are not enough manually tagged data, at the word sense level, for training a model.
    The performance of state of the art WSD systems on realistic evaluations is only comparable to the &#8220;first sense&#8221; baseline (cf.
    Section 5.3).
    Notwithstanding much research, the benefits of disambiguated lexical information for language processing are still mostly speculative.
    This paper presents a novel approach to broad
  
  
    coverage information extraction and word sense disambiguation.
    Our goal is to simplify the disambiguation task, for both nouns and verbs, to a level at which it can be approached as any other tagging problem, and can be solved with state of the art methods.
    As a by-product, this task includes and extends NER.
    We define a tagset based on Wordnet&#8217;s lexicographers classes, or supersenses (Ciaramita and Johnson, 2003), cf.
    Table 1.
    The size of the supersense tagset allows us to adopt a structure
