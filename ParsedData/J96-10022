ulate their lineups accordingly.
    Wall Street speculators (who rank among the best paid statistical modelers) build models based on past stock price movements to predict tomorrow's fluctuations and alter their portfolios to capitalize on the predicted future.
    At the other end of the pay scale reside natural language researchers, who design language and acoustic models for use in speech recognition systems and related applications.
    The past few decades have witnessed significant progress toward increasing the predictive capacity of statistical models of natural language.
    In language modeling, for instance, Bahl et al. (1989) have used decision tree models and Della Pietra et al.
    (1994) have used automatically inferred link grammars to model long range correlations in language.
    In parsing, Black et al. (1992) have described how to extract grammatical rules from annotated text automatically and incorporate these rules into statistical models of grammar.
