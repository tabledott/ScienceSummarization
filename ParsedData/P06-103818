ations: we computed thresholds that would give us the maximal number of words, while enabling the pattern access table to reside in main memory.
    The resulting numbers are 100, 50,20, 100, 100.
    Corpus window size was determined by starting from a very small window size, defining at random a single window of that size, running the algorithm, and iterating this process with increased window sizes until reaching a desired vocabulary category participation percentage (i.e., x% of the different words in the corpus assigned into categories.
    We used 5%.)
    This process has only a negligible effect on running times, because each iteration is run only on a single window, not on the whole corpus.
    The table below gives some statistics.
    V is the total number of different words in the corpus.
    W is the number of words belonging to at least one of our categories.
    C is the number of categories (after merging and windowing.)
    A5 is the average category size.
    Running times are in minutes on
