 &#8220;flat&#8221; structures at the VP and clause levels, leading to a huge number of context-free rules (the flatness is one consequence of the relatively free word order seen within VP&#8217;s and clauses in German).
    There are clearly some advantages to learning reordering rules automatically, as in Xia et. al&#8217;s approach.
    However, we note that our approach involves a handful of linguistically&#8211;motivated transformations and achieves comparable improvements (albeit on a different language pair) to Xia et. al&#8217;s method, which in contrast involves over 56,000 transformations.
    In this section we give a brief description of the syntactic structure of German clauses.
    The characteristics we describe motivate the reordering rules described later in the paper.
    Figure 1 gives an example parse tree for a German sentence.
    This sentence contains two clauses: Clause 1: Ich/I werde/will Ihnen/to you die/the entsprechenden/corresponding Anmerkungen/comments aushaendigen/pass on Clau
