ctic categories that identify a lexical item as either a functor or argument.
    For the functors, the category specifies the type and directionality of the arguments and the type of the result.
    For example, the following category for the transitive verb bought specifies its first argument as a noun phrase (NP) to its right and its second argument as an NP to its left, and its result as a sentence: For parsing purposes, we extend CCG categories to express category features, and head-word and dependency information directly, as follows: The feature dcl specifies the category&#8217;s S result as a declarative sentence, bought identifies its head, and the numbers denote dependency relations.
    Heads and dependencies are always marked up on atomic categories (S, N, NP, PP, and conj in our implementation).
    The categories are combined using a small set of typed combinatory rules, such as functional application and composition (see Steedman (2000) for details).
    Derivations are written as follows, with
