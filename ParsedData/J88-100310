roach over previous ones.
    First, spans of unlimited length can be handled (subject to machine resources).
    Although earlier researchers (Klein and Simmons, Greene and Rubin) have suggested that spans of length over 5 are rare enough to be of little concern, this is not the case.
    The number of spans of a given length is a function of that length and the corpus size; so long spans may be obtained merely by examining more text.
    The total numbers of spans in the Brown Corpus, for each length from 3 to 19, are: 397111, 143447, 60224, 26515, 11409,5128, 2161, 903, 382, 161, 58, 29, 14, 6, 1, 0, 1.
    Graphing the logarithms Computational Linguistics, Volume 14, Number 1, Winter 1988 33 Steven J. DeRose Grammatical Category Disambiguation by Statistical Optimization of these quantities versus the span length for each, produces a near-perfect straight line.
    Second, a precise mathematical definition is possible for the fundamental idea of CLAWS.
    Whereas earlier efforts were based primarily on a
