    3.2.2 Granularity.
    One of the foremost problems for WSD is to determine the appropriate degree of sense granularity.
    Several authors (for example, Slator and Wilks [1987]) have remarked that the sense divisions one finds in dictionaries are often too fine for the purposes of NLP work.
    Overly fine sense distinctions create practical difficulIde and Veronis Introduction ties for automated WSD: they introduce significant combinatorial effects (for example, Slator and Wilks [1987] note that the sentence There is a huge envelope of air around the surface of the earth has 284,592 different potential combined sense assignments using the moderately-sized LDOCE); they require making sense choices that are extremely difficult, even for expert lexicographers; and they increase the amount of data required for supervised methods to unrealistic proportions.
    In addition, the sense distinctions made in many dictionaries are sometime
