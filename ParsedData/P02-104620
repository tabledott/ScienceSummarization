s, and incorrectly labels one new instance.
    The rule&#8217;s precision is 0.95.
    The precision of the new classifier (the old classifier plus the new atomic rule) is 119/120 = 0.99.
    Note that the new precision lies between the old precision and the precision of the rule.
    We will show that this is always the case, given precision independence and balanced errors.
    We need to consider several quantities: the precision of the current classifier, P(Y`JG`); the precision of the rule under consideration, P(Y`JF`); the precision of the rule on the current labeled set, P(Y`JF`G&#8727;); and the precision of the rule as measured using estimated labels, P(G`JF`G&#8727;).
    The assumption of balanced errors implies that measured precision equals true precision on labeled instances, as follows.
    (We assume here that all instances have true labels, hence that This, combined with precision independence, implies that the precision of F` as measured on the labeled set is equal to its true precision P(Y
