 the grammatical function through which they were realized, e.g. subject.
    The BFP algorithm assumes that some other mechanism can structure both written texts and taskoriented dialogues into hierarchical segments.
    The present concern is not with whether there might be a grammar of discourse that determines this structure, or whether it is derived from the cues that cooperative speakers give hearers to aid in processing.
    Since centering is a local phenomenon and is intended to operate within a segment, we needed to deduce a segmental structure in order to analyse the data.
    Speaker's intentions, task structure, cue words like O.K. now.., intonational properties of utterances, coherence relations, the scoping of modal operators, and mechanisms for shifting control between discourse participants have all been proposed as ways of determining discourse segmentation [Gro77, GSSG, Rei85, PH87, HL87, Hob78, Hob85, Rob88, WS88].
    Here, we use a combination of orthography, anaphora distribution, cue w
