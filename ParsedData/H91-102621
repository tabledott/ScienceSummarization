 scored with X. logprob (match I slope j) J Using Bayes rule, the prob(matchlslopej) is rewritten as prob( slope ~ Imatch) prob ( match).
  Both terms were estimated empirically.
  The second term is determined by the fan-in, the number of possible matches that a particular j value might play a role in.
  In this example, most of the j values had a fan-in of 1.
  However, the two instances of et had a fan-in of 2 because they could match either of the two instances of and.
  The score is smaller for both of these uses of et because there is more uncertainty.
  We considered three cases: the fan-in is 1, 2 or many.
  The log prob(match) in each of these three cases is -0.05, --0.34 and ---0.43, respectively.
  The first term is also determined empirically.
  The score is maximized for a slope of 1, In this case, log prob(slopelmatch) is --0.46.
  The score falls off rapidly with larger or smaller slopes.
  The dynamic programming optimization is also given the choice to match an English word to NULL.
