sentences lengths in ef-, eef-, and effbeads.
    From this joint distribution, we can compute that the mutual information between French and English sentence lengths in these beads is 1.85 bits per sentence.
    We see therefore that, even in the absence of the anchor points produced by the first two passes, the correlation in sentence lengths is strong enough to allow alignment with an error rate that is asymptotically less than 100%.
    Heartening though such a result may be to the theoretician, this is a sufficiently coarse bound on the error rate to warrant further study.
    Accordingly, we wrote a program to simulate the alignment process that we had in mind.
    Using Pr (e.,), Pr (ef), and the parameters from Table 3, we generated an artificial pair of aligned corpora.
    We then determined the most probable alignment for the data.
    We recorded the fraction of ef-beads in the most probable alignment that did not correspond to ef-beads in the true alignment as the error rate for the process.
