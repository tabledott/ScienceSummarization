 improve on when combining systems.
    This year, the system combinations perform better than their component systems more often than last year.
    The primary objectives of this workshop are to evaluate the state of the art in machine translation, to disseminate common test sets and public training data with published performance numbers, and to refine evaluation methodologies for machine translation.
    As with past years, all of the data, translations, and human judgments produced for our workshop are publicly available.2 We hope they form a valuable resource for research into statistical machine translation, system combination, and automatic evaluation of translation quality.
  
  
    The workshop examined translation between English and four other languages: German, Spanish, French, and Czech.
    We created a test set for each language pair by translating newspaper articles.
    We additionally provided training data and two baseline systems.
    The test data for this year&#8217;s task was created
