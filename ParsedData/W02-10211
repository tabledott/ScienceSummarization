l hypotheses with the same number of covered source sentence positions and apply both pruning types again.
    Those hypotheses that survive the pruning are called the active hypotheses.
    The word graph structure and the results presented here can easily be transferred to other search algorithms, such as A* search.
  
  
    It is widely accepted in the community that a significant improvement in translation quality will come from more sophisticated translation and language models.
    For example, a language model that goes beyond m-gram dependencies could be used, but this would be difficult to integrate into the search process.
    As a step towards the solution of this problem, we determine not only the single best sentence hypothesis, but also other complete sentences that the search algorithm found but that were judged worse.
    We can then apply rescoring with a refined model to those hypotheses.
    One efficient way to store the different alternatives is a word graph.
