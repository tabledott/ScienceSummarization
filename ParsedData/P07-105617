    Sections 2-5 focused on how to adapt to a target domain when you had a labeled source dataset.
    We now take a step back to look at the problem of selecting source domain data to label.
    We study a setting where an engineer knows roughly her domains of interest but does not have any labeled data yet.
    In that case, she can ask the question &#8220;Which sources should I label to obtain the best performance over all my domains?&#8221; On our product domains, for example, if we are interested in classifying reviews of kitchen appliances, we know from sections 4-5 that it would be foolish to label reviews of books or DVDs rather than electronics.
    Here we show how to select source domains using only unlabeled data and the SCL representation.
    We propose to measure domain adaptability by using the divergence of two domains after the SCL projection.
    We can characterize domains by their induced distributions on instance space: the more different the domains, the more dive
