cient for choosing the correct target word in an English-to-French Machine Translation system and is at a similar level of granularity to the sense distinctions explored by other researchers in WSD, for example Brown et al. (1991), Yarowsky (1996), and McRoy (1992) (see Section 2).
    We began by examining the potential usefulness of part-of-speech information for sense resolution.
    It was found that 34% of the content-word types in LDOCE were polysemous, and 12% polyhomographic.
    (Polyhomographic words are necessarily polysemous since each homograph is a non-empty set of senses.)
    If we assume that the part of speech of each polyhomographic word in context is known, then 88% of word types would be disambiguated to the homograph level.
    (In other words, 88% do not have two homographs with the same part of speech.)
    Some words will be disambiguated to the homograph level if they are used in a certain part of speech but not others.
    For example, beam has 3 homographs in LDOCE; the first two a
