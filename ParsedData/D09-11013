ce models (e.g., Luo et al. (2004), Yang et al.
    (2004)).
    Unlike mention-pair models, these entity-mention models are trained to determine whether an active mention belongs to a preceding, possibly partially-formed, coreference cluster.
    Hence, they can employ cluster-level features (i.e., features that are defined over any subset of mentions in a preceding cluster), which makes them more expressive than mention-pair models.
    Motivated in part by these recently developed models, we propose in this paper a clusterranking approach to coreference resolution that combines the strengths of mention-ranking models and entity-mention models.
    Specifically, we recast coreference as the problem of determining which of a set of preceding coreference clusters is the best to link to an active mention using a learned cluster ranker.
    In addition, we show how discourse-new detection (i.e., the task of determining whether a mention introduces a new entity in a discourse) can be learned jointly with corefer
