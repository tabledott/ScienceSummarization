    As in Experiment 1, the frequency threshold and the length of the transition sequence were optimized on the development set.
    Optimal salience-based models were obtained for entities with frequency &#8805;2.
    The optimal transition length was &#8804;2.
    All models were trained and tested using SVMlight (Joachims 2002).
    Comparison with State-of-the-Art Methods.
    Our results were compared to the LSA model introduced in Experiment 1 (see Section 4.2 for details).
    Unfortunately, we could not Barzilay and Lapata Modeling Local Coherence employ Barzilay and Lee&#8217;s (2004) content models for the summary ranking task.
    Being domain-dependent, these models require access to domain representative texts for training.
    Our summary corpus, however, contains texts from multiple domains and does not provide an appropriate sample for reliably training content models.
    Impact of Linguistic Representation.
    Our results are summarized in Table 8.
