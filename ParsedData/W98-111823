-systems result which we achieved by adding 75 articles from the formal-run test corpus to the basic 350-article training data.
    In addition to being an outstanding performance figure, this number shows MENE's responsiveness to good training material.
    A few other conclusions can be drawn from this data.
    First of all, MENE needs at least 20 articles of tagged training data to get acceptable performance on its own.
    Secondly, there is a minimum amount of training data which is needed for MENE to improve an external system.
    For Proteus and the Manitoba system, this number seems to be about 80 articles, because they show a degradation of performance at 40.
    Since the IsoQuest system was stronger to start with, MENE required 150 articles to show an improvement.
    Note the anomaly in comparing the 250 and 350 article columns.
    Proteus shows only a very small gain and IsoQuest shows a deterioration.
    These last 100 articles added to the system were tagged by us at NYU, and we would humbl
