gual &#8220;synsets&#8221; by comparing them to entries in human-constructed bilingual dictionaries, as done by Haghighi et al. (2008).
    Unlike previous work (Koehn and Knight, 2002), we evaluate all words, not just nouns.
    We collected bilingual lexica mapping English words to German, Greek, Spanish, French, Italian, Dutch and Swedish.
    Each lexicon is a set of pairs consisting of an English word and a translated word, 1we, wt}.
    We do not consider multi-word terms.
    We expect that simple analysis of topic assignments for sequential words would yield such collocations, but we leave this for future work.
    For every topic t we select a small number K of the most probable words in English (e) and in each &#8220;translation&#8221; language (E): Wte and Wtt, respectively.
    We then add the Cartesian product of these sets for every topic to a set of candidate translations C. We report the number of elements of C that appear in the reference lexica.
    Results for K = 1, that is, considering on
