    Yet very few publications describe phrasetable smoothing techniques in detail.
    In this paper, we provide the first systematic study of smoothing methods for phrase-based SMT.
    Although we introduce a few new ideas, most methods described here were devised by others; the main purpose of this paper is not to invent new methods, but to compare methods.
    In experiments over many language pairs, we show that smoothing yields small but consistent gains in translation performance.
    We feel that this paper only scratches the surface: many other combinations of phrasetable smoothing techniques remain to be tested.
    We define a phrasetable as a set of source phrases (ngrams) s&#732; and their translations &#732;t, along with associated translation probabilities p(&#732;s|&#732;t) and &#732;t|&#732;s).
    These conditional distributions are derived from the joint frequencies c(&#732;s, &#732;t) of source/target phrase pairs observed in a word-aligned parallel corpus.
