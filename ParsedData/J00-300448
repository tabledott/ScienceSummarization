bly with the results of Hockenmaier and Brew (1998) on the PH corpus; unfortunately no other researchers have published quantitative results on a standard corpus.
    Further work is needed to analyze the results of the Rocling corpus in more detail.
    The next step is to use automatically segmented text to investigate the digital library applications we have described: information retrieval, text summarization, document clustering, and keyphrase extraction.
  
  
    We are grateful to Stuart Inglis, Hong Chen, and John Cleary, who provided advice and assistance.
    The corrected version of Guo Jin's PH corpus and the Rocling corpus were provided by Julia Hockenmaier and Chris Brew at the University of Edinburgh and the Chinese Knowledge Information Processing Group of Academia Sirtica, respectively.
    The Institute of Computational Linguistics of Peking University also provided some test material.
