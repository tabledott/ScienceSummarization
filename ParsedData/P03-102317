ficant improvement (21.1 for MUC-6, and 13.1 for MUC-7) over Connolly et al.&#8217;s twin-candidate based approach.
    Compared with the gains in pronoun resolution, the improvement in non-pronoun resolution is slight.
    As shown in Table 3, our approach resolves non-pronominal anaphors with the recall of 51.3 (39.7) and the precision of 90.4 (87.6) for MUC-6 (MUC-7).
    In contrast to Ng and Cardie&#8217;s approach, the performance of our approach improves only 0.3 (0.6) in recall and 0.5 (1.2) in precision.
    The reason may be that in non-pronoun resolution, the coreference of an anaphor and its candidate is usually determined only by some strongly indicative features such as alias, apposition, string-matching, etc (this explains why we obtain a high precision but a low recall in non-pronoun resolution).
    Therefore, most of the positive candidates are coreferential to the anaphors even though they are not the &#8220;best&#8221;.
    As a result, we can only see comparatively slight difference betwe
