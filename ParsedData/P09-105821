 model outperforms all prior approaches for both Seg and Seg &amp; Tag, and we hope that our error-driven model can further improve performance.
  
  
    In this section, we discuss related approaches based on several aspects of learning algorithms and search space representation methods.
    Maximum entropy models are widely used for word segmentation and POS tagging tasks (Uchimoto et al., 2001; Ng and Low, 2004; Nakagawa, 2004; Nakagawa and Uchimoto, 2007) since they only need moderate training times while they provide reasonable performance.
    Conditional random fields (CRFs) (Lafferty et al., 2001) further improve the performance (Kudo et al., 2004; Shi and Wang, 2007) by performing whole-sequence normalization to avoid label-bias and length-bias problems.
    However, CRF-based algorithms typically require longer training times, and we observed an infeasible convergence time for our hybrid model.
    Online learning has recently gained popularity for many NLP tasks since it performs comparably or bet
