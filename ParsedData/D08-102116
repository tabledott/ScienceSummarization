    The test sentences were also parsed with the Bikel parser.
    The phrases to be evaluated were selected such that there was an even balance of phrase lengths (from one word long up to five words long), with half of the phrases being valid syntactic constituents and half being arbitrary sequences of words.
    410 phrases were selected at random for evaluation.
    30 items were excluded from our results subsequent to evaluation on the grounds that they consisted solely of punctuation and stop words like determiners, prepositions and pronouns.
    This left a total of 380 unique phrases.
    We produced paraphrases under the following eight conditions: 1.
    Baseline &#8211; The paraphrase probability defined by Bannard and Callison-Burch (2005).
    Calculated over multiple parallel corpora as given in Equation 5.
    Note that under this condition the best paraphrase is the same for each occurrence of the phrase irrespective of which sentence it occurs in.
