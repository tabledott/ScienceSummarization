e and approximate inference methods at testing time, this approach can be made scalable.
    This results in a coreference model that can capture features over sets of noun phrases, rather than simply pairs of noun phrases.
    This is an example of a model with extremely flexible representational power, but for which exact inference is intractable.
    The simple approximations we have described here have enabled this more flexible model to outperform a model that is simplified for tractability.
    A short-term extension would be to consider features over entire clusterings, such as the number of clusters.
    This could be incorporated in a ranking scheme, as in Ng (2005).
    Future work will extend our approach to a wider variety of tasks.
    The model we have described here is specific to clustering tasks; however a similar formulation could be used to approach a number of language processing tasks, such as parsing and relation extraction.
    These tasks could benefit from first-order features, and th
