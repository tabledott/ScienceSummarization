cal context into Equation 1 respectively.
    Notice that KLC differs substantially from KGC as it considers the ordering of the tokens and the feature space is enriched with PoS, lemma and orthographic features.
    Finally, the Shallow Linguistic kernel It follows directly from the explicit construction of the feature space and from closure properties of kernels that KSL is a valid kernel.
  
  
    The two data sets used for the experiments concern the same domain (i.e. gene/protein interactions).
    However, they present a crucial difference which makes it worthwhile to show the experimental results on both of them.
    In one case (AImed) interactions are considered symmetric, while in the other (LLL challenge) agents and targets of genic interactions have to be identified.
    The first data set used in the experiments is the AImed corpus4, previously used for training protein interaction extraction systems in (Bunescu et al., 2005; Bunescu and Mooney, 2005b).
    It consists of 225 Medline abstracts:
