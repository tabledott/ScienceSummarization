al similarity.
    Medin, Goldstone, and Gentner (1990) distinguish attributes and relations as follows: Attributes are predicates taking one argument (e.g., X is red, X is large), whereas relations are predicates taking two or more arguments (e.g., X collides with Y, X is larger than Y).
    Attributes are used to state properties of objects; relations express relations between objects or propositions.
    Gentner (1983) notes that what counts as an attribute or a relation can depend on the context.
    For example, large can be viewed as an attribute of X, LARGE(X), or a relation between X and some standard Y, LARGER THAN(X, Y).
    The amount of attributional similarity between two words, A and B, depends on the degree of correspondence between the properties of A and B.
    A measure of attributional similarity is a function that maps two words, A and B, to a real number, sima(A,B) E R. The more correspondence there is between the properties of A and B, the greater their attributional similarity.
