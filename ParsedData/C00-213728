 all the flit)s l:md on :~ particular side is faMy small ((1/2) 5 -- i[/32).
  When the ttil)s are positively correlated, these chmices increase.
  When the first flip lands on that side, the chances of the other four tlil)s doing the same are now ea.ch greater tlmn 1/2.
  Since statistical significance testing involves finding the chances of getting an mmsmd (skcwe(1) result under some null hyt)othesis, one needs to determine those del)endencies in order to accurately determine those dmnces, l)eter- mining the etks:t of these dependencies is some- thing that is yet to l)e done,.
  5 Conc lus ions In elnpirical natural language processing, one is often COml)aring differences in values of met- rics like recall, precision and balanced F-score.
  Many of the statistics tests commonly used to make such comparisons assume the indepen- dence between the results being compared.
