 we do not consider past- or present- participle uses of the predicates, thus excluding any passive-voice sentences.
  The syntactic positions used are based on a few heuristic rules: Any NP under an S node in the treebank is considered a syntactic subject, and any NP under a VP is considered an object.
  In all other cases, we use the syntactic category of the argument?s node in the treebank tree: for example, SBAR for sentential complements and PP for prepositional phrases.
  For prepositional phrases, as well as for noun phrases that are the object of a preposition, we include the preposition as part of our syntactic role: for example, PP-in, PP-with.
  Table 6 shows the most frequent semantic roles associated with var- ious syntactic positions, while Table 7 shows the most frequent syntactic positions for various roles.
  Tables 6 and 7 show overall statistics for the corpus, and some caution is needed in interpreting the results, as the semantic-role labels are defined on a per-frameset basis and do not
