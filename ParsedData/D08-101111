 Viterbi search.
    First, whenever more than one hypothesis words are aligned to one backbone word, we keep the link which gives the highest occupation probability computed via the forward-backward algorithm.
    The other hypothesis words originally aligned to the backbone word will be aligned to the null associated with that backbone word.
    Second, for the hypothesis words that are aligned to a particular null on the backbone side, a set of nulls are inserted around that backbone word associated with the null such that no links cross each other.
    As illustrated in Fig.
    3 (a), if a hypothesis word e2&#8217; is aligned to the backbone word e2, a null is inserted in front of the backbone word e2 linked to the hypothesis word e1&#8217; that comes before e2&#8217;.
    Nulls are also inserted for other hypothesis words such as e3&#8217; and e4&#8217; after the backbone word e2.
    If there is no hypothesis word aligned to that backbone word, all nulls are inserted after that backbone word .3 For a b
