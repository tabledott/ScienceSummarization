way of evaluating RS trees.
    The problem is far too complex and our knowledge of the issues involved so meagre that only a token gesture can be made at this point.
    We offer the following evaluation scheme merely so that the basis of our experiments is clear and because we believe that some of the ideas are starting in the right direction.
    Here are the features that we score for: Topic and Interestingness We assume that the entity that the text is &amp;quot;about&amp;quot;- is specified with the input.

    We score as follows: -20 for an unsatisfied precondition for a relation Focus Movement We do
