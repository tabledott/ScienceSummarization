onducted for training data of 569,994 vectors.
			The total size of the original news articles was 2 MB and the number of NEs was 39,022.
			According to the definition of +-) , a classifier has to process support vectors for each  . Table 1 shows  s for different word classes.
			According to this table, classi fication of one word requires  ?s dot products with 228,306 support vectors in 33 classifiers.
			Therefore, the classifiers are very slow.
			We have never seensuch large  s in SVM literature on pattern recogni tion.
			The reason for the large  s is word features.
			Inother domains such as character recognition, dimen 3http://cl.aist-nara.ac.jp/?taku-ku/software/TinySVM sion ` is usually fixed.
			However, in the NE task, ` increases monotonically with respect to the size of the training data.
			Since SVMs learn combinations of features,  tends to be very large.
			This tendencywill hold for other tasks of natural language pro cessing, too.
			Here, we focus on the quadratic kernel BG * I#!?G ?
