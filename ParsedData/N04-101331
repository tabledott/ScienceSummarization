  The complete version gives an overall improvement in F-score of 5% over the Collins parser at a cost of a factor of 5 in parsing time.
  
  
    We presented some experiments that compare the accuracy and performance of two stochastic parsing systems, the shallow Collins parser and the deep-grammar-based XLE system.
    We measured the accuracy of both systems against a gold standard derived from the PARC 700 dependency bank, and also measured their processing times.
    Contrary to conventional wisdom, we found that the shallow system was not substantially faster than the deep parser operating on a core grammar, while the deep system was significantly more accurate.
    Furthermore, extending the grammar base of the deep system results in much better accuracy at a cost of a factor of 5 in speed.
    Our experiment is comparable to recent work on reading off Propbank-style (Kingsbury and Palmer, 2002) predicate-argument relations from gold-standard treebank trees and automatic parses of the Collins parser.
