 a split correlating external with internal contexts is the inverted sentence category (SINV), which has only two subsymbols, one which usually has the ROOT symbol as its parent (and which has sentence final puncutation as its last child), and a second subsymbol which occurs in embedded contexts (and does not end in punctuation).
    Such patterns are common, but often less easy to predict.
    For example, possesive NPs get two subsymbols, depending on whether their possessor is a person / country or an organization.
    The external correlation turns out to be that people and countries are more likely to possess a subject NP, while organizations are more likely to possess an object NP.
    Nonterminal splits can also be used to relay information between distant tree nodes, though untangling this kind of propagation and distilling it into clean examples is not trivial.
    As one example, the subsymbol S-12 (matrix clauses) occurs only under the ROOT symbol.
    S-12&#8217;s children usually include NP-8, wh
