0 sentences), yielding average solve times of less than 0.5 seconds.
    Our approach converges quickly due to the quality of the scoring function.
    Its weights have been trained on cycle free data, thus it is more likely to guide the search to a cycle free solution.
    In the following section we present the objective function Ox, variables Vx and linear constraints Bx and Ix needed for parsing x using Algorithm 1.
    Vx contains a set of binary variables to represent labelled edges: where n is the number of tokens and the index 0 represents the root token. bestk(i, j) is the set of k labels with highest s(i, j, l). ei,j,l equals 1 if there is a edge (i.e., a dependency) with the label l between token i (head) and j (child), 0 otherwise. k depends on the type of constraints we want to add.
    For the plain MST problem it is sufficient to set k = 1 and only take the best scoring label for each token pair.
    However, if we want a constraint which forbids duplicate subjects we need to provide additional
