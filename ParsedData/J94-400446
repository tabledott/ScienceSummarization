he syntactic structures and corresponding CLCS are shown here: (29) [C-MAX [I-MAX [N-MAX I] [V-MAX [V am]  [A--MAX hungry]]]] [State BEIdent ([Thing I], [Position aTIdent ([Thing I], [Property HUNGRY])])] [C-MAX [I-MAX [N-MAX Ich] [V-MAX IN-MAX Hunger] [v habe]]]] 19 Here, the predicate is adjectival (hungry) in English but nominal (Hunger) in German.
  Categorial divergence is resolved by means of the :CAT parameter.
  The lexical entries for be and haben illustrate the difference in the use of this parameter: 2?
  (30) (i) (ii) Lexical entry for be: [State BEIdent ([Thing W], [Position aTIdent ([Thing W], [Property Y])])] Lexical entry for haben: [State BEIdent ([Thing W], [Position aTIdent ([Thing W], [Property :CAT(N) Y])])] Because the English entry does not contain a :CAT marker in the position correspond- ing to [Property Y], this constituent is realized in the syntactic structure as C$/~(Property) Adjective (i.e., hungry).
  By contrast, the :CAT(N) marker specified in the German entry forces the defa
