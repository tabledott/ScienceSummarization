t classification.
    We can use numerous additional features that deal with specific problems of the baseline statistical MT system.
    In this paper, we shall use the first three of these features.
    As additional language model, we use a class-based five-gram language model.
    This feature and the word penalty feature allow a straightforward integration into the used dynamic programming search algorithm (Och et al., 1999).
    As this is not possible for the conventional dictionary feature, we use n-best rescoring for this feature.
  
  
    To train the model parameters &#955;M1 of the direct translation model according to Eq.
    11, we use the GIS (Generalized Iterative Scaling) algorithm (Darroch and Ratcliff, 1972).
    It should be noted that, as was already shown by (Darroch and Ratcliff, 1972), by applying suitable transformations, the GIS algorithm is able to handle any type of real-valued features.
    To apply this algorithm, we have to solve various practical problems.
