acement relation.
    Third, it can be ignored because it comes in the middle or center of another rule application that started to the left of the bracket in question and extends further to the right.
    Suppose we encode these three different roles in three distinct left-bracket symbols &lt;, &lt;, and The crucial difference in the case where an obligatory left-to-right rule incorrectly fails to apply is that the left-context preceding the 0&#176; is marked with &lt; instead of &lt;, since it is part of an identity sequence.
    This situation is undesirable no matter what types of brackets are ignored in the 0&#176; pattern or mark the right-context of this potential application.
    Whether those brackets are in the center or at the boundary of replacements that are carried out further to the right of the offending situation, the leftward application marked by the &lt; should have taken precedence.
    The symbols &lt; and &gt; were previously used as auxiliary characters appearing in intermediate string
