d corpora from which bilingual rewrite probabilities could be estimated; this rules out the possibility of supervised training of the joint rules.
    Second, separating the probabilities allows separate estimation of the probabilities&#8212;resulting in two well-understood parameter estimation tasks which can be carried out independently.1 This factored modeling approach bears a strong resemblance to the factored monolingual parser of Klein and Manning (2002), which combined an English dependency model and an unlexicalized PCFG.
    The generative model used by Klein and Manning consisted of multiplying the two component models; the model was therefore deficient.
    We go a step farther, replacing the deficient generative model with a log-linear model.
    The underlying parsing algorithm remains the same, but the weights are no longer constrained to sum to one.
    (Hereafter, we assume weights are additive real values; a log-probability is an example of a weight.)
    The weights may be estimated using di
