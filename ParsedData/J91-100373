2, water is removed to prevent it from being used a second time.
    Figure 15 shows the semantic vector produced.
    As with Figure 11, it shows a metaphorical relation.
    There is a preference violation, an estranged network path indicated by the 1 in the fifth column of the first array.
    There is also a relevant analogy, shown by the 1 in the third column of the second array: the analogical match of the cells [plough1, plough2, soil]] and [shipl, sail2, water2].
    The second array shows that 11 cells are matched, 1 from the source and 10 from the target (check against Figure 13).
    The sum of the array's columns is: Semantic vector for another metaphorical semantic relation In the third array, the match of nonrelevant cells, there is 1 ancestor match, 4 same matches, 1 sister match, and 3 distinctive cells of ship1.
    Fifteen cells are matched, 6 from the source and 9 from the target (see Figure 14).
    The totals are: Semantic vectors can represent all the semantic relations except metonymic
