ense preferences.
    Section 5 describes how it combines the preference information to select senses.
    Afterward, we will discuss the results of our methods and the avenues for improvement that remain.
  
  
    The problem of word sense discrimination is to choose, for a particular word in a particular context, which of its possible senses is the &amp;quot;correct&amp;quot; one for the context.
    Information about senses can come from a wide variety of sources: Of course, not all these cues will be equally useful.

    Role-related expectations are also important, but to a slightly lesser degree.
    Syntactic tags are very important, because knowing the intended part of speech is often enough to identify the correct sense.
