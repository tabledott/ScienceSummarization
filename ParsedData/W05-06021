s to a complete formal meaning representation language (MRL).
			We consider two MRL?s that can be directly used to perform useful, complex tasks.
			The first is a Prolog-based language used in a previously-developed corpus of queries to a database on U.S. geography (Zelle and Mooney, 1996).
			The second MRL is a coaching language for robotic soccer developed for the RoboCup Coach Competition, in which AI researchers compete to provide effective instructions to a coachable team of agents in a simulated soccer domain (et al, 2003).We present an approach based on a statisti cal parser that generates a semantically augmentedparse tree (SAPT), in which each internal node includes both a syntactic and semantic label.
			We aug ment Collins?
			head-driven model 2 (Collins, 1997) to incorporate a semantic label on each internalnode.
			By integrating syntactic and semantic inter pretation into a single statistical model and finding the globally most likely parse, an accurate combined syntactic/semantic analysis c
