			1%eest imat ing a SLTAG Given a set of positive example sentences, W = {wt ' "wK}, we would like to compute the probabil- ity of each rule of a given SLTAG in order to maximize thc probability that the corpus were generated by this SLTAG.
			An algorithm solving this problem can be used in two different ways.
			The first use is as a reestimation algorithm.
			In ttfis approach, the input SI,'1'A(~ derives structures that arc reasonable according to some criteria (such as a linguis- tic theory and some a priori kuowledge of the corpus) and the intended use of the algorithm is to refine the probability of each rule.
			The second use is as a learning algorithm.
			At the first iteration, a SLTAG which generates all possible struc- tures over a given set of nodes and terminal symbols is used.
			Initially the probability of each rule is randomly assigned and then tile algorithm will re-estimate tbese probabilities.
			Informally speaking, given a first estimate of the pa- rameter
