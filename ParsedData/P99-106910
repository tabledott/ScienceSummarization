ield belonging to the syntactic analysis w, and yi = y(wi) is the yield belonging to the i'th sample in the training corpus.
    The point is that Eo(f3(w)ly(w) yi) is generally computable.
    In fact, if SZ(y) is the set of well-formed syntactic structures that have yield y (i.e., the set of possible parses of the string y), then a l expectations only involves summing over the possible syntactic analyses or parses 12(yi) of the strings in the training corpus.
    While it is possible to construct UBGs for which the number of possible parses is unmanageably high, for many grammars it is quite manageable to enumerate the set of possible parses and thereby directly evaluate Eo (f3(w)iy (w ) = yi ) .
    Therefore, we propose replacing the gradient, (3), by and performing a gradient ascent.
    Of course (6) is no longer the gradient of the likelihood function, but fortunately it is (exactly) the gradient of (the log of) another criterion: Instead of maximizing the likelihood of the syntactic analyses over the
