  SemEval-2010 Task 13: TempEval-2
  
    Tempeval-2 comprises evaluation tasks for time expressions, events and temporal relations, the latter of which was split up in four sub tasks, motivated by the notion that smaller subtasks would make both data preparation and temporal relation extraction easier.
    Manually annotated data were
  
  
    The ultimate aim of temporal processing is the automatic identification of all temporal referring expressions, events and temporal relations within a text.
    However, addressing this aim is beyond the scope of an evaluation challenge and a more modest approach is appropriate.
    The 2007 SemEval task, TempEval-1 (Verhagen et al., 2007; Verhagen et al., 2009), was an initial evaluation exercise based on three limited temporal ordering and anchoring tasks that were considered realistic both from the perspective of assembling resources for development and testing and from the perspective of developing systems capable of addressing the tasks.1 TempEval-2 is based on T
