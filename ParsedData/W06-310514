ary distribution over any english phrases without affecting the likelihood of either sentence pair.
    Not only does this counterintuitive parameterization give a high data likelihood, but it is also a fixed point of the EM algorithm.
    The phenomenon demonstrated above poses a problem for generative phrase models in general.
    The ambiguous process of translation can be modeled either by the latent segmentation variable or the phrase translation probabilities.
    In some cases, optimizing the likelihood of the training corpus adjusts for the former when we would prefer the latter.
    We next investigate how this problem manifests in &#966;EM and its effect on translation quality.
    The parameters of &#966;EM differ from the heuristically extracted parameters &#966;H in that the conditional distributions over English translations for some French words are sharply peaked for &#966;EM compared to flatter distributions generated by &#966;H.
