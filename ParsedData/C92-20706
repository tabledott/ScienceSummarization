in lines 7, 8, and 10 above).
  While the level of noise introduced through polysemy is substantial, it can usually be tolerated because the spurious senses are distributed through tile 1(}41 other categories, whereas the signal is coneenwated in just one.
  Only if several words had secondary senses in the state category would context typical for the other category appear significant in this context.
  However, if one of these spurious senses was frexluent and dominated the set of examples, file situation could be disastrous.
  An attempt is made to weight the concordance data to minim~e this effect and to make the sample representative of all tools attd tnachinery, not just the more common ones.
  If a word such as drill occurs k tinies in the coqms, all words ill the context of drill contribnte weight 1/k to frequency sunos.
  Despite its flaws, this weighted matrix will serve as a representative, albeit noisy, sample of the typical context ofIYOOI.S/MACItlNERY in Groliers encyclopedia.
