 following, accuracy denotes the number of correctly assigned tags divided by the number of tokens in the corpus processed.
    The tagger is allowed to assign exactly one tag to each token.
    We distinguish the overall accuracy, taking into account all tokens in the test corpus, and separate accuracies for known and unknown tokens.
    The latter are interesting, since usually unknown tokens are much more difficult to process than known tokens, for which a list of valid tags can be found in the lexicon.
    The German NEGRA corpus consists of 20,000 sentences (355,000 tokens) of newspaper texts (Frankfurter Rundschau) that are annotated with parts-ofspeech and predicate-argument structures (Skut et al., 1997).
    It was developed at the Saarland University in Saarbriicken2.
    Part of it was tagged at the IMS Stuttgart.
    This evaluation only uses the partof-speech annotation and ignores structural annotations.
    Tagging accuracies for the NEGRA corpus are shown in table 2.
