    However, our test data differs from theirs in that in this test we deleted all partial words and punctuation from the data, as this results in a more realistic test situation.
    Since the immediate goal of this work is to produce a program that identifies the words of a sentence that belong to the reparandum of a repair construction (to a first approximation these words can be ignored in later processing), our evaluation focuses on the model&#8217;s performance in recovering the words in a reparandum.
    That is, the model is used to classify each word in the sentence as belonging to a reparandum or not, and all other additional structure produced by the model is ignored.
    We measure model performance using standard precision p, recall r and f-score f, measures.
    If n, is the number of reparandum words the model correctly classified, nt is the number of true reparandum words given by the manual annotations and nm is the number of words the model predicts to be reparandum words,
