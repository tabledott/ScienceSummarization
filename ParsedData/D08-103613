cit sampler represents and samples the HMM parameters 0 and 0 in addition to the states t, while in a collapsed sampler the HMM parameters are integrated out, and only the states t are sampled.
    The difference between explicit and collapsed samplers corresponds exactly to the difference between the two PCFG sampling algorithms presented in Johnson et al. (2007).
    An iteration of the pointwise explicit Gibbs sampler consists of resampling 0 and 0 given the stateto-state transition counts n and state-to-word emission counts n0 using (5), and then resampling each state ti given the corresponding word wi and the neighboring states ti&#8722;1 and ti+1 using (6).
    The Dirichlet distributions in (5) are non-uniform; nt is the vector of state-to-state transition counts in t leaving state t in the current state vector t, while n0t is the vector of state-to-word emission counts for state t. See Johnson et al. (2007) for a more detailed explanation, as well as an algorithm for sampling from the Dirichlet distri
