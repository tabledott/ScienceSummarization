			Discussion Across all of the corpora the best performing system, in terms of F score, achieved a 0.972, with an average of 0.918 and median of 0.941.
			As one would expect the best F score on the open tests was higher than the best on the closed tests, 0.972 vs. 0.964, both on the MSR corpus.
			This result follows from the fact that systems taking part on the open test can utilize moreinformation than those on the closed.
			Also interesting to compare are the OOV recall rates be tween the Open and Closed tracks.
