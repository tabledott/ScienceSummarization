ore pairs cannot be judged in isolation, and context becomes an important factor.
    Barzilay and Elhadad (2003) make use of contextual information by detecting the topical structure of the articles in the two corpora and aligning them at paragraph level based on the topic assigned to each paragraph.
    Afterwards, they proceed and align sentences within paragraph pairs using dynamic programming.
    Their results show that both the induced topical structure and the paragraph alignment improve the precision of their extraction method.
    A line of research that is both complementary and related to ours is that of Resnik and Smith (2003).
    Their STRAND Web-mining system has a purpose that is similar to ours: to identify translational pairs.
    However, STRAND focuses on extracting pairs of parallel Web pages rather than sentences.
    Resnik and Smith (2003) show that their approach is able to find large numbers of similar document pairs.
    Their system is potentially a good way of acquiring comparabl
