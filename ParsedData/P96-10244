 Nc denote ITc I, the number of nonterminals in the correct parse tree.
    There are various levels of strictness for determining whether a constituent (element of TG) is &amp;quot;correct.&amp;quot; The strictest of these is Labelled Match.
    A constituent (s,t, X) E TG is correct according to Labelled Match if and only if (s, t, X) E T. In other words, a constituent in the guessed parse tree is correct if and only if it occurs in the correct parse tree.
    The next level of strictness is Bracketed Match.
    Bracketed match is like labelled match, except that the nonterminal label is ignored.
    Formally, a constituent (s, t, X) E TG is correct according to Bracketed Match if and only if there exists a Y such that (s,t,Y) E T. The least strict level is Consistent Brackets (also called Crossing Brackets).
    Consistent Brackets is like Bracketed Match in that the label is ignored.
    It is even less strict in that the observed (s, t, X) need not be in Tc &#8212;it must simply not be ruled out by any (
