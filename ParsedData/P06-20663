ency treebanks: the Prague Dependency Treebank (PDT) (Haji&#711;c et al., 2001), and the Danish Dependency Treebank (DDT) (Kromann, 2003).
    The rest of the paper is structured as follows.
    In section 2, we provide a formal definition of dependency structures as a special kind of directed graphs, and characterize the notion of projectivity.
    In section 3, we define and compare five different constraints on mildly non-projective dependency structures that can be found in the literature: planarity, multiplanarity, well-nestedness, gap degree, and edge degree.
    In section 4, we provide an experimental evaluation of the notions of planarity, well-nestedness, gap degree, and edge degree, by investigating how large a proportion of the dependency structures found in PDT and DDT are allowed under the different constraints.
    In section 5, we present our conclusions and suggestions for further research.
  
  
    For the purposes of this paper, a dependency graph is a directed graph on the set of indices
