nslated by a synchronous grammar (Wu, 1997; Chiang, 2005; Galley et al., 2006), and the tree-based systems whose input is already a parse tree to be directly converted into a target tree or string (Lin, 2004; Ding and Palmer, 2005; Quirk et al., 2005; Liu et al., 2006; Huang et al., 2006).
    Compared with their string-based counterparts, treebased systems offer some attractive features: they are much faster in decoding (linear time vs. cubic time, see (Huang et al., 2006)), do not require a binary-branching grammar as in string-based models (Zhang et al., 2006), and can have separate grammars for parsing and translation, say, a context-free grammar for the former and a tree substitution grammar for the latter (Huang et al., 2006).
    However, despite these advantages, current tree-based systems suffer from a major drawback: they only use the 1best parse tree to direct the translation, which potentially introduces translation mistakes due to parsing errors (Quirk and Corston-Oliver, 2006).
