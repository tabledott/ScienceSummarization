R, it is easy to separate Attributes and Values when referring to sets, allowing a closer approximation of Full Brevity: the resulting algorithm, D&amp;RPlural,Att, is to D&amp;RPlural as D&amp;RAtt is to D&amp;R; overlapping Values can be treated as described in Section 3.1.
    In what follows, we will once again take propertyoriented versions of the Incremental Algorithm as our starting point, but implications for the separation between Attributes and Values will be mentioned where they are nontrivial.
    Now that we are able to generate references to sets, let us move away from purely intersective descriptions, on to full Boolean combinations of properties.
    Consider a KB whose domain is a set of animals (a, b, c, d, e) and whose only Attributes are TYPE and COLOR: TYPE: DOG ({a, b, c, d, e}), POODLE ({a, b}) COLOR: BLACK ({a, b, c}), WHITE ({d, e}) (All domain elements happen to be dogs.)
    In this situation, the Incremental Algorithm does not allow us to individuate any of the animals.
