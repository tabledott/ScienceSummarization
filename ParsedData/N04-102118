rage parse log probability of the oracle or the reference translations.
    Hence, it turns out that the parser is actually assigning higher probabilities to the ungrammatical MT output than to the presumably grammatical human translations.
    One reason for that is that the MT output uses fewer unseen words and typically more frequent words which lead to a higher language model probability.
    We also performed experiments to balance this effect by dividing the parser probability by the word unigram probability and using this &#8217;normalized parser probability&#8217; as a feature function, but also this did not yield improvements.
    A tree-to-string model is one of several syntaxbased translation models used.
    The model is a conditional probability p(f|T(e)).
    Here, we used a model defined by Yamada and Knight (2001) and Yamada and Knight (2002).
    Internally, the model performs three types of operations on each node of a parse tree.
    First, it reorders the child nodes, such as changing VP &
