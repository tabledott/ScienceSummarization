			The experiments are presented in Section 5 followed by discussion in Section 6.
	
	
			We use a log-linear approach (Och, 2003) in whicha foreign language sentence f is translated into an other language, for example English, e, by seeking a maximum solution: e?
			= argmax e wT ? h( f , e) (1) where h( f , e) is a large-dimension feature vector.
			w is a weight vector that scales the contribution from each feature.
			Each feature can take any real value, such as the log of the n-gram language model to represent fluency, or a lexicon model to capture the word or phrase-wise correspondence.
			2.1 Hierarchical Phrase-based SMT.
			Chiang (2005) introduced the hierarchical phrase based translation approach, in which non-terminalsare embedded in each phrase.
			A translation is gener ated by hierarchically combining phrases using the non-terminals.
			Such a quasi-syntactic structure can naturally capture the reordering of phrases that is notdirectly modeled by a conventional phrase-based approach (K
