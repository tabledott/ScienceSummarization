 on clustering performance.
    The results in table 4 demonstrate that the more two verbs differ in their senses, the lower their chance of ending up in the same cluster.
    From the figures in table 5 we see that the probability of two verbs to appear in the same cluster increases with the number of senses they share.
    Interestingly, it is not only the degree of polysemy which influences the results, but also the type.
    For verb pairs where at least one of the members displays &#8216;irregular&#8217; polysemy (i.e. it does not share its full set of senses with any other verb), the probability of co-occurrence in the same cluster is far lower than for verbs which are polysemic in a &#8216;regular&#8217; manner (Table 5).
    Manual cluster analysis against the polysemic gold standard revealed a yet more comprehensive picture.
    Consider the following clusters (the IB output with K = 42): A1: talk (37), speak (37) A2: look (30, 35), stare (30) A3: focus (31, 45), concentrate (31, 45) A4: add (22, 37,
