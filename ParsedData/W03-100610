 linguistically-motivated characteristic of the tree.
    The elements comprising a feature vector are listed in Table 1.
    Each elementary tree is decomposed into a feature vector in a relatively straightforward manner.
    For example, the POS feature is obtained from the preterminal node of the elementary tree.
    There are also features that specify the syntactic transformations that an elementary tree exhibits.
    Each such transformation is recognized by structural pattern matching the elementary tree against a pattern that identifies the transformation&#8217;s existence.
    For more details, see (Chen, 2001).
    Given a set of elementary trees which compose a TAG, and also the feature vector corresponding to each tree, it is possible to annotate each node representing an argument in the tree with role information.
    These are syntactic roles including for example subject and direct object.
    Each argument node is labeled with two kinds of roles: a surface syntactic role and a deep syntactic r
