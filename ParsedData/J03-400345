relation is replaced with NP.
    In addition, the relation is &#8220;normalized&#8221; to some extent.
    First, all POS tags are replaced with the token TAG, so that POS-tagging errors do not lead to errors in dependencies.17 Second, any complement markings on the parent or head nonterminal are removed.
    For example, (NP-C, NPB, PP, R) is replaced by (NP, NPB, PP, R).
    This prevents parsing errors where a complement has been mistaken to be an adjunct (or vice versa), leading to more than one dependency error.
    As an example, in Figure 12, if the NP the man with the telescope was mistakenly identified as an adjunct, then without normalization, this would lead to two dependency errors: Both the PP dependency and the verb-object relation would be incorrect.
    With normalization, only the verb-object relation is incorrect.
    Under this definition, gold-standard and parser-output trees can be converted to sets of dependencies, and precision and recall can be calculated on these dependencies.
