g planes can be dangerous,&amp;quot; one might have expected that lexical ambiguity was so pervasive that it would be hopeless to try to assign just one part of speech to each word and in just one linear time pass over the input words.
  
  
    However, the proposed stochastic method is considerably simpler than what Marcus had in mind.
    His thesis parser used considerably more syntax than the proposed stochastic method.
    Consider the following pair described in [Marcus]: where it appears that the parser needs to look past an arbitrarily long noun phrase in order to correctly analyze &amp;quot;have,&amp;quot; which could be either a tenseless main verb (imperative) or a tensed auxiliary verb (question).
    Marcus' rather unusual example can no longer be handled by Fidditch, a more recent Marcus-style parser with very large coverage.
    In order to obtain such large coverage, Fidditch has had to take a more robust/modest view of lexical disambiguation.
