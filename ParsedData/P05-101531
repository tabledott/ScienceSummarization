nsider the resulting classifier to output a positivity-preference function , we can then learn a series of thresholds to convert this value into the desired label set, under the assumption that the bigger is, the more positive the review.9 This algorithm always outperforms the majority-class baseline, but not to the degree that the best of SVM OVA and SVM regression does.
    Koppel and Schler (2005) independently found in a three-class study that thresholding a positive/negative classifier trained only on clearly positive or clearly negative examples did not yield large improvements.
