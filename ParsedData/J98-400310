an optional PAUSE between word pronunciations.
    We originally thought to build a general letter-to-sound WFST (Divay and Vitale 1997), on the theory that while wrong (overgeneralized) pronunciations might occasionally be generated, Japanese transliterators also mispronounce words.
    However, our letter-to-sound WFST did not match the performance of Japanese transliterators, and it turns out that mispronunciations are modeled adequately in the next stage of the cascade.
    Next, we map English sound sequences onto Japanese sound sequences.
    This is an inherently information-losing process, as English R and L sounds collapse onto Japanese r, the 14 English vowel sounds collapse onto the 5 Japanese vowel sounds, etc.
    We face two immediate problems: An obvious target inventory is the Japanese syllabary itself, written down in katakana (e.g., -= ) or a roman equivalent (e.g., ni).
    With this approach, the English sound K corresponds to one of t (ka), (ki), (ku), (ke), or (ko), depending on its cont
