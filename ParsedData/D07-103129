cy and VI of EM is comparatively low.
			We showed that either by using a suitable Bayesian prior or by simply reducing the number of hidden states it is possible to significantly improve both the 1-to-1 accuracy and the VI score, achieving a 1-to-1 tagging accuracy of 46%.
			We also showed that EM and other estimators take much longer to converge than usually thought, and often require several hundred iterations to achieve optimal performance.
			We also found that there is considerable variance in the performance of all of these estimators, so in general multiple runs fromdifferent random starting points are necessary in or der to evaluate an estimator?s performance.
			Finally, there may be more sophisticated ways of improving the 1-to-1 accuracy and VI score thanthe relatively crude methods used here that primarily reduce the number of available states.
			For example, we might obtain better performance by us ing EM to infer an HMM with a large number of states, and then using some kind of distributional
