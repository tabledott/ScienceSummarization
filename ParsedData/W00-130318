th is employed in the dependency structure analysis.
    However, the result is against our intuition.
    They report that a beam width between 3 and 10 gives the best parsing accuracy, and parsing accuracy falls down with a width larger than 10.
    This result suggests that Japanese dependency structures may consist of a series of local optimization processes.
    We evaluate the relationship between the beam width and the parsing accuracy.
    Table 5 shows their relationships under the condition d = 3, along with the changes of the beam width from k = 1 to 15.
    The best parsing accuracy is achieved at k = 5 and the best sentence accuracy is achieved at k = 5 and k = 7.
    We have to consider how we should set the beam width that gives the best parsing accuracy.
    We believe that the beam width that gives the best passing accuracy is related not only with the length of the sentence, but also with the lexical entries and parts-of-speech that comprise the chunks.
    Instead of learning a single class
