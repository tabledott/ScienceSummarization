    Therefore, considering the trade-off between applicability and precision, it seems better to rely on a significantly larger monolingual corpus than on a smaller bilingual corpus.
    An optimal method may exploit both types of corpora, in which the somewhat more accurate, but more expensive, data of a bilingual corpus are augmented by the data of a much larger monolingual corpus.13 quantities of shallow information.
