1986) model, Polanyi (1988) proposes that DCUs (analogous to segments) are structured as a tree, and in both models, the tree structure of discourse constrains how the discourse evolves, and how referring expressions are processed.
    Recent work (Moore and Paris 1993; Moore and Pollack 1992) has argued that to account for explanation dialogues, it is necessary to independently model both RST relations and intentions.
    Researchers have begun to investigate the ability of humans to agree with one another on segmentation, and to propose methodologies for quantifying their findings.
    The types of discourse units being coded and the relations among them vary.
    Several studies have used trained coders to locally and globally structure spontaneous or read speech using the model of Grosz and Sidner (1986), including Grosz and Hirschberg 1992; Nakatani, Hirschberg, and Grosz 1995; Stifleman 1995; Hirschberg and Nakatani 1996.
    In Grosz and Hirschberg (1992), percent agreement (see Section 3.2) among 7 co
