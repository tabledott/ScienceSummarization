  Japanese Discourse and the Process of Centering Mar i lyn  Walker* University of Pennsylvania Sharon  Cotes University of Pennsylvania Masayo  I ida t Stanford University This paper has three aims: (1) to generalize a computational ccount of the discourse process called CENTERING, (2) to apply this account o discourse processing in Japanese so that it can be used in computational systems for machine translation or language understanding, and (3) to provide some insights on the effect of syntactic factors in Japanese on discourse interpretation.
  We argue that while discourse interpretation is an inferential process, syntactic ues constrain this process; we demonstrate his argument with respect o the interpretation of ZEROS, unexpressed arguments of the verb, in Japanese.
  The syntactic ues in Japanese discourse that we investigate are the morphological markers for grammatical TOPIC, the postposition wa, as well as those for grammatical functions uch as SUBJECT, ga, OBJECT, o and OBJECT2, ni.
