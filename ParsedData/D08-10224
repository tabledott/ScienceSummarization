iu et al., 2006; Mi et al., 2008), which is also 0.5 points better than (and twice as fast as) extracting on 30-best parses.
    When combined with our previous orthogonal work on forest-based decoding (Mi et al., 2008), the forest-forest approach achieves a 2.5 BLEU points improvement over the baseline, and even outperforms the hierarchical system of Hiero, one of the best-performing systems to date.
    Besides tree-to-string systems, our method is also applicable to other paradigms such as the string-totree models (Galley et al., 2006) where the rules are in the reverse order, and easily generalizable to pairs of forests in tree-to-tree models.
  
  
    We review in this section the tree-based approach to machine translation (Liu et al., 2006; Huang et al., 2006), and its rule extraction algorithm (Galley et al., 2004; Galley et al., 2006).
    Current tree-based systems perform translation in two separate steps: parsing and decoding.
    The input string is first parsed by a parser into a 1-best tree, wh
