nts and subjective expressions (Choi et al., 2005).
  The source of a speech event is the speaker; the source of a subjective expression is the experiencer of the private state.
  The source identifier is trained on the MPQA Opinion Corpus3 using a variety of features.
  Because the source identifier re- lies on dependency parse information, it is currently only available in batch mode.
  2.3.4 Sentiment Expression Classification The final component uses two classifiers to iden- tify words contained in phrases that express pos- itive or negative sentiments (Wilson et al., 2005).
  3The MPQA Opinion Corpus can be freely obtained at http://nrrc.mitre.org/NRRC/publications.htm.
  The first classifier focuses on identifying sentiment expressions.
  The second classifier takes the senti- ment expressions and identifies those that are pos- itive and negative.
  Both classifiers were developed using BoosTexter (Schapire and Singer, 2000) and trained on the MPQA Corpus.
