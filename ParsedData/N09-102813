e, which is put after any other modifiers.
    For both verb and adjective precedence rules, we also apply some heuristics to prevent excessive movements.
    In order to do this, we disallow any movement across punctuation and conjunctions.
    Therefore, for sentences like &#8220;John hit the ball but Sam threw the ball&#8221;, the reordering result would be &#8220;John the ball hit but Sam the ball threw&#8221;, instead of &#8220;John the ball but Sam the ball threw hit&#8221;.
    In Korean, when a noun is modified by a prepositional phrase, such as in &#8220;the way to happiness&#8221;, the prepositional phrase is usually moved in front of the noun, resulting in &#8220;q (happiness) &#176; 71at= 7J (to the way)&#8221; .
    Similarly for relative clause modifier, it is also reordered to the front of the head noun.
    For preposition head node with an object modifier, &#8364; %1901 9 ZL tig N 4 &#176;1844 . the order is the object first and the preposition last.
    One example is &#8220;with a bat&#8221
