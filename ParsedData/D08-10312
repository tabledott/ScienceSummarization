tested on systems with features whose strength has not been established, and compared to weak pairwise baselines.
    As a result, it is possible that some modeling innovations may have less impact or applicability when applied to a stronger baseline system.
    This paper introduces a rather simple but stateof-the-art system, which we intend to be used as a strong baseline to evaluate the impact of structural innovations.
    To this end, we combine an effective coreference classification model with a strong set of features, and present an ablation study to show the relative impact of a variety of features.
    As we show, this combination of a pairwise model and strong features produces a 1.5 percentage point increase in B-Cubed F-Score over a complex model in the state-of-the-art system by Culotta et al. (2007), although their system uses a complex, non-pairwise model, computing features over partial clusters of mentions.
