tistical measures.
    For this purpose, a suitable statistical function needs to indicate the strength of cooccurrence correlation between source and target words, which we assume is indicative of carrying the same semantic content.
    Our preferred choice of statistical measure for assigning the costs is the 0 correlation measure (Gale and Church 1991).
    We apply this statistic to co-occurrence of the source word with all its possible translations in the data set examples.
    We have found that, at least for our data, this measure leads to better performance than the use of the log probabilities of target words given source words (cf.
    Brown et al. 1993).
    In addition to the correlation measure, the cost for a pairing includes a distance measure component that penalizes pairings proportionately to the difference between the (normalized) positions of the source and target words in their respective sentences.
    As noted earlier, dependency transduction models are generative probabilistic models;
