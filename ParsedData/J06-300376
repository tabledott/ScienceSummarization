reflect the actual distribution of the classes in a real corpus.
    Classification with 30 distinct classes is a hard problem.
    To make the task easier, we can collapse the 30 classes to 5 classes, using the grouping that is given in Table 19.
    For example, agent and beneficiary both collapse to participant.
    On the 30 class problem, LRA with the single nearest neighbor algorithm achieves an accuracy of 39.8% (239/600) and a macroaveraged F of 36.6%.
    Always guessing the majority class would result in an accuracy of 8.2% (49/600).
    On the 5 class problem, the accuracy is 58.0% (348/600) and the macroaveraged F is 54.6%.
    Always guessing the majority class would give an accuracy of 43.3% (260/600).
    For both the 30 class and 5 class problems, LRA&#8217;s accuracy is significantly higher than guessing the majority class, with 95% confidence, according to the Fisher Exact Test (Agresti 1990).
    Table 20 shows the performance of LRA and VSM on the 30 class problem.
