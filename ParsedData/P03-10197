nterpretation of the Schr&#168;oder numbers is given in (Knuth, 1973): The number of permutations that can be sorted with an output-restricted doubleended queue (deque) is exactly the large Schr&#168;oder number.
    Additionally, Knuth presents an approximation for the large Schr&#168;oder numbers: where c is set to 2 &#65533;(3&#8730;2 &#8722; 4)/&#960;.
    This approximation function confirms the result of Schr&#168;oder, and we obtain Sn &#8712; o((3 + &#8730;8)n), i.e. the Schr&#168;oder numbers grow like (3 + &#8730;8)n &#8776; 5.83n.
    In this section, we will describe the IBM constraints (Berger et al., 1996).
    Here, we mark each position in the source sentence either as covered or uncovered.
    In the beginning, all source positions are uncovered.
    Now, the target sentence is produced from bottom to top.
    A target position must be aligned to one of the first k uncovered source positions.
    The IBM constraints are illustrated in Fig.
    2.
    For most of the target positions there are
