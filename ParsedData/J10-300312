all possible verbalizations that can convey the same semantic content.
    This may unfairly penalize translation hypotheses that have the same meaning but use n-grams that are not present in the reference.
    For example, the given system output S will not have a high score against the reference R even though it conveys precisely the same semantic content: S: We must consider the entire community.
    R: We must bear in mind the community as a whole.
    One solution is to use multiple reference translations, which is expensive.
    An alternative solution, tried in a number of recent approaches, is to address this issue by allowing the evaluation process to take into account paraphrases of phrases in the reference translation so as to award credit to parts of the translation hypothesis that are semantically, even if not lexically, correct (Owczarzak et al. 2006; Zhou, Lin, and Hovy 2006).
    In evaluation of document summarization, automatically generated summaries (peers) are also evaluated against refer
