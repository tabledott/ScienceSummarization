heir usefulness as resources for NLP such as machine translation is limited for the time being.
    It is therefore important to extract sentence alignments that are as literal as possible.
    To achieve this, a reliable measure of the validity of sentence alignments is necessary.
  
  
    We adopt a standard strategy to align articles and sentences.
    First, we use a method based on CLIR to align Japanese and English articles (Collier et al., 1998; Matsumoto and Tanaka, 2002) and then a method based on DP matching to align Japanese and English sentences (Gale and Church, 1993; Utsuro et al., 1994) in these articles.
    As each of these methods uses existing NLP techniques, we describe them briefly focusing on basic similarity measures, which we will compare with our proposed measures in Section 5.
    We first convert each of the Japanese articles into a set of English words.
    We use ChaSen1 to segment each of the Japanese articles into words.
    We next extract content words, which are then transla
