&#8217;s lives.
    Instead, they discovered that most of the complex paraphrases&#8212;ones with alternations more interesting than simple lexical synonymy and local syntactic changes&#8212; exhibited varying degrees of semantic divergence.
    For example: Therefore, in order to be able to create a richer paraphrase corpus, one with many complex alternations, the instructions to the annotators had to be relaxed; the degree of mismatch accepted before a sentence pair was judged to be fully semantically divergent (or &#8220;non-equivalent&#8221;) was left to the human subjects.
    It is also reported that, given the idiosyncratic nature of each sentence pair, only a few formal guidelines were generalizable enough to take precedence over the subjective judgments of the human annotators.
    Despite the somewhat loosely defined guidelines, the inter-annotator agreement for the task was 84%.
    However, a kappa score of 62 indicated that the task was overall a difficult one (Cohen 1960).
    At the end, 67% of
