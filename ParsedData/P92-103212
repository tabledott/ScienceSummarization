ay not be very representative of the general vocabulary.
    Zernik (1990, p. 27), for example, reports 70% performance for the word interest, and then acknowledges that this level of performance may not generalize very well to other words.4 Although we agree with Zernik's prediction that interest is not very representative of other words, we suspect that interest is actually more difficult than most other words, not less difficult.
    Table 1 shows the performance of Yarowsky (1992) on twelve words which have been previously discussed in the literature.
    Note that interest is at the bottom of the list.
    The reader should exercise some caution in interpreting the numbers in Table 1.
    It is natural to try to use these numbers to predict performance on new words, but the study was not designed for that purpose.
    The test words were selected from the literature in order to make comparisons over systems.
    If the study had been intended to support predictions on new words, then the study should hav
