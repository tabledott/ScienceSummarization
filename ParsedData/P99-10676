er work also on the co-occurrence assumption (Fung &amp; Yee, 1998; Fung &amp; McKeown, 1997).
    By presupposing a lexicon of seed words, she avoids the prohibitively expensive computational effort encountered by Rapp (1995).
    The method described here &#8212; although developed independently of Fung's work &#8212; goes in the same direction.
    Conceptually, it is a trivial case of Rapp's matrix permutation method.
    By simply assuming an initial lexicon the large number of permutations to be considered is reduced to a much smaller number of vector comparisons.
    The main contribution of this paper is to describe a practical implementation based on the co-occurrence clue that yields good results.
  
  
    As mentioned above, it is assumed that across languages there is a correlation between the cooccurrences of words that are translations of each other.
    If &#8212; for example &#8212; in a text of one language two words A and B co-occur more often than expected by chance, then in a text of anot
