not, &#954;S&amp;C should be reported too, as well as a third measure that corrects for prevalence, as suggested in Byrt, Bishop, and Carlin (1993).
  
  
    P(E) is the probability of agreement among coders due to chance.
    The literature describes two different methods for estimating a probability distribution for random assignment of categories.
    In the first, each coder has a personal distribution, based on that coder&#8217;s distribution of categories (Cohen 1960).
    In the second, there is one distribution for all coders, derived from the total proportions of categories assigned by all coders (Scott 1955; Fleiss 1971; Krippendorff 1980; Siegel and Castellan 1988).1 We now illustrate the computation of P(E) according to these two methods.
    We will then show that the resulting &#954;Co and &#954;S&amp;C may straddle one of the significant thresholds used to assess the raw &#954; values.
    The assumptions underlying these two methods are made tangible in the way the data are visualized, in a c
