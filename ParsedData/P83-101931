  The self-correction system I have described suggests that many non-fluent strings can be resolved with little detailed linguistic knowledge.
    As Table 1 shows, about a quarter of the editing signals result in expunction of only non-linguistic material.
    This requires only an ability to distinguish linguistic from nonlinguistic stuff, and it introduces the idea that edit signals signal an expunction site.
    Almost a third are resolved by the Surface Copying rule, which can be viewed simply as an instance of the general non-linguistic rule that multiple instances of the same thing count as a single instance.
    The category copying rules are generalizations of simple copying, applied to a knowledge of linguistic categories.
    Making the transition from surface copies to category copies is aided by the fact that there is considerable overlap in coverage, defining a path of expanding generalization.
    Thus at the earliest stages of learning, only the simplest, non-linguistic self-correction rules w
