    Supertagging has the potential to benefit more from Gaussian smoothing than POS tagging because the feature space is sparser by virtue of the much larger tagset.
    Gaussian smoothing would also allow us to incorporate rare longer range dependencies as features, without risk of overfitting.
    This may further boost supertagger performance.
  
  
    This paper has demonstrated, both analytically and empirically, that GIS does not require a correction feature Eliminating the correction feature simplifies further the already very simple estimation algorithm.
    Although GIS is not as fast as some alternatives, such as conjugate gradient and limited memory variable metric methods (Malouf, 2002), our C&amp;C POS tagger takes less than 10 minutes to train, and the space requirements are modest, irrespective of the size of the tagset.
    We have also shown that using a Gaussian prior on the parameters of the ME model improves performance over a simple frequency cutoff.
    The Gaussian prior effec
