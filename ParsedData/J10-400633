6).
    In DM, matricization is applied to labeled tensors and it is the fundamental operation for turning the third-order tensor representing the weighted tuple structure into matrices whose row and column vector spaces correspond to the linguistic objects we want to study; that is, the outcome of matricization must be labeled matrices.
    Therefore, we must define an operation of labeled mode-n matricization.
    Recall from earlier discussion that when mode-n matricization is applied, the n-th index becomes the row index of the resulting matrix, and the corresponding labels do not need to be updated.
    The problem is to determine the labels of the column index of the resulting matrix.
    We saw that the columns of the matrix produced by mode-n matricization are the mode-n fibers of the original tensor.
    We must therefore assign a proper label to mode-n tensor fibers.
    A mode-n fiber is obtained by fixing the values of two indices, and by taking the tensor entries corresponding to the full range o
