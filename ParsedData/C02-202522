 the set, the expected accu- racy of guessing at random, and the accuracy of the Com- bined model.
  We can see that the parse ranking accuracy is decreasing quickly and more powerful models will be needed to achieve good accuracy for highly ambiguous sentences.

  (1999) estimate a Stochastic Unification Based Grammar (SUBG) using a log-linear model.
  The features they include in the model are not limited to production rule features but also ad- junct and argument and other linguistically motivated features.
