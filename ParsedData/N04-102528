ood correlation with difficulty for at least two languages, English and French, with the only algorithm difference being a change in the morphology handling during feature processing.
    We also showed that the Smoothed Unigram method is robust for short passages and Web documents.
    Some traditional variables like type/token ratio gave excellent correlation with difficulty on commercial leveled passages, but the same statistics performed inconsistently on Web-based test sets.
    In contrast, the Smoothed Unigram method had good accuracy across all test sets.
    The problem of reading difficulty prediction lies in an interesting region between classification and regression, with close connections to ordinal regression (MacCullagh, 1980) and discriminative ranking models (Crammer and Singer, 2001).
    While simple methods like modified na&#239;ve Bayes give reasonably good results, more sophisticated techniques may give more accurate predictions, especially at lower grades, where vocabulary progress is m
