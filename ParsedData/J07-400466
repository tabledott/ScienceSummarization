ore for a conjunctive node, &#968;c, is the outside score for its disjunctive node mother: The calculation of the outside score for a disjunctive node, &#968;d, is a little more involved; it is defined as a sum over the conjunctive mother nodes, of the product of the outside score of the mother, the inside score of the disjunctive node sister, and the feature weights on the mother.
    For example, the outside score of d4 in Figure 4 is the sum of two product terms.
    The first term is the product of the outside score of c5, the inside score of d5, and the feature weights at c5; and the second term is the product of the outside score of c2, the inside score of d3, and the feature weights at c2.
    The definition is as follows; the outside score for a root disjunctive node is 1, otherwise: The normalization constant ZS is the sum of the inside scores for the root disjunctive nodes: In order to calculate inside scores, the scores for daughter nodes need to be calculated before the scores for mother nodes (an
