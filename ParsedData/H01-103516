e- sult for translingual-grammar-based NP bracketing, and especially promising given that no word segmentation (only raw characters) were used.
  For French, the increase from 59% to 91% F-measure for the stand-alone induced bracketer shows that the training algo- rithm is able to generalize successfully from the noisy raw projec- tion data, distilling a reasonably accurate (and transferable) model of baseNP structure from this high degree of noise.
  NAMED ENTITY TAGGER INDUCTION Multilingual named entity tagger induction is based on the ex- tended combination of the part-of-speech and noun-phrase brac- keting frameworks.
  The entity class tags used for this study were FNAME, LNAME, PLACE and OTHER (other entities including or- ganizations).
  They were derived from an anonymously donated MUC-6 named entity tagger applied to the English side of the French- English Canadian Hansards data.
  Initial classification proceeds on a per-word basis, using an ag- gressively smoothed transitive projection model simil
