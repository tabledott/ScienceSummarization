0% is obtained by adapting the WSJ model to Broadcast News (BN) text.
    Overall, the MEMM capitalizer adapted to BN data achieves 60% relative improvement in accuracy over the 1-gram baseline.
    The paper is organized as follows: the next section frames automatic capitalization as a sequence labeling problem, presents previous approaches as well as the widespread and highly sub-optimal 1gram capitalization technique that is used as a baseline in most experiments in this work and others.
    The MEMM sequence labeling technique is briefly reviewed in Section 3.
    Section 4 describes the MAP adaptation technique used for the capitalization of out-of-domain text.
    The detailed mathematical derivation is presented in Appendix A.
    The experimental results are presented in Section 5, followed by conclusions and suggestions for future work.
  
  
    Automatic capitalization can be seen as a sequence tagging problem: each lower-case word receives a tag that describes its capitalization form.
