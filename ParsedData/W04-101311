AD LCS precision (Plcs-MEAD) as follows: We can rewrite Equation (9) in terms of Rlcs-MEAD and Plcs-MEAD with a constant parameter &#223; = 1 as follows: Equation 12 shows that normalized pairwise LCS as defined in Radev et al.
    (2002) and implemented in MEAD is also a F-measure with &#223; = 1.
    Sentencelevel normalized pairwise LCS is the same as ROUGE-L with &#223; = 1.
    Besides setting &#223; = 1, summary-level normalized pairwise LCS is different from ROUGE-L in how a sentence gets its LCS score from its references.
    Normalized pairwise LCS takes the best LCS score while ROUGE-L takes the union LCS score.
  
  
    LCS has many nice properties as we have described in the previous sections.
    Unfortunately, the basic LCS also has a problem that it does not differentiate LCSes of different spatial relations within their embedding sequences.
    For example, given a reference sequence X and two candidate sequences Y1 and Y2 as follows: Y1 and Y2 have the same ROUGE-L score.
    However, in thi
