s that they are typically less robust, which Kaplan et al. address by developing a &#8220;fragment&#8221; grammar, together with a &#8220;skimming mode,&#8221; which increases coverage on Section 23 of the Penn Treebank from 80% to 100%.
    Kaplan et al. also present speed figures for their parser, comparing with the Collins parser.
    Comparing parser speeds is difficult because of implementation and accuracy differences, but their highest reported speed is around 2 sentences per second on sentences from Section 23.
    The parse speeds that we present in Section 10.3 are an order of magnitude higher.
    More generally, the literature on statistical parsing using linguistically motivated grammar formalisms is large and growing.
    Statistical parsers have been developed for TAG (Chiang 2000; Sarkar and Joshi 2003), LFG (Riezler et al. 2002; Kaplan et al.
    2004; Cahill et al. 2004), and HPSG (Toutanova et al.
