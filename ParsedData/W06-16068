ll outside the projected span, then those children give rise to rules that have variables.
    For example, if the tuple shown in Figure 2 is in our training corpus, for the foreign/source phrases FRANCE, FRANCE AND, FRANCE AND RUSSIA, and ASTRO- -NAUTS, we extract the minimally syntactified, lexicalized phrase-based-compatible xRS rules r5, r6, r2, and r7 in Figure 1, respectively.
    Because, as in phrase-based MT, all our rules have continuous phrases on both the source and target language sides, we call these phrase-based compatible xRS rules.
    Since these lexicalized rules are not sufficient to explain an entire (7r, F, A) tuple, we also extract the required minimal/necessary, non-lexicalized xRS rules.
    The minimal non-lexicalized rules that are licensed by the tuple in Figure 2 are labeled r4, r9, r10, r11 and r12 in Figure 1.
    To obtain the non-lexicalized xRS rules, we compute the set of all minimal rules (lexicalized and non-lexicalized) by applying the algorithm proposed by Galley et al.
