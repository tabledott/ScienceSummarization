 span can futher improve the performance by ~1.2 in F-measure6.
			This suggests the usefulness of extending the tree span beyond SPT for the ?predicate-linked?
			tree span category.
			In the future work, we will further explore expanding the dynamic tree span beyond SPT for the remaining tree span categories.
			6 Significance test shows that the dynamic tree span per-.
			forms s tatistically significantly better than SPT with p values smaller than 0.05.
