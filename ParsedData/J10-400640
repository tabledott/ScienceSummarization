extracted in the word&#8211;link&#8211;word&#8211;score format, which is customary in many structured DSMs.
    Labeled matricization can then simply be obtained by concatenating two elements in the original triple to build the corresponding matrix&#8212;again, a common step in building a structured DSM.
    In spite of being cost-free in terms of implementation, the mathematical formalism of labeled tensors highlights the common core shared by different views of the semantic space, thereby making distributional semantics more general.
  
  
    As will be clear in the next sections, the ways in which we tackle specific tasks are, by themselves, mostly not original.
    The main element of novelty is the fact that methods originally developed to resort to ad hoc distributional spaces are now adapted to fit into the unified DM framework.
    We will point out connections to related research specific to the various tasks in the sections devoted to describing their reinterpretation in DM.
