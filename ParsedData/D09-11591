  Retrieving this information and analyzing this content are impossible tasks if they were to be manually done.
    However, advances in machine learning and natural language processing present us with a unique opportunity to automate the decoding of consumers&#8217; opinions from online reviews.
    Previous works on mining opinions can be divided into two directions: sentiment classification and sentiment related information extraction.
    The former is a task of identifying positive and negative sentiments from a text which can be a passage, a sentence, a phrase and even a word (Somasundaran et al., 2008; Pang et al., 2002; Dave et al., 2003; Kim and Hovy, 2004; Takamura et al., 2005).
    The latter focuses on extracting the elements composing a sentiment text.
