 service, location and rooms, respectively.
    The remaining sentences were not relevant to any of the rated aspects.
    We compared two models.
    The first model uses the first three topics of MAS to extract relevant mentions based on the probability of that topic/aspect being present in the sentence.
    To obtain these probabilities we used estimators based on the proportion of words in the sentence assigned to an aspects&#8217; topic and normalized within local topics.
    To improve the reliability of the estimator we produced 100 samples for each document while keeping assignments of the topics to all other words in the collection fixed.
    The probability estimates were then obtained by averaging over these samples.
    We did not perform any model selection on the basis of the hand-labeled data, and tested only a single model of each type.
    For the second model we trained a maximum entropy classifier, one per each aspect, using 10-fold cross validation and unigram/bigram features.
