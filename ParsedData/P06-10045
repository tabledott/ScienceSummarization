ational techniques for finding the optimal partitioning are also quite different.
    Since the minimization of the normalized cut is NP-complete in the general case, researchers in vision have to approximate this computation.
    Fortunately, we can find an exact solution due to the linearity constraint on text segmentation.
  
  
    Linguistic research has shown that word repetition in a particular section of a text is a device for creating thematic cohesion (Halliday and Hasan, 1976), and that changes in the lexical distributions usually signal topic transitions.
    Figure 1 illustrates these properties in a lecture transcript from an undergraduate Physics class.
    We use the text Dotplotting representation by (Church, 1993) and plot the cosine similarity scores between every pair of sentences in the text.
    The intensity of a point (i, j) on the plot indicates the degree to which the i-th sentence in the text is similar to the j-th sentence.
    The true segment boundaries are denoted by vertical li
