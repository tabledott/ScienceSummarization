 our evaluations.
    For each of the 4 debates in our test set, we use posts with at least 5 sentences for evaluation.
    We implemented two baselines: the OpTopic system that uses topic information only, and the OpPMI system that uses topic as well as related word (noun) information.
    All systems use the same lexicon, as well as exactly the same processes for opinion finding and opinion-target pairing.
    The OpTopic system This system considers only explicit mentions of the topic for the opinion analysis.
    Thus, for this system, the step of opinion-target pairing only finds all topic+1 , topic= , topic+2 , topic2 instances in the post (where, for example, an instance of topic+1 is a positive opinion whose target is explicitly topic1).
    The polarity-topic pairs are counted for each debate side according to the following equations.
    The post is assigned the side with the higher score.
    The OpPMI system This system finds opiniontarget pairs for not only the topics, but also for the words in t
