or the remainder of this paper, the window size, w, will be set to five words as a compromise; this setting is large enough to show some of the constraints between verbs and arguments, but not so large that it would wash out constraints that make use of strict adjacency.3 Since the association ratio becomes unstable when the counts are very small, we will not discuss word pairs with f (x,y) 5.
    An improvement would make use of t-scores, and throw out pairs that were not significant.
    Unfortunately, this requires an estimate of the variance off (x,y), which goes beyond the scope of this paper.
    For the remainder of this paper, we will adopt the simple but arbitrary threshold, and ignore pairs with small counts.
    Technically, the association ratio is different from mutual information in two respects.
    First, joint probabilities are supposed to be symmetric: P(x, y) = P( y, x), and thus, mutual information is also symmetric: I(x, y) = I(y, x).
    However, the association ratio is not symmetric, s
