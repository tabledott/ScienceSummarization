eated as an NCC: Induce two translation models, a trial translation model that involves the candidate NCC and a base translation model that does not.
    If the value of the objective function is higher in the trial model than in the base model, then the NCC is valid; otherwise it is not.
    In theory, this test can be repeated for each sequence of words in the text.
    In practice, texts contain an enormous number of word sequences (Brown et al., 1992), only a tiny fraction of which are NCCs, and it takes considerable computational effort to induce each translation model.
    Therefore, it is necessary to test many NCCs on each pair of translation models.
    Suppose we induce a trial translation model from texts E and F involving a number of NCCs in the language S of E, and compare it to a base translation model without any of those NCCs.
    We would like to keep the NCCs that caused a net increase in the objective function I and discard those that caused a net decrease.
    We need some method of assign
