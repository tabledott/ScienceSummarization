n groups of words.
    As experiments have shown it is difficult to handle different word order and the translation of compound nouns.
    In this paper, we will describe two methods for statistical machine translation extending the baseline alignment model in order to account for these problems.
    In section 2, we shortly review the single-word based approach described in (Tillmann et al., 1997) with some recently implemented extensions allowing for one-to-many alignments.
    In section 3 we describe the alignment template approach which explicitly models shallow phrases and in doing so tries to overcome the above mentioned restrictions of singleword alignments.
    The described method is an improvement of (Och and Weber, 1998), resulting in an improved training and a faster search organization.
    The basic idea is to model two different alignment levels: a phrase level alignment between phrases and a word level alignment between single words within these phrases.
