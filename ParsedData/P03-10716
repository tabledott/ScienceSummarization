ted in our case: while our data does not have the same kind of syntactic and rhetorical structure as written text, we nonetheless expect that information from the written transcription alone should provide indications about topic boundaries.
    In this section, we describe our work on LCseg, a topic segmenter based on lexical cohesion that can handle both speech and text, but that is especially designed to generate the lexical cohesion feature used in the feature-based segmentation described in Section 5.
    LCseg computes lexical chains, which are thought to mirror the discourse structure of the underlying text (Morris and Hirst, 1991).
    We ignore synonymy and other semantic relations, building a restricted model of lexical chains consisting of simple term repetitions, hypothesizing that major topic shifts are likely to occur where strong term repetitions start and end.
    While other relations between lexical items also work as cohesive factors (e.g. between a term and its super-ordinate), the work on
