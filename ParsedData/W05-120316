on, incorporating semantic information into the text similarity measure increases the likelihood of recognition significantly over the random baseline and over the lexical matching baseline.
    In the unsupervised setting, the best performance is achieved using a method that combines several similarity metrics into one, for an overall accuracy of 68.8%.
    When learning is used to find the optimal combination of metrics and optimal threshold, the highest accuracy of 71.5% is obtained by combining the similarity metrics and the lexical matching baseline together.
    For the entailment data set, although we do not explicitly check for entailment, the directional similarity computed for textual entailment recognition does improve over the random and lexical matching baselines.
    Once again, the combination of similarity metrics gives the highest accuracy, measured at 58.3%, with a slight improvement observed in the supervised setting, where the highest accuracy was measured at 58.9%.
