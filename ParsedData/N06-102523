    While the results given by using &#8216;the free encyclopedia that anyone can edit&#8217; are satisfactory, major improvements can come from developing efficient query strategies &#8211; i.e. a more refined disambiguation technique taking advantage of the context in which the queries (e.g. referring expressions) occur.
    Future work will include turning Wikipedia into an ontology with well defined taxonomic relations, as well as exploring its usefulness of for other NLP applications.
    We believe that an interesting aspect of Wikipedia is that it offers large coverage resources for many languages, thus making it a natural choice for multilingual NLP systems.
    Semantics plays indeed a role in coreference resolution.
    But semantic features are expensive to compute and the development of efficient methods is required to embed them into large scale systems.
    Nevertheless, we believe that exploiting semantic knowledge in the manner we described will assist the research on coreference resol
