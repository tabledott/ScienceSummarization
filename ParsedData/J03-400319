   Equations (3) and (4) of the current article made the independence assumption that each modifier is generated independently of the others (i.e., that the modifiers are generated independently of everything except P, H, and h).
    In general, however, the probability of generating each modifier could depend on any function of the previous modifiers, head/parent category, and headword.
    Moreover, if the top-down derivation order is fully specified, then the probability of generating a modifier can be conditioned on any structure that has been previously generated.
    The remainder of this article assumes that the derivation order is depth-first: that is, each modifier recursively generates the subtree below it before the next modifier is generated.
    (Figure 3 gives an example that illustrates this.)
    The models in Collins (1996) showed that the distance between words standing in head-modifier relationships was important, in particular, that it is important to capture a preference for right-branchi
