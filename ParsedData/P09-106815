entire verb with all of its arguments.
    A joint decision can be made such that a verb is added to a schema if both its subject and object are assigned to chains in the schema with high confidence.
    For instance, it may be the case that (Y pull over) scores well with the &#8216;police&#8217; chain in figure 3.
    However, the object of (pull over A) is not present in any of the other chains.
    Police pull over cars, but this schema does not have a chain involving cars.
    In contrast, (Y search) scores well with the &#8216;police&#8217; chain and (search X) scores well in the &#8216;defendant&#8217; chain too.
    Thus, we want to favor search instead of pull over because the schema is already modeling both arguments.
    This intuition leads us to our event relatedness function for the entire narrative schema N, not just one chain.
    Instead of asking which event slot (v, d) is a best fit, we ask if v is best by considering all slots at once: where CN is the set of chains in our narrative N. If (v
