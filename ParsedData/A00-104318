particular type of lexical links the word w has with words in the local context.
    After an importance score is computed for each word, each phrase in the 'sentence gets a score by adding up the scores of its children nodes in the parse tree.
    This score indicates how important the phrase is in the local context.
    Step 4: Corpus evidence.
    The program uses a corpus consisting of sentences reduced by human professionals and their corresponding original sentences to compute how likely humans remove a certain phrase.
    The system first parsed the sentences in the corpus using ESG parser.
    It then marked which subtrees in these parse trees (i.e., phrases in the sentences) were removed by humans.
    Using this corpus of marked parse trees, we can compute how likely a subtree is removed from its parent node.
    For example, we can compute the probability that the &amp;quot;when&amp;quot; temporal clause is removed when the main verb is &amp;quot;give&amp;quot;, represented as Prob(&amp;quot;when-c
