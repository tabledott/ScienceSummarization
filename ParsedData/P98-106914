ithms all require parallel, translated texts as input.
    Attempts at exploring nonparallel corpora for terminology translation are very few (Rapp, 1995; Fung, 1995a; Fung and McKeown, 1997).
    Among these, (Rapp, 1995) proposes that the association between a word and its close collocate is preserved in any language. and (Fung and McKeown, 1997) suggests that the associations between a word and many seed words are also preserved in another language.
    In this paper, we have demonstrated that the associations between a word and its context seed words are well-preserved in nonparallel, comparable texts of different languages.
  
  
    Our algorithm is the first to have generated a collocation bilingual lexicon, albeit small, from a nonparallel, comparable corpus.
    We have shown that the algorithm has good precision, but the recall is low due to the difficulty in extracting unambiguous Chinese and English words.
    Better results can be obtained when the following changes are made: We will test the pre
