ognition with word segmentation and POS tagging.
    Atom segmentation, the bottom level of HHMM, is an initial step.
    Here, atom is defined to be the minimal segmentation unit that cannot be split in any stage.
    The atom consists of Chinese character, punctuation, symbol string, numeric expression and other non-Chinese char string.
    Any word is made up of an atom or more.
    Atom segmentation is to segment original text into atom sequence and it provides pure and simple source for its parent HMM.
    For instance, a sentence like &amp;quot;2002.9,ICTCLAS (6,nEh:gfFApRtti&amp;quot; (The free source codes of ICTCLAS was distributed in September, 2002) would be segmented as atom sequence &amp;quot;2002.9/,/ICTCLAS/&#65533;J/n/Eh/&#65533;/q/fF /44M/M/&#65533;/&amp;quot;.
    In this HMM, the original symbol is observation while the atom is state.
    We skip the detail of operation in that it's a simple application on the basis of HMM.
    POS tagging and role tagging using Viterbi are also skipped bec
