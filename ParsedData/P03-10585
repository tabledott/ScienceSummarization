n Table 2 for word sense disambiguation.
    We evaluated our approach on all the nouns in the English lexical sample task of SENSEVAL-2 (Edmonds and Cotton, 2001; Kilgarriff 2001), which used the WordNet 1.7 sense inventory (Miller, 1990).
    While our approach has only been tested on English and Chinese, it is completely general and applicable to other language pairs.
  
  
    Our approach of exploiting parallel texts for word sense disambiguation consists of four steps: (1) parallel text alignment (2) manual selection of target translations (3) training of WSD classifier (4) WSD of words in new contexts.
    In this step, parallel texts are first sentence-aligned and then word-aligned.
    Various alignment algorithms (Melamed 2001; Och and Ney 2000) have been developed in the past.
    For the six bilingual corpora that we used, they already come with sentences pre-aligned, either manually when the corpora were prepared or automatically by sentencealignment programs.
    After sentence alignment, the En
