  Nevertheless, in the rest of the results reported below, meronymy and hypernymy were used.
  g lobal  nhyp  is as good as local  nhyp.
  The average number of hypouyms or nhyp (c.f.
  formula 1) can be approximated in two ways.
  If an independent hyp is computed for every concept in WordNet we call it local nhyp.
  If instead, a unique nhyp is computed using the whole hierarchy, we have global nhyp.

  18 While local nhyp is the actual average for a given concept, global nhyp gives only an estimation.
  The results (c.f.
  figure 4) show that local nhyp performs only slightly better.
  Therefore global nhyp is favoured and was used in subsequent experiments.

  One could assume that the more context lhere is, the better the disambiguation results would be.
