    Further experiments showed that when combined with handcoded systems from NYU, the University of Manitoba, and IsoQuest, Inc., MENE was able to generate scores which exceeded the highest scores thus-far reported by any system on a MUC evaluation.
    Given appropriate training data, we believe that this system is highly portable to other domains and languages and have already achieved good results on upper-case English.
    We also feel that there are p
