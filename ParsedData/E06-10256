&#8220;opposite-orientation&#8221; edges, depending on the conjunctions extracted from the document set.
    A clustering algorithm then partitions the graph into a Positive cluster and a Negative cluster, based on a relation of similarity induced by the edges.
    Turney and Littman (2003) determine term orientation by bootstrapping from two small sets of subjective &#8220;seed&#8221; terms (with the seed set for Positive containing terms such as good and nice, and the seed set for Negative containing terms such as bad and nasty).
    Their method is based on computing the pointwise mutual information (PMI) of the target term t with each seed term ti as a measure of their semantic association.
    Given a target term t, its orientation value O(t) (where positive value means positive orientation, and higher absolute value means stronger orientation) is given by the sum of the weights of its semantic association with the seed positive terms minus the sum of the weights of its semantic association with the seed
