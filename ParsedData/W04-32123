tic positions.
    The PropBank annotation captures this regularity by assigning a semantic role label to each argument of the verb independently of its syntactic position.
    This means a fixed set of roles are specified for each verb and a different label is assigned to each role.
    In PropBank annotations, these roles are labeled with a sequence of integers, starting with 01 and prefixed with ARG.
    For example, the verb break, has four such numbered arguments: ARGO: the breaker, AR Cl: thing broken, ARC?
    : instrument and ARCS: pieces.
    It is worth pointing out that even though the same numbers (0-5) are used to label the semantic roles of all verbs, these roles can only be interpreted in a verb-specific 'There are some exceptions. manner.
    That is, an argument marked with the same number, e.g.
    ARG, may not share any semantic similarities for different verbs.
    In addition to the numbered arguments, which are considered to be core to a verb, there are also elements that are less closel
