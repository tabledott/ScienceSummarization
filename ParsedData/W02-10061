e of a word in a natural language text, the task of word sense disambiguation (WSD) is to determine the correct sense of in that context.
    WSD is a fundamental problem of natural language processing.
    For example, effective WSD is crucial for high quality machine translation.
    One could envisage building a WSD system using handcrafted rules or knowledge obtained from linguists.
    Such an approach would be highly laborintensive, with questionable scalability.
    Another approach involves the use of dictionary or thesaurus to perform WSD.
    In this paper, we focus on a corpus-based, supervised learning approach.
    In this approach, to disambiguate a word , we first collect training texts in which instances of occur.
    Each occurrence of is manually tagged with the correct sense.
    We then train a WSD classifier based on these sample texts, such that the trained classifier is able to assign the sense of in a new context.
