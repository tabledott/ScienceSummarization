    It follows that [[Desm]] c [[Q1]] n &#183; &#183; &#183; n [[Qm]] = {r}.
    But r E [[Desm]], so [[Desm]] = {r}.
    Theorem 2: Completeness of D&amp;RAtt Assume (1) Attributes have no overlapping Values (see Section 3.1), and (2) there are at most denumerably many Attributes and Values, and finitely many (one or more) distractors.
    Then if an object can be individuated by intersecting a finite number of properties, D&amp;RAtt will find such an intersection.
    Proof Given Assumption (1), if D&amp;R is complete, then so is D&amp;RAtt.
    To see this, let BV abbreviate FindBestValue(r,Ai).
    Suppose there is a Value Vi,j of Attribute Ai that leads to a distinguishing description whereas BV does not.
    Then a contradiction is derived as follows.
    For certain Vi,a1, .

    But Case (i) contradicts the definition of FindBestValue (se
