rniak, 2000).
			The data has been converted to dependency trees using head rules (Magerman, 1995; Collins, 1996).
			We are grateful to Ya mada and Matsumoto for letting us use their rule set, which is a slight modification of the rules used byCollins (1999).
			This permits us to make exact com parisons with the parser of Yamada and Matsumoto (2003), but also the parsers of Collins (1997) and Charniak (2000), which are evaluated on the same data set in Yamada and Matsumoto (2003).One problem that we had to face is that the standard conversion of phrase structure trees to de pendency trees gives unlabeled dependency trees, whereas our parser requires labeled trees.
			Since the annotation scheme of the Penn Treebank does notinclude dependency types, there is no straightfor ward way to derive such labels.
			We have therefore experimented with two different sets of labels, none of which corresponds to dependency types in a strict sense.
			The first set consists of the function tags forgrammatical roles accor
