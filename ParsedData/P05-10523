 using a kernel SVM (Support Vector Machine).
    We showed that adding sentence level word trigrams as global information to local dependency context boosted the performance of finding slot fillers for management succession events.
    This paper describes an extension of this approach to the identification of entity relations, in which syntactic information from sentence tokenization, parsing and deep dependency analysis is combined using kernel methods.
    At each level, kernel functions (or kernels) are developed to represent the syntactic information.
    Five kernels have been developed for this task, including two at the surface level, one at the parsing level and two at the deep dependency level.
    Our experiments show that each level of processing may contribute useful clues for this task, including surface information like word bigrams.
    Adding kernels one by one continuously improves performance.
    The experiments were carried out on the ACE RDR (Relation Detection and Recognition) task wit
