ut this work. which can be loosely viewed as a pointwise mutual information quantity.
    We can check that the objective logp(m, s, t; B) is equal to the weight of a matching plus some constant C: To find the optimal partial matching, edges with weight wz,7 &lt; 0 are set to zero in the graph and the optimal full matching is computed in 0((nS+nT)3) time using the Hungarian algorithm (Kuhn, 1955).
    If a zero edge is present in the solution, we remove the involved word types from the matching.6 Bootstrapping Recall that the E-step produces a partial matching of the word types.
    If too few word types are matched, learning will not progress quickly; if too many are matched, the model will be swamped with noise.
    We found that it was helpful to explicitly control the number of edges.
    Thus, we adopt a bootstrapping-style approach that only permits high confidence edges at first, and then slowly permits more over time.
    In particular, we compute the optimal full matching, but only retain the highest
