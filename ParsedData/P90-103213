us to filter out incorrect associations such as &amp;quot;blue-stocks&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;advancing-market&amp;quot; and replace them with the appropriate ones, &amp;quot;blue chip stocks,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;the broader market in the NYSE advancing issues.&amp;quot; This stage also produces phrasal templates such as those given in the previous section.
    In short, stage two filters inapropriate results and combines word pairs to produce multiple word combinations.
    To make the results directly usable for language generation we are currently investigating the use of a bottom-up parser in combination with stage two in order to classify the collocations according to syntactic criteria.
    For example if the lexical relation involves a noun and a verb it determines if it is a subject-verb or a verb-object collocation.
    We plan to do this using a determin'stic bottom up parser developed at Bell Communication Research [Abney 89] to parse the concordances.
    The parser would analyze each sentence of t
