			Inorder to measure how many of the LDD reentran cies in the gold-standard f-structures are captured correctly by our parsers, we developed evaluation software for f-structure LDD reentrancies (similar to Johnson?s (2002) evaluation to capture traces and their antecedents in trees).
			Table 9 shows the results with the integrated model achieving more than 76% correct LDD reentrancies.
	
	
			(Collins, 1999)?s Model 3 is limited to wh-traces in relative clauses (it doesn?t treat topicalisation, focus etc.).
			Johnson?s (2002) work is closest toours in spirit.
			Like our approach he provides a fi nite approximation of LDDs.
			Unlike our approach,however, he works with tree fragments in a post processing approach to add empty nodes and their DEP.
