ees in a packed forest structure.
    Feature forest models are maximum entropy models defined over feature forests.
    A dynamic programming algorithm is proposed for maximum entropy estimation without unpacking feature forests.
    Thus probabilistic modeling of any data structures is possible when they are represented by feature forests.
    This article also describes methods for representing HPSG syntactic structures and predicate&#8211;argument structures with feature forests.
    Hence, we describe a complete strategy for developing probabilistic models for HPSG parsing.
    The effectiveness of the proposed methods is empirically evaluated through parsing experiments on the Penn Treebank, and the promise of applicability to parsing of real-world sentences is discussed.
  
  
    Following the successful development of wide-coverage lexicalized grammars (Riezler et al. 2000; Hockenmaier and Steedman 2002; Burke et al.
    2004; Miyao, Ninomiya, and Tsujii 2005), statistical modeling of these grammars
