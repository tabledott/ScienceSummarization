lly spec- ified by hand.
  Moreover, in ma W cases it; is very important not to deviate from certain linguis- tic standards in generation, in which case hand- crafted grammars give excellent control.
  How- ever, in other applications tbr NLG the variety of the output is much bigger, and the demands on the quality of the output somewhat less strin- gent.
  A typical example is NLG in the con- text of (interlingua- or transthr-based) machine translation.
  Another reason for reb~xing the quality of the output may be that not enough time is available to develop a flfll grammar tbr a new target language in NLG.
  In all these cases, stochastic ("empiricist") methods pro- vide an alternative to hand-crafted ("rational- ist") approaches to NLG.
  To our knowledge, the first to use stochastic techniques in NLG were Langkilde and Knight (1998a) and (1998b).
  In this paper, we present FERGUS (Flexible Em- piricist/Rationalist Generation Using Syntax).
  FErtGUS follows Langkilde and Knights seminal work in using an
