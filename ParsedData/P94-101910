We need an algorithm for selecting the action verb.
    Following is a decision tree for translating English Change-of-state verbs into Chinese: A multi-domain approach We suggest that to achieve accurate lexical selection, it is necessary to have fine-grained selection restrictions that can be matched in a flexible fashion, and which can be augmented when necessary by context-dependent knowledge-based understanding.
    The underlying framework for both the selection restrictions on the verb arguments and the knowledge base should be a verb taxonomy that relates verbs with similar meanings by associating them with the same conceptual domains.
    We view a verb meaning as a lexicalized concept which is undecomposable.
    However, this semantic form can be projected onto a set of concepts in different conceptual domains.
    Langacker (Langacker, 1988) presents a set of basic domains used for defining a knife.
    It is possible to define an entity by using the size, shape, color, weight, functionality etc.
