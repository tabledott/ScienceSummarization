ries for building an automatic index for a document collection, can be used to classify a text, or may serve as a concise summary for a given document.
    Moreover, a system for automatic identification of important terms in a text can be used for the problem of terminology extraction, and construction of domain-specific dictionaries.
    The simplest possible approach is perhaps to use a frequency criterion to select the &#8220;important&#8221; keywords in a document.
    However, this method was generally found to lead to poor results, and consequently other methods were explored.
    The state-ofthe-art in this area is currently represented by supervised learning methods, where a system is trained to recognize keywords in a text, based on lexical and syntactic features.
    This approach was first suggested in (Turney, 1999), where parametrized heuristic rules are combined with a genetic algorithm into a system for keyphrase extraction - GenEx - that automatically identifies keywords in a document.
