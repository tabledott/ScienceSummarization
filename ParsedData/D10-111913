es all of the ways of splitting the logical expression into two parts, as described in Section 4.1.
    Section 4.2 describes how to construct syntactic categories that are consistent with the two new fragments of logical form and which will allow the new lexical items to recombine.
    Finally, Section 4.3 defines the full set of lexical entry pairs that can be created by splitting a lexical entry.
    As we will see, this splitting process is overly prolific for any single language and will yield many lexical items that do not generalize well.
    For example, there is nothing in our original lexical entry above that provides evidence that the split should pair &#8220;Vermont&#8221; with the constant vt and not Ax.next to(ny, x).
    Section 5 describes how we estimate the parameters of a probabilistic parsing model and how this parsing model can be used to guide the selection of items to add to the lexicon.
    The set of possible splits for a logical expression h is defined as the solution to a pair of hi
