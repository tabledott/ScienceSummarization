l LKBs.
    Ppr and Spr obtain comparable results, which is remarkable, given the simplicity of the Ppr algobaseline and the best results of supervised systems at competition time (SMUaw,GAMBL). rithm, compared to the more elaborate algorithm to construct the graph.
    The differences between methods are not statistically significant, which is a common problem on this relatively small datasets (Snyder and Palmer, 2004; Palmer et al., 2001).
    Regarding LKBs, the best results are obtained using WordNet 1.7 and eXtended WordNet.
    Here the differences are in many cases significant.
    These results are surprising, as we would expect that the manually disambiguated gloss relations from WordNet 3.0 would lead to better results, compared to the automatically disambiguated gloss relations from the eXtended WordNet (linked to version 1.7).
    The lower performance of WNet30+gloss can be due to the fact that the Senseval all words data set is tagged using WordNet 1.7 synsets.
