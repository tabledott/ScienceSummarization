regation as a separate text planning task.
    Chunking together input elements (to eliminate detail) or taking them apart (to be more detailed) has received scant mention &#8212; see Ellovy 871, and for the related problem of paraphrase see [Schank 75] &#8212; but this task should interact with text structuring in order to provide text that is both optimally detailed and coherent.
    At the present time, only about 20% of the RST relations have been formalized to the extent that they can be used by the structurer.
    This formalization process is difficult, because it goes handin-hand with the development of terms with which to characterize the relations' goals/constraints.
    Though the formalization can never be completely finalized &#8212; who can hope to represent something like motivation or justification complete with all ramifications?
    &#8212; the hope is that, by having the requirements stated in rather basic terms, the relations will be easily adaptable to any new representation scheme and do
