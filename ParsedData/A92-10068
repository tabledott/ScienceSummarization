of the system (though not the overall processing time).
    This can be crucial if multi-paragraph text is to be generated by an interface tool.
    In the Joyce system, the text planner cedes control to the sentence planner as soon as the text planner has defined a proposition.
    Once the sentence planner has constructed the DSyntR of a complete sentence, it sends it to the realizer which generates the English sentence.
    Thus, the first sentence is output by Joyce shortly after the text generator is invoked; text continues to be output approximately at reading speed.
    The effect is that a user of the text generator has the impression that he or she never has to wait for the system to respond, even when it is generating lengthy texts.
    Throughout the system, processing is message-driven in the sense of (McDonald et al 1987): control lies in the input, which is used to construct the next level of representation.
    There is no need for backtracking or feedback from one level of processing to an ear
