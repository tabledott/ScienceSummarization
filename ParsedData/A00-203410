ween 0 and We also experimented with euclidian distance, the LI norm, and cosine measures.
    The differences in performance of these measures were not statistically significant.
    1 which smooths p1(x) with p2(x) so that asri is always defined.
    We use the same value (0.99) for a as Lee.
    If a is set to 1 then this measure is equivalent to the Kulback-Liebler divergence.
  
  
    We experiment with a SCF lexicon produced from 19.3 million words of parsed text from the BNC (Leech, 1992).
    We used the causative and conative alternations, since these have enough candidates in our lexicon for experimentation.
    Evaluation is performed on verbs already filtered by the syntactic processing.
    The SCF acquisition system has been evaluated elsewhere (Briscoe and Carroll, 1997).
    We selected candidate verbs which occurred with 10 or more nominal argument heads at the target slots.
    The argument heads were restricted to those which can be classified in the WordNet hypernym hierarchy.
