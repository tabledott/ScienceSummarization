ution over (r, f, c, w) and factorizes according to the three stages as follows: p(r, f, c, w  |s) = p(r  |s)p(f  |r)p(c, w  |r, f, s) The following three sections describe each of these stages in more detail.
    The record choice model specifies a distribution over an ordered sequence of records r = (r1, ... , r|r|), where each record ri E s. This model is intended to capture two types of regularities in the discourse structure of language.
    The first is salience, that is, some record types are simply more prominent than others.
    For example, in the NFL domain, 70% of scoring records are mentioned whereas only 1% of punting records are mentioned.
    The second is the idea of local coherence, that is, the order in which one mentions records tend to follow certain patterns.
    For example, in the weather domain, the sky conditions are generally mentioned first, followed by temperature, and then wind speed.
    To capture these two phenomena, we define a Markov model on the record types (and given the
