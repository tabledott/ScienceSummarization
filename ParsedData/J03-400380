our models to use POS tags as word class information.
    Charniak&#8217;s model may be missing an important generalization in this respect.
    Charniak (2000) shows that using the POS tags as word class information in the model is important for parsing accuracy. c The coordination flag.
    This distinguishes, for example, coordination cases from appositives: Charniak&#8217;s model will have the same parameter&#8212;P(modifier| head, NP, NP)&#8212;in both of these cases. p, &#8710;,LC/RC The punctuation, distance, and subcategorization variables.
    It is difficult to tell without empirical tests whether these features are important. model are effectively decomposed into our L1 parameters (section 5.1), the head parameters, and&#8212;in models 2 and 3&#8212;the subcategorization and gap parameters.
    This decomposition allows our model to assign probability to rules not seen in training data: See section 7.4 for an extensive discussion. tures to encode preferences for right-branching structures.
