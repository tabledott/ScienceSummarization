    The weights are trained using minimum error rate training (Och, 2003) with BLEU score as the objective function.
    The dev and test data sets contain parts of the 2003, 2004 and 2005 Arabic NIST MT evaluation sets among other parallel data.
    The blind test data used is the &#8220;NIST&#8221; part of the 2006 Arabic-English NIST MT evaluation set, and is not included in the training data.
    For the first experiment we trained predictive class-based 5-gram models using clusterings with 64, 128, 256 and 512 clusters1 on the en target data.
    We then added these models as additional features to the log linear model of the Arabic-English machine translation system.
    The word-based language model used by the system in these experiments is a 5-gram model also trained on the en target data set.
    Table 1 shows the BLEU scores reached by the translation system when combining the different class-based models with the word-based model in comparison to the BLEU scores by a system using only the
