ties like polyunsaturatedfatty acids and erythromycin.
    The quantitative measurements we are directly interested in are those directly related to inhibition, such as IC50 and K(i).
    We tag the name of the measurement, the numerical value, and the unit.
    For example, in the phrase ...was inhibited by troleandomycin (ED50 = 1 microM), ED50 is the name, 1 the value, and microM the unit.
    We are also tagging other measurements, since it is easy to do and may provide valuable information for future IE work.
  
  
    As has been noted in the literature on biomedical IE (e.g., (Pustejovsky et al., 2002; Yakushiji et al., 2001)), the same relation can take a number of syntactic forms.
    For example, the family of words based on inhibit occurs commonly in MEDLINE abstracts about CYP enzymes (as in the example in the introduction) in patterns like A inhibited B, A inhibited the catalytic activity of B, inhibition of B by A, etc.
    Such alternations have led to the use of patternmatching rules (often ha
