n our experiments, it is always a log-linear function returning positive values: where &#952; is a learned, finite collection of weights and f is a corresponding collection of feature functions, some of which are used by Fm.
    (Note that fh is permitted to consult the observed input W. It also sees which factor Fm it is scoring, to support reuse of a single feature function fh and its weight &#952;h by unboundedly many factors in a model.)
    LINK.
    A family of unary soft factors that judge the links in a parse A individually.
    LINKij fires iff Lij = true, and then its value depends on (i, j), W, and &#952;.
    Our experiments use the same features as McDonald et al. (2005).
    A first-order (or &#8220;edge-factored&#8221;) parsing model (McDonald et al., 2005) contains only LINK factors, along with a global TREE or PTREE factor.
    Though there are O(n2) link factors (one per Lij), only n of them fire on any particular parse, since the global factor ensures that exactly n are true.
