sum is unspecified).
    The set of context vectors for the word to be disambiguated are then clustered, and the clusters are manually sense tagged.
    The features used in this work are complex and difficult to interpret and it isn't clear that this complexity is required.
    (Yarowsky, 1995) compares his method to (Schiitze, 1992) and shows that for four words the former performs significantly better in distinguishing between two senses.
    Other clustering approaches to word&#8212;sense disambiguation have been based on measures of semantic distance defined with respect to a semantic network such as WordNet.
    Measures of semantic distance are based on the path length between concepts in a network and are used to group semantically similar concepts (e.g.
    (Li, Szpakowicz, and Matwin, 1995)).
    (Resnik, 1995b) provides an information theoretic definition of semantic distance based on WordNet.
    (McDonald et al., 1990) apply another clustering approach to word&#8212;sense disambiguation (also see
