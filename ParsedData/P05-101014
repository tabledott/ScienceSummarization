ls on initializations, four instances of the same model were trained with different initial values of parameters.3 The model used in this experiment was created by CENTER-PARENT binarization and was set to 16.
    Table 1 lists training/heldout data loglikelihood per sentence (LL) for the four instances and their parsing performances on the test set (section 22).
    The parsing performances were obtained using the approximate distribution method in Section 3.2.
    Different initial values were shown to affect the results of training to some extent (Table 1).
    We compared four types of binarization.
    The original form is depicted in Figure 5 and the results are shown in Figure 6.
    In the first two methods, called CENTER-PARENT and CENTER-HEAD, the headfinding rules of Collins (1999) were used.
    We obtained an observable grammar for each model by reading off grammar rules from the binarized training trees.
    For each binarization method, PCFG-LA models with different numbers of latent annotation
