m the the prepositional phrase modification: term(+w,&lt;lex=a,..&gt;, X&amp;quot;and(woman(X), form(&lt;type=prep,lex=on&gt;, 1111(+w,term(+b,&lt;lex=a,..&gt;,. bus,_q2,_b)), -I) ) , _q1,_v).
    Informally, the form is resolved by applying its restriction, RR(.
    .
    . ) to an appropriate salient predicate, and instantiating the form's meta-variable, _f, with the result.
    In this case, the appropriate predicate might be inside, so that _f is instantiated to inside(+w,term(+b,&lt;lex=a,..&#8250;,bus,_q2,_b)).
    Tense: One way of treating tense is by means of a temporal relation form in the restriction of an event term.
    For John slept we might have: _s:sleep(term(+e,&lt;type=event&gt;, E-form(&lt;type=trel,tense=past&gt;, 11- and( event (E) ,R(E)) , _t) , _q1,_e), term(+j,&lt;type=name&gt;, J-name(J,'John'),_q2,_j)).
    4 Here we simplify the issues arising out of the semantics of intensional, sentential complement verbs like claim.
    Since the tense on the temporal relation category is past,
