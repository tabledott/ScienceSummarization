e similar values and n denotes the total number of senses for the word under consideration.
    The sense of the example with the minimum distance from the untagged usage is chosen: if there is more than one with the same distance, one is chosen at random to break the tie.
    Ng and Lee tested LEXAS on two separate data sets: one used previously in WSD research, the other a new, manually tagged, corpus.
    The common data set was the interest corpus constructed by Bruce and Wiebe (1994) consisting of 2,639 sentences from the Wall Street Journal, each containing an occurrence of the noun interest.
    Each occurrence is tagged with one of its six possible senses from LDOCE.
    Evaluation is carried out through 100 random trials, each trained on 1,769 sentences and tested on the 600 remaining sentences.
    The average accuracy was 87.4%, significantly higher than the figure of 78% reported by Bruce and Wiebe.
    Further evaluation was carried out on a larger data set constructed by Ng and Lee.
