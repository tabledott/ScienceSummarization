h taken by Li and Abe (1998), Ribas (1995), and McCarthy (2000).7 Resnik (1998) explains how this apparently crude technique works surprisingly well.
    Alternative approaches are described in Clark and Weir (1999) (see also Clark [2001]), Abney and Light (1999), and Ciaramita and Johnson (2000).
    In this section we show how to test whether p(v  |c', r) changes significantly when considering a node higher in the hierarchy.
    Consider the problem of deciding whether p(run  |(canine),subj) is a good approximation of p(run  |(dog),subj).
    ((canine) is the parent of (dog) in WordNet.)
    To do this, the probabilities p(run  |ci,subj) are compared using a chi-square test, where the ci are the children of (canine).
    In this case, the null hypothesis of the test is that the probabilities p(run  |ci,subj) are the same for each child ci.
    By judging the strength of the evidence against the null hypothesis, how similar the true probabilities are likely to be can be determined.
    If the test indicates
