    Agglomerative clustering (e.g., (Brown et al, 1992; Li, 1996)) can produce hierarchical word categories from an unannotated corpus.
    However, we are not aware of work in this direction that has been evaluated with good results on lexical category acquisition.
    The technique is also quite demanding computationally.
    The second main algorithmic approach is to use lexico-syntactic patterns.
    Patterns have been shown to produce more accurate results than feature vectors, at a lower computational cost on large corpora (Pantel et al, 2004).
    Hearst (1992) uses a manually prepared set of initial lexical patterns in order to discover hierarchical categories, and utilizes those categories in order to automatically discover additional patterns.
    (Berland and Charniak, 1999) use hand crafted patterns to discover part-of (meronymy) relationships, and (Chklovski and Pantel, 2004) discover various interesting relations between verbs.
    Both use information obtained by parsing.
