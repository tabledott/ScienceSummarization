 of Search and Learning Strategies: For the second set of experiments, we evaluate the effect of search methods, learning strategies, and beam width.
    We use feature set E for this set of experiments.
    Table 3 shows the error rates on the development data set with both left-to-right (L-to-R) and bidirectional (Bi-Dir) search methods.
    We also tested both aggressive learning and non-aggressive learning strategies with beam width of 1 and 3.
    First, with non-aggressive learning on bidirectional search, the error rate does not converge to a comparable number.
    This is due to the fact that the search space is too large in bidirectional search, if we do not use aggressive learning to constrain the samples for learning.
    With aggressive learning, the bidirectional approach always shows advantages over left-to-right search.
    However, the gap is not large.
    This is due to the fact that the accuracy of POS tagging is very high.
    As a result, we can always keep the gold-standard tags in the b
