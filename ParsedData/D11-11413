    We make the following contributions: LabeledLDA is applied, utilizing constraints based on an open-domain database (Freebase) as a source of supervision.
    This approach increases F1 score by 25% relative to co-training (Blum and Mitchell, 1998; Yarowsky, 1995) on the task of classifying named entities in Tweets.
    The rest of the paper is organized as follows.
    We successively build the NLP pipeline for Twitter feeds in Sections 2 and 3.
    We first present our approaches to shallow syntax &#8211; part of speech tagging (&#167;2.1), and shallow parsing (&#167;2.2).
    &#167;2.3 describes a novel classifier that predicts the informativeness of capitalization in a tweet.
    All tools in &#167;2 are used as features for named entity segmentation in &#167;3.1.
    Next, we present our algorithms and evaluation for entity classification (&#167;3.2).
    We describe related work in &#167;4 and conclude in &#167;5.
  
  
    We first study two fundamental NLP tasks &#8211; POS tagging and noun-p
