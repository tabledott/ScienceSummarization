ree as the multiplication of the probabilities of each derivation decision conditional on that decision&#8217;s prior derivation history .
    The neural network is used to estimate the parameters of this probability model.
    To define the parameters we need to choose the ordering of the decisions in a derivation, such as a top-down or shift-reduce ordering.
    The ordering which we use here is that of a form of left-corner parser (Rosenkrantz and Lewis, 1970).
    A left-corner parser decides to introduced a node into the parse tree after the subtree rooted at the node&#8217;s first child has been fully parsed.
    Then the subtrees for the node&#8217;s remaining children are parsed in their left-to-right order.
    We use a version of left-corner parsing which first applies right-binarization to the grammar, as is done in (Manning and Carpenter, 1997) except that we binarize down to nullary rules rather than to binary rules.
    This allows the choice of the children for a node to be done incrementally,
