 Example 8, the additional information (&#8220;multicultural&#8221;) restricts the set to which it refers (&#8220;couples&#8221;) making ENG entailed by ENG1, and not vice versa as resulted from Turkers&#8217; annotation.
    In light of this analysis, we conclude that the sentence modification methodology proved to be successful, as the low number of Type 1 errors shows.
    Considering that the most expensive phase in the creation of a TE dataset is the generation of the pairs, this is a significant achievement.
    Differently, the entailment assessment phase appears to be more problematic, accounting for the majority of errors.
    As shown by Type 2 errors, this is due to a partial misalignment between the instructions given in our HITs, and the formal definition of textual entailment.
    For this reason, further experimentation will explore different ways to instruct workers (e.g. asking to consider proper names and pronouns as equivalent) in order to reduce the amount of errors produced.
