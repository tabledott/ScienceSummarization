atisfactory treatment of modification at the derivation level, there are now three types of operations (two adjunctions and substitution) for two types of dependencies (arguments and modifiers), and the directionality problem for embedded clauses remains unsolved.
    In defining DTG we have attempted to resolve these problems with the use of a single operation (that we call subsertion) for handling all complementation and a second operation (called sisteradjunction) for modification.
    Before discussion these operations further we consider a second problem with TAG that has implications for the design of these new composition operations (in particular, subsertion).
    TAG cannot be used to provide suitable analyses for certain syntactic phenomena, including longdistance scrambling in German (Becker et al., 1991), Romance Clitics (Bleam, 1994), wh-extraction out of complex picture-NPs (Kroch, 1987), and Kashmiri wh-extraction (presented here).
    The problem in describing these phenomena with TAG arises f
