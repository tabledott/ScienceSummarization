ledwith attribute tests, the edges with the possible out comes of a test, and the terminal nodes are labeled with classes.
			An object is classified by evaluating the test of the top node on the object, following the respective edge to a daughter node, evaluating thetest of the daughter node, and so on until a termi nal node is reached whose class is assigned to the object.Decision Trees are turned into probability estimation trees by storing a probability for each pos sible class at the terminal nodes instead of a singleresult class.
			Figure 1 shows a probability estima tion tree for the prediction of the probability of the nominative attribute of nouns.
			2.1 Induction of Decision Trees.
			Decision trees are incrementally built by first selecting the test which splits the manually anno tated training sample into the most homogeneous subsets with respect to the class.
			This test, which maximizes the information gain 1 wrt.
