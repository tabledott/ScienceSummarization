reated using some string matching techniques; and (2) adjective/adverb pairs from CATVAR (Habash and Dorr, 2003).

    We completed the dictionary by transferring portions of the COMLEX Syntax adverb entries to the corresponding adjectives.
    We now use ADJADV and our list of temporal nouns to evaluate NOMBANK annotation of modifiers.
    Each annotated left modifier is compared against our dictionaries.
