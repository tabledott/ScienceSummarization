e has been some work on statistical approaches to the semantics of compositional compound nominals (e.g.
    Lauer (1995), Barker and Szpakowicz (1998), Rosario and Hearst (2001)), the more idiosyncratic items have been largely ignored beyond attempts at identification (Melamed, 1997; Lin, 1999; Schone and Jurafsky, 2001).
    And yet the identification of noncompositional phrases, while valuable in itself, would by no means be the end of the matter.
    The unique challenge posed by MWEs for empirical NLP is precisely that they do not fall cleanly into the binary classes of compositional and non-compositional expressions, but populate a continuum between the two extremes.
    Part of the reason for the lack of interest by computational linguists in the semantics of MWEs is that there is no established gold standard data from which to construct or evaluate models.
    Evaluation to date has tended to be fairly ad hoc.
    Another key problem is the lack of any firm empirical foundations for the notion of comp
