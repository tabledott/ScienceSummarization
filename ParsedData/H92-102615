 to as Syn, and about 50 semantic categories, referred to as Sem.
  Each NT (and therefore mnemonic) of the grammar has been assigned a syntactic (Syn) and a semantic (Sere) category.
  We also associate with a non-terminal a primary lexical head, denoted by H1, and a secondary lexical head, denoted by H2.
  2 When a rule is applied to a non-terminal, it indicates which child will generate the lexical primary head and which child will generate the secondary lexical head.
  The proposed generative model associates for each con- stituent in the parse tree the probability: p( Syn, Sere, R, H1, H2 ISynp, Sernp, Rp, Ipc, Hip, H2p) In HBG, we predict the syntactic and semantic labels of a constituent, its rewrite rule, and its two lexical heads using the labels of the parent constituent, the parents lexical heads, the parents rule Rp that lead to the con- stituent and the constituents index Ipc as a child of Rp.
  As we discuss in a later section, we have also used with success more information about the derivation
