those that endeavour to take into acof measures with man-made resources count the semantics of the particle.
    This relationship is stronger than statistics which have previously been used for filtering candidate multiwords which suggests that it might be better not to filter with statistics before looking at compositionality using an automatic thesaurus.
    We have not yet exploited these measures in the construction of a lexicon for phrasal verbs.
    Identifying non-compositional phrasals by employing thresholds to force a binary decision is one option.
    This would help in determining which candidate phrasals should be treated separately from the simplex for purposes such as selectional preference acquisition and word sense disambiguation.
    The thresholds might be acquired empirically from some training data, such as the compositionality judgements we have used.
    However, we believe that permitting measurements and evaluation on a continuum of compositionality allows for a more natural explorat
