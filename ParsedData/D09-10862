ndred sentences will achieve mediocre dependency accuracy (the proportion of words that attach to their correct parent).
    But what if we also had a large number of trees in the CoNLL style (the source corpus)?
    Ideally they should help train our parser.
    But unfortunately, a parser that learned to produce perfect CoNLL-style trees would, for example, get both links &#8220;wrong&#8221; when its coordination constructions were evaluated against a Prague-style gold standard (Figure 1).
    If it were just a matter of this one construction, the obvious solution would be to write a few rules by hand to transform the large source training corpus into the target style.
    Suppose, however, that there were many more ways that our corpora differed.
    Then we would like to learn a statistical model to transform one style of tree into another.
    We may not possess hand-annotated training data for this tree-to-tree transformation task.
    That would require the two corpora to annotate some of the same sent
