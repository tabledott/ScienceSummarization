    Unfortunately, it is difficult to directly compare approaches.
    Each method uses a slightly different definition of base NP.
    Each is evaluated on a different corpus.
    Most approaches have been evaluated by hand on a small test set rather than by automatic comparison to a large test corpus annotated by an impartial third party.
    A notable exception is the Ramshaw &amp; Marcus work, which evaluates their transformation-based learning approach on a base NP corpus derived from the Penn Treebank WSJ, and achieves precision and recall levels of approximately 93%.
    This paper presents a new algorithm for identifying base NPs in an arbitrary text.
    Like some of the earlier work on base NP identification, ours is a trainable, corpus-based algorithm.
    In contrast to other corpus-based approaches, however, we hypothesized that the relatively simple nature of base NPs would permit their accurate identification using correspondingly simple methods.
    Assume, for example, that we use the
