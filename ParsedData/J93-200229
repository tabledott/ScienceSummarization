 from coins to verbs, the procedure works as follows.
    For some fixed N, consider the first N occurrences of each verb that occurs at least N times in the input.
    (A uniform sample size N is needed only for estimating 7r_5.
    Given an estimate of 7r-5, verbs with any number of occurrences can be classified.)
    Let S be some syntactic frame and let H[i] be the number of distinct verbs that were followed by cues for S exactly i times out of N&#8212;i.e., the height of the ith histogram bin.
    Assume that there is some 1 &lt; Jo &lt; N such that most -S verbs are followed by cues for S Jo times or fewer, and conversely most verbs that are followed by cues for S Jo times or fewer are -S verbs.
    For each possible estimate j of Jo there is a corresponding estimate of 7r_s; namely, the average rate at which verbs in the first j bins are followed by cues for S. Choosing the most plausible estimate of 7_5 thus comes down to choosing the most plausible estimate of Jo, the boundary between the -S verbs an
