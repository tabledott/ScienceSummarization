oduces 1,941 errors (corresponding to an accuracy of 98.31%), which is 31.3% less than HMM's 2,824 errors.
    A minimal level of combination achievement is that a majority or better will lead to the correct tag and that ties are handled appropriately about 50% of the time for the (2-2) pattern and 25% for the (1-1-1-1) pattern (or 33.3% for the (1-1-1) pattern for Wotan).
    In more optimistic scenarios, a combiner is able to select the correct tag in all tied cases, or even in cases where a two- or three-tagger majority must be overcome.
    Although the possibility of overcoming a majority is present with the arbiter type combiners, the situation is rather improbable.
    As a result, we ought to be more than satisfied if any combiners approach the level corresponding to the projected combiner which resolves all ties correctly.23 Projected accuracies for increasingly successful levels of combination achievement.
    For each level we list the accuracy (%) and the percentage of errors made by the best indi
