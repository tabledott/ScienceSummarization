    We evaluate our LP based global inference procedure against two simpler approaches and a third that is given more information at learning time.
    Basic, only tests our entity and relation classifiers, which are trained independently using only local features.
    In particular, the relation classifier does not know the labels of its entity arguments, and the entity classifier does not know the labels of relations in the sentence either.
    Since basic classifiers are used in all approaches, we describe how they are trained here.
    For the entit
