training data.
    Finding the maximum entropy model that satisfies these constraints is a constrained optimisation problem, which can be solved using the method of Lagrange multipliers, and leads to the form in (1) where the Ai are the Lagrange multipliers.
    A natural choice for Ki is the empirical expected value of the feature fi: xo, An alternative motivation for this model is that, starting with the log-linear form in (1) and deriving (conditional) MLES, we arrive at the same solution as the ME model which satisfies the constraints in (5).
  
  
    GIS is a very simple algorithm for estimating the parameters of a ME model.
    The algorithm is as follows, where E p f, is the empirical expected value of J and E p fi is the expected value according to model p: In practice C is maximised over the (x, y) pairs in the training data, although in theory C can be any constant greater than or equal to the figure in (8).
    However, since determines the rate of convergence of the algorithm, it is preferable to
