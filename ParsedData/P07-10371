    Our best result (0.4688 BLEU) improves by 6.1% relative to a state-of-theart PBSMT model, which compares very favourably with the leading systems on the NIST 2005 task.
  
  
    Within the field of Machine Translation, by far the most dominant paradigm is Phrase-based Statistical Machine Translation (PBSMT) (Koehn et al., 2003; Tillmann &amp; Xia, 2003).
    However, unlike in rule- and example-based MT, it has proven difficult to date to incorporate linguistic, syntactic knowledge in order to improve translation quality.
    Only quite recently have (Chiang, 2005) and (Marcu et al., 2006) shown that incorporating some form of syntactic structure could show improvements over a baseline PBSMT system.
    While (Chiang, 2005) avails of structure which is not linguistically motivated, (Marcu et al., 2006) employ syntactic structure to enrich the entries in the phrase table.
    In this paper we explore a novel approach towards extending a standard PBSMT system with syntactic descriptions: we inje
