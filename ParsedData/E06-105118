).
    As in (Bunescu et al., 2005; Bunescu and Mooney, 2005b), the graph points are obtained by varying the threshold on the classifiFinally, Figure 5 shows the learning curve of the combined kernel KSL using the OARD evaluation methodology.
    The curve reaches a plateau with around 100 Medline abstracts.
    The system was evaluated on the &#8220;basic&#8221; version of the LLL challenge data set (Section 4.2).
    Table 2 shows the results of KSL returned by the scoring service8 for the three subsets of the training set (with and without coreferences, and with their union).
    Table 3 shows the best results obtained at the official competition performed in April 2005.
    Comparing the results we see that KSL trained on each subset outperforms the best systems of the LLL challenge9.
    Notice that the best results at the challenge were obtained by different groups and exploiting the linguistic &#8220;enriched&#8221; version of the data set.
    As observed in (Ned&#180;ellec, 2005), the scores obtained
