 that a particular symptom is associated with a particular object, as in &amp;quot;the disk drive has select lock.&amp;quot; The objectl semantic role would be filled by the disk drive, the subject of the clause, and the symptom semantic role would be filled by select lock, the object of the clause.
    The time(Per) is always passed around, and is occasionally filled by a time adjunct, as in the disk drive had select lock at 0800.
    In addition to the mapping rules that are used to associate syntactic constituents with semantic roles, there are selection restrictions associated with each semantic role.
    The selection restrictions for have test whether or not the filler of the objectl role is allowed to have the type of symptom that fills the symptom role.
    For example, only disk drives have select locks.
    The decomposition of replace is also a very domain specific decomposition that indicates that an agent can use an instrument to exchange two objects.
    The following mapping rule specifies that
