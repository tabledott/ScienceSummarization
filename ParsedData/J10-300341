ques can take good advantage of large bilingual corpora and capture a much larger variety of paraphrastic phenomena.
    Ibrahim, Katz, and Lin (2003) propose an approach that applies a modified version of the dependency path distributional similarity algorithm proposed by Lin and Pantel (2001) to the same monolingual parallel corpus (multiple translations of literary works) used by Barzilay and McKeown (2001).
    The authors claim that their technique is more tractable than Lin and Pantel&#8217;s approach since the sentence-aligned nature of the input parallel corpus obviates the need to compute similarity over tree paths drawn from sentences that have zero semantic overlap.
    Furthermore, they also claim that their technique exploits the parallel nature of a corpus more effectively than Barzilay and McKeown&#8217;s approach simply because their technique uses tree paths and not just lexical information.
    Specifically, they propose the following modifications to Lin and Pantel&#8217;s algorithm: Despit
