			We compare the results of the TAG inside-outside algorithm with the results of the inside-outside algorithm for context-free grammars (Baker, 1979).
			These preliminary experiments suggest that SLTAG achieves faster convergence (and also to a better solu- tion) than stochastic ontext-free grmnmars.
			5.1 In ferr ing the Language {a"b"\]n &gt; 0}.
			We consider first an artificial language.
			The train- ing corpus consists of 100 sentences in the language L = {a"b'~ln &gt; 0} randomly generated by a stochastic context-free grammar.
			The initial grammar consists of the trees ~' , fl~, c~ a and ab with random probability of adjoining and null adjoining.
			The inferred grammar models correctly the language L. Its rules of the form (I), (5) or (fi) with high prob- ability follow (any excluded rule of the same form has probability at least l0 -a3 times lower than the rules given below).
			The structural rules of the form (2), (3), (4) or (7) are not shown since their probability always remain 1.
