not proved overly onerous to maintain and correct hose that are automatically provided.
  We have chosen to retain these null elements because we believe that they can be exploited in many cases to establish a sentences predicate-argument structure; at least one recipient of the parsed corpus has used it to bootstrap the development of lexicons for partic- ular NLP projects and has found the presence of null elements to be a considerable aid in determining verb transitivity (Robert Ingria, personal communication).
  While these null elements correspond more directly to entities in some grammatical theories than in others, it is not our intention to lean toward one or another theoretical view in producing our corpus.
  Rather, since the representational framework for grammatical structure in the Treebank is a relatively impoverished flat context-free notation, the eas- iest mechanism to include information about predicate-argument structure, although indirectly, is by allowing the parse tree to contain explici
