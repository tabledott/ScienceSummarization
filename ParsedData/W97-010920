un): where P is the number of pairs of words in the quadruples which have a common semantic ancestor, Le.
    P 1, 2 or 3 (if there is no such a pair, Dq = 00) and its purpose is to give higher priority to matches on more words.
    The distance of the currendy disambiguated word is squared in order to have a bigger weight in the distance Da (the currently disambiguated word must be different from the corresponding word in the matched quadruple6 unless it has been previously disambiguated).
    The distance between two words D(w1,w2) is defined as the minimum semantic distance between all the possible senses of the words w1 and w2.
    Two quadruples are similar, if their distance is less or equal to the current Similarity Distance Threshold, and if the currently disambiguated word is similar to the corresponding word in the matched quadruple.
    Two words are similar if their semantic distance is less than 1.0 and if either their character strings are different or if one of the words has been previously dis
