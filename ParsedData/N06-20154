tomatic tagging performance.
    Building on results in grouping fine-grained WordNet senses into more coarse-grained senses that led to improved inter-annotator agreement (ITA) and system performance (Palmer et al., 2004; Palmer et al., 2006), we have developed a process for rapid sense inventory creation and annotation that includes critical links between the grouped word senses and the Omega ontology (Philpot et al., 2005; see Section 5 below).
    This process is based on recognizing that sense distinctions can be represented by linguists in an hierarchical structure, similar to a decision tree, that is rooted in very coarse-grained distinctions which become increasingly fine-grained until reaching WordNet senses at the leaves.
    Sets of senses under specific nodes of the tree are grouped together into single entries, along with the syntactic and semantic criteria for their groupings, to be presented to the annotators.
    As shown in Figure 1, a 50-sentence sample of instances is annotated and immediat
