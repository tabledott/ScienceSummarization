terms and their translations.'
    We will subdivide the task of constructing a glossary into two subtasks: (1) generating a list of terms, and (2) finding the translation equivalents.
    The first task will be referred to as the monolingual task and the second as the bilingual task.
    How should a glossary be constructed?
    Translation schools teach their students to read as much background material as possible in both the source and target languages, an extremely time-consuming
  
  
    The statistical corpus-based renaissance in computational linguistics has produced a number of interesting technologies, including part-of-speech tagging and bilingual word alignment.
    Unfortunately, these technologies are still not as widely deployed in practical applications as they might be.
    Part-ofspeech taggers are used in a few applications, such as speech synthesis (Sproat et al., 1992) and question answering (Kupiec, 1993b).
    Word alignment is newer, found only in a few places (Gale and Church, 1991a;
