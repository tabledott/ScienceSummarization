 category or that have a semantic association to each other to create unity in text (Morris 1988; Morris and Hirst 1991; Halliday and Hasan 1976).
    These associations can be thought of as a class of collocations that lack the predictable syntactic structure of, say, collocations arising from verb-particle or compound noun constructions.
    Since language producers select senses that group together semantically, a language analyzer should prefer senses that share a semantic association.
    However, it is unclear whether the benefit of knowing the exact nature of an association would justify the cost of determining it.
    Thus, our system provides a cluster mechanism for representing and identifying groups of senses that are associated in some unspecified way.
    A cluster is a set of the senses associated with some central concept.
    The definition of a cluster includes a name suggesting the central concept and a list of the cluster's members, as in Figure 11.
    A cluster may contain concepts or oth
