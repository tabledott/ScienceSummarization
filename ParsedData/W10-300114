o the cue word.
    That is, correct scope boundaries with incorrect cue annotation and correct cue words with bad scope boundaries were both treated as errors.
    This scope-level metric is very strict.
    For instance, the requirement of the precise match of the cue phrase is questionable as &#8211; from an application point of view &#8211; the goal is to find uncertain text spans and the evidence for this is not so important.
    However, the annotation of cues in datasets is essential for training scope detectors since locating the cues usually precedes the identification of their scope.
    Hence we decided to incorporate cue matches into the evaluation metric.
    Another questionable issue is the strict boundary matching requirement.
    For example, including or excluding punctuations, citations or some bracketed expressions, like (see Figure 1) from a scope is not crucial for an otherwise accurate scope detector.
    On the other hand, the list of such ignorable phenomena is arguable, especially ac
