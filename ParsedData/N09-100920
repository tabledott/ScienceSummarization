ounterpart, so we report only performance with MBR parsing.
    In this paper, we use a few simple heuristics to decide which partition structure S to use.
    Our heurisInput: initial parameters &#181;(&#176;), E(&#176;), partition structure S, observed data x, number of iterations T tics rely mainly on the centrality of content words: nouns, verbs, and adjectives.
    For example, in the English treebank, the most common attachment errors (with the LN prior from Cohen et al., 2008) happen with a noun (25.9%) or a verb (16.9%) parent.
    In the Chinese treebank, the most common attachment errors happen with noun (36.0%) and verb (21.2%) parents as well.
    The errors being governed by such attachments are the direct result of nouns and verbs being the most common parents in these data sets.
    Following this observation, we compare four different settings in our experiments (all SLN settings include one normal expert for each multinomial on its own, equivalent to the regular LN setting from Cohen et al. )
