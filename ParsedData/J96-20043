se, taken as a set, they introduce the full range of issues we wish to discuss. possible to mark conversational move boundaries, cite separately for each of three naive coders the ratio of the number of times they agreed with an &amp;quot;expert&amp;quot; coder about the existence of a boundary over the number of times either the naive coder or the expert marked a boundary.
    They do not describe any restrictions on possible boundary sites.
    Although (1) and KID's use of (2) differ slightly from Litman and Hirschberg's use of (2), (3) and (4) in clearly designating one coder as an &amp;quot;expert,&amp;quot; all of these studies have n coders place some kind of units into m exclusive categories.
    Note that the cases of testing for the existence of a boundary can be treated as coding &amp;quot;yes&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;no&amp;quot; categories for each of the possible boundary sites; this treatment is used by measures (3) and (4) but not by measure (1).
    All four approaches seem reasonable when tak
