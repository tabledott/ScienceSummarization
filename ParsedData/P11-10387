ition problem.
    For example, Kobus et al. (2008) firstly convert input text tokens into phonetic tokens and then restore them to words by phonetic dictionary lookup.
    Beaufort et al. (2010) use finite state methods to perform French SMS normalisation, combining the advantages of SMT and the noisy channel model.
    Kaufmann and Kalita (2010) exploit a machine translation approach with a preprocessor for syntactic (rather than lexical) normalisation.
    Predominantly, however, these methods require large-scale annotated training data, limiting their adaptability to new domains or languages.
    In contrast, our proposed method doesn&#8217;t require annotated data.
    It builds on the work on SMS text normalisation, and adapts it to Twitter data, exploiting multiple data sources for normalisation.
  
  
    We define the task of text normalisation to be a mapping from &#8220;ill-formed&#8221; OOV lexical items to their standard lexical forms, focusing exclusively on English for the purposes of this pape
