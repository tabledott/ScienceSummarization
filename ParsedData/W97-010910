l problem and has been approached by many researchers [GCY92], [YA93], [B&amp;W94], [RE95], [YA95], [KAE96], fL196}, etc.
    We believe that the word sense disambiguation can be accompanied by PP attachment resolution, and that they complement each other.
    At the same time we would like to note, that PP attachment and sense disambiguation are heavily contextually dependent problems.
    Therefore, we know in advance that without incorporation of wide context, the full disambiguation will be never reached.
  
  
    The supervised learning algorithm which we have devised for the PP attachment resolution, and which is discussed in Chapter 3, is based on the induction of a decision tree from a large set of training examples which contain verb-noun-preposition-noun quadruples with disambiguated senses.
    Unfortunately, at the time of writing this work, a sufficiently big corpus which was both syntactically analysed and semantically tagged did not exist.
    Therefore, we used the syntactically analysed corp
