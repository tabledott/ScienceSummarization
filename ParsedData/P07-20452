    Factored translation Mapping of source phrases to target phrases may be decomposed into several steps.
    Decomposition of the decoding process into various steps means that different factors can be modeled separately.
    Modeling factors in isolation allows for flexibility in their application.
    It can also increase accuracy and reduce sparsity by minimizing the number dependencies for each step.
    For example, we can decompose translating from surface forms to surface forms and lemma, as shown in Figure 3. je ach&#232;te you a un a une vert cat 178 Figure 3.
    Example of graph of decoding steps By allowing the graph to be user definable, we can experiment to find the optimum configuration for a given language pair and available data.
    The factors on the source sentence are considered fixed, therefore, there is no decoding step which create source fact
