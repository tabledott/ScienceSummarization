    In the sentence: (6) *Whoi did you make the claim e that Reagan met ei there is a wh-movement out of the complement CP of claim.
    When the movement left an intermediate trace at CSpec, the value of whpg became -.
    When the item with -whpg is combined with the item representing claim, their unification has attributes (+govern -theta -whpg), which is an ECP violation.
    The item is recognized as invalid and discarded.
    PRO Theorem: PRO must be ungoverned (Haegeman, 1991, p.263).
    When the IP node receives an item from Ibar with cform not being fin, the node makes a copy of the item and assign +pro and -ppro to the copy and then send it further without combining it with any item from (
