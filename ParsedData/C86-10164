specif ications and the labels correspond to symbols in an ordinary phrase structure rule.
  For example, the rule S + NP VP in I) PATR notat ion is wr i t ten as (S NP VP) Before a rule is used by the parser, I)-PATI{ compiles it to a feature set.
  A feature set can be displayed in di[ferent ways-- for  example, as a matr i?
  or as a directed graph.
  [n this paper, we usual ly represent feature sets as graphs but the matr ix  notat ion will also be used occasionally.
  [n these graphs, the const i tuents  of the rule are represented by labeled arcs, called attributes.
  The nodes in the graph are values.
  A value can be atomic or complex; a complex wfiue is another  set of at t r ibute-va lue pairs.
  By convention, the symbol on the left-hand side of a phrase structure rule is represented by the numer ic  at t r ibute  0.
  Const i tuents  on the r ight -hand side of the rule are numbered left-to-right, s tar t ing with 1.
  The above rule D PATR represents  as the following feature set, shown here firs
