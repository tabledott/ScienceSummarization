list.
			At this step, we also filter outall those words that have been assigned contradict ing, positive and negative, sentiment values within the same run.
			The performance of STEP was evaluated using GI-H4 as a gold standard, while the HM list wasused as a source of seed words fed into the system.
			We evaluated the performance of our sys tem against the complete list of 1904 adjectives in GI-H4 that included not only the words that were marked as Positiv, Negativ, but also those that werenot considered sentiment-laden by GI-H4 annota tors, and hence were by default considered neutralin our evaluation.
			For the purposes of the evalua tion we have partitioned the entire HM list into 58non-intersecting seed lists of adjectives.
			The re sults of the 58 runs on these non-intersecting seed lists are presented in Table 2.
			The Table 2 showsthat the performance of the system exhibits sub stantial variability depending on the composition of the seed list, with accuracy ranging from 47.6%to 87.5% percent (
