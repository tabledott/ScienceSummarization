ax&#8722;Salience+ on the two corpora).
    We explain this variation by the substantial difference in the type/token ratio between the two domains&#8212;12.1 for Earthquakes versus 5.0 for Accidents.
    The low type/token ratio for Accidents means that most sentences in a text have some words in common.
    For example, the entities pilot, airplane, and airport appear in multiple sentences in the text from Table 6.
    Because there is so much repetition in this domain, the syntax-free grids will be relatively similar for both coherent (original) and incoherent texts (permutations).
    In fact, inspection of the grids from the Accidents corpus reveals that they have many sequences of the form [X X X], [X &#8722; &#8722; X], [X X &#8722; &#8722;], and [&#8722; &#8722; X X] in common, Two texts from the Earthquakes and Accidents corpus.
    One entity class for each document is shown to demonstrate the difference in referring expressions used in the two corpora. and deteriorating rapidly.
