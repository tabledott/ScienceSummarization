d Hanks 1990; Smadja and McKeown 1990).
    As an example of the kind of data that we derived, Figure 8 shows the ten most frequent co-occurrences involving the root &amp;quot;take.&amp;quot; Note that the collocation &amp;quot;take action&amp;quot; appears both in its active form (third in the list), as well as its passive, actions were taken (fifth in the list).
    From an examination of these lists and the contexts in which the pairs appeared in the corpus, we constructed the patterns used by TRUMP to identify collocations.
    Then, using the patterns as a guide, we added lexical entries for each collocation.
    (Figure 9 lists some of the entries for the compositional collocations associated with the verb take; the entries pair a dynamic sense of take with a sense occurring as its complement.)
    These entries link the collocations to the semantic hierarchy, and, where appropriate, provide syntactic constraints that the parser can use to verify the presence of a collocation.
    For example, Figure 10
