ce score is independent from other sentence scores.
    Since we do not know the true mean and variance , we can not model the distribution of sentence scores with the normal distribution.
    However, we can use Student&#8217;s t-distribution, which approximates the normal distribution for large .
    See Figure 5 for an illustration: Given the sample mean and sample variance , we estimate the probability distribution for true translation quality.
    We are now interested in a confidence interaround the mean sentence score.
    The true translation quality (or the true mean lies within in the confidence interval with a probability .
    Note the relationship between the degree of statistical significance and the confidence interval: The degree of statistical significance is indicated by the fraction of the area under the curve that is shaded.
    The confidence interval is indicated by the boundaries on the x-axis.
    The functional mapping between a confidence inand the probability can be obtained by inte
