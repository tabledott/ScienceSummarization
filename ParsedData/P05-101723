  Although our model can easily extended to a multi-state model, the effectiveness of using such a multi-state model has not been shown yet.
    Our model uses only the tendency of having the same orientation.
    Therefore we can extract semantic orientations of new words that are not listed in a dictionary.
    The validation of such extension will widen the possibility of application of our method.
    Larger corpora such as web data will improve performance.
    The combination of our method and the method by Turney and Littman (2003) is promising.
    Finally, we believe that the proposed model is applicable to other tasks in computational linguistics.
