most highly rated task is executed first.
    The rating of a partial plan reflects how likely it is to be part of the &amp;quot;correct&amp;quot; plan, i.e. the plan the speaker is executing.
    If several incompatible inferences can be made from one point in the alternative, then its rating is divided among them.
    The heuristics described in this section are based on domain independent relations between actions, their bodies, preconditions, and effects.
    The need for more domain dependent measures is discussed later.
    American Journal of Computational Linguistics, Volume 6, Number 3-4, July-December 1980 173 of tions are possible in rules EC.1 - EC.3 and EI.1 EI.3.
    The heuristics are described here only in terms increasing or decreasing ratings of partial plans.
    Decrease the rating of a partial plan in which the preconditions of executing actions are currently false.
    Decrease the rating of a partial plan containing a pending action ACT by an agent A if A is not able to do ACT.3 Decreas
