 word, e.g., a specialized feature for the word about in Table 3 could be: Table 8 shows the results of an experiment in which specialized features are constructed for &amp;quot;difficult&amp;quot; words, and are added to the baseline feature set.
    Here, &amp;quot;difficult&amp;quot; words are those that are mistagged a certain way at least 50 times when the training set is tagged with the baseline model.
    Using the set of 29 difficult words, the model performs at 96.49% accuracy on the Development Set, an insignificant improvement from the baseline accuracy of 96.43%.
    Table 9 shows the change in error rates on the Development Set for the frequently occurring &amp;quot;difficult&amp;quot; words.
    For most words, the specialized model yields little or no improvement, and for some, i.e., more and about, the specialized model performs worse.
    The lack of improvement implies that either the feature set is still impoverished, or that the training data is inconsistent.
