oreference resolution jointly for all mentions in a document, using first-order probabilistic models in either supervised or unsupervised settings.
    Haghighi and Klein (2010) propose a generative approach that models entity clusters explicitly using a mostly-unsupervised generative model.
    As previously mentioned, our work is not constrained by first-order or Bayesian formalisms in how it uses cluster information.
    Additionally, the deterministic models in our tiered model are significantly simpler, yet perform generally better than the complex inference models proposed in these works.
    From a high level perspective, this work falls under the theory of shaping, defined as a &#8220;method of successive approximations&#8221; for learning (Skinner, 1938).
    This theory is known by different names in many NLP applications: Brown et al. (1993) used simple models as &#8220;stepping stones&#8221; for more complex word alignment models; Collins (1999) used &#8220;cautious&#8221; decision list learning f
