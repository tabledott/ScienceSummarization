    Topic segmentation is one of the fundamental problems in discourse analysis, where the task is to divide a text into a linear sequence of topicallycoherent segments.
    Hearst&#8217;s TEXTTILING (1994) introduced the idea that unsupervised segmentation can be driven by lexical cohesion, as high-quality segmentations feature homogeneous lexical distributions within each topic segment.
    Lexical cohesion has provided the inspiration for several successful systems (e.g., Utiyama and Isahara, 2001; Galley et al.2003; Malioutov and Barzilay, 2006), and is currently the dominant approach to unsupervised topic segmentation.
    But despite the effectiveness of lexical cohesion for unsupervised topic segmentation, it is clear that there are other important indicators that are ignored by the current generation of unsupervised systems.
    For example, consider cue phrases, which are explicit discourse markers such as &#8220;now&#8221;
