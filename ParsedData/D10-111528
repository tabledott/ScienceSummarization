 for the bulk of ANs, such corpus-based co-occurrence vectors are semantically reasonable.
  
  
    Having tentatively established that the sort of vectors we can harvest for ANs by directly collecting their corpus co-occurrences are reasonable representations of their composite meaning, we move on to the core question of whether it is possible to reconstruct the vector for an unobserved AN from information about its components.
    We use nearness to the corpus-observed vectors of held-out ANs as a very direct way to evaluate the quality of modelgenerated ANs, since we just saw that the observed ANs look reasonable (but see the caveats at the end of this section).
    We leave it to further work to assess the quality of the generated ANs in an applied setting, for example adapting Mitchell and Lapata&#8217;s paraphrasing task to ANs.
    Since the observed vectors look like plausible representations of composite meaning, we expect that the closer the modelgenerated vectors are to the observed ones, the bett
