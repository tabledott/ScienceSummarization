 could measure both precision and recall; for the others shown, sources were available for measuring precision but no exhaustive list was available from which to measure recall, so we measured coverage (the number of countries for which at least one target concept is found as related).
    Another eleven meaningful relations were generated for which we did not compute precision numbers.
    These include celebrity-from, animal-of, lakein, borders-on and enemy-of.
    (The set of relations generated by other seed pairs differed only slightly from those shown here for France and Angola.)
    In our second experiment, our seed consisted of two fish species, barracuda and bluefish.
    There are 770 species listed in WordNet of which 447 names are character strings with no white space.
    The first stage of the algorithm returned 305 of the species listed in Wordnet, another 37 species not listed in Wordnet, as well as 48 other names (consisting mostly of other sea creatures).
    The second part of the algorith
