 series of Bergen Workshop on Anaphora Resolution (WAR)).
    Being inherently a clustering task, coreference has also received a lot of attention in the machine learning community.
    Fifteen years have passed since the first paper on learning-based coreference resolution was published (Connolly et al., 1994).
    Our goal in this paper is to provide NLP researchers with a survey of the major milestones in supervised coreference research, focusing on the computational models, the linguistic features, the annotated corpora, and the evaluation metrics that were developed in the past fifteen years.
    Note that several leading coreference researchers have published books (e.g., Mitkov (2002)), written survey articles (e.g., Mitkov (1999), Strube (2009)), and delivered tutorials (e.g., Strube (2002), Ponzetto and Poesio (2009)) that provide a broad overview of coreference research.
    This survey paper aims to complement, rather than supersede, these previously published materials.
    In particular, while ex
