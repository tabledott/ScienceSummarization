ased are inherently shorter than MaxMatch, having the same distortion limit means CharBased is limited to a smaller context than MaxMatch.
    To make a fairer comparison, we set the linear distortion limit in Moses to unlimited, removed the lexicalized reordering model, and retested both systems.
    With this setting, MaxMatch is 0.46 BLEU point better than CharBased (29.62 to 29.16) on MT03.
    This result suggests that having word segmentation does affect how the reordering model works in a phrasebased system.
    Hypothesis 2.
    Better Segmentation Performance Should Lead to Better MT Performance Observation We have shown in Hypothesis 1 that it is helpful to segment Chinese texts into words first.
    In order to decide a segmenter to use, the most intuitive thing to do is to find one that gives higher F measure on segmentation.
    Our experiments show that higher F measure does not necessarily lead to higher BLEU score.
    In order to contrast with the simple maximum matching lexicon-based model (
