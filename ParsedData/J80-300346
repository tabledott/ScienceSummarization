 Q implies P.
    (PC.!)
    WA(Bs(P)) =c=&gt; WA(Bs(Q)), if BABs(Q P).
    (PH) BsWA(Bs(Q)) =i=&gt; BsWA(Bs(P)), if BsBABs(Q P).
    In Example 9, S recognizes that A asked him to leave.
    The interpretation depends on S concluding that John performed his REQUEST successfully (through PH and ACT.2), and hence that A wants to request S to leave.
    It is then an easy step to infer that A wants S to leave, which leads to the request interpretation.
    Interpretation (c), a simple report of some previous action, follows from (2) by PI.BA.
    In Example 10, S recognizes that A intended to tell him that John wants him to leave.
    This depends on the fact that S concludes that John wanted to perform the REQUEST that A reported.
    Most of the needed inferences call for the use of EI.1 to embed simple inference rules twice.
    Note that an INFORM act could have been inferred at each of the four previous steps; for example, from (5) the body inference would produce INFORM(A, S, Wj(REQUEST(A, S, LEAVE(S))).
