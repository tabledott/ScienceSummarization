aining, on translation quality three different setups for training the statistical lexicon on Verbmobil data have been defined: The language model is always trained on the full English corpus.
    The argument for this is that monolingual corpora are always easier and less expensive to obtain than bilingual corpora.
    A conventional dictionary is used in all three setups to complement Impact of corpus size (measured in number of running words in the corpus) on vocabulary size (measured in number of different full-form words found in the corpus) for the German part of the Verbmobil corpus. the bilingual corpus.
    In the last setup, the lexicon probabilities are trained exclusively on this dictionary As Table 9 shows, the quality of translation drops significantly when the amount of bilingual data available during training is reduced: When the training corpus is restricted to 5,000 sentences, the SSER increases by about 7% and the ISER by about 3%.
    As could be expected, the translations produced by the
