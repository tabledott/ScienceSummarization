 personal experiences, products, movies etc. is crucial to understand user generated content in social networks, blogs or product reviews.
    Detecting sentiment in these data is a challenging task which has recently spawned a lot of interest (Pang and Lee, 2008).
    Current baseline methods often use bag-of-words representations which cannot properly capture more complex linguistic phenomena in sentiment analysis (Pang et al., 2002).
    For instance, while the two phrases &#8220;white blood cells destroying an infection&#8221; and &#8220;an infection destroying white blood cells&#8221; have the same bag-of-words representation, the former is a positive reaction while the later is very negative.
    More advanced methods such as (Nakagawa et al., tecture which learns semantic vector representations of phrases.
    Word indices (orange) are first mapped into a semantic vector space (blue).
    Then they are recursively merged by the same autoencoder network into a fixed length sentence representation.
