ference chain).
    Consider the responses shown in Figures 7 and 8.
    We had mentioned earlier that the error of linking the the two large chains in the second response is more damaging than the error of linking one of the large chains with the smaller chain in the first response.
    Our scoring algorithm takes this into account and computes a final precision of 58% and 76% for the two responses respectively.
    In comparison, the MUC algorithm computes a precision of 90% for both the responses (Figure 9).
  
  
    Figure 11 shows the precision, recall, and F-Measure (with equal weights for both precision and recall) using the B-CUBED scoring algorithm.
    The Vector Space Model in this case constructed the space of terms only from the summaries extracted by SentenceExtractor.
    In comparison, Figure 12 shows the results (using the B-CUBED scoring algorithm) when the vector space model constructed the space of terms from the articles input to the system (it still used the summaries when computing the
