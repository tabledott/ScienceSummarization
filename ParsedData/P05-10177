to Q and the entropy of Q : The parameters &#952; that minimizes the variational free energy will be chosen.
    It has been shown that minimizing F is equivalent to minimizing the KullbackLeibler divergence between P and Q (Mackay, 2003).
    We next assume that the function Q(x; &#952;) has the factorial form : Using the mean-field method developed in statistical mechanics, we determine the semantic orientations on the network in a global manner.
    The global optimization enables the incorporation of possibly noisy resources such as glosses and corpora, while existing simple methods such as the shortest-path method and the bootstrapping method cannot work in the presence of such noisy evidences.
    Those methods depend on less-noisy data such as a thesaurus.
    Simple substitution and transformation leads us to the following variational free energy: With the usual method of Lagrange multipliers, we obtain the mean field equation : xi = Pxi xi exp &#181;&#946;xi Pj wijxj)
  
  
    We use the spin model
