 a tagset based on Wordnet supersenses, a much simpler and general semantic model than Wordnet which, however, preserves significant polysemy information and includes standard named entity recognition categories.
    We showed that in this framework it is possible to perform accurate broad-coverage tagging with state of the art sequence learning methods.
    The tagger considerably outperformed the most competitive baseline on both Semcor and Senseval data.
    To the best of our knowledge the results on Senseval data provide the first convincing evidence of the possibility of improving by considerable amounts over the first sense baseline.
    We believe both the tagset and the structured learning approach contribute to these results.
    The simplified representation obviously helps by reducing the number of possible senses for each word (cf.
    Table 3).
    Interestingly, the relative improvement in performance is not as large as the relative reduction in polysemy.
    This indicates that sense granulari
