nce varies with boundary strength (1 &lt; T, &lt; 7).
    Table 4 shows recall and precision of RA, PA, CA and humans when boundaries are broken down into those identified by exactly 1 subject, exactly 2, and so on up to 7.8 There is a strong tendency for recall to increase and precision to decrease as boundary strength increases.
    We take this as evidence that the presence of a boundary is not a binary decision; rather, that boundaries vary in perceptual salience.
  
  
    We have shown that human subjects can reliably perform linear discourse segmentation in a corpus of transcripts of spoken narratives, using an informal notion of speaker intention.
    We found that percent agreement with the segmentations produced by the majority of subjects ranged from 82%-92%, with an average across all narratives of 89% (cr=.0006).
    We found that these agreement results were highly significant, with probabilities of randomly achieving our findings ranging from p = .114 x 10-8 to p &lt; .6 x 10-9.
    We have inv
