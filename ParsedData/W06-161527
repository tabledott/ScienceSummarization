adaptation.
    It uses unlabeled data and frequently-occurring pivot features from both source and target domains to find correspondences among features from these domains.
    Finding correspondences involves estimating the correlations between pivot and non-pivot feautres, and we adapt structural learning (ASO) (Ando and Zhang, 2005a; Ando and Zhang, 2005b) for this task.
    SCL is a general technique that can be applied to any feature-based discriminative learner.
    We showed results using SCL to transfer a PoS tagger from the Wall Street Journal to a corpus of MEDLINE abstracts.
    SCL consistently outperformed both supervised and semi-supervised learning with no labeled target domain training data.
    We also showed how to combine an SCL tagger with target domain labeled data using the classifier combination techniques from Florian et al. (2004).
    Finally, we improved parsing performance in the target domain when using the SCL PoS tagger.
    One of our next goals is to apply SCL directly to par
