 due to the relative ease of the problem.
    This would be an important consideration when comparing various algorithms; when the algorithms are actually applied, it is clearly very desirable to incorporate as much prior knowledge (say, on potential anchors) as possible.
    Moreover, long texts can almost always be expected to contain natural anchors, such as chapter section headings, at which to make an priori Gale and Church (1991) note that their method performed considerably better when lengths of sentences were measured in number of characters instead of in number of words.
    Their method is based on a probabilistic model of the distance between and a dynamic programming algorithm is used to minimize the total aligned Their implementation assumes that character in one language gives rise to, on average, one character in the other language.'
    In our texts, one character in English on average gives rise to somewhat more than 1.2 characters in German, and the correlation between the lengths (in chara
