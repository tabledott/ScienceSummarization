translation when multiple reference translations are not available (Callison-Burch et al., 2006).
    A large database of human judgments might also be useful as an objective function for minimum error rate training (Och, 2003) or in other system development tasks.
  
  
    Similar to previous editions of this workshop we carried out an extensive manual and automatic evaluation of machine translation performance for translating from European languages into English, and vice versa.
    One important aspect in which this year&#8217;s shared task differed from previous years was the introduction of an additional newswire test set that was different in nature to the training data.
    We also added new language pairs to our evaluation: Hungarian-English and German-Spanish.
    As in previous years we were pleased to notice an increase in the number of participants.
    This year we received submissions from 23 groups from 18 institutions.
    In addition, we evaluated seven commercial rule-based MT systems.
