ecify all its elements.
    A marker passer takes the opposite stance, however, considering all paths up, down, and across the network unless it is explicitly constrained.
    Thus a marker passer might find the following dubious path from the 'written object' sense of book to the 'part-of-a-plant' sense of leaf: [book made-of paper] [paper made-from wood] [tree made-of wood] [tree has-part leaf] whereas no cluster would link these entities, unless there had been some prior evidence of a connection.
    (The recommended solution to the production of such paths by a marker passer is to prevent the passing of marks through certain kinds of nodes [Hirst 1987; Hendler 19871.)
    From the lexical entries, the underlying concept hierarchy, and the specialized entries for collocation and clusters just described, a language analyzer can extract the information that establishes preferences among senses.
    In the next section, we will describe how a semantic interpreter can apply knowledge from such a wide variety o
