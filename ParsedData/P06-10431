s remarkable since training the parser and reranker on labeled Brown data achieves only 88.4%.
  
  
    Modern statistical parsers require treebanks to train their parameters, but their performance declines when one parses genres more distant from the training data&#8217;s domain.
    Furthermore, the treebanks required to train said parsers are expensive and difficult to produce.
    Naturally, one of the goals of statistical parsing is to produce a broad-coverage parser which is relatively insensitive to textual domain.
    But the lack of corpora has led to a situation where much of the current work on parsing is performed on a single domain using training data from that domain &#8212; the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) section of the Penn Treebank (Marcus et al., 1993).
    Given the aforementioned costs, it is unlikely that many significant treebanks will be created for new genres.
    Thus, parser adaptation attempts to leverage existing labeled data from one domain and create a parser capable of parsing a
