son), company names (Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co), and organization names (Federal Reserve).
    This multiword analysis was chosen because many applications do not require the internal structure of names, and the identification of named entities is now typically carried out by a separate non-syntactic pre-processing module.
    This was captured for the LFG parser by using named entity markup and for the Collins parser by creating complex word forms with a single POS tag (section 5).
  
  
    A conversion routine was required for each system to transform its output so that it could be compared to the DEPBANK dependencies.
    While it is relatively straightforward to convert LFG f-structures to the dependency bank format because the f-structure is effectively a dependency format, it is more difficult to transform the output trees of the Model 3 Collins parser in a way that fairly allocates both credits and penalties.
    LFG Conversion We discarded the LFG tree structures and used a general rewriting system pre
