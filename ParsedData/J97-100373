d by the judges, since paragraphs with a nonpositive depth score are not eligible for boundary assignment, and these cases are marked with a dash.
    Note that this evaluation does away with the need for LC and HC cutoff levels.
    From Table 2 we can see that varying the parameter settings improves the scores for some texts while detracting from others.
    We can also see that the blocks algorithm for lexical score determination produces stronger results in most cases than the vocabulary introduction method, although the latter seems to do better on the cases where the blocks algorithm finds few boundaries (e.g., texts 6, 7, and 11).
    In almost all cases the algorithms are not as accurate as the judges, but the scores for the blocks version of the algorithm are very strong in many cases.
    In looking at the results in more detail, one might wonder why the algorithm performs better on some texts than on others.
    Text 7, for example, scores especially poorly.
    This may be caused by the fact that
