e , D1, A) be a valid rule template, and (Pp,q f , Ps,t e , D2, A) a valid phrase alignment, where [p, q] C [i, j], [s, t] C [m, n], D2 is a sub-structure of D1, and at least one word in Pi,j f but not in Pp,q f is aligned.
    We create a new valid rule template (P0 f, P0e, D0, A), where we obtain Pf0 by replacing Pp,q f with label X in Pi,j f , and obtain Among all valid rule templates, we collect those that contain at most two NTs and at most seven elements in the source as transfer rules in our system.
    Following previous work on hierarchical MT (Chiang, 2005; Galley et al., 2006), we solve decoding as chart parsing.
    We view target dependency as the hidden structure of source fragments.
    The parser scans all source cells in a bottom-up style, and checks matched transfer rules according to the source side.
    Once there is a completed rule, we build a larger dependency structure by substituting component dependency structures for corresponding NTs in the target dependency structure of rules.
