Andreas Stolcke Efficient Probabilistic Context-Free Parsing information can be easily incorporated to restrict the allowable parses.
    A simple extension of the Earley chart allows finding partial parses of ungrammatical input.
    The computation of probabilities is conceptually simple, and follows directly Earley's parsing framework, while drawing heavily on the analogy to finite-state language models.
    It does not require rewriting the grammar into normal form.
    Thus, the present algorithm fills a gap in the existing array of algorithms for SCFGs, efficiently combining the functionalities and advantages of several previous approaches.
  
  
    In Section 4.5 we defined the probabilistic left-corner and unit-production matrices RL and Ru, respectively, to collapse recursions in the prediction and completion steps.
    It was shown how these matrices could be obtained as the result of matrix inversions.
    In this appendix we give a proof that the existence of these inverses is assured if the gram
