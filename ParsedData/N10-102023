    Note that r is not a perfect measure of model quality for conversations; in some cases, multiple orderings of the same set of posts may form a perfectly acceptable conversation.
    On the other hand, there are often strong constraints on the type of response we might expect to follow a particular dialogue act; for example, answers follow questions.
    We would expect an effective model to use these constraints to predict order.
    Performance at the conversation ordering task while varying the number of acts for each model is displayed in Figure 5.
    In general, we found that using Bayesian inference outperforms EM.
    Also note that the Bayesian Conversation model outperforms the Conversation+Topic model at predicting conversation order.
    This is likely because modeling conversation content as a sequence can in some cases help to predict post ordering; for example, adjacent posts are more likely to contain similar content words.
    Recall though that we found the Conversatio
