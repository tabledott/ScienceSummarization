 that the anchor is either evoked or unused.
    I assume the following conventions for the ranking constraints on the elements of the S-list.
    The 3-tuple (x, uttx, pos z) denotes a discourse entity x which is evoked in utterance uttx at the text position posx.
    With respect to any two discourse entities (x, uttx , pas x) and (y, utty, posy), uttx and utty specifying the current utterance Ui or the preceding utterance U2_1, I set up the following ordering constraints on elements in the S-list (Table 2)2.
    For any state of the processor/hearer, the ordering of discourse entities in the S-list that can be derived from the ordering constraints (1) to (3) is denoted by the precedence relation (I) If x E OLD and y E MED, then x y.
    If x E OLD and y E NEW, then x y.
    If x E MED and y E NEW, then x y.
    (2) If x, y E OLD, or x, y E MED, or x, y E NEW, then if utt. utty, then x y, if utt.
    = utty and pos.
    &lt; posy, then x y. Summarizing Table 2, I state the following preference ranking for d
