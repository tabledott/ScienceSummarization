    Following compares SMS text normalization with other similar or related applications.
    General text normalization deals with NonStandard Words (NSWs) and has been wellstudied in text-to-speech (Sproat et al., 2001) while SMS normalization deals with Non-Words (NSs) or lingoes and has seldom been studied before.
    NSWs, such as digit sequences, acronyms, mixed case words (WinNT, SunOS), abbreviations and so on, are grammatically correct in linguistics.
    However lingoes, such as &#8220;b4&#8221; (before) and &#8220;bf&#8221; (boyfriend), which are usually selfcreated and only accepted by young SMS users, are not yet formalized in linguistics.
    Therefore, the special phenomena in SMS texts impose a big challenge to SMS normalization.
    Intuitively, many would regard SMS normalization as a spelling correction problem where the lingoes are erroneous words or non-words to be replaced by English words.
