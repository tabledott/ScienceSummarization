h division by the maximal weight dmax.
    If we take all disagreements to be of equal weight, that is dkaka = 0 for all categories ka and dkakb = 1 for all ka =~ kb, then the observed disagreement is exactly the complement of the observed agreement as calculated in Section 2.4: D&#954;wo = 1 &#8722; A&#954;o.
    Like &#954;, the coefficient &#954;w interprets expected disagreement as the amount expected by chance from a distinct probability distribution for each coder.
    These individual distributions are estimated by &#710;P(k|c), the proportion of items assigned by coder c to category k, that is the number of such assignments nck divided by the number of items i.
    The probability that coder c1 assigns an item to category kQ and coder c2 assigns it to category kb is the joint probability of each coder making this assignment independently, namely, P(kQ|c1)P(kb|c2).
    The expected disagreement is the mean of the weights for all (ordered) category pairs, weighted by the probabilities of the category pa
