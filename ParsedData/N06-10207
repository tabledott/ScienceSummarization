ere are 147,456 such features involving only parts-of-speech and 454,101 features involving parts-of-speech and words.
    These additional features are largely responsible for improving the reranker&#8217;s performance on section 23 to 91.3% f-score (Charniak and Johnson (2005) reported an f-score of 91.0% on section 23).
    Our labeled data comes from the Penn Treebank (Marcus et al., 1993) and consists of about 40,000 sentences from Wall Street Journal (WSJ) articles annotated with syntactic information.
    We use the standard divisions: Sections 2 through 21 are used for training, section 24 is held-out development, and section 23 is used for final testing.
    Our unlabeled data is the North American News Text corpus, NANC (Graff, 1995), which is approximately 24 million unlabeled sentences from various news sources.
    NANC contains no syntactic information.
    Sentence boundaries in NANC are induced by a simple discriminative model.
    We also perform some basic cleanups on NANC to ease parsing.
