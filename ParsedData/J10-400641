of our own work that the DM framework is an extension and generalization of Baroni et al. (2010) and Baroni and Lenci (2009).
    Instead, we briefly discuss two other studies that explicitly advocate a uniform approach to corpus-based semantic tasks, and one article that, like us, proposes a tensor-based formalization of corpus-extracted triples.
    See Turney and Pantel (2010) for a very recent general survey of DSMs.
    Pad&#180;o and Lapata (2007), partly inspired by Lowe (2001), have proposed an interesting general formalization of DSMs.
    In their approach, a corpus-based semantic model is characterized by (1) a set of functions to extract statistics from the corpus, (2) construction of the basis-by-target-elements co-occurrence matrix, and (3) a similarity function operating on the matrix.
    Our focus is entirely on the second aspect.
    A DM, according to the characterization in Section 3, is a labeled tensor based on a source weighted tuple structure and coupled with matricization operations.
