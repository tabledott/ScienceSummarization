ill discuss our current implementation f such an architecture, ~hich is parameterized in such a way that it can be used either for ~arsing or generation with respect o grammars written in a particular ~rammar formalism which has a logical semantics, the PATR formal- sm.
  Furthermore, the architecture allows fine tuning to reflect differ- mt l::ocessing strategies, including parsing models intended to mimic )s~cholinguistiC phenomena.
  This tuning allows the parsing system to )perate within the same realm of efficiency as previous architectures or parsing alone, but with much greater flexibility for engaging in ,ther processing regimes.

  2 Language Processing as Deduction Viewed intuitively, natural-language-utterance gen ration is a nonde- terministic top-down process of building a phrase that conforms to certain given criteria, e.g., that the phrase be a sentence and that it convey a
