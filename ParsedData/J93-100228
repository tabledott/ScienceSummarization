t to reduce, and the appropriate rule of the grammar with which to perform the reduction.
    The control information is standardly encoded as a parse table with rows representing parse states, and columns terminal and nonterminal symbols of the grammar.
    This representation defines a finite-state automaton.
    Figure 2 gives the LALR(1) parse table for Grammar 1.
    (LALR(1) is the most commonly used variant of LR since it usually provides the best trade-off between directed rule invocation and parse table size.)
    If the grammar is in the appropriate LR class (a stronger restriction than being an unambiguous CFG), the automaton will be deterministic; however, some algorithms for parse table construction are also able to build nondeterministic automata containing action conflicts for ambiguous CFGs.
    Parse table construction is discussed further in Section 4.
    Tomita (1987) describes a system for nondeterministic LR parsing of context-free grammars consisting of atomic categories, in which each
