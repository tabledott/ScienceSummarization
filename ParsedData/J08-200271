ring arguments, of the form R-ARGX, as discussed in Section 3.
    Our approach to dealing with referring arguments and deciding when multiple identically labeled constituents are part of the same argument was to label constituents with only the set of argument labels and NONE and then map some of these labels into referring or continuation labels.
    We converted an ARGX into a R-ARGX if and only if the label of the constituent began with &#8220;WH&#8221;.
    The rule for deciding when to add continuation labels was the same as for our systems for the February 2004 data described in Section 4.3: A constituent label becomes continuing if and only if it is a core argument label and there is another constituent with the same core argument label to the left.
    Therefore, for the CoNLL 2005 shared task we employ the same semantic role labeling system, just using a different post-processing rule to map to CoNLL-style labelings of sets of words.
    We tested the upper bound in performance due to our conversion
