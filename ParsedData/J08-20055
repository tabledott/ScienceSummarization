ubset of the data for training, which potentially makes the problem harder.
  Furthermore, an SRL system is usually complicated and consists of several stages.
  It was still unclear howmuch syntactic information helps and precisely where it helps the most.
  The goal of this paper is threefold.
  First, we describe an architecture for an SRL system that incorporates a level of global inference on top of the relatively common processing steps.
  This inference step allows us to incorporate structural and linguistic constraints over the possible outcomes of the argument classifier in an easy way.
  The inference procedure is formalized via an Integer Linear Programming framework and is shown to yield state-of-the-art results on this task.
  Second, we provide a fair com- parison between SRL systems that use full parse trees and systems that only use shal- low syntactic information.
  As with our full syntactic parse?based SRL system (Koomen et al.
  2005), our shallow parsing?based SRL system is based on the s
