nation, this could have been expected.
    Looking at the actual tag precision values (see Table 9 below), we see that the precision is generally more dependent on the tag than on the tagger, so that TagPrecision always tends to select the easier tag.
    In other words, it uses less specific rather than more specific information.
    Precision-Recall is meant to correct this behavior by the involvement of recall values.
    As intended, Precision-Recall generally has a higher accuracy than TagPrecision, but does not always improve on TotPrecision.
    Our previously unconfirmed hypothesis, that arbiter-type combiners would be able to outperform the gang-type ones, is now confirmed.
    With the exception of several of the Tags+Word versions and the Tags+Context version for WSJ, the more sophisticated modeling systems have a significantly better accuracy than the simple voting systems on all four data sets.
    TagPair, being somewhere between simple voting and stacking, also falls in the middle where accurac
