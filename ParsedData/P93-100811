es needed by Gemini are the value spaces used by features.
    Thus for example, the type v (verb) admits a feature vform, whose value space vform-types can be instantiated with values like present participle, finite, and past participle.
    Since all recursive features are category-valued, these two kinds of types suffice.
    Sortal Constraints Selectional restrictions are imposed in Gemini through the sorts mechanism.
    Selectional restrictions include both highly domain-specific information about predicateargument and very general predicate restrictions.
    For example, in our application the object of the transitive verb depart (as in flights departing Boston) is restricted to be an airport or a city, obviously a domain-specific requirement.
    But the same machinery also restricts a determiner like all to take two propositions, and an adjective like further to take distances as its measure-specifier (as in thirty miles further).
    In fact, sortal constraints are assigned to every atomic predicate
