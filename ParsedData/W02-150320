and should use the ADEGREE feature; if they do, then the question arises as to why they do not have this feature as part of their analysis.
    Finally, there is the discussion of problematic constructions.
    These may be constructions that already have analyses which had been agreed upon in the past but which are not working properly now that more data has been considered.
    More frequently, they are new constructions that one of the grammars is considering adding.
    Possible analyses for the construction are discussed and then one of the grammars will incorporate the analysis to see whether it works.
    If the analysis works, then the other grammars will incorporate the analysis.
    Constructions that have been discussed in past ParGram meetings include predicative adjectives, quantifiers, partitives, and clefts.
    Even if not all of the languages have the construction in question, as was the case with clefts, the grammar writers for that language may have interesting ideas on how to analyze it.
