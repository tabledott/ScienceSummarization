riminative tagger with cluster features using active learning.
    Both with and without clusters, active learning exhibits a noticeable increase in learning rates.
    However, the increase in learning rate is significantly more pronounced when cluster features are introduced.
    We attribute this increase to better confidence measures provided by word clusters &#8211; the system is no longer restricted to whether or not it knows a word; it now can know something about the clusters to which a word belongs, even if it does not know the word.
    Finally, Figure 4 shows the impact of consolidating the gains from both cluster features and active learning compared to the baseline HMM.
    This final combination achieves an F-score of 90 with less than 20,000 words of training &#8211; a quantity that can be annotated in about 4 person hours &#8211; compared to 150,000 words for the HMM &#8211; a quantity requiring nearly 4 person days to annotate.
    At 1,000,000 word of training, the final combination continue
