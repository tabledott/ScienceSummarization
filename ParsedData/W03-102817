 the stemmed terms, a unit was considered a keyword if it was equal to a stemmed manual keyword.
    For the unstemmed terms, the term had to match exactly.
    The measure used to evaluate the results on the validation set was the F-score, defined as combining the precision and the recall obtained.
    In this study, the main concern is the precision and the recall for the examples that have been assigned the class positive, that is how many of the suggested keywords are correct (precision), and how many of the manually assigned keywords that are found (recall).
    As the proportion of correctly suggested keywords is considered equally important as the amount of terms assigned by a professional indexer that was detected, was assigned the value 1, thus giving precision and recall equal weights.
    When calculating the recall, the value for the total number of manually assigned keywords present in the documents is used, independent of the number actually present in the different representations.
