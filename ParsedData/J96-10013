 languages, our system produces translations of common word pairs and phrases that can form the basis of a bilingual lexicon.
    Our focus is on the use of statistical methods for the translation of multiword expressions, such as collocations which are often idiomatic in nature.
    Published translations of such collocations are not readily available, even for languages such as French and English, despite the fact that collocations have been recognized as one of the main obstacles to second language acquisition (Leed and Nakhimovsky 1979).
    We have developed a program named Champollion1 , which, given a sentencealigned parallel bilingual corpus, translates collocations (or individual words) in the source language into collocations (or individual words) in the target language.
    The aligned corpus is used as a reference, or database corpus, and represents Champollion' s knowledge of both languages.
    Champollion uses statistical methods to incrementally construct the collocation translation, adding on
