    In this paper, we focus on the particular task of classifying subcategorization frame (SCF) distributions in a semantically motivated manner.
    Previous research has demonstrated that clustering can be useful in inferring Levin-style semantic classes (Levin, 1993) from both English and German verb subcategorization information (Brew and Schulte im Walde, 2002; Schulte im Walde, 2000; Schulte im Walde and Brew, 2002).
    We propose a novel approach, which involves: (i) obtaining SCF frequency information from a lexicon extracted automatically using the comprehensive system of Briscoe and Carroll (1997) and (ii) applying a clustering mechanism to this information.
    We use clustering methods that process raw distributional data directly, avoiding complex preprocessing steps required by many advanced methods (e.g.
    Brew and Schulte im Walde (2002)).
    In contrast to earlier work, we give special emphasis to polysemy.
    Earlier work has largely ignored t
