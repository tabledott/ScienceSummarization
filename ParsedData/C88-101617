e, l f ) ,  R(kle,) , and Q(51e,), and a method of finding the pattern $ maximizing P(E,$ [ F).
  A good starting point is as follows: A.
  Make Q(ejle,) = l /K,  where K is the size of the English vocabulary.
  73 g. l.et R(I  [e,) = 0 .8 ,  R(01?)
  = 0.1, R(2 I&lt;)  = R(31&lt;) = R(4 I g) = R(5 I e,) = 0.025 for all words e, except he null word ell l,et R(0 le0) = 1.0.
  C. To determine the initial distribution P(e, l f )  proceed as Iollows: (i) Estimate first P(&lt; If ) by tile algorithm of Section 3.
  (ii) Compute the mutual information values l(e,; f )  by formula (Y2), and for each f find the 20 words e, for which I(e,;f) is largest.
  (iii) I.ct P(&lt;~I./) = P(&lt; l f )  = ( I /21)  - e for all words&lt;on the list obtained in OiL whEre e is some small positive number.
  l)istributc the remaining probability e uniformly over all the I nglish words not on the list.
