positionality.
    They evaluate this by comparing the extracted items with those listed in existing dictionaries, and report that it offers no improvement in extracting MWEs over existing techniques.
    The assumption that non-compositionality is requisite for the presence of a MWE in a dictionary, while interesting, is not well-founded, and hence it does not seem to us that the poor results reflect a failure of the LSA approach in measuring compositionality.
    Bannard (2002) used a combination of hand-built thesauri and corpus statistics to explore the compositionality of VPCs.
    The task was to predict whether the verb and/or the particle were contributing meaning to a given item, using statistical analysis of a set of VPCs extracted from the Wall Street Journal section of the Penn Treebank (Marcus et al., 1993).
    Two techniques were used.
    The first of these loosely followed Lin in measuring the extent to which the component verb or particle of any VPC could be replaced with items of a similar
