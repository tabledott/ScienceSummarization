3 tree to an appropriate set of dependency relations, and the process requires a certain amount of intuition and skill.
    For our experiments we tried to define a conversion that gives appropriate credit to the dependencies that can be read from the trees without relying on an undue amount of sophisticated linguistic knowledge5.
  
  
    We conducted our experiments by preparing versions of the test sentences in the form appropriate to each system.
    We used a configuration of the XLE parser that expects sentences conforming to ordinary text conventions to appear in a file separated by double line-feeds.
    A certain amount of effort was required to remove the part-ofspeech tags and labeled brackets of the WSJ corpus in a way that restored the sentences to a standard English format (for example, to remove the space between wo and n&#8217;t that remains when the POS tags are removed).
    Since the PARC 700 treats proper names as multiword expressions, we then augmented the input strings with XML markup
