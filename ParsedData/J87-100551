ccurs free in either r or s (and by induction in or s') so u(p) = {x} U u, U u, &#8212; {xl = u.
    If the quantification of x is vacuous, then U(r') = u, and U(s') = u, and Vacuous quantified variables can be divided into v&#8222; and vs similarly.
    Suppose the quantification of x is vacuous (i.e., x does not occur free in r or s).
    Then V V(a) = {x} U v, U v. By the induction hypothesis, V(I) = V(r) = v, and V(s') = V(s) = v,.
    Also by induction, x does not occur free in or s'.
    Therefore, the quantification of x in p is also vacuous and V(13) = {x} U v,U v, = V(a).
    If the quantification of x is not vacuous, then v = v, U v, and x occurs free in either r or s. By inducation, x occurs free in either or s' so the quantification of x in g is also non-vacuous.
    Also by induction as before, V(I) = v,. and V(s') = v&#8222; so pull(a,b): This follows directly, using the previously proved induction steps for apply-terms and pullopaque-args. gen(a): This follows directly, using the previously pro
