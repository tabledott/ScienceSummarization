of all sentences.
    Here we summarize the most important preprocessing steps for those constructions that do not involve non-local dependencies.
    Preprocessing steps required for constructions involving non-local dependencies (i.e., traces or null elements in the Treebank) are mentioned in Section 6.
    Remaining problems are discussed in Section 7.
    More detailed and complete descriptions can be found in the CCGbank manual.
    Annotation errors and inconsistencies in the Treebank affect the quality of any extracted grammar or lexicon.
    This is especially true for formalisms with an extended domain of locality, such as TAG or CCG, where a single elementary tree or lexical category may contain information that is distributed over a number of distinct phrase-structure rules.
    Part-of-Speech Tagging Errors.
    Ratnaparkhi (1996) estimates a POS tagging error rate of 3% in the Treebank.
    The translation algorithm is sensitive to these errors and inconsistencies, because POS tagging errors can
