 person whom he believes to be the spy, or if there is some actual spy who has given John good cause for his suspicions.
    However, S may not be actual, only possible.
    Suppose this is the case.
    One common objection to possible individuals is that they may seem to violate the Law of the Excluded Middle.
    Is S married or not married?
    Our intuition is that the question is inappropriate, and indeed the answer given in our formalism has this flavor.
    By axiom (3), married(S) is really just an abbreviation for marrierr(E,S) A Ezist(E).
    This is false, for the existence of E in the real world would imply the existence of S. So married(S) is also false.
    But its falsity has nothing to do with S's marital status, only his existential status.
    The predication unmarried(S) is false for the same reason.
    The primed predicates are basic, and for them the problem of the excluded middle does not arise.
    The predication married( E, S) is true or false depending on whether E is the condition
