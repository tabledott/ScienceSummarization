is attracting considerable attention.
    This is because natural language processing applications usually require disambiguated or ranked parse results, and statistical modeling of syntactic/semantic preference is one of the most promising methods for disambiguation.
    The focus of this article is the problem of probabilistic modeling of wide-coverage HPSG parsing.
    Although previous studies have proposed maximum entropy models (Berger, Della Pietra, and Della Pietra 1996) of HPSG-style parse trees (Oepen, Toutanova, et al. 2002b; Toutanova and Manning 2002; Baldridge and Osborne 2003; Malouf and van Noord 2004), the straightforward application of maximum entropy models to wide-coverage HPSG parsing is infeasible because estimation of maximum entropy models is computationally expensive, especially when targeting wide-coverage parsing.
    In general, complete structures, such as transition sequences in Markov models and parse trees, have an exponential number of ambiguities.
    This causes an exponenti
