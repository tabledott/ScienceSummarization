 word appearing less than TC times per a million words4.
    Now define a meta-pattern as any sequence of HFWs and CWs.
    In this paper we require that meta-patterns obey the following constraints: (1) at most 4 words; (2) exactly two content words; (3) no two consecutive CWs.
    The rationale is to see what can be achieved using relatively short patterns and where the discovered categories contain single words only.
    We will relax these constraints in future papers.
    Our meta-patterns here are thus of four types: CHC, CHCH, CHHC, and HCHC.
    In order to focus on patterns that are more likely to provide high quality categories, we removed patterns that appear in the corpus less than TP times per million words.
    Since we can ensure that the number of HFWs is bounded, the total number of pattern candidates is bounded as well.
    Hence, this stage can be computed in time linear in the size of the corpus (assuming the corpus has been already pre-processed to allow direct access to a word by its ind
