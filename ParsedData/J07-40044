by developing a new model and efficient parsing algorithm which exploits all derivations, including CCG&#8217;s nonstandard derivations.
    This model and parsing algorithm, when combined with normal-form constraints, give state-of-the-art accuracy for the recovery of predicate&#8211;argument dependencies from CCGbank.
    The parser is also evaluated on DepBank and compared against the RASP parser, outperforming RASP overall and on the majority of relation types.
    The evaluation on DepBank raises a number of issues regarding parser evaluation.
    This article provides a comprehensive blueprint for building a wide-coverage CCG parser.
    We demonstrate that both accurate and highly efficient parsing is possible with CCG.
  
  
    Log-linear models have been applied to a number of problems in NLP, for example, POS tagging (Ratnaparkhi 1996; Lafferty, McCallum, and Pereira 2001), named entity recognition (Borthwick 1999), chunking (Koeling 2000), and parsing (Johnson et al. 1999).
