hat are to be applied as a batch and construct the relation [UkRk]*.
    Because of closure under union, this relation is regular and includes all pairs of strings that are identical except for substrings that differ according to the rewriting specified by at least one of the rules.
    But also as we have seen several times before, this relation does not completely simulate the batch application of the rules.
    In particular, it does not allow for overlap between the material that satisfies the application requirements of one rule in the set with the elements that sanction a previous application of another rule.
    As usual, we account for this new array of overlapping dependencies by introducing a larger set of special marking symbols and carefully managing their occurrences and interactions.
    A batch rule is a set of subrules {01 1p1 /Al '/A' pn together with a specification of the standard parameters of application (left-to-right, obligatory, etc.).
    We use superscripts to distinguish the compone
