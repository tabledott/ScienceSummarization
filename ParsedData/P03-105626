improvement was in recall: precision improved by 0.3% to the final figure, whereas recall jumped by 3.4%.
    We interpret these results as indicating that we have unlocked a heretofore undiscovered space of independence-assumption refinements for CTB parsing, suggesting that there is still considerable room for improvement in CTB parsing even with a small (90,000-word) training set; a parser-combining model such as that proposed in (Henderson and Brill, 1999), for example, might be effective here.
    This is an encouraging result for the use of detailed error analysis followed by focused treestructure enhancements to improved parser performance.
    However, we found two limitations to our methodology.
    First, some important and addressable error types are relatively rare in Treebank data.
    The 100-sentence chunk of development data we chose to analyze simply did not contain any instances of BA, discussed above in Section 4.3, but errors involving BA occurred three times elsewhere in the development s
