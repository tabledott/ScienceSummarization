of groups using various criteria&#8212;for example, four senses can be grouped in a group they call Group 1 on the basis of subcategorization frame similarities (Table 9).
    Palmer, Dang, and Fellbaum (2007) achieved for the English Verb Lexical Sense task of SENSEVAL-2 a percentage agreement among coders of 82% with grouped senses, as opposed to 71% with the original WordNet senses.
    Bruce and Wiebe (1998) found that collapsing the senses of their test word (interest) on the basis of their use by coders and merging the two classes found to be harder to distinguish resulted in an increase of the value of K from 0.874 to 0.898.
    Using a related technique, V&#180;eronis (1998) found that agreement on noun word sense tagging went up from a K of around 0.45 to a K of 0.86.
    We should note, however, that the post hoc merging of categories is not equivalent to running a study with fewer categories to begin with.
    Attempts were also made to develop techniques to measure partial agreement with hierarchi
