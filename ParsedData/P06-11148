er question.
    Following (Groenendijk, 1999), we expect that if a question ?q logically entails another question ?q', then some subset of the answers entailed by ?q' should also be interpreted as valid answers to ?q.
    By establishing TE between a question and AGQs derived from passages identified by the Q/A system for that question, we expect we can identify a set of answer passages that contain correct answers to the original question.
    For example, in Table 2, we find that entailment between questions indicates the correctness of a candidate answer: here, establishing that Q2 entails AGQs and AGQ2 (but not AGQ3 or AGQ4) enables the system to select A2 as the correct answer.
    When at least one of the AGQs generated by the AutoQUAB module is entailed by the original question, all AGQs that do not reach TE are filtered from consideration; remaining passages are assigned an entailment confidence score and are sent to the AP module in order to provide an exact answer to the question.
