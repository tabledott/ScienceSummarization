ion, we ignore the fact that there can be a large number of possible segmentations and assume that there is only one segmentation.
    In the previous section, we have described the alignment within the phrases.
    For the alignment af&#8216; between the source phrases &#235; and the target phrases fr, we obtain the following equation: For the phrase level alignment we use a first-order alignment model p(aklaki-1 K) = P(ak lak-i, K) which is in addition constrained to be a permutation of the K phrases.
    For the translation of one phrase, we introduce the alignment template as an unknown variable: The probability p(z1e) to apply an alignment template gets estimated by relative frequencies (see next section).
    The probability p(f lz, e) is decomposed by Eq.
    (2).
    In this section we show how we obtain the parameters of our translation model by using a parallel training corpus: rections f e and e &#8212;+ f by applying the EM-algorithm.
    However we do not apply maximum approximation in training,
