    Each abstract comes with two sets of keywords assigned by professional indexers: controlled keywords, restricted to a given thesaurus, and uncontrolled keywords, freely assigned by the indexers.
    We follow the evaluation approach from (Hulth, 2003), and use the uncontrolled set of keywords.
    In her experiments, Hulth is using a total of 2000 abstracts, divided into 1000 for training, 500 for development, and 500 for test2.
    Since our approach is completely unsupervised, no training/development data is required, and we are only using the test docu2Many thanks to Anette Hulth for allowing us to run our algorithm on the data set used in her keyword extraction experiments, and for making available the training/test/development data split. ments for evaluation purposes.
    The results are evaluated using precision, recall, and F-measure.
    Notice that the maximum recall that can be achieved on this collection is less than 100%, since indexers were not
