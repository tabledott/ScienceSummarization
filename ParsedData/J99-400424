nce using the parser is the sum of the value of all item derivations of the goal item.
    Just as with grammar derivations, individual item derivations are finite, but there may be infinitely many item or grammar derivations of a sentence.
    We say that al ' b' &#8226; ak c1 ci is an instantiation of deduction rule A1 ' &#8226; ' &#8212;1 .
    . whenever the first expression is a variable-free instance of the second; that is, the first expression is the result of consistently substituting constant terms for each variable in the second.
    Now, we can define an item derivation tree.
    Intuitively, an item derivation Grammar derivation, grammar derivation tree, item derivation tree, and derivation value. tree for x just gives a way of deducing x from the grammar rules.
    We define an item derivation tree recursively.
    The base case is rules of the grammar: (r) is an item derivation tree, where r is a rule of the grammar.
    Also, if D a&#8222; .
    .
    .
    , Da&#8222; , Da, are derivation tree
