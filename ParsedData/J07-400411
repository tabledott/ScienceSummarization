 1999).
    One possible criticism of CCG has been that highly efficient parsing is not possible because of the additional &#8220;spurious&#8221; derivations.
    In fact, we show that a novel method which tightly integrates the supertagger and parser leads to parse times significantly faster than those reported for comparable parsers in the literature.
    The parser is evaluated on CCGbank (available through the Linguistic Data Consortium).
    In order to facilitate comparisons with parsers using different formalisms, we also evaluate on the publicly available DepBank (King et al. 2003), using the Briscoe and Carroll annotation consistent with the RASP parser (Briscoe, Carroll, and Watson 2006).
    The dependency annotation is designed to be as theory-neutral as possible to allow easy comparison.
    However, there are still considerable difficulties associated with a cross-formalism comparison, which we describe.
    Even though the CCG dependencies are being mapped into another representation, the accur
