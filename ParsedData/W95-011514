d adjectives with past participles.
    These considerations are further complicated by the differences in the tag sets used by taggers for different languages.
    To maximize the filter's effectiveness, tag sets must be remapped to a more general common tag set, which ignores many of the language-specific details.
    Otherwise, correct translation pairs would be filtered out because of superficial differences like tense and capitalization.
    The different ways to remap different tag sets into a more general common tag set represent a number of design decisions.
    Fortunately, BiBLE provided an objective criterion for tag set design, and a fast evaluation method.
    The English half of the corpus was tagged using Brill's transformation-based tagger [Bri92].
    The French half was kindly tagged by George Foster of CITI.
    Then, BiBLE was used to select among several possible generalizations of the two tag sets.
    The resulting optimal tag set is shown in Table 2.
