signing an item to that category: P(k|c1) &#183; P(k|c2).4 Expected agreement is then the probability of c1 and c2 agreeing on any category, that is, the sum of the product over all categories: The difference between S, &#960;, and &#954; lies in the assumptions leading to the calculation of P(k|ci), the chance that coder ci will assign an arbitrary item to category k (Zwick 1988; Hsu and Field 2003).
    S: This coefficient is based on the assumption that if coders were operating by chance alone, we would get a uniform distribution: That is, for any two coders cm, cn and any two categories kj, kl, P(kj|cm) = P(kl|cn). &#960;: If coders were operating by chance alone, we would get the same distribution for each coder: For any two coders cm, cn and any category k, P(k|cm) = P(k|cn). &#954;: If coders were operating by chance alone, we would get a separate distribution for each coder.
    Additionally, the lack of independent prior knowledge of the distribution of items among categories means that the distribut
