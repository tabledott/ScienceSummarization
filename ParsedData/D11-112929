ar meaning can be renormalised in practice.
    Therefore the delta between HIGH means and LOW mean cannot serve as a definite indication of the practical applicability (or lack thereof) of semantic models; the means are provided just to aid comparison with the results of the first experiment.
    Model Parameters As in the first experiment, the lexical vectors from (Mitchell and Lapata, 2008) were used for the other models evaluated (additive, multiplicative and baseline)8 and for the noun vec8Kintsch was not evaluated as it required optimising model parameters against a held-out segment of the test set, and we could not replicate the methodology of Mitchell and Lapata tors of our categorical model.
    Transitive verb vectors were trained as described in &#167;4 with S = N&#8855;N.
    Second Experiment Results The results for the models evaluated against the second dataset are presented in Table 5.
    We observe a significant (according to p &lt; 0.0.5) improvement in the alignment of our categorical mode
