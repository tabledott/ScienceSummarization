TSM is 2 which is closer to SW.
			It is however not clear how well BLEU and NIST discriminate simplification systems.
			As discussed in Jurafsky and Martin (2008), ?BLEU does poorly at comparing systems with radically different architectures and is most appropriate when evaluating incremental changes with similar architectures.?
			In our case, TSM andCSS can be considered as having similar architec tures as both of them can do splitting, dropping 9http://www.statmt.org/moses/ 1359 TokLen SenLen #Sen BLEU NIST #Same Flesch Lix(Grade) OOV% PPL CW 4.95 27.81 100 0.50 6.89 100 49.1 53.0 (10) 52.9 384 SW 4.76 17.86 131 1.00 10.98 3 60.4 (PE) 44.1 (8) 50.7 179 Moses 4.81 26.08 100 0.55 7.47 25 54.8 48.1 (9) 52.0 363 C 4.98 18.02 103 0.28 5.37 1 56.2 45.9 (8) 51.7 481 CS 4.90 18.11 103 0.19 4.51 0 59.1 45.1 (8) 49.5 616 CSS 4.98 10.20 182 0.18 4.42 0 65.5 (PE) 38.3 (6) 53.4 581 TSM 4.76 13.57 180 0.38 6.21 2 67.4 (PE) 36.7 (5) 50.8 353 Table 9: Evaluation and substitution.
