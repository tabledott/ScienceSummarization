in real-world NLP tasks due to their limited coverage and prescriptive nature (i.e. they do not include semantic relations that are plausible but not guaranteed).
    For example, it may be valuable to know that if someone has bought an item, they may sell it at a later time.
    WordNet does not include the relation &amp;quot;X buys Y&amp;quot; happens-before &amp;quot;X sells Y&amp;quot; since it is possible to sell something without having bought it (e.g. having manufactured or stolen it).
    Verbs are the primary vehicle for describing events and expressing relations between entities.
    Hence, verb semantics could help in many natural language processing (NLP) tasks that deal with events or relations between entities.
    For tasks which require canonicalization of natural language statements or derivation of plausible inferences from such statements, a particularly valuable resource is one which (i) relates verbs to one another and (ii) provides broad coverage of the verbs in the target language.
