t both words are unaligned.
    The ranking of these different methods varies for different training corpus sizes.
    For instance, the alignment f2e starts out second to worst for the 10,000 sentence pair corpus, but ultimately is competitive with the best method at 320,000 sentence pairs.
    The base heuristic is initially the best, but then drops off.
    The discrepancy between the best and the worst method is quite large, about 0.02 BLEU.
    For almost all training corpus sizes, the heuristic diag-and performs best, albeit not always significantly.
    The initial word alignment for collecting phrase pairs is generated by symmetrizing IBM Model 4 alignments.
    Model 4 is computationally expensive, and only approximate solutions exist to estimate its parameters.
    The IBM Models 1-3 are faster and easier to implement.
    For IBM Model 1 and 2 word alignments can be computed efficiently without relying on approximations.
