gh this is a very attractive proposition that defines both paraphrase generation and recognition in terms of textual entailment, there are some important caveats.
    For example, textual entailment cannot guarantee that the entailed hypothesis H captures all of the same meaning as the given text T. Consider the following example: Although both H1 and H2 are entailed by T, they are not strictly paraphrases of T because some of the semantic content has not been carried over.
    This must be an important consideration when building the proposed entailment engine.
    Of course, even these approximately semantically equivalent constructions may prove useful in an appropriate downstream application.
    The relationship between paraphrasing and entailment is more tightly entwined than it might appear.
    Entailment recognition systems sometimes rely on the use of paraphrastic templates or patterns as inputs (Iftene 2009) and might even use paraphrase recognition to improve their performance (Bosma and Callison-
