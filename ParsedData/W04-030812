dependents this is not a problem, as can be seen in (5), which can be processed by alternating Shift and Left-Reduce.
    But in (1) the sequence of reductions has to be performed from right to left as it were, which rules out strict incrementality.
    However, whereas the structures exemplified in (6&#8211;7) can never be processed incrementally within the present framework, the structure in (1) can be handled by modifying the parsing strategy, as we shall see in the next section.
    It is instructive at this point to make a comparison with incremental parsing based on extended categorial grammar, where the structures in (6&#8211;7) would normally be handled by some kind of concatenation (or product), which does not correspond to any real semantic combination of the constituents (Steedman, 2000; Morrill, 2000).
    By contrast, the structure in (1) would typically be handled by function composition, which corresponds to a well-defined compositional semantic operation.
    Hence, it might be argued that the
