ven no idea of why this should be, so we reserve final judgement on this matter.
    Also contrary to expectations, the error analysis suggests that there has been no improvement in either the handing of unknown words, nor prepositional phrases.
    Rather, there is a general improvement in intermediate-length sentences (20-50 words), but no improvement at the extremes: a phenomenon we call the Goldilocks effect.
    The only specific syntactic phenomenon that seems to be affected is conjunctions.
    However, this is good news since conjunctions have long been considered the hardest of parsing problems.
    There are many ways in which this research should be continued.
    First, the error analysis needs to be improved.
    Our tentative guess for why sentences with unknown words failed to improve should be verified or disproven.
    Second, there are many other ways to use self-trained information in parsing.
    Indeed, the current research was undertaken as the control experiment in a program to try much
