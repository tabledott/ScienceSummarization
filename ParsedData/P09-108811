arameters, ON zi &#8212; Dirichlet(aT), and integrate out (Nzi.
    This results in the conditional probability: where nN,&#8722;i ri,zi is the count of rewriting zi with nonterminal rule ri, nN,&#8722;i &#183;,zi the total count over all nonterminal rules and |N |is the number of unique non-terminal rules.
    For terminal productions (ti = TERM) we first decide whether to generate a phrase in both languages or in one language only, according to a fixed probability pnull.3 Contingent on this decision, the terminal strings are then drawn from 3To discourage null alignments, we used Pnuu = 10&#8722;10 for this value in the experiments we report below. either &#966;Pzi for phrase pairs or &#966;null for single language phrases.
    We choose Dirichlet process (DP) priors for these parameters: zi where the base distributions, P1P and Pnull 1 , range over phrase pairs or monolingual phrases in either language, respectively.
    The most important choice for our model is the priors on the parameters of these termi
