y counting the number of times that x is followed by y in a window of w words, f(x,y), and normalizing by N. The window size parameter allows us to look at different scales.
    Smaller window sizes will identify fixed expressions (idioms) and other relations that hold over short ranges; larger window sizes will highlight semantic concepts and other relationships that hold over larger scales.
    For the remainder of this paper, the window size, w, will be set to 5 words as a compromise; this setting is large enough to show some of the constraints between verbs and arguments, but not so large that it would wash out constraints that make use of strict adjacency.1 Since the association ratio becomes unstable when the counts are very small, we will not discuss word pairs with f(x,y) S 5.
    An improvement would make use of t-scores, and throw out pairs that were not significant.
    Unfortunately, this requires an estimate of the variance of f(x,y), which goes beyond the scope of this paper.
    For the remaind
