ext (global or local) and topics for all the words in the collection except for the considered word at position i in document d; y is the vector of sentiment ratings.
    The first factor &#951;d,i v,r,z is responsible for modeling co-occurrences on the window and document level and coherence of the topics.
    This factor is proportional to the conditional distribution used in the Gibbs sampler of the MG-LDA model (Titov and McDonald, 2008).
    The last factor quantifies the influence of the assignment of the word (d, i) on the probability of the sentiment ratings.
    It appears only if ratings are known (observable) and equals: where the probability distribution is computed as defined in expression (1), yda is the rating for the ath aspect of review d.
  
  
    In this section we present qualitative and quantitative experiments.
    For the qualitative analysis we show that topics inferred by the MAS model correspond directly to the associated aspects.
    For the quantitative analysis we show that the M
