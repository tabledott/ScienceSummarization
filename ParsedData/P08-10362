e the goal is to find the set of relevant aspects for a rated entity and extract all textual mentions that are associated with each.
    Aspects can be fine-grained, e.g., fish, lamb, calamari, or coarse-grained, e.g., food, decor, service.
    Similarly, extracted text can range from a single word to phrases and sentences.
    The second problem is sentiment classification.
    Once all the relevant aspects and associated pieces of texts are extracted, the system should aggregate sentiment over each aspect to provide the user with an average numeric or symbolic rating.
    Sentiment classification is a well studied problem (Wiebe, 2000; Pang et al., 2002; Turney, 2002) and in many domains users explicitly provide ratings for each aspect making automated means unnecessary.2 Aspect identification has also been thoroughly studied (Hu and Liu, 2004b; Gamon et al., 2005; Titov and McDonald, 2008), but again, ontologies and users often provide this information negating the need for automation.
