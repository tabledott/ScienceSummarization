r training.
  
  
    For all experiments, we used sections 2-20 of the PDTB for training and sections 21-22 for testing.
    Sections 0-1 were used as a development set for feature design.
    We ran four binary classification tasks to identify each of the main relations from the rest.
    As each of the relations besides Expansion are infrequent, we train using equal numbers of positive and negative examples of the target relation.
    The negative examples were chosen at random.
    We used all of sections 21 and 22 for testing, so the test set is representative of the natural distribution.
    The training sets contained: Comparison (1927 positive, 1927 negative), Contingency (3500 each), Expansion3 (6356 each), and Temporal (730 each).
    The test set contained: 151 examples of Comparison, 291 examples of Contingency, 986 examples of Expansion, 82 examples of Temporal, and 13 examples of No-relation.
    We used Naive Bayes, Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt), and AdaBoost (Freund and Schapire, 1996) classifiers
