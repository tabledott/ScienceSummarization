   Using triangulation in conjunction with the standard phrase-table improved over the standard system in most instances, and only degraded performance once.
    The improvement is largest for the German tasks which can be explained by triangulation providing better robustness to noisy alignments (which are often quite poor for German) and better estimates of low-count events.
    The difficulty of aligning German with the other languages is apparent from the Giza++ perplexity: the final Model 4 perplexities for German are quite high, as much as double the perplexity for more easily aligned language pairs (e.g., Spanish-French).
    Figure 3 shows the effect of triangulation on different sized corpora for the language pair fr &#8594; en.
    It presents learning curves for the standard system and a triangulated system using one language (es).
    As can be seen, gains from triangulation only diminish slightly for larger training corpora, and that the purely triangulated models have very competitive performanc
