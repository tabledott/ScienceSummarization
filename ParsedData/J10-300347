nts are performed with the automatic translations.
    Finally, an even more direct method to align equivalences in parallel sentence pairs can be effected by building on word alignment techniques from the field of statistical machine translation (Brown et al. 1990).
    Current state-of-the-art SMT methods rely on unsupervised induction of word alignment between two bilingual parallel sentences to extract translation equivalences that can then be used to translate a given sentence in one language into another language.
    The same methods can be applied to monolingual parallel sentences without any loss of generality.
    Quirk, Brockett, and Dolan (2004) use one such method to extract phrasal paraphrase pairs.
    Furthermore, they use these extracted phrasal pairs to construct sentential paraphrases for new sentences.
    Mathematically, Quirk, Brockett, and Dolan&#8217;s approach to sentential paraphrase generation may be expressed in terms of the typical channel model equation for statistical machine tr
