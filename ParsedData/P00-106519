tering; 97.9% of instances of nominal head words were in the vocabulary.
    Adding clustering statistics for NP constituents into the full system increased overall performance from 80.4% to 81.2%.
    The experiments described above have used human annotated frame element boundaries &#8212; here we address how well the frame elements can be found automatically.
    Experiments were conducted using features similar to those described above to identify constituents in a sentence's parse tree that were likely to be frame elements.
    The system was given the human-annotated target word and the frame as inputs, whereas a full language understanding system would also identify which frames come into play in a sentence &#8212; essentially the task of word sense disambiguation.
    The main feature used was the path from the target word through the parse tree to the constituent in question, represented as a string of parse tree nonterminals frame element &amp;quot;He&amp;quot; to the target word &amp;quot;ate&amp;q
