ur model.We also provide evaluation measures for the sen tences in the evaluation dataset: CW: complexsentences from Normal Wikipedia and SW: par allel simple sentences from Simple Wikipedia.
			6.1 Basic Statistics and Examples.
			The first three columns in Tab.
			9 present the ba sic statistics for the evaluation sentences and theoutput of the five systems.
			tokenLen is the aver age length of tokens which may roughly reflect the lexical difficulty.
			TSM achieves an average token length which is the same as the Simple Wikipedia (SW).
			senLen is the average number of tokens inone sentence, which may roughly reflect the syn tactic complexity.
			Both TSM and CSS produce shorter sentences than SW.
			Moses is very close to CW.
			#sen gives the number of sentences.
			Moses, C and CS cannot split sentences and thus produce about the same number of sentences as available in CW.
			Here are two example results obtained with our TSM system.Example 1.
