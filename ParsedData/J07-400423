otential impact of LTAG supertagging on parsing speed and accuracy by performing a number of oracle experiments.
    They find that, with the perfect supertagger, extremely high parsing accuracies and speeds can be obtained.
    Interestingly, the accuracy of LTAG supertaggers using automatically extracted grammars is significantly below the accuracy of the CCG supertagger.
    One possible way to increase the accuracy of LTAG supertagging is to use a Maximum Entropy, rather than HMM, tagger (as discussed previously), but this is likely to result in an improvement of only a few percentage points.
    Thus whether the difference in supertagging accuracy is due to the nature of the formalisms, the supertagging methods used, or properties of the extracted grammars, is an open question.
    Related work on statistical parsing with CCG will be described in Section 3.
