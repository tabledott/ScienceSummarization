s for the same sentence.
    However, this approach uses many heuristics and is based on the alignment that is performed to calculate a specific MT error measure; the performance improvements are reported only in terms of this measure.
    Here, we propose an alignment procedure that explicitly models reordering of words in the hypotheses.
    In contrast to existing approaches, the context of the whole document rather than a single sentence is considered in this iterative, unsupervised procedure, yielding a more reliable alignment.
    Based on the alignment, we construct a confusion network from the (possibly reordered) translation hypotheses, similarly to the approach of (Bangalore et al., 2001).
    Using global system probabilities and other statistical models, the voting procedure selects the best consensus hypothesis from the confusion network.
    This consensus translation may be different from the original translations.
    This paper is organized as follows.
    In Section 2, we will describe the c
