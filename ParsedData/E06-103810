 best compression.
    This table can be filled in O(n2).
    This algorithm is really an extension of Viterbi to the case when scores factor over dynamic substrings of the text (Sarawagi and Cohen, 2004; McDonald et al., 2005a).
    As such, we can use back-pointers to reconstruct the highest scoring compression as well as k-best decoding algorithms.
    This decoding algorithm is dynamic with respect to compression rate.
    That is, the algorithm will return the highest scoring compression regardless of length.
    This may seem problematic since longer compressions might contribute more to the score (since they contain more bigrams) and thus be preferred.
    However, in Section 3.2 we define a rich feature set, including features on words dropped from the compression that will help disfavor compressions that drop very few words since this is rarely seen in the training data.
    In fact, it turns out that our learned compressions have a compression rate very similar to the gold standard.
    That said, t
