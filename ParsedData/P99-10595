ry production in P has one of the following forms: Thus every nonterminal is lexicalized at some terminal a.
    A constituent of nonterminal type A[a] is said to have terminal symbol a as its lexical head, &amp;quot;inherited&amp;quot; from the constituent's head child in the parse tree (e.g., C[a]).
    Notice that the start symbol is necessarily a lexicalized nonterminal, T[$].
    Hence $ appears in every string of L(G); it is usually convenient to define G so that the language of interest is actually L' (G) = {x : x$ E L (G)} Such a grammar can encode lexically specific preferences.
    For example, P might contain the productions in order to allow the derivation VP[solve] solve two puzzles, but meanwhile omit the similar productions since puzzles are not edible, a goat is not solvable, &amp;quot;sleep&amp;quot; is intransitive, and &amp;quot;goat&amp;quot; cannot take plural determiners.
    (A stochastic version of the grammar could implement &amp;quot;soft preferences&amp;quot; by allowing the rules i
