 Categorial Grammar (CCG) assign one or more syntactic structures to each word in a sentencewhich are then manipulated by the parser.
			Supertag ging was introduced for LTAG as a way of increasingparsing efficiency by reducing the number of struc tures assigned to each word (Bangalore and Joshi, 1999).
			Supertagging has more recently been applied to CCG (Clark, 2002; Curran and Clark, 2003).Supertagging accuracy is relatively high for man ually constructed LTAGs (Bangalore and Joshi,1999).
			However, for LTAGs extracted automati cally from the Penn Treebank, performance is much lower (Chen et al, 1999; Chen et al, 2002).
			In fact, performance for such grammars is below that needed for successful integration into a full parser (Sarkar et al, 2000).
			In this paper we demonstratethat CCG supertagging accuracy is not only sufficient for accurate and robust parsing using an auto matically extracted grammar, but also offers several practical advantages.
