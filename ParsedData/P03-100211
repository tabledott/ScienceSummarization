    Figure 5 illustrates three examples of this situation.

    Similarly, in Figure 5(b), the relative clause is featured only by the relative pronoun that, whereas the verb occurred should also be taken into account.
    Figure 5(c) shows another example of an infinitive verb phrase, in which the head word is to, whereas the verb declared should also be considered.
    Based on these observations, we introduced in FS2 the CONTENT WORD (cw), which adds a new lexicalization from the argument constituent for better content representation.
    To select the content words we used the heuristics illustrated in Figure 6.
    After implementing FS1, we noticed that the hw feature was rarely used, and we believe that this happens because of data sparsity.
    The same was noticed for the cw feature from FS2.
    Therefore we decided to add two new features, namely t
