 or elementary tree pairs ('y, &#945;), where: of packed forests instead of pairs of trees.
    Since a packed forest is much more likely to include the correct tree, it is less likely that parser errors will cause good rules to be filtered out.
    However, even on human-annotated data, treeto-tree extraction misses many rules, and many such rules would seem to be useful.
    For example, in Figure 2, the whole English phrase &#8220;Taiwan&#8217;s...shores&#8221; is an NP, but its Chinese counterpart is not a constituent.
    Furthermore, neither &#8220;surplus...shores&#8221; nor its Chinese counterpart are constituents.
    But both rules are arguably useful for translation.
    Wellington et al. therefore argue that in order to extract as many rules as possible, a more powerful formalism than synchronous CFG/TSG is required: for example, generalized multitext grammar (Melamed et al., 2004), which is equivalent to synchronous set-local multicomponent CFG/TSG (Weir, 1988).
    But the problem illustrated in
