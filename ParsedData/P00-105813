 times replaced with the symbol *UNKNOWN*), but if we consider elementary tree templates, the grammar is quite manageable: 3626 tree templates, of which 2039 occur more than once (see Figure 4).
    The 616 most frequent tree-template types account for 99% of tree-template tokens in the training data.
    Removing all but these trees from the grammar increased the error rate by about 5% (testing on a subset of section 00).
    A few of the most frequent tree-templates are shown in Figure 3.
    So the extracted grammar is fairly compact, but how complete is it?
    If we plot the growth of the grammar during training (Figure 5), it's not clear the grammar will ever converge, even though the very idea of a grammar requires it.
    Three possible explanations are: In a random sample of 100 once-seen elementary tree templates, we found (by casual inspection) that 34 resulted from annotation errors, 50 from deficiencies in the heuristics, and four apparently from performance errors.
    Only twelve appeared to be
