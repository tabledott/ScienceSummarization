tices were Algorithm 4 (Barzilay and Lee 2003).
    Generate set M of matching lattice pairs given a pair of comparable corpora C1 and C2.
    Summary.
    Gather topically related sentences from C1 into clusters.
    Do the same for C2.
    Convert each sentence cluster into a slotted lattice using a multiple-sequence alignment (MSA) algorithm.
    Compare all lattice pairs and output those likely to be paraphrastic. generated, comparing the sentences that were written on the same day and computing a comparison score based on overlap between the sets of arguments that fill the slots.
    If this computed score is greater than some fixed threshold value b, then the two lattices (or patterns) are considered to be paraphrases of each other.
    Besides generating pairs of paraphrastic patterns, the authors go one step further and actually use the patterns to generate paraphrases for new sentences.
    Given such a sentence S, the first step is to find an existing slotted lattice from either corpus that aligns b
