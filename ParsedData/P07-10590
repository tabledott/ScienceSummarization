  Statistical Machine Translation for Query Expansion in Answer Retrieval
  
    We present an approach to query expansion in answer retrieval that uses Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) techniques to bridge the lexical gap between questions and answers.
    SMT-based query expansion is done by i) using a full-sentence paraphraser to introduce synonyms in context of the entire query, and ii) by translating query terms into answer terms using a full-sentence SMT model trained on question-answer pairs.
    We evaluate these global, context-aware query expansion techon from 10 million question-answer pairs extracted from FAQ pages.
    Experimental results show that SMTbased expansion improves retrieval performance over local expansion and over retrieval without expansion.
  
  
    One of the fundamental problems in Question Answering (QA) has been recognized to be the &#8220;lexical chasm&#8221; (Berger et al., 2000) between question strings and answer strings.
    This problem is manifested in a mismatch
