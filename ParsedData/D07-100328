ithm, allowing fuzzy word align ments through WordNet expansion; both results are reported.The second baseline is the approximate tree matching work by Punyakanok et al (2004).
			Their algorithm measures the similarity between ?q and ?a by computing tree edit distance.
			Our replication is close to the algorithm they describe, with one subtle difference.
			Punyakanok et al used answer-typing in computing edit distance; this is not available in our dataset (and our method does not explicitly carry out answer-typing).
			Their heuristics for reformulating questions into statements were not replicated.
			Wedid, however, apply WordNet type-checking and ap proximate, penalized lexical matching.
			Both results are reported.
