se are from the MUC conferences (MUC-6, 1995; MUC7, 1997) and four are from the Automatic Content Evaluation (ACE) Program (NIST, 2004).
    In this section, we outline the differences between the MUC and ACE coreference resolution tasks, and define terminology for the rest of the paper.
    Noun phrase coreference resolution is the process of determining whether two noun phrases (NPs) refer to the same real-world entity or concept.
    It is related to anaphora resolution: a NP is said to be anaphoric if it depends on another NP for interpretation.
    Consider the following: John Hall is the new CEO.

    As discussed in depth elsewhere (e.g. van Deemter and Kibble (2000)), the notions of coreference and anaphora are difficult to define precisely and to operationalize consistently.
    Furthermore, the connectio
