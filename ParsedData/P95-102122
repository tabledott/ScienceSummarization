of the adjoined tree.
    Unfortunately, as seen in the examples given in Section 1.2, there are cases where satisfactory analyses cannot be obtained with adjunction.
    In particular, using adjunction in this way cannot handle cases in which parts of the clausal complement are required to be placed within the structure of the adjoined tree.
    The DTG operation of subsertion is designed to overcome this limitation.
    Subsertion can be viewed as a generalization of adjunction in which components of the clausal complement (the subserted structure) which are not substituted can be interspersed within the structure that is the site of the subsertion.
    Following earlier work (Becker et al., 1991; Vijay-Shanker, 1992), DTG provide a mechanism involving the use of domination links (d-edges) that ensure that parts of the subserted structure that are not substituted dominate those parts that are.
    Furthermore, there is a need to constrain the way in which the non-substituted components can be interspersed'.
