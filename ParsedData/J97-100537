method on the same narratives to see if the results are reproducible.
    Although we do not have enough subjects on any single narrative to compare two distinct sets of seven subjects, we do have four narratives with data from eight distinct subjects.
    For each set of eight subjects, we created two randomly selected partitions (A and B) with four distinct subjects in each.
    Then we assessed reliability by comparing the boundaries produced by partitions A and B on the four narratives (using a boundary threshold of at least three subjects).
    Because we only have four subjects within each partition, this necessarily produces fewer significant boundaries than our method.
    In other words, this test can only give us a conservative lower bound for reliability.
    (Recall that significance of a boundary increases exponentially with the number of subjects who agree on a boundary.)
    But even with this conservative evaluation, reliability is fairly good on two narratives, and promising on average.
