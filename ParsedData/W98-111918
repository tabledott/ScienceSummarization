 this work we have considered only three gender classes, masculine, feminine and inanimate, which are indicated by their typical pronouns, HE, SHE, and IT.
    However, a variety of pronouns indicate the same class: Plural pronouns like &amp;quot;they&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;us&amp;quot; reveal no gender information about their referent and consequently aren't useful, although this might be a way to learn pluralization in an unsupervised manner.
    In order to gather statistics on the gender of referents in a corpus, there must be some way of identifying the referents.
    In attempting to bootstrap lexical information about referents' gender, we consider two strategies, both completely blind to any kind of semantics.
    One of the most naive pronoun reference strategies is the &amp;quot;previous noun&amp;quot; heuristic.
    On the intuition pronouns closely follow their referents, this heuristic simply keeps track of the last noun seen and submits that noun as the referent of any pronouns following.
