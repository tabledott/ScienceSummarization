m on the PragueDependency Treebank (PDT 2.0).
			Mor?ce?s tag ging accuracy was 95.12%, 0.3% better than the n-gram tagger.
			A hybrid system based on four different tagging methods reached an accuracy of 95.68%.
			Because of the different corpora used andthe different amounts of lexical information avail able, a direct comparison to our results is difficult.
			Furthermore, our tagger uses no corpus-specific heuristics, whereas Mor?ce e.g. is optimized for Czech POS tagging.
			The German tagging results are, to the best ofour knowledge, the first published results for fine grained POS tagging with the Tiger tagset.

			We presented a HMM POS tagger for fine-grained tagsets which splits the POS tags into attributevectors and estimates the conditional probabilities of the attributes with decision trees.
			In ex periments with German and Czech corpora, this method achieved a higher tagging accuracy than two state-of-the-art general-purpose POS taggers (TnT and SVMTool).
