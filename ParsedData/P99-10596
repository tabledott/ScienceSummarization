n the second group but assigning them various low probabilities.)
    The cost of this expressiveness is a very large grammar.
    Standard context-free parsing algorithms are inefficient in such a case.
    The CKY algorithm (Younger, 1967; Aho and Ullman, 1972) is time 0(n3- IPI), where in the worst case I P1 = IVNI3 (one ignores unary productions).
    For a bilexical grammar, the worst case is IPI = VD I 3 ' I VT12, which is large for a large vocabulary VT. We may improve the analysis somewhat by observing that when parsing d1 &#8226; &#8226; &#8226; dn, the CKY algorithm only considers nonterminals of the form A[di]; by restricting to the relevant productions we obtain 0(n3 &#8226; IVDI3 &#8226; min(n, IVTI)2)&#8226; We observe that in practical applications we always have n &lt; IVTI&#8226; Let us then restrict our analysis to the (infinite) set of input instances of the parsing problem that satisfy relation n &lt; WTI.
    With this assumption, the asymptotic time complexity of the CKY algorithm become
