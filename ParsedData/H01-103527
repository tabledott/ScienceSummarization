  7.3 Morphology Induction: Observations This section includes additional detail regarding the morphol- ogy induction experiments, supplementing the previous details and analyses given in Section 7 and Table 3. ?
  Performance induction using the French Bible as the bridge source is evaluated using the full test verb set extracted from the French Hansards.
  The strong performance when trained only using the Bible illustrates that even a small single text in a very different genre can provide effective transfer to modern (conversational) French.
  While the observed genre and topic-sensitive vocabulary differs substantially between the Bible and Hansards, the observed inventories of stem changes and suffixation actually have large overlap, as do the set of observed high-frequency irregular verbs.
  Thus the in- ventory of morphological phenomena seem to translate better across genre than do lexical choice and collocation models.
