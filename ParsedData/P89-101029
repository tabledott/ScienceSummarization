e then able to show that the table encoded a number of very interesting patterns ranging from doctor ... nurse to save ... from.
    We finally concluded by showing how the patterns in the association ratio table might help a lexicographer organize a concordance.
    In point of fact, we actually developed these results in basically the reverse order.
    Concordance analysis is still extremely labor-intensive, and prone to errors of omission.
    The ways that concordances are sorted don't adequately support current lexicographic practice.
    Despite the fact that a concordance is indexed by a single word, often lexicographers actually use a second word such as &amp;quot;from&amp;quot; or an equally common semantic concept such as a time adverbial to decide how to categorize concordance lines.
    In other words, they use two words to triangulate in on a word sense.
    This triangulation approach clusters concordance lines together into word senses based primarily on usage (distributional evidence), as opp
