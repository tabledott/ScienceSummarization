imation in speech recognition or in other related areas for which hidden Markov models (HMM's) are used.
    In all such applications, one looks for the best path, i.e., the path with the minimum weight.
    In this section, we give the definition of string-to-weight transducers and other definitions useful for the presentation of the theorems of the following sections.
    In addition to the output weights of the transitions, string-to-weight transducers are provided with initial and output weights.
    For instance, when used with the input string ab, the transducer in Figure 9 outputs: 5 + 1 + 2 + 3 = 11, 5 being the initial and 3 the final weight.
    More formally, a string-to-weight transducer T is defined by T = (Q, E, I, F, E, A, p) with: One can define for T a transition (partial) function S mapping Q x E to 2Q by: V (q, a) E Q x E, (q , a) = fq' I 3x E (q, a, x, q') e El and an output function a mapping E to R. by: A path 7 in T from q E Q to q' c Q is a set of successive transitions from q to q': 7
