rd output, and each column gives a wrongly assigned value.
    The column &#8220;Seg&#8221; represents segmentation errors.
    Each figure in the table shows the percentage of the corresponding error from all the errors.
    It can be seen from the table that the NN-VV and VV-NN mistakes were the most commonly made by the decoder, while the NR-NN mistakes are also frequent.
    These three types of errors significantly outnumber the rest, together contributing 14.92% of all the errors.
    Moreover, the most commonly mistaken tags are NN and VV, while among the most frequent tags in the corpus, PU, DEG and M had comparatively less errors.
    Lastly, segmentation errors contribute around half (51.47%) of all the errors.
    10-fold cross validation is performed to test the accuracy of the joint word segmentor and POS tagger, and to make comparisons with existing models in the literature.
    Following Ng and Low (2004), we partition the sentences in CTB 3, ordered by sentence ID, into 10 groups evenly.
