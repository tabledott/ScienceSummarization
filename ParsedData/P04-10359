    Default polarity classifiers We tested support vector machines (SVMs) and Naive Bayes (NB).
    Following Pang et al. (2002), we use unigram-presence features: the ith coordinate of a feature vector is 1 if the corresponding unigram occurs in the input text, 0 otherwise.
    (For SVMs, the feature vectors are le
