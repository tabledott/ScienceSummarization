on that string (and ngram) based metrics cannot capture.
    The MBR decoder under this loss function gives improvements under an evaluation metric based on the loss function.
    We present results under the Bitree loss function as an example of incorporating linguistic information into a loss function; we have not yet measured its correlation with human assessments of translation quality.
    This loss function allows us to integrate syntactic structure into the statistical MT framework without building detailed models of syntactic features and retraining models from scratch.
    However, we emphasize that the MBR techniques do not preclude the construction of complex models of syntactic structure.
    Translation models that have been trained with linguistic features could still benefit by the application of MBR decoding procedures.
    That machine translation evaluation continues to be an active area of research is evident from recent workshops (AMTA, 2003).
    We expect new automatic MT evaluation metr
