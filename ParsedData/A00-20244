m both a professional and computational perspective.
    We also describe the six cut and paste operations.
    In Section 3, we describe the system architecture.
    The major components of the system, including sentence reduction, sentence combination, decomposition, and sentence selection, are described in Section 4.
    The evaluation results are shown in Section 5.
    Related work is discussed in Section 6.
    Finally, we conclude and discuss future work.
  
  
    Professionals take two opposite positions on whether a summary should be produced by cutting and pasting the original text.
    One school of scholars is opposed; &amp;quot;(use) your own words... Do not keep too close to the words before you&amp;quot;, states an early book on abstracting for American high school students (Thurber, 1924).
    Another study, however, shows that professional abstractors actually rely on cutting and pasting to produce summaries: &amp;quot;Their professional role tells abstractors to avoid inventing anything.
