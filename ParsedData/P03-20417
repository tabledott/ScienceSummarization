s no real advantage for modeling string pairs.3 But STSGs can generate a wider variety of tree pairs, e.g., non-isomorphic ones.
    So when actual trees are provided for training, STSG can be more flexible in aligning them.
    1Goodman (2002) presents efficient TSG parsing with unbounded elementary trees.
    Unfortunately, that clever method does not permit arbitrary models of elementary tree probabilities, nor does it appear to generalize to our synchronous case.
    (It would need exponentially many nonterminals to keep track of an matching of unboundedly many frontier nodes.)
  
  
    Most statistical MT derives from IBM-style models (Brown et al., 1993), which ignore syntax and allow arbitrary word-to-word translation.
    Hence they are able to align any sentence pair, however mismatched.
    However, they have a tendency to translate long sentences into word salad.
    Their alignment and translation accuracy improves when they are forced to translate shallow phrases as contiguous, potentially idiom
