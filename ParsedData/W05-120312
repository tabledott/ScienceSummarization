quation 7 and determine the semantic similarity of the two text segments with respect to text 1 as 0.6702, and with respect to text 2 as 0.7202.
    Finally, the two figures are combined into a bidirectional measure of similarity, calculated as 0.6952 based on equation 8.
    Although there are a few words that occur in both text segments (e.g. juror, questionnaire), there are also words that are not identical, but closely related, e.g. courtroom found similar to juror, or fill which is related to complete.
    Unlike traditional similarity measures based on lexical matching, our metric takes into account the semantic similarity of these words, resulting in a more precise measure of text similarity.
  
  
    To test the effectiveness of the text semantic similarity metric, we use this measure to automatically identify if two text segments are paraphrases of each other.
    We use the Microsoft paraphrase corpus (Dolan et al., 2004), consisting of 4,076 training pairs and 1,725 test pairs, and determine the n
