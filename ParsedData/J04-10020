  CorMet: A Computational Corpus-Based Conventional Metaphor Extraction System
  
    CorMet is a corpus-based system for discovering metaphorical mappings between concepts.
    It does this by finding systematic variations in domain-specific selectional preferences, which are inferred from large, dynamically mined Internet corpora.
    Metaphors transfer structure from a source domain to a target domain, making some concepts in the target domain metaphorically equivalent to concepts in the source domain.
    The verbs that select for a concept in the source domain tend to select for its metaphorical equivalent in the target domain.
    This regularity, detectable with a shallow linguistic analysis, is used to find the metaphorical interconcept mappings, which can then be used to infer the existence of higher-level conventional metaphors.
    Most other computational metaphor systems use small, hand-coded semantic knowledge bases and work on a few examples.
    Although CorMet&#8217;s only knowledge base is
