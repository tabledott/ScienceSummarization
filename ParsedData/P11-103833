owever, there was still a lot of room for improvement at ill-formed word detection.
    In normalisation, we compared our method with two benchmark methods from the literature, and achieved that highest F-score and BLEU score by integrating dictionary lookup, word similarity and context support modelling.
    In future work, we propose to pursue a number of directions.
    First, we plan to improve our ill-formed word detection classifier by introducing an OOV word whitelist.
    Furthermore, we intend to alleviate noisy contexts with a bootstrapping approach, in which ill-formed words with high confidence and no ambiguity will be replaced by their standard forms, and fed into the normalisation model as new training data.
