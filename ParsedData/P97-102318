 and other elements of Aa.
    This operation in turn defines a subset of L, La, which includes all links between members of Aa.
    We train our log-linear model on L&#8212; La (excluding links between morphologically related adjectives), compute predictions and dissimilarities for the links in La, and use these to classify and label the adjectives in Aa. a must be at least 2, since we need to leave some links for training.
    Table 3 shows the results of these experiments for = 2 to 5.
    Our method produced the correct classification between 78% of the time on the sparsest test set up to more than 92% of the time when a higher number of links was present.
    Moreover, in all cases, the ratio of the two group frequencies correctly identified the positive subgroup.
    These results are extremely significant statistically (P-value less than 10') when compared with the baseline method of randomly assigning orientations to adjectives, or the baseline method of always predicting the most frequent (for types)
