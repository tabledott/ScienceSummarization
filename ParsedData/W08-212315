f the second-order parser restricts its use to batch applications, we see an in- teresting research direction to find suitable com- promises between the two approaches, for instance by sacrificing the exact search procedure.
  System Training Parse Labeled Unlabeled 1st order 65 min 28 sec 85.78 89.51 2nd order 60 hours 34 min 88.33 91.43 Table 4: Impact of second-order features.
  Table 5 shows the dependency types most af- fected by the addition of second-order features to the parser when ordered by the increase in F1.
  As can be seen, they are all verb adjunct categories, which demonstrates the effect of grandchild fea- tures on PP attachment and labeling.

  5.2 Semantic Results To assess the effect of the components in the se- mantic submodel, we tested their performance on the top-scoring parses from the syntactic model.
  Table 6 shows the results.
