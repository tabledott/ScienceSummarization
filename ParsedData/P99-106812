es containing hyperlinks to English and Spanish, which pass the structural filter with flying colors.
    The problem is potentially acute if the generation stage happens to yield up many pairs of pages that come from online catalogues or other Web sites having large numbers of pages with a conventional structure.
    There is, of course, an obvious solution that will handle most such cases: making sure that the two pages are actually written in the languages they are supposed to be written in.
    In order to filter out candidate page pairs that fail this test, statistical language identification based on character n-grams was added to the system (Dunning, 1994).
    Although this does introduce a need for language-specific training data for the two languages under consideration, it is a very mild form of language dependence: Dunning and others have shown that when classifying strings on the order of hundreds or thousands of characters, which is typical of the non-markup text in Web pages, it is possible to
