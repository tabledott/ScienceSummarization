ecisions on which we focused.
    The potential of maximum entropy methods has not previously been fully exploited for the task of assignment of parts of speech.
    We incorporated into a maximum entropy-based tagger more linguistically sophisticated features, which are non-local and do not look just at particular positions in the text.
    We also added features that model the interactions of previously employed predictors.
    All of these changes led to modest increases in tagging accuracy.
    This paper has thus presented some initial experiments in improving tagger accuracy through using additional information sources.
    In the future we hope to explore automatically discovering information sources that can be profitably incorporated into maximum entropy part-of-speech prediction.
