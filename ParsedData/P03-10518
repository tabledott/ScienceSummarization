om the prefix wA# and suffixes 0, +A, +hA.
    As illustrated by S12, derivation of sub-segmentations of the matching prefixes/suffixes enables the system to identify possible segmentations which would have been missed otherwise.
    In this case, segmentation including the derived prefix sequence &#65166;&#1607;+ &#1585;&#65198;&#1570; #&#1575; #&#1608;(n# A# krr +hA) happens to be the correct one.
    While the number of possible segmentations is maximized by sub-segmenting matching prefixes and suffixes, some of illegitimate subsegmentations are filtered out on the basis of the knowledge specific to the manually segmented corpus.
    For instance, subsegmentation of the suffix hA into +h +A is ruled out because there is no suffix sequence +h +A in the training corpus.
    Likewise, subsegmentation of the prefix Al into A# l# is filtered out.
    Filtering out improbable prefix/suffix sequences improves the segmentation accuracy, as shown in Table 5.
