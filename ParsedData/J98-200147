 the first experiment, the subjects did not have the option of classifying a definite description as Idiom; we instructed them to make a choice and write down their doubts.
    The written instructions and the script given to the subjects can be found in Appendix B.
    As in Experiment 1, the subjects were given one text to practice before starting with the analysis of the corpus.
    They took, on average, eight hours to complete the task.
    The distribution of definite descriptions in the four classes according to the three coders is shown in Table 8.
    We had 283 cases of complete agreement among annotators on the classification (61%): 164 cases of complete agreement on coreferential definite descriptions, 7 cases of complete agreement on bridging, 65 cases of complete agreement on larger situation, and 47 cases of complete agreement on the unfamiliar class.
    As in Experiment 1, we measured the K coefficient of agreement among annotators; the result for annotators C, D, and E is K = 0.58 if we cons
