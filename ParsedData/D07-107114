that simultaneously selects a small subset of all entriesgenerated by GENLEX and estimates parameter val uesw.
			Zettlemoyer and Collins (2005) present more complete details.
			In section 4.2 we describe a new, online algorithm that uses GENLEX.
	
	
			This section describes a set of CCG combinators which we add to the conventional CCG combinatorsdescribed in section 2.2.
			These additional combinators are natural extensions of the forward appli cation, forward composition, and type-raising rulesseen in CCG.
			We first describe a set of combinators that allow the parser to significantly relax con straints on word order.
			We then describe a set of type-raising rules which allow the parser to copewith telegraphic input (in particular, missing func tion words).
			In both cases these additional rules lead to significantly more parses for any sentence x given a lexicon ?.
			Many of these parses will be suspect from a linguistic perspective; broadening theset of CCG combinators in this way might be con side
