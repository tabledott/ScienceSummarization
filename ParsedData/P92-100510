X-c1aim(X,clever(+h)).
    Constraints on legitimate scoping (Section 5) force +b and +h to take wide scope over both the antecedent and ellipsis.
    The sloppy reading results from re-indexing the ellipsis pronoun so that it has the same restriction and category as the original, but is resolved to +j and has a new index +hl.
    This corresponds to taking P1 to be: X-claim(X,clever(term(+hl,&lt;lex=he&gt;, male,exists,+j))).
    More generally, in Crouch and Alshawi 1992 we explore the claim that solutions to verb phrase ellipsis have the general form: That is, P1 is formed out of an antecedent clause QLF S by abstracting over the 'parallel elements' s ..si, perhaps with some additional substitutions for terms si+1..sn in S (E[a/b] is the expression E with a substituted for b).
    This seems to be sufficient to cover the range of examples treated by Dalrymple, Shieber and Pereira (1991), but that is a specific linguistic claim about verb phrase ellipsis in English and not central to the present paper.
