lities and any special mechanisms for avoiding local maxima.
    They are similar to one another (and different from constraint satisfaction and enumeration approaches) in that they are heuristic (not guaranteed to find optimal solutions) and they are &amp;quot;anytime&amp;quot;.
    That is, such an algorithm can be stopped at any point and it will be able to yield at that point a result which is the best it has found so far.
    This is important for NLG applications where interface considerations mean that texts have to be produced within a limited time.
  
  
    A key requirement for the use of any stochastic search approach is the ability to assess the quality of a possible solution.
    Thus we are forced to confront directly the task of evaluating RST trees.
    We assign a candidate tree a score which is the sum of scores for particular features the tree may have.
    A positive score here indicates a good feature and a negative one indicates a bad one.
    We cannot make any claims to have the best
