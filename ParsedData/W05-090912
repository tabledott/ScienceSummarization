grams in the system translation that are mapped (to unigrams in the reference translation) to the total number of unigrams in the reference translation* Next we compute Fmean by combining the precision and recall via a harmonic-mean (van Rijsbergen, 1979) that places most of the weight on recall* We use a harmonic mean of P and 9R* The resulting formula used is: Precision, recall and Fmean are based on unigram matches* To take into account longer matches, METEOR computes a penalty for a given alignment as follows* First, all the unigrams in the system translation that are mapped to unigrams in the reference translation are grouped into the fewest possible number of chunks such that the unigrams in each chunk are in adjacent positions in the system translation, and are also mapped to unigrams that are in adjacent positions in the reference translation* Thus, the longer the n-grams, the fewer the chunks, and in the extreme case where the entire system translation string matches the reference translation there i
