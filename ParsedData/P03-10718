hains when there is a long hiatus of h consecutive sentences with no occurrence of the term, where h is determined experimentally.
    For each hiatus, a new division is made and thus, we avoid creating weakly linked chains.
    For all chains that have been identified, we use a weighting scheme that we believe is appropriate to the task of inducing the topical or sub-topical structure of text.
    The weighting scheme depends on two factors: Frequency: chains containing more repeated terms receive a higher score.
    Compactness: shorter chains receive a higher weight than longer ones.
    If two chains of different lengths contain the same number of terms, we assign a higher score to the shortest one.
    Our assumption is that the shorter one, being more compact, seems to be a better indicator of lexical cohesion.3 We apply a variant of a metric commonly used in information retrieval, TF.IDF (Salton and Buckley, 1988), to score term repetitions.
    If R1 ... R,,, is the set of all term repetitions collect
