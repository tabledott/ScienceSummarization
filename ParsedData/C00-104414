le gradability of tile ad.iective, we use a log-linear model.
  Ix)g-linear models (Nantnef and l)ufly, 1989) construct a linear combination (weighted sum) of the predictor wlriables 1~, i=1 and relate it to the actual response H. (in this case, 0 for non-gmdable and 1 for gradable) via the so-called logis- tic trcm,sJbrmation, 1~- I -t- eJ Maximum likelihood estimates for the coefficients fli are obtained from training samples for which the correct response H, is known, using the iterative reweighted non- linear least squares algorithm (Bates and Watts, 1988).
  This statistical model is particularly suited for model- ing variables with a "yes"-"no" (binary) value, because, unlike linear models, it captures the dependency of IFs variance on its mean (Santner and Dully, 1989).
  We normalize the counts for the two indicators of g,adability, and the cot, at otjoint occurrences of both in- tleetion and modilication by grading moditiers, by divid- ing with the total frequency of the adjective in the corpus.
