 improve the coverage of the estimator, that is, how many new noun heads they were able to handle.
    The automatic-clustering method performed by far the best on this metric; only 2.1% of test cases were unseen in the data used for the automatic clustering.
    This indicates how much can be achieved with unsupervised methods given very large training corpora.
    The bootstrapping technique described here, although it has a similar unsupervised flavor, made use of much less data than the corpus used for noun clustering.
    Unlike probabilistic clustering, the bootstrapping technique can make use of only those sentences containing the target words in question.
    The WordNet experiment, on the other hand, indicates both the usefulness of hand-built resources when they apply and the difficulty of attaining broad coverage with such resources.
    Combining the three systems described would indicate whether their gains are complementary or overlapping.
