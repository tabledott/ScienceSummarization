nouns, e.g., the relation between Mary and walk in Mary took dozens of walks is handled as follows: Mary is marked as the ARG0 of walk and took + dozens + of is marked as a support chain in NomBank.
    In contrast, verbal long distance dependencies can be handled by means of empty categories in the Penn Treebank, e.g., the relation between John and walked in John seemed t to walk.
    Support chains are needed because nominal long distance dependencies are not captured under the Penn Treebank&#8217;s system of empty categories.
    There exists no large-scale dependency treebank for English, and we thus had to construct a dependency-annotated corpus automatically from the Penn Treebank (Marcus et al., 1993).
    Since dependency syntax represents grammatical structure by means of labeled binary head&#8211;dependent relations rather than phrases, the task of the conversion procedure is to identify and label the head&#8211;dependent pairs.
    The idea underpinning constituent-to-dependency conversion algorith
