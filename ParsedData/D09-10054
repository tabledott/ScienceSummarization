nt optimization algorithms.
    We implement the expectation and variance semirings in Joshua (Li et al., 2009a), and demonstrate their practical benefit by using minimumrisk training to improve Hiero (Chiang, 2007).
  
  
    We use a specific tree-based system called Hiero (Chiang, 2007) as an example, although the discussion is general for any systems that use a hypergraph to represent the hypothesis space.
    In Hiero, a synchronous context-free grammar (SCFG) is extracted from automatically wordaligned corpora.
    An illustrative grammar rule for Chinese-to-English translation is where the Chinese word In, means of, and the alignment, encoded via subscripts on the nonterminals, causes the two phrases around In, to be reordered around of in the translation.
    Given a source sentence, Hiero uses a CKY parser to generate a hypergraph, encoding many derivation trees along with the translation strings.
    Formally, a hypergraph is a pair (V, E), where V is a set of nodes (vertices) and E is a set of hype
