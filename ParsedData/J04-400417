n the parent nonterminal is NPB.
    With arguments identified as described in Section 4.9, if a subjectless sentence is found to have an argument prior to its head, this step detransforms the SG so that it reverts to being an S. Head-finding is discussed at length in Collins&#8217; thesis, and the head-finding rules used are included in his Appendix A.
    There are a few unpublished details worth mentioning, however.
    There is no head-finding rule for NX nonterminals, so the default rule of picking the leftmost child is used.10 NX nodes roughly represent the N&#8217; level of syntax and in practice often denote base NPs.
    As such, the default rule often picks out a less-thanideal head-child, such as an adjective that is the leftmost child in a base NP.
    Collins&#8217; thesis discusses a case in which the initial head is modified when it is found to denote the right conjunct in a coordinated phrase.
    That is, if the head rules pick out a head that is preceded by a CC that is non-initial, the head
