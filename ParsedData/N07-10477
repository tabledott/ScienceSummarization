 we implement a one-to-one aligner based on the epsilon scattering method (Black et al., 1998).
    The method applies the EM algorithm to estimate the probability of mapping a letter l to a phoneme p, P(l, p).
    The initial probability table starts by mapping all possible alignments between letters and phonemes for each word in the training data, introducing all possible null phoneme positions.
    For example, the word/phoneme-sequence pair abode [ &#10053; b o d ] has five possible positions where a null phoneme can be added to make an alignment.
    The training process uses the initial probability table P(l, p) to find the best possible alignments for each word using the Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) algorithm (Sankoff and Kruskal, 1999).
    At each iteration, the probability table P(l, p) is re-calculated based on the best alignments found in that iteration.
    Finding the best alignments and re-calculating the probability table continues iteratively until there is no change in the probability table.
