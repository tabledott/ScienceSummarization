  Both the system without and with preprocessing for negation finding performed better than the hedge finding system.
    An informed baseline system has been created by calculating the average length of the scope to the right of the hedge cue in each corpus and tagging that number of tokens as scope tokens.
    We take the scope to the right for the baseline because it is much more frequent than the scope to the left, as is shown by the statistics contained in Table 1 of Section 3.
    Baseline results are presented in Table 5.
    The low PCS for the three subcorpora indicates that finding the scope of hedge cues is not a trivial task.
    The fact that, despite a very low PCS, precision, recall and F1 are relatively high indicates that these measures are in themselves not reliable to evaluate the performance of the system.
    The upper-bound results of the metalearner system assuming gold standard identification of hedge cues are shown in Table 6.
    The percentage of correct scopes has been measured in
