for an argument-type, we can imagine that an argument is itself able to select the predicates that govern it.
    I will refer to such constructions as cospecifications.
    Informally, relative to the process bake, the noun cake carries the selectional information that it is a process of &amp;quot;baking&amp;quot; that brings it about.13 We can illustrate this schematically in Example 31, where the complement effectively acts like a &amp;quot;stage-level&amp;quot; event predicate (cf.
    Carlson 1977) relative to the process event-type of the verb (i.e. a function from processes to transitions, &lt;P , T&gt;).14 The change in meaning in 31 comes not from the semantics of bake, but rather in composition with the complement of the verb, at the level of the entire verb phrase.
    The &amp;quot;creation&amp;quot; sense arises from the semantic role of cake that specifies it is an artifact (see below for discussion).
    Thus, we can derive both word senses of verbs like bake by putting some of the semantic wei
