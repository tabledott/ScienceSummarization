 base case (9.22% vs. 8.47%).
    Overall, however, the dependency representation has the best cohesion properties. ernment.
    We would like to thank Franz Och for providing us with the manually annotated data used in these experiments.
  
  
    We have examined the issue of phrasal cohesion between English and French and discovered that while there is less cohesion than we might desire, there is still a large amount of regularity in the constructions where breakdowns occur.
    This reassures us that reordering words by phrasal movement is a reasonable strategy.
    Many of the initially daunting number of crossings were due to non-linguistic reasons, such as rewording during translation or errors in syntactic analysis.
    Among the rest, there are a small number of syntactic constructions which result in the majority of the crossings examined in our analysis.
    One practical result of this skewed distribution is that one could hope to discover the major problem areas for a new language pair by manuall
