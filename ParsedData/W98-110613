    The work presented here only addresses the initial stage of information extraction.
    However, in previous work we showed that AutoSlog-TS achieved performance comparable to AutoSlog (Riloff, 1996b), which performed very well in the MUC-4 evaluation (Lehnert et al., 1992b).
    Since the conceptual case frames achieved comparable recall and higher precision than AutoSlog-TS' extraction patterns, our results suggest that the case frames performed well relative to previous work on this domain.
    Several other systems learn extraction patterns that can also be viewed as conceptual case frames with selectional restrictions (e.g., PALKA (Kim and Moldovan, 1993) and CRYSTAL (Soderland et al., 1995)).
    The case frames learned by our system are not necessarily more powerful then those generated by other systems.
    The advantage of our approach is that it requires no special training resources.
    Our technique requires on
