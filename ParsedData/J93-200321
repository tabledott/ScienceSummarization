rrive at estimates of the parameters of the final model that do not depend on our initial estimates of the parameters for Model 1.
    In Models 3 and 4, we must be content with approximate EM iterations because it is not feasible to carry out sums over all possible alignments for these models.
    But, while approaching more closely the complexity of Model 5, they retain enough simplicity to allow an efficient investigation of the neighborhood of probable alignments and therefore allow us to include what we hope are all of the important alignments in each EM iteration.
    In the remainder of this section, we give an informal but reasonably precise description of each of the five models and an intuitive account of the EM algorithm as applied to them.
    We assume the reader to be comfortable with Lagrange multipliers, partial differentiation, and constrained optimization as they are presented in a typical college calculus text, and to have a nodding acquaintance with random variables.
