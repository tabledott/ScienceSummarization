    Based on previous work about Turkish, Hoffman argues that, in this language, the sentence-initial position corresponds to the topic, the position that immediately precedes the verb yields the focus, and the remainder of the sentence is to be considered the (back)ground.
    Furthermore, Hoffman relates this notion of information structure of utterances to centering, claiming that the topic corresponds to the Cb in most cases&#8212;with the exception of segment-initial utterances, which do not have a Cb.

    In her approach, this ranking is achieved by thematic roles (see also Turan [1998]).
    Both Rambow (1983) as well as Hoffman (1996, 1998) argue for a correlation between the information structure of utt
