  Deep Read: A Reading Comprehension System
  
    paper describes initial work on Read, an automated reading comprehension system that accepts arbitrary text input (a story) and answers questions about it.
    We have acquired a corpus of 60 and 60 test stories of to grade material; each story is followed by short-answer questions (an answer key was also provided).
    We used these to construct and evaluate a baseline system that uses pattern matching (bag-of-words) techniques augmented with additional automated linguistic processing (stemming, name identification, semantic class identification, and pronoun resolution).
    This simple system retrieves the sentence containing the answer 30-40% of the time.
  
  
    This paper describes our initial work exploring reading comprehension tests as a research problem and an evaluation method for language understanding systems.
    Such tests can take the form of standardized multiple-choice diagnostic reading skill tests, as well as fill-inthe-blank and short-a
