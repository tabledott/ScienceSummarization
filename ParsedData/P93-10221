or the cooccurrence of two words within a limited distance in the context.
    Statistical data about these various cooccurrence relations is employed for a variety of applications, such as speech recognition (Jelinek, 1990), language generation (Smadja and McKeown, 1990), lexicography (Church and Hanks, 1990), machine translation (Brown et al., ; Sadler, 1989), information retrieval (Maarek and Smadja, 1989) and various disambiguation tasks (Dagan et al., 1991; Hindle and Rooth, 1991; Grishman et al., 1986; Dagan and Itai, 1990).
    A major problem for the above applications is how to estimate the probability of cooccurrences that were not observed in the training corpus.
    Due to data sparseness in unrestricted language, the aggregate probability of such cooccurrences is large and can easily get to 25% or more, even for a very large training corpus (Church and Mercer, 1992).
    Since applications often have to compare alternative hypothesized cooccurrences, it is important to distinguish between those u
