amounts of less-specific background training data with specific, in-domain data for this and other problems.
    Another interesting research direction is to explore the usefulness of the MAP adaptation of MaxEnt models for other problems among which we wish to include language modeling, part-of-speech tagging, parsing, machine translation, information extraction, text routing.
  
  
    Special thanks to Adwait Ratnaparkhi for making available the code for his MEMM tagger and MaxEnt trainer.
