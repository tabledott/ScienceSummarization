1 I LHS).
    With supervised training, where a set of correct parse trees is provided as training, one estimates p(RHS) I LHS) by the number of times rule LHS RHSI appears in the training set divided by the number of times LHS appears in the trees.
    The probability of a syntactic structure S. given the input string W, is then modeled by the product of the probabilities of the rules used in S. Chitrao and Grishman (1990) used a similar context-free model.
    Using this model, we explored the following issues: Probability of a parse tree given words.
    Our intention is to use the TREEBANK corpus being developed at the University of Pennsylvania as a source of correct structures for training.
    However, in our first experiments, we used small training sets taken from an existing question-answering corpus of sentences about a personnel database.
    To our surprise, we found that as little as 80 sentences of supervised training (in which a person, using graphical tools, identifies the correct parse) are
