    Many previous studies on user generated content have attempted to predict these labels automatically from the associated text.
    However, these labels are often present in the data already, which opens another interesting line of research: designing models leveraging these labelings to improve a wide variety of applications.
    In this study, we look at the problem of aspectbased sentiment summarization (Hu and Liu, 2004a; Popescu and Etzioni, 2005; Gamon et al., 2005; Carenini et al., 2006; Zhuang et al., 2006).1 An aspect-based summarization system takes as input a set of user reviews for a specific product or service and produces a set of relevant aspects, the aggregated sentiment for each aspect, and supporting textual evidence.
