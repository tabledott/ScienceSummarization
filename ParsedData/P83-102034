c and pragmatic interaction interleaved with the parsing process to quickly prune unpromising search paths.
    While Parsifal made use of exactly such interactions in other contexts, e.g. to correctly place prepositional phrases, such interactions seem to demand at least implicitly building syntactic structure which is discarded after some choice is made by higher-level cognitive components.
    Because this is counter to at least the spirit of the determinism hypothesis, it would be interesting if the syntactic analysis of coordinate structures could be made autonomous of higher-level processes.
    There are more central problems for a deterministic analysis of conjunction, however.
    Techniques which make use of the lookahead provided by buffering constituents can deterministically handle a perhaps surprising range of coordinate phenomena, as first demonstrated by the YAP parser (Church 801, but there appear to be fundamental limitations to what can be analyzed in this way.
    The central problem is th
