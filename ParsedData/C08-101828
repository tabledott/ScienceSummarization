gs for our system (Abstract), the baseline (Extract), and the gold standard.
			We first performed an Analysis of Variance (ANOVA)to examine the effect of different system compres sions.
			The ANOVA revealed a reliable effect on both grammaticality and importance (significant over both subjects and items (p &lt; 0.01)).We next examined in more detail between system differences.
			Post-hoc Tukey tests revealed that our abstractive model received significantlyhigher ratings than the baseline in terms of impor tance (?
			&lt; 0.01).
			We conjecture that this is due to the synchronous grammar we employ which is larger and more expressive than the baseline.
			In the extractive case, a word sequence is eitherdeleted or retained.
			We may, however, want to re tain the meaning of the sequence while rendering the sentence shorter, and this is precisely what our model can achieve, e.g., by allowing substitutions.As far as grammaticality is concerned, our abstractive model is numerically better than the extrac tiv
