not in this factored form, it still admits factored grammar projection bounds; we are currently investigating this case.
  
  
    An A* parser is simpler to build than a best-first parser, does less work per edge, and provides both an optimality guarantee and a worst-case cubic time bound.
    We have described two general ways of constructing admissible A* estimates for PCFG parsing and given several specific estimates.
    Using these estimates, our parser is capable of finding the Viterbi parse of an average-length Penn treebank sentence in a few seconds, processing less than 3% of the edges which would be constructed by an exhaustive parser.
  
  
    We would like to Joshua Goodman and Dan Melamed for advice and discussion about this work.
