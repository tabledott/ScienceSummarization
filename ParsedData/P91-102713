 from unusual extrapositions or other relatively rare phenomena.
    Once again, the high accuracy and low efficiency are consistent with the priorities of Section 1.2.
    The throughput rate is currently about ten-thousand words per second on a Sparcstation 2, which is also consistent with the initial priorities.
    Furthermore, at ten-thousand words per second the current density of observations is not problematic.
  
  
    Interest in extracting lexical and especially collocational information from text has risen dramatically in the last two years, as sufficiently large corpora and sufficiently cheap computation have become available.
    Three recent papers in this area are Church and Hanks (1990), Hindle (1990), and Smadja and McKeown (1990).
    The latter two are concerned exclusively with collocation relations between open-class words and not with grammatical properties.
    Church is also interested primarily in open-class collocations, but he does discuss verbs that tend to be followed by infinit
