ent features are needed for different subtasks.
    Finally, we show that using a maximum entropy classifier and fewer features, we achieved results that are comparable to the best previously reported results obtained with SVM models.
    We believe this is a clear indication that developing features that capture the right kind of information is crucial to advancing the state-of-the-art in semantic analysis.
    We also believe that the features we proposed here are to a large extent complementary to those proposed in a recent work by Pradhan et al (2004) and we intend to incorporate them in our system.
  
  
    We would like to thank Scott Cotton for providing the PropBank API 6 which greatly simplifies the implementation of our system.
