 slates are e(plat if their parse  structures have the same start position, end position, and com- bined state.
  The backward search starts at the end of the input, sentence, and backtracks to the beginning of the sentence using tim path-map.
  Initial states are obtained by looking up the entries of tim sentence nd position of the path-map.
  The suc- cessor states are obtained by first, looking u 1) tim en- tries of the path-map at the start position of the cur- rent parse,  then cbecldng whether they satisfy the con- straint of the combined state transition in the second order IIMM, aim whether the transition is allowed by the tagging model.
  The combined state transition con- straint means that tim part of speech sequence in the parse .n th -order -s ta te  of the current parse,  ignor- 4 In Figure 1, function transprob returns the probability of given trlgraln.
