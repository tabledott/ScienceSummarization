    We first show that a large set of transducers Mohri Transducers in Language and Speech admit determinization, then give a characterization of unambiguous transducers admitting determinization.
    In what follows, the states of the transducers considered will be assumed to be accessible from the initial one.
    The following lemma will be useful in the proof of the theorems.
    Lemma 1 Let T = (Q, E, I, F, E, A, p) be a string-to-weight transducer, 7r E p q a path in T from the state p E Q to q E Q, and 7r' E p' q' a path from p' E Q to q' E Q both labeled with the input string w E E*.
    Assume that the lengths of it and 7r' are greater than We also define A and p by: V(ii, t2) E h x A(ii, i2) = A2(i2)), V(fj,,,f2) E Fi x F2, P(fi,f2) -= (Pi(fi ), P2(f2)).
    Consider the cross product of T with itself, T x T. Let it and 713 be two paths in T with lengths greater than 1Q12 - 1, (m&gt; 1Q12 - 1): is a path in T x T with length greater than 1Q12 - 1.
    Since T x T
