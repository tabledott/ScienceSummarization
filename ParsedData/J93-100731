tion of the /Ifs and produce their average pi and variance U, around j3j.
    In Figure 4 spread represents U, on a scale of 1 to 100.
    1/, characterizes the shape of the pi, histogram.
    If U, is small, then the histogram will tend to be flat, which means that w, can be used equivalently in almost any position around w. In contrast, if U, is large, then the histogram will tend to have peaks, which means that w, can only be used in one (or several) specific position around w. LI, is defined by:
  
  
    These analyses are then used to sort out the retrieved data.
    First, using (1a), collocates with strength smaller than a given threshold 1(0 are eliminated.
    Then, using (1b), we filter out the collocates having a variance Li, smaller than a given threshold Uo.
    Finally, we keep the interesting collocates by pulling out the peaks of the 13'1 distributions.
    These peaks correspond to the js such that the z-score of p' is bigger than a given threshold 1c1.
    These thresholds have to be determ
