lity &#946; + a never increases.
    The proof of this is very similar to the proof of the uniform-cost case in Klein and Manning (2001a), and so we omit it for space reasons (it can be found in Klein and Manning, 2002).
    Concretely, we can use b + a as the edge priority, provided a is an admissible, monotonic estimate of &#945;.
    We will still have a correct algorithm, and even rough heuristics can dramatically cut down the number of edges processed (and therefore total work).
    We next discuss several estimates, describe how to compute them efficiently, and show the edge savings when parsing Penn treebank WSJ sentences.
  
  
    When parsing with a PCFG G, each edge e = X:[i, j] spans some interval [i, j] of the sentence and is labeled 2The example here shows a bottom-up construction of a parse tree.
    However, the present algorithm and estimates work just as well for top-down chart parsing, given suitable active items as nodes; see (Klein and Manning, 2001a). by some grammar symbol (or state) X.
