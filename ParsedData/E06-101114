dency graphs involving multiple parents are well established in the literature (Hudson, 1984).
    Unfortunately, the problem of finding the dependency structure with highest score in this setting is intractable (Chickering et al., 1994).
    To create an approximate parsing algorithm for dependency structures with multiple parents, we start with our approximate second-order nonprojective algorithm outlined in Figure 4.
    We use the non-projective algorithm since the Danish Dependency Treebank contains a small number of non-projective arcs.
    We then modify lines 7-10 of this algorithm so that it looks for the change in parent or the addition of a new parent that causes the highest change in overall score and does not create a cycle2.
    Like before, we make one change per iteration and that change will depend on the resulting score of the new tree.
    Using this simple new approximate parsing algorithm, we train a new parser that can produce multiple parents.
