    This transition function generalizes to a two-tape transducer the construction of a one-tape finite-state machine for the intersection of two regular languages.
    We might therefore suspect that the lexical-surface relation for a two-level grammar consisting of transducers Th Tn is the relation n,R(T,).
    However, what is actually computed under this interpretation is the relation Rel(Paths(T1) n Paths (T2) .
    .
    .
    Paths(L)) of the form discussed in Section 3.
    As we observed, this may be only a proper subset of the relation n,R(T,) when the component relations contain string pairs of unequal length.
    In this case, the literal-matching transducer may not accept the intersection, a relation that in fact may not even be regular.
    The individual transducers allowed in two-level specifications do permit the expansion and contraction of strings by virtue of a null symbol 0.
    If this were treated just like &#8364;, we would be able to say very little about the combined relation.
