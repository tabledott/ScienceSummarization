 to be the baseline (no composition).
    Other Models The other models we compare ours to are those evaluated by Mitchell and Lapata (2008).
    We provide a selection of the results from that paper for the worst (Add) and best5 (Multiply) performing models, as well as the previous second-best performing model (Kintsch).
    The additive and multiplicative models are simply applications of vector addition and component-wise multiplication.
    We invite the reader to consult (Mitchell and Lapata, 2008) for the description of Kintsch&#8217;s additive model and parametric choices.
    Model Parameters To provide the most accurate comparison with the existing multiplicative model, and exploiting the aforementioned feature that the categorical model can be built &#8220;on top of&#8221; existing lexical distributional models, we used the parameters described by Mitchell and Lapata (2008) to reproduce the vectors evaluated in the original experiment as our noun vectors.
    All vectors were built from a lemmatised
