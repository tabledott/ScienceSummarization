   If there were further senses of run in our example, and course(2) was found to be suitable for those extra senses, then the algorithm would mark the second sense of course as correct.
    There is, however, no condition under which run(1) could be considered as correct through the consideration of further verb senses.
    Also, although John and hilly are not ambiguous in this example, they still participate in the disambiguation process.
    In fact they are vital to its success, as the correct senses could not have been identified without considering the restrictions placed by the adjective hilly.
    This partial tagger returns, for all ambiguous noun, verb, and adjective occurrences in the text, the set of senses which satisfy the preferences imposed on those words.
    Adverbs do not have any selectional preferences in LDOCE and so are ignored by this partial tagger.
    Our final partial tagger is a re-implementation of the algorithm developed by Yarowsky (1992).
    This algorithm is dependent upon
