ent the context in which an ambiguous word occurs with a wide variety of features.
    However, when the contribution of each type of feature to overall accuracy is analyzed (eg.
    (Ng and Lee, 1996)), shallow lexical features such as co&#8212;occurrences and collocations prove to be stronger contributors to accuracy than do deeper, linguistically motivated features such as part&#8212;of&#8212;speech and verb&#8212;object relationships.
    It has also been shown that the combined accuracy of an ensemble of multiple classifiers is often significantly greater than that of any of the individual classifiers that make up the ensemble (e.g., (Dietterich, 1997)).
    In natural language processing, ensemble techniques have been successfully applied to part&#8212; of&#8212;speech tagging (e.g., (Brill and Wu, 1998)) and parsing (e.g., (Henderson and Brill, 1999)).
    When combined with a history of disambiguation success using shallow lexical features and Naive Bayesian classifiers, these findings suggest that wo
