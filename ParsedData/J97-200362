articular, it cannot be used with the tropical semiring or the string semiring used in language and speech processing, since none of these semirings is a field.
    More precisely, a recent result of Krob (1994) states that such a minimization cannot be defined for transducers defined on the tropical semiring.
    Furthermore, we implemented the algorithm of Schatzenberger (1961) and used it in the case of the semiring (R., +, 0,1).
    It has two important disadvantages in practice: it creates many transitions, and it can generate transitions with negative weights, even if the initial machine has none.
    The negative weights cannot be interpreted in terms of probability.
    In the next section, we describe some of the applications to speech recognition of the algorithms we presented above.
  
  
    In previous sections, we gave a theoretical description of the determinization and minimization algorithms for string-to-weight transducers.
    Here we indicate their use in practice.
    These algorithms hav
