which are, of course, not useful for selecting word senses in that language.
    This is where other languages can supply the solution, exploiting the fact that the mapping between words and word senses varies significantly between different languages.
    For instance, the English words 'sign' and 'seal' (from Example 1 in the introduction) correspond to two distinct senses of the Hebrew word lahtom.
    These senses should be distinguished by most applications of Hebrew understanding programs.
    To make this distinction, it is possible to perform the same process that is performed for target word selection, by producing all the English alternatives for the lexical relations involving lahtom.
    Then the Hebrew sense that corresponds to the most plausible English lexical relations is preferred.
    This process requires a bilingual lexicon that maps each Hebrew sense separately into its possible translations, similar to a Hebrew&#8212;Hebrew&#8212;English lexicon (analogous to the Oxford English&#8212;Eng
