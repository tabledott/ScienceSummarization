 conjecture derives from a belief that this approach will most effectively limit the inferences required.
    These loading situations thus constitute a component of the centering constituent of the discourse situation.
    It remains an open question how long to retain these loading situations, although those corresponding to elements of Cf that are not carried forward (either as the Cb or as Cf s of the subsequent utterance) can, obviously, be dropped.
    It is possible for an utterance to prefer either a value-free (VF) or value-loaded (VL) interpretation but not force it.
    For example, the second utterance in the following sequence prefers a VF interpretation but allows for the VL interpretation that is needed in the third utterance.
    In a similar way the second utterance in the following sequencen prefers the VL interpretation, but allows for the VF.
    The third utterance requires the VF interpretation.
    In these examples, both value-free and value-loaded interpretations are shown to stem fro
