oach is outlined in Figure 1.
    Assuming that we have an algorithm for generating cross-lingual word clusters (see Section 4.2), we can augment the delexicalized parsing algorithm to use these word cluster features at training and testing time.
    In order to further motivate the proposed approach, consider the accuracy of the supervised English parser.
    A parser with lexical, part-of-speech and cluster features achieves 90.7% LAS (see Table 3).
    If we remove all lexical and cluster features, the same parser achieves 83.1%.
    However, if we add back just the cluster features, the accuracy jumps back up to 89.5%, which is only 1.2% below the full system.
    Thus, if we can accurately learn cross-lingual clusters, there is hope of regaining some of the accuracy lost due to the delexicalization process.
    Our first method for inducing cross-lingual clusters has two stages.
    First, it clusters a source language (S) as in the monolingual case, and then projects these clusters to a target language
