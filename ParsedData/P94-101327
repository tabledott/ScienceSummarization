f disagreement, using the single best evidence outperforms the combination of evidence 65% to 35%.
    This observed difference is 1.9 standard deviations greater than expected by chance and is statistically significant. ing only the single most reliable evidence in a classification.
    There are other advantages as well, including run-time efficiency and ease of parallelization.
    However, the greatest gain comes from the ability to incorporate multiple, non-independent information types in the decision procedure.
    As noted above, a given word in context (such as Castillos) may match several times in the decision list, once for its parts of speech, lemma, capitalized and capitalization-free forms, and possible wordclasses as well.
    By only using one of these matches, the gross exaggeration of probability from combining all of these non-independent log-likelihoods is avoided.
    While these dependencies may be modeled and corrected for in Bayesian formalisms, it is difficult and costly to do so.
