on.
    Thus, they are doomed to fail when disambiguation can rely only on deep understanding of the text and no other surface cues are available.
    This happened in one of the Hebrew examples, where the two alternatives were either 'emigration law' or 'immigration law' (the Hebrew word `hagira' is used for both subsenses).
    While the context indicated that the first alternative is correct, the statistics preferred the second alternative.
    It seems that such cases are quiet rare, but only further evaluation will show the extent to which deep understanding is really needed.
  
  
    The method presented takes advantage of two linguistic phenomena: the different usage of words and word senses among different languages and the importance of lexical cooccurrences within syntactic relations.
    The experiment shows that these phenomena are indeed useful for practical disambiguation.
    We suggest that the high precision received in the experiment relies on two characteristics of the ambiguity phenomena,
