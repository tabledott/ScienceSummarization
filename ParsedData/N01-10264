w publicly available EGYPT system (Al-Onaizan et al., 1999) and based on IBM's Model 3 statistical MT formalism (Brown et al., 1990).
    The data sets used for our projection studies both contained approximately 2 million words in each language.
    Their alignment was based on strictly word-based model variants for English and character-based model variants for Chinese, with no use of morphological analysis or stemming, POS-tagging, bracketing, outside dictionaries or any other external data source or annotation tool.'
    Thus the experiments were carefully designed 1-The two exceptions are end-of-sentence detection and tokenization.
    For the French Hansards, before alignment only even when the high-error automatic alignments have been manually corrected, yielding 69% and 78% direct projection accuracy respectively (at English tagset granularity).
    Traditional supervised learning algorithms tend to perform poorly at this level of noise, and a standard bigram tagger trained on the automatically aligne
