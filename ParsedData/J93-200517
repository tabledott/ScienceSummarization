  The initial seeding of lexical structures is being done independently both from the Oxford Advanced Learners Dictionary (OALD) and from lexical entries in the Longman Dictionary of Contemporary English (Procter, Ilson, and Ayto 1978).
    These are then automatically adapted to the format of generative lexical structures.
    It is these lexical structures that are then statistically tuned against the corpus, following the methods outlined in Anick and Pustejovsky (1990) and Pustejovsky (1992).
    Previous work by Amsler (1980), Calzolari (1984), Chodorow, Byrd, and Heidorn (1985), Byrd et al. (1987), Markowitz, Ahlswede, and Evens (1986), and Nakamura and Nagao (1988) showed that taxonomic information and certain semantic relations can be extracted from MRDs using fairly simple techniques.
    Later work by Veronis and Ide (1991), Klavans, Chodorow, and Wacholder (1990), and Wilks et al. (1992) provides us with a number of techniques for transfering information from MRDs to a representation language such
