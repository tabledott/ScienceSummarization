    As we noted briefly above, the existence of a regular pattern of suffixation with n distinct suffixes will generally give rise to a large set of stems displaying all n suffixes, but it will also give rise in general to stems displaying most possible combinations of subsets of these suffixes.
    Thus, if there is a regular paradigm in English consisting of the suffixes NULL, -s, -ing, and -ed, we expect to find stems appearing with most possible combinations of these suffixes as well.
    As this case clearly shows, not all such predicted subpatterns are merely partially filled paradigms.
    Of stems appearing with the signature NULL.s, some are verbs (such as occur/occurs), but the overwhelming majority, of course, are nouns.
    In the present version of the algorithm, no effort is made to directly relate signatures to one another, and this has a significant and negative impact on performance, because analyses in which stems are affiliated with high-frequency signatures are more
