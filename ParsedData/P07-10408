is computed as follows where is the reference length.
    The only difference to word error rate is that the TER allows shifts.
    A shift of a sequence of words is counted as a single edit.
    The minimum translation edit alignment is usually found through a beam search.
    When multiple references are provided, the edits from the closest reference are divided by the average reference length.
    Full test set scores are obtained by accumulating the edits and the average reference lengths.
    The perfect TER score is 0, and otherwise higher than zero.
    The TER score may also be higher than 1 due to insertions.
    Also TER is reported as a percentage in the results section.
  
  
    Confusion network decoding in MT has to pick one hypothesis as the skeleton which determines the word order of the combination.
    The other hypotheses are aligned against the skeleton.
    Either votes or some form of confidences are assigned to each word in the network.
    For example using &#8220;cat sat the mat&#822
