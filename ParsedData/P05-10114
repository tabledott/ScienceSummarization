 a treebank, T(s) is computed by parsing each s in the treebank.
    Previous studies assumed T(s) could be enumerated; however, the assumption is impractical because the size of T(s) is exponentially related to the length of s. The problem of exponential explosion is inevitable in the wide-coverage parsing of real-world texts because many parse candidates are produced to support various constructions in long sentences.
  
  
    To avoid exponential explosion, we represent T(s) in a packed form of HPSG parse trees.
    A parse tree of HPSG is represented as a set of tuples (m, 1, r), where m, 1, and r are the signs of mother, left daughter, and right daughter, respectively1.
    In chart parsing, partial parse candidates are stored in a chart, in which phrasal signs are identified and packed into an equivalence class if they are determined to be equivalent and dominate the same word sequence.
    A set of parse trees is then represented as a set of relations among equivalence classes.
