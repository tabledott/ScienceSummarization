    An interesting experiment would be the application of our role-labeling system to the output of the trace recovery system of Johnson (2002).
    Our results also have implications for parser evaluation, as the most frequently used constituent-based precision and recall measures do not evaluate how well long-range dependencies can be recovered from the output of a parser.
    Measures based on dependencies, such as those of Lin (1995) and Carroll et al. (1998), are likely to be more relevant to real-world applications of parsing.
