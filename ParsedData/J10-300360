est with S, in terms of the previously mentioned alignment scoring function.
    If some lattice is found as a match, then all that remains is to take all corresponding lattices from the other corpus that are paired with this lattice and use them to create An example showing the generalization of the word lattice (a) into a slotted lattice (b).
    The word lattice is produced by aligning seven sentences.
    Nodes having in-degrees &gt; 1 occur in more than one sentence.
    Nodes with thick incoming edges occur in all sentences. multiple rewritings (paraphrases) for S. Rewriting in this context is a simple matter of substitution: For each slot in the matching lattice, we know not only the argument from the sentence that fills it but also the slot in the corresponding rewriting lattice.
    As far as the quality of acquired paraphrases is concerned, this approach easily outperforms almost all other sentential paraphrasing approaches surveyed in this article.
    However, a paraphrase is produced only if the
