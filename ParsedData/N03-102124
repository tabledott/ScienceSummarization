 its minimizing decomposition.
    The cardinality of a production is bounded by its rank, as Table 1 shows for the 2D case.
    Finally, the cardinality C(G) of an MTG G is the maximum of the cardinalities of its productions.
  
  
    Parser A is a parser for arbitrary MTGs.
    It initializes its chart and fires Y inferences just like Parser R2A.
    It then composes pairs of items into larger items using inference rule A.0 (see below).
    Just like items in ordinary parsers, Parser A items need to know their positions in the input multitext, but not their internal structure.
    However, items with discontinuities need to remember all their boundaries, not just the outermost ones.
    Expanding on Johnson (1985), we define a discontinuous span (or dspan, for short) as a list of zero or more intervals In addition, we say that a d-span is in normal form if all the inequalities between ri and 4+1 are strict, i.e. there is a gap between each pair of consecutive intervals.
    Now, a hedge item X(a) in Parser
