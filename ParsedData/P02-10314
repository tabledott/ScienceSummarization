ated by the errors present in automatic parser output, by testing a role-labeling system based on a flat or &amp;quot;chunked&amp;quot; representation of the input.
  
  
    The results in this paper are primarily derived from the Propbank corpus, and will be compared to earlier results from the FrameNet corpus.
    Before proceeding to the experiments, this section will briefly describe the similarities and differences between the two sets of data.
    While the goals of the two projects are similar in many respects, their methodologies are quite different.
    FrameNet is focused on semantic frames, which are defined as schematic representation of situations involving various participants, props, and other conceptual roles (Fillmore, 1976).
    The project methodology has proceeded on a frameby-frame basis, that is by first choosing a semantic frame, defining the frame and its participants or frame elements, and listing the various lexical predicates which invoke the frame, and then finding example sentenc
