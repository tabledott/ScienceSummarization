ing problem is that no studies could provide empirical comparisons across grammar theories.
    The above studies and our research evaluated parsing accuracy on their own test sets.
    The construction of theory-independent standard test sets requires enormous effort because we must establish theory-independent criteria such as agreed definitions of phrases and headedness.
    Although this issue is beyond the scope of the present article, it is a fundamental obstacle to the transparency of these studies on parsing.
    Clark and Curran (2004a) described a method for reducing the cost of parsing a training treebank without sacrificing accuracy in the context of CCG parsing.
    They first assigned each word a small number of supertags, corresponding to lexical entries in our case, and parsed supertagged sentences.
    Because they did not use the probabilities of supertags in a parsing stage, their method corresponds to our &#8220;filtering only&#8221; method.
    The difference from our approach is that the
