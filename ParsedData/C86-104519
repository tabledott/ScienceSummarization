ation has always been one of the hardest problems for categorial grammars.
			Functional composition together with type-raising can be used to obtain all permutations of the sentences that are generated by a traditional categorial grammar.
			Totally free word order does therefore not pose an unsurmountable problem to the categorial approach.
			As with other types of grammar formalisms, it is semi-free word order that is difficult o accommedate.
			GPSG, LFG, and FUG all have mechanisms for encoding ordering regularities.
			Such a device does not exist in the categorial grammars that i am aware of.
			However, Uszkoreit (1985a,b) argues (on the basis of data fl'om German) for an application of l/near precedence rules to the valency list of syntactic functors.
			This approach presupposes that the valency list contains adjuncts as well as complements as the flmetor's syntactic arguments) The model can be summarized as follows.
			The lexicon lists uninstantiated ntries.
			For functors, these entries contain
