ynsets usingWordNet relationship edges; ?track star#n#1?
			and ?ex pert#n#1?
			are first reached by following hyponym and hypernym edges from ?ace#n#1,?
			and ?occultist#n#1?
			and ?Cagliostro#n#1?
			are first reached with hypernym and instance edges from ?sorcerer#n#1.?
			The node?breeze through#v#1?
			is reached through a path follow ing derivational links with ?ace#n? and ?ace#v.?The MarkovGloss variant in table 1 shows how infor mation can be extracted solely from the textual glosses.
			Once the random walk reaches the first Synset nodes, itcan step to the TokenPOS nodes in their glosses; for example, ?ace#n#1?
			has the gloss ?someone who is daz zlingly skilled in any field.?
			Links to TokenPOS nodes that are very common in glosses are down-weighted with NMDF weighting, so ?someone#n? receives little mass while ?dazzlingly#r? receives more.
			From there, therandom walk can step to another Synset such as ?daz MarkovLink model MarkovGloss model Figure 1: Example stationary distributions plotted
