ll of 0, whereas our argument-based measure would report precision and recall of 1.
    If the guessed labeling is [The deregulation]ARG1 of railroads [that]R-ARG1 [began]PRED enabled shippers to bargain for transportation, both measures would report precision and recall of 1.
    (For our argument-based measure it does not make sense to propose R-ARGX labels and we assume such labels would be converted to C-ARGX labels if they are after the phrase they refer to.)
    Nevertheless, overall we expect the two measures to yield very similar results.
  
  
    A classifier is local if it assigns a probability (or score) to the label of an individual parse tree node ni independently of the labels of other nodes.
    In defining our models, we use the standard separation of the task of semantic role labeling into identification and classification phases.
    Formally, let L denote a mapping of the nodes in a tree t to a label set of semantic roles (including NONE) with respect to a predicate v. Let Id(L) be the map
