    Although we believe that this algorithm could be seen as an instance of a uniform architecture for parsing and generation&#8212;just as the extended Earley parser (Shieber, 1985b) and the bottom-up generator were instances of the generalized Earley deduction architecture&#8212;our efforts to date have been aimed foremost toward the development of the algorithm for generation alone.
    We will mention efforts toward this end in Section 5.
    As does the Earley-based generator, the new algorithm assumes that the grammar is a unification-based or logic grammar with a phrase structure backbone and complex nonterminals.
    Furthermore, and again consistent with previous work, we assume that the nonterminals associate to the phrases they describe logical expressions encoding their possible meanings.
    Beyond these requirements common to logic-based formalisms, the methods are generally applicable.
    A variant of our method is used in Van Noord's BUG (Bottom-Up Generator) system, part of MiMo2, an experim
