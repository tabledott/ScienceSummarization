 each pair are also in the figure.
    Those formulae replace the step 3 (in Section 2.3) for each training pair, and these counts are used in the step 4.
    The graph structure is generated by expanding the root node .
    The beta probability for each node is first calculated bottom-up, then the alpha probability for each node is calculated topdown.
    Once the alpha and beta probabilities for each node are obtained, the counts are calculated as above and used for updating the parameters.
    The complexity of this training algorithm is .
    The cube comes from the number of parse tree nodes ( ) and the number of possible French substrings ( ).
