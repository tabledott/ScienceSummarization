   We compared our output to the deterministic system of Haghighi and Klein (2009).
    Many improvements arise from correctly identifying mentions which are semantically compatible but which do not explicitly appear in an appositive or predicatenominative configuration in the data.
    For example, analyst and it cannot corefer in our system because it is not a likely pronoun for the type PERSON.
    While the focus of our model is coreference resolution, we can also isolate and evaluate the type component of our model as an NER system.
    We test this component by presenting our learned model with boundary-annotated non-pronominal entities from the A05ST dev set and querying their predicted type variable T. Doing so yields 83.2 entity classification accuracy under the mapping between our prototyped types and the coarse ACE types.
    Note that this task is substantially more difficult than the unsupervised NER in Elsner et al. (2009) because the inventory of named entities is larger (7 vs. 3) and because w
