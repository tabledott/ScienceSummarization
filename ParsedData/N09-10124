i to word j means that word j is an argument of word i or alternatively, word i is the head of word j.
    Note that each word token may be the argument of at most one head, but a head may have several arguments.
    If parse tree ti can be drawn on a plane above the sentence with no crossing edges, it is called projective.
    Otherwise it is nonprojective.
    As in previous work, we restrict ourselves to projective dependency trees.
    The dependency models in this paper will be formulated as a particular kind of Probabilistic Context Free Grammar (PCFG), described below.
    3.
    If N1 &#8212;* &#946;1 and N2 &#8212;* &#946;2 are tied then the tying relation defines a one-to-one mapping between rules in RN, and RN2, and we say that N1 and N2 are tied nonterminals.
    As we see below, we can estimate tied PCFGs using standard techniques.
    Clearly, the tying relation also defines an equivalence class over nonterminals.
    The tying relation allows us to formulate the distributions over trees in term
