ee 4 edge degree 5 edge degree 6 projective planar well-nested of primary and secondary dependencies based on Discontinuous Grammar (Kromann, 2003).
    Only primary dependencies are considered in the experiments, which are based on the entire treebank.4 The results of our experiments are given in Table 1.
    For the binary constraints (planarity, well-nestedness), we simply report the number and percentage of structures in each data set that satisfy the constraint.
    For the parametric constraints (gap degree, edge degree), we report the number and percentage of structures having degree d (d &gt; 0), where degree 0 is equivalent (for both gap degree and edge degree) to projectivity.
    For DDT, we see that about 15% of all analyses are non-projective.
    The minimal degree of non-projectivity required to cover all of the data is 2 in the case of gap degree and 4 in the case of edge degree.
    For both measures, the number of structures drops quickly as the degree increases.
