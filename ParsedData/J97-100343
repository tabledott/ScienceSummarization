documents using normalized tf.idf term weighting, scoring text segments according to a normalized inner product of vectors of these weights (this algorithm is called the vector space model [Salton 1989]).
    Salton and Allan (1993) do not try to determine the extents of passages within articles or sections.
    Instead, all paragraphs, sections, and articles are assigned pairwise similarity scores, and links are drawn between those with the highest scores, independent of their position within the text.
    This distinction is important because the difficulty in subtopic segmentation lies in detecting the subtle differences between adjacent text blocks.
    A method that finds blocks with the topmost similarity to one another can succeed at finding the equivalent of the center of a subtopic extent, but does not distinguish where one subtopic ends and the next begins.
    If the algorithm of Salton and Allan (1993) were transformed so that adjacent text units were compared, and a method for determining where t
