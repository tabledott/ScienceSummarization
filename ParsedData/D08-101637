nonterminal refinements (Matsuzaki et al., 2005), or secondary links Mid (not constrained by TREE/PTREE) that augment the parse with representations of control, binding, etc.
    (Sleator and Temperley, 1993; Buch-Kromann, 2006).
    Other parsing-like problems that could be attacked with BP appear in syntax-based machine translation.
    Decoding is very expensive with a synchronous grammar composed with an n-gram language model (Chiang, 2007)&#8212;but our footnote 10 suggests that BP might incorporate a language model rapidly.
    String alignment with synchronous grammars is quite expensive even for simple synchronous formalisms like ITG (Wu, 1997)&#8212;but Duchi et al. (2007) show how to incorporate bipartite matching into max-product BP.
    Finally, we can take advantage of improvements to BP proposed in the context of other applications.
    For example, instead of updating all messages in parallel at every iteration, it is empirically faster to serialize updates using a priority queue (Elidan et al.
