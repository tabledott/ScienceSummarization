 this paper to provide a comprehensive description of the PATR-II project, or even of the formalism itself.
    Rather, we will discuss briefly the critical properties of PATR-II to give a flavor for our approach to the design of the language.
    References to papers with more complete descriptions of particular aspects of the project are provided when appropriate.
    Building on a convergence of ideas from the linguistics and Al communities, PATH-II takes as its primitive operation an extended pattern-matching technique, unification, first used in logic and theorem-proving research and lately finding its way into research in linguistics [Kay, 79; Gazdar and PuIlum, 821 and knowledge representation [Reynolds, 70; Ait-Kaci, 83).
    Instead of unifying logic terms, however, PAIR unification operates on directed acyclic graphs (DAG).3 DAGs can be atomic symbols or sets of label/value pairs, where the values are themselves DAGs (either atomic or complex).
    Two labels can have the same value&#8212;thus the u
