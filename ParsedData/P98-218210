bers of the category.
    For instance, either pickup truck or pickup is a legitimate vehicle, whereas cargo plane is legitimate, but cargo is not.
    For this reason, co-occurrence within noun compounds is not considered in the iterative portions of our algorithm.
    Instead, all noun compounds with a head that is included in our final ranked list, are evaluated for inclusion in a second list.
    The method for evaluating whether or not to include a noun compound in the second list is intended to exclude constructions such as government plane and include constructions such as fighter plane.
    Simply put, the former does not correspond to a type of vehicle in the same way that the latter does.
    We made the simplifying assumption that the higher the probability of the head given the non-head noun, the better the construction for our purposes.
    For instance, if the noun government is found in a noun compound, how likely is the head of that compound to be plane?
    How does this compare to the noun f
