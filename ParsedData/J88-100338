r words for every one explicitly tagged.
    But CLAWS is time- and storage-inefficient in the extreme, and in some cases a fallback algorithm is employed to prevent running out of memory, as was discovered by examining the Pascal program code.
    How often the fallback is employed is not known, nor is it known what effect its use has on overall accuracy.
    Since CLAWS calculates the probability of every path, it operates in time and space proportional to the product of all the degrees of ambiguity of the words in the span.
    Thus, the time is exponential (and hence Non-Polynomial) in the span length.
    For the longest span in the Brown Corpus, of length 18, the number of paths examined would be 1,492,992.
  
  
    The algorithm described here depends on a similar empirically-derived transitional probability matrix to that of CLAWS, and has a similar definition of &amp;quot;optimal path&amp;quot;.
    The tagset is larger than TAGGIT's, though smaller than CLAWS', containing 97 tags.
