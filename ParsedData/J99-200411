ry tree is associated with at least one lexical item on its frontier.
    The lexical item associated with an elementary tree is called the anchor of that tree.
    An elementary tree serves as a complex description of the anchor and provides a domain of locality over which the anchor can specify syntactic and semantic (predicate argument) constraints.
    Elementary trees are of two kinds: (a) initial trees and (b) auxiliary trees.
    In an FB-LTAG grammar for natural language, initial trees are phrase structure trees of simple sentences containing no recursion, while recursive structures are represented by auxiliary trees.
    Elementary trees are combined by substitution and adjunction operations.
    The result of combining the elementary trees is the derived tree and the process of combining the elementary trees to yield a parse of the sentence is represented by the derivation tree.
    The derivation tree can also be interpreted as a dependency tree with unlabeled arcs between words of the sentence.
