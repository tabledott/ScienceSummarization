ss-validation on other portions of OntoNotes data.
    As mentioned earlier, there are some portions of the OntoNotes corpus that have not been annotated for coreference but that have been annotated for other layers.
    For training models for each of the layers, where feasible, we used all the data that we could for that layer from the training portion of the entire OntoNotes release.
    Parse Trees Predicted parse trees were produced using the Charniak parser (Charniak and Johnson, 2005).12 Some additional tag types used in the OntoNotes trees were added to the parser&#8217;s tagset, including the NML tag that has recently been added to capture internal NP structure, and the rules used to determine head words were appropriately extended.
    The parser was then re-trained on the training portion of the release 4.0 data using 10-fold crossvalidation.
    Table 5 shows the performance of the re-trained Charniak parser on the CoNLL-2011 test set.
    We did not get a chance to re-train the re-ranker, and sin
