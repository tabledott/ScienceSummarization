for so-called "permanent pre- dictable ambiguity", those cases in which one cannot tell where a constituent should be attached, even given context.
  Here, annotators attach the constituent at the more likely site (or if that is impossible to determine, at the higher site) and pseudo-attach it at all other plausible sites using using the *PPA * null element.
  Within the annotator workstation, this is done with a single mouse click, using pseudo-move and pseudo-promote operations.
