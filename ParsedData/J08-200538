nt the V arguments as it is quite trivial to predict V and, hence, this gives overoptimistic overall performance if included.
  When doing the comparison, we also compute the 95% confidence interval of F1 us- ing the bootstrap resampling method (Noreen 1989), and the difference is considered significant if the compared F1 lies outside this interval.
  The automatic full parse trees are derived using Charniak?s parser (2001) (version 0.4).
  In automatic shallow parsing, the information is generated by different state-of-the-art components, including a POS tagger (Even-Zohar and Roth 2001), a chunker (Punyakanok and Roth 2001), and a clauser (Carreras, Ma`rquez, and Castro 2005).
  4.2 Argument Classification To evaluate the performance gap between full parsing and shallow parsing in argument classification, we assume the argument boundaries are known, and only train classifiers to classify the labels of these arguments.
  In this stage, the only difference between the uses of full parsing and shallow parsing
