 as contextual information about the tokens immediately to the left and to the right.
    We also conducted tests using wider contexts, but performance did not improve.
    We call the token containing the symbol which marks a putative sentence boundary the Candidate.
    'Hie portion of the Candidate preceding the potential sentence boundary is called the Prefix and the portion following it is called the Suffix.
    The system that focused on maximizing performance used the following hints, or contextual &amp;quot;templates&amp;quot;: The templates specify only the form of the information.
    The exact information used by the maximum entropy model for the potential sentence boundary marked by . in Corp. in Example 1 would be: PreviousWordIsCapitalized, Prefix= Corp, Suffix=NULL, PrefixFeature=CorporateDesignator.
    The highly portable system uses only the identity of the Candidate and its neighboring words, and a list of abbreviations induced from the training data.2 Specifically, the &amp;quot;templates&
