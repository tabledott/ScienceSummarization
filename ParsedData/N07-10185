e t is generated by G and fr(t) is the number of times the production r = A ? ?
			R is used in the derivation of t. If G does not generate t let PG(t|?)
			= 0.
			The yield y(t) of a parse tree t is the sequence of terminals labeling its leaves.
			The probability of a string w ? T+ of terminals is the sum of the probability of all trees with yield w, i.e.: PG(w|?)
			= ? t:y(t)=w PG(t|?).
			2.2 Bayesian inference for PCFGs.
			Given a corpus of strings w = (w1, . . .
			, wn), where each wi is a string of terminals generated by a knownCFG G, we would like to be able to infer the pro duction probabilities ? that best describe that corpus.
			Taking w to be our data, we can apply Bayes?
			rule (Equation 1) to obtain: P(?|w) ? PG(w|?)P(?), where PG(w|?)
			= n ? i=1 PG(wi|?).
			Using t to denote a sequence of parse trees for w, we can compute the joint posterior distribution over t and ?, and then marginalize over t, with P(?|w) = ? t P(t, ?|w).
			The joint posterior distribution on t and ? is given by: P
