e controversial are the approximations that must be made to obtain a tractable version.
    The first commonly made approximation is that the probabilities of the individual aligned pairs within an alignment are independent, i.e., The other common approximation is that each Pr(Li L2171 , 7-2) depends not on the entire texts, but only on the contents of the specific passages within the alignment: Maximization of this approximation to the alignment probabilities is easily converted into a minimum-sum problem: The minimization can be implemented using a dynamic programming strategy.
    Further approximations vary according to the specific method being used.
    Below, we first discuss a pure length-based approximation, then a method with lexical extensions.
  
  
    Length-based alignment methods are based on the following approximation to equation (2): where l = length(Li) and /2 = length(L2), measured in number of characters.
    In other words, the only feature of L1 and L2 that affects their alignment prob
