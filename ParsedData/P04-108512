 and disagreements.
    We first define the classification problem, then describe non-contextual features, provide some empirical evidence justifying our choice of contextual features, and finally evaluate the classifier.
    We need to first introduce some notational conventions and define the classification problem with the agreement/disagreement tagset.
    In our classification problem, each spurt among the spurts of a meeting must be assigned a tag AGREEDISAGREEBACKCHANNELOTHER.
    To specify the speaker of the spurt (e.g. speaker B), the notation will sometimes be augmented to incorporate speaker information, as with , and to designate the addressee of B (e.g. listener A), we will use the notation .
    For example, AGREE simply means that B agrees with A in the spurt of index .
    This notation makes it obvious that we do not necessarily assume that agreements and disagreements are reflexive 7The annotation of DA is particularly fine-grained with a choice of many optional tags that can be associated
