-free but uses unification to express rule templates for the the context-free productions.
    For example, the rule template: corresponds to three CFG productions where the second feature : n is either s, p, or : n. This rule template may elicit up to 7 non-terminals.
    The grammar has 21 features whose range of values maybe from 2 to about 100 with a median of 8.
    There are 672 rule templates of which 400 are actually exercised when we parse a corpus of 15,000 sentences.
    The number of productions that are realized in this training corpus is several hundred thousand.
    While a NT in the above grammar is a feature vector, we group several NTs into one class we call a mnemonic represented by the one NT that is the least specified in that class.
    For example, the mnemonic VBOPASTSG* corresponds to all NTs that unify with: We use these mnemonics to label a parse tree and we also use them to estimate a P-CFG, where the probability of rewriting a NT is given by the probability of rewriting the mnemon
