 For d = 0, we have a Dirichlet distribution and the number of unique words grows more slowly at O(0 log T).
    Figure 1 demonstrates the power-law behaviour of the Pitman-Yor process and how this depends on d and 0.
    In the first two panels we show the average number of unique words among 10 sequences of T words drawn from G, as a function of T, for various values of 0 and d. We see that 0 controls the overall number of unique words, while d controls the asymptotic growth of the number of unique words.
    In the last two panels, we show the proportion of words appearing only once among the unique words; this gives an indication of the proportion of words that occur rarely.
    We see that the asymptotic behaviour depends on d but not on 0, with larger d&#8217;s producing more rare words.
    This procedure for generating words drawn from G is often referred to as the Chinese restaurant process (Pitman, 2002).
    The metaphor is as follows.
    Consider a sequence of customers (corresponding to the word
