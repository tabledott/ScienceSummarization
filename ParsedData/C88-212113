tems which serve as heads.
  If a structure has only one terminal, the terminal is the head of the structure; if there are several terminals, the choice of the head is linguistically motivated, e.g.
  by the principles of X theory.
  S also has to be considered as the projection of a lexical head, usually V. Each lexical item corresponds to as many entries as there are possible category or argument structures.
  The category structure is a lexical tree that is not necessarily reduced to a single category.
  It corresponds to the maximal projection of a category in the case of simple phrases, to the entire compound, in the case of compound categories.
  Category structures can be of two different kinds: ?
  lexical trees reduced to a single category: ~ DET NP PP DET N of N$ DET , I I t hell) JR bunch(i ) ?
  lexical trees that consist of a phrase: NP NP A I D~ N N I I boy (I) Ma r y (I) The argument  st ructure is not reduced to a list of arguments as the usual subcategorization frames.
