ank for systemi and n is the number of systems.
    The possible values of p range between 1(where all systems are ranked in the same order) and &#8722;1 (where the systems are ranked in the reverse order).
    Thus an automatic evaluation metric with a higher value for p is making predictions that are more similar to the human judgments than an automatic evaluation metric with a lower p. Measuring sentence-level correlation under our human evaluation framework was made complicated by the fact that we abandoned the fluency and adequacy judgments which are intended to be absolute scales.
    Some previous work has focused on developing automatic metrics which predict human ranking at the sentence-level (Kulesza and Shieber, 2004; Albrecht and Hwa, 2007a; Albrecht and Hwa, 2007b).
    Such work generally used the 5-point fluency and adequacy scales to combine the translations of all sentences into a single ranked list.
    This list could be compared against the scores assigned by automatic metrics and used to
