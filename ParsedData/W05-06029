			The tag null is used for words that have no cor responding concept.
			Some concepts are conveyedby phrases, like ?has the ball?
			for bowner in the pre vious example.
			Only one word is labeled with the concept; the syntactic head word (Collins, 1997) is preferred.
			During parsing, the other words in thephrase will provide context for determining the se mantic label of the head word.
			Labels are added to the remaining nodes in abottom-up manner.
			For each node, one of its chil dren is chosen as the semantic head, from which it will inherit its label.
			The semantic head is chosen as the child whose semantic label can take the MR?s of the other children as arguments.
			This step wasdone mostly automatically, but required some man ual corrections to account for unusual cases.
			In order for COMPOSEMR to be able to construct the MR for a node, the argument constraints for its semantic head must identify a unique concept to fill each argument.
			However, some predicates take multipl
