  TOWARD A COMPLEX G1,OfSSARY In the previous section we have introduced a techniqne that derives a word - to - word translation glossary.
  We will now reline tile model to make the probabilities a better reflection of reality, and then outline an approach for including in tile glossary Ihe /ixEd locations discussed in Section 2.
  It should be noted that while English / French translation is quite k)cal (as illustrated by the alignment of Figure 1), the model leading to (4.1) did not take advantage of this affinity of the two languages: tile relative position of the word translate pairs ill their respective selltences was not taken into account.
  If m and n denote the respective lengths of corresponding French and l:.nglish sentences, then the probability that 6~ (the kth word in the English sentencE) is a pri
