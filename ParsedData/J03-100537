obabilities are taken into account (Tillmann 2001).
    Using the definition of &#175;p(f), the following modified probability Qe (e, C, j) is used to replace the original probability Qe (e,C,j), and all pruning is applied to the new probability: For the translation experiments, equation (3) is recursively evaluated over subsets of source positions of equal cardinality.
    For reasons of brevity, we omit the state description S in equation (3), since no separate pruning according to the states S is carried out.
    The set of surviving hypotheses for each cardinality c is referred to as the beam.
    The size of the beam for cardinality c depends on the ambiguity of the translation task for that cardinality.
    To fully exploit the speedup of the DP beam search, the search space is dynamically constructed as described in Tillmann, Vogel, Ney, Zubiaga, and Sawaf (1997), rather than using a static search space.
    To carry out the pruning, the maximum probabilities with respect to each coverage set C and car
