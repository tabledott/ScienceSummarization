ble to human experts.
    As defined in [McDonald96], there are two kinds of evidences that can be used in NER to solve the ambiguity, robustness and portability problems described above.
    The first is the internal evidence found within the word and/or word string itself while the second is the external evidence gathered from its context.
    In order to effectively apply and integrate internal and external evidences, we present a NER system using a HMM.
    The approach behind our NER system is based on the HMM-based chunk tagger in text chunking, which was ranked the best individual system [Zhou+00a] [Zhou+00b] in CoNLL'2000 [Tjong+00].
    Here, a NE is regarded as a chunk, named &amp;quot;NE-Chunk&amp;quot;.
    To date, our system has been successfully trained and applied in English NER.
    To our knowledge, our system outperforms any published machine-learning systems.
    Moreover, our system even outperforms any published rule-based systems.
    The layout of this paper is as follows.
