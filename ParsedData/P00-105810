 generation of a node depends on the label of its grandparent (Charniak, 2000; Johnson, 1998).
    In order to capture such dependencies in a PCFG-based model, they must be localized either by transforming the data or modifying the parser.
    Such changes are not always obvious a priori and often must be devised anew for each language or each corpus.
    But none of these cases really requires special treatment in a PTAG model, because each composition probability involves not only a bilexical dependency but a &amp;quot;biarboreal&amp;quot; (tree-tree) dependency.
    That is, PTAG generates an entire elementary tree at once, conditioned on the entire elementary tree being modified.
    Thus dependencies that have to be stipulated in a PCFG by tree transformations or parser modifications are captured for free in a PTAG model.
    Of course, the price that the PTAG model pays is sparser data; the backoff model must therefore be chosen carefully.
