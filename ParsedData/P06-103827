    Categories are generated using a novel graph clique-set algorithm.
    The only other fully unsupervised lexical category acquisition approach is based on decomposition of a matrix defined by context feature vectors, and it has not been shown to scale well yet.
    Our algorithm was evaluated using both human judgment and automatic comparisons with WordNet, and results were superior to previous work (although it used a POS tagged corpus) and more efficient computationally.
    Our algorithm is also easy to implement.
    Computational efficiency and specifically lack of annotation are important criteria, because they allow usage of huge corpora, which are presently becoming available and growing in size.
    There are many directions to pursue in the future: (1) support multi-word lexical items; (2) increase category quality by improved merge algorithms; (3) discover various relationships (e.g., hyponymy) between the discovered categories; (4) discover finer inter-word relationships, such as verb sele
