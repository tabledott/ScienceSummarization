nstette et al.
    (2004)11 all begin by first creating prior-polarity lexicons.
    Yu and Hatzivassiloglou then assign a sentiment to a sentence by averaging the prior semantic orientations of instances of lexicon words in the sentence.
    Thus, they do not identify the contextual polarity of individual phrases containing clue instances, which is the focus of this work.
    Morinaga et al. only consider the positive or negative clue instance in each sentence that is closest to some target reference; Kim and Hovy, Hu and Liu, and Grefenstette et al. multiply or count the prior polarities of clue instances in the sentence.
    These researchers also consider local negation to reverse polarity, with Morinaga et al. also taking into account the negating effect of words like insufficient.
    However, they do not use the other types of features that we consider in our experiments.
    Kaji and Kitsuregawa (2006) take a different approach to recognizing positive and negative sentences.
