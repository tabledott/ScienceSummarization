resented a simple greedy algorithm for removing links that destroy phrasal coherence.
    Although it is shown to be quite effective in the current domains, it is preferable to have a more principled way of promoting phrasal coherence.
    The problem is that, by treating MRL productions as atomic units, current word-based alignment models have no knowledge about the tree structure hidden in a linearized MR parse.
    In the future, we would like to develop a word-based alignment model that is aware of the MRL syntax, so that better lexicons can be learned.
