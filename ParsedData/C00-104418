  Following the methodology of the preceding subsec- tion, we recovered the inflection and modilication indica- tors for these 453 adjectives, and trained both the unmod- ified and modilied log-linear models rcpcatedly, using a randomly selected subset ol 300 adjectives for training and 100 adjectives for testing.
  The entire cycle of se- lecting random test and training sets, fitting the models coefficients, making predictions, and evaluating the pre- dicted gradability labels is repeated 100 times, to ensure that the ewtluation is not affected by a lucky (or unlucky) partition of the data between training and test sets.
  This procedure yields over the 453 adjectives gradability clas- sifications with an average precision o1 93.55% and av- erage recall o1 82.24% (in terms of the gradable words reported or recovered, respectively).
  The overall accu- racy of the predicted gradability labels is 87.97%.
  These results were obtained with the modified log-linear model, which slightly ot, tperformed
