an one outgoing edge labelled l for all l in a set of labels U. C1 In a symmetric coordination there is exactly one argument to the right of the conjunction and at least one argument to the left.
    C2 In an asymmetric coordination there are no arguments to the left of the conjunction and at least two arguments to the right.
    C3 There must be at least one comma between subsequent arguments to the left of a symmetric coordination.
    C4 Arguments of a coordination must have compatible word classes.
    P1 Two dependencies must not cross if one of their labels is in a set of labels P. A1 covers constraints such as &#8220;there can only be one subject&#8221; if U contains &#8220;subject&#8221; (see Section 4.4 for more details of U).
    C1 applies to configurations which contain conjunctions such as &#8220;en&#8221;,&#8220;of&#8221; or &#8220;maar&#8221; (&#8220;and&#8221;, &#8220;or&#8221; and &#8220;but&#8221;).
    C2 will rule-out settings where a conjunction such as &#8220;zowel&#8221; (translates as
