    Table 1 gives an overview of the results of the chunking-labeling experiments, using the following algorithms, determined by validation on the train set: IBI-IG for XP-chunking and IGTree for PP-chunking and ADVFUNCs assignment.
    In grammatical relation assignment we assign a GR to pairs of words in a sentence.
    In our 2PPs containing anything else than NPs (e.g.
    'without bringing his wife) are not searched for. ments.
    NP-,VP-, ADJP-, ADVP- and Prepchunks are found simultaneously, but for convenience, precision and recall values are given separately for each type of chunk. experiments, one of these words is always a verb, since this yields the most important GRs.
    The other word is the head of the phrase which i
