that occurs during semantic composition is an equality condition which identifies two different variables.
    Stating this formally is straightforward but a little long-winded, so we omit it here.
  
  
    The SEPs and EQs can be interpreted with respect to a first order model hE, A, Fi where: Definition 4 Denotations of SEMENTs If a =6 &#8869; is a SEMENT, [a]M = h[i], [i0], Gi where: The truth definition of the SEPs and EQs (which we group together under the term SMRS, for simple MRS) is as follows: Thus, with respect to a model M, an SMRS can be viewed as denoting an element of P(G), where G is the set of variable assignment functions (i.e., elements of G assign the variables e,... and x, .. . their denotations): [smrs]M = {g : g is a variable assignment function and M |=g smrs} We now consider the semantics of the algebra.
    This must define the semantics of the operation op in terms of a function f which is defined entirely in terms of the denotations of op&#8217;s arguments.
    In other words, [op(
