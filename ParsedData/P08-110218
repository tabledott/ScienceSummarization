sure both on segmentation and on Joint S&amp;T.
    Note that the accuracy of Joint S&amp;T means that a word-POS pair is recognized only if both the boundary tags and the POS&#8217;s are correctly labelled.
    The evaluation results are shown in Table 3.
    We find that Joint S&amp;T can also improve the segmentation accuracy.
    However, the F-measure on Joint S&amp;T is obvious lower, about a rate of 95% to the F-measure on segmentation.
    Similar trend appeared in experiments of Ng and Low (2004), where they conducted experiments on CTB 3.0 and achieved Fmeasure 0.919 on Joint S&amp;T, a ratio of 96% to the F-measure 0.952 on segmentation.
    As the next step, a group of experiments were conducted to investigate how well the cascaded linear model performs.
    Here the core perceptron was just the POS+ model in experiments above.
    Besides this perceptron, other sub-models are trained and used as additional features of the outside-layer linear model.
    We used SRI Language Modelling Toolkit (Sto
