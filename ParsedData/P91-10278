    Note the five SFs, as tested on 2.6 million words of the Wall Street Journal and controlled by the Penn Treebank's hand-verified tagging the substantial variation among the SFs: for the SFs &amp;quot;direct object&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;direct object &amp; clause&amp;quot; efficiency is roughly 40% and 25%, respectively; for &amp;quot;direct object &amp; infinitive&amp;quot; it drops to about 8%; and for the intransitive SFs it is under 5%.
    The reason that the transitive SFs fare better is that the direct object gets case from the preceding verb and hence reveals its presence &#8212; intransitive verbs are harder to find.
    Likewise, clauses fare better than infinitives because their subjects get case from the main verb and hence reveal it, whereas infinitives lack overt subjects.
    Another obvious factor is that, for every SF listed above except &amp;quot;direct object&amp;quot; two verbs need to be found &#8212; the matrix verb and the complement verb &#8212; if either one is not detecte
