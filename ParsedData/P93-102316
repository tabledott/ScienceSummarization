law (Zipf, 1949).
    However, the expected number of concordances and discordances which can be attributed to chance will be the same (a random pair can produce a concordance or discordance with probability 0.5 for each), so the effect of chance fluctuations on T is not very significant.
    Furthermore, the robustness of the method guarantees that it will not be significantly influenced by any outliers (this is true for all rank based methods).
    Therefore, although we cannot have complete confidence in a statistical estimate like T, we expect the module to produce useful estimates of similarity.
    On the other hand, the adjective-adjective module produces similarity values with absolute certainty, since once two adjectives have been seen in the same NP even once, we can deduce that they do not belong in the same group.
    However, this negative knowledge is computed only for a few of the possible pairs of adjectives, and it cannot be propagated to more pairs as dissimilarity is not a transitive relati
