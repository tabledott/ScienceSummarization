 is the previously covered source sentence position and e', e'' are the predecessor words.
    The DP equation is evaluated recursively for each hypothesis (e', e, C, j).
    The resulting algorithm is depicted in Table 2.
    Some details concerning the initialization and the finding of the best target language string are presented in Section 3.4. p($  |e, e') is the trigram language probability for predicting the sentence boundary symbol $.
    The complexity of the algorithm is O(E3 &#183; J2 &#183; 2J), where E is the size of the target language vocabulary.
    The above search space is still too large to translate even a medium-length input sentence.
    On the other hand, only very restricted reorderings are necessary; for example, for the translation direction German to English, the word order difference is mostly restricted to the German verb group.
    The approach presented here assumes a mostly monotonic traversal of the source sentence positions from left to right.2 A small number of positions may
