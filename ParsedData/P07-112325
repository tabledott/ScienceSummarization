 shows the performance of the two classifiers on the MPQA corpus as reported in (Wiebe and Riloff, 2005).
    Note that 55% of the sentences in the MPQA corpus are subjective &#8211; which represents the baseline for this data set.
    The two OpinionFinder classifiers are used to label the training corpus.
    After removing the 504 test sentences, we are left with 10,628 sentences that are automatically annotated for subjectivity.
    Table 6 shows the number of subjective and objective sentences obtained with each classifier.
    Next, the OpinionFinder annotations are projected onto the Romanian training sentences, which are then used to develop a probabilistic classifier for the automatic labeling of subjectivity in Romanian sentences.
    Similar to, e.g., (Pang et al., 2002), we use a Naive Bayes algorithm trained on word features cooccurring with the subjective and the objective classifications.
    We assume word independence, and we use a 0.3 cut-off for feature selection.
