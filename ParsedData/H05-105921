nt set in each chunk representation type to the test data.
			Table 6 summarizes the performance on thetest set.
			Our bidirectional methods achieved F scores of 93.63 and 93.70, which are better than the best F-score (93.48) of the CoNLL-2000 shared task (Sang and Buchholz, 2000) and comparable to those achieved by other state-of-the-art methods.
	
	
			There are some reports that one can improve the performance of unidirectional models by combiningoutputs of multiple taggers.
