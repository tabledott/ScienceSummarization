ines of research in summarization and anaphora resolution.
    In summarization, topic signatures are a set of terms indicative of a topic (Lin and Hovy, 2000).
    They are extracted from hand-sorted (by topic) sets of documents using log-likelihood ratios.
    These terms can capture some narrative relations, but the model requires topic-sorted training data.
    Bean and Riloff (2004) proposed the use of caseframe networks as a kind of contextual role knoweldge for anaphora resolution.
    A caseframe is a verb/event and a semantic role (e.g.
    &lt;patient&gt; kidnapped).
    Caseframe networks are relations between caseframes that may represent synonymy (&lt;patient&gt; kidnapped and &lt;patient&gt; abducted) or related events (&lt;patient&gt; kidnapped and &lt;patient&gt; released).
    Bean and Riloff learn these networks from two topic-specific texts and apply them to the problem of anaphora resolution.
    Our work can be seen as an attempt to generalize the intuition of caseframes (finding an entir
