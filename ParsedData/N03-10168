, s, and even e when context permits.
    Our parser, like a best-first parser, maintains estimates b(e, s) of O(e, s) which begin at &#8722;oo, only increase over time, and always represent the score of the best parses of their edges e discovered so far.
    Optimality means that for any e, b(e, s) will equal OG(e, s) when e is removed from the agenda.
    If one uses b(e, s) to prioritize edges, we show in Klein and Manning (2001a), that the parser is optimal over arbitrary PCFGs, and a wide range of control strategies.
    This is proved using an extension of Dijkstra&#8217;s algorithm to a certain kind of hypergraph associated with parsing, shown in figure 1(b): parse items are nodes in the hypergraph, hyperarcs take sets of parse items to their result item, and hyperpaths map to parses.
    Reachability from start corresponds to parseability, and shortest paths to Viterbi parses.
    The hypergraph shown in figure 1(b) shows a parse of the goal S:[0,3] which includes NP:[0,2].2 This parse can be split in
