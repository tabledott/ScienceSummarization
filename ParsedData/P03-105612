c generalizations corresponding to category refinements are easily implemented via category-splitting in the PCFG model, without concern for affecting the dependency model.
    In adapting this parsing model to Chinese, we have retained unchanged the dependency model developed for English; the model backs off to tags, and backoff parameters remain the same.3 In all cases, test input to the parser was segmented but untagged.4 Our focus in parser development has been to refine the PCFG model via stepwise refinements informed by major observed ambiguity classes.
    We illustrate that each of these refinements can effectively be viewed as an amendment to the independence assumptions made by a simple PCFG.
  
  
    The simplest systematic augmentations to basic PCFG models are the inclusion of various types of contextual information in the structure of individual node labels.
    In principle, any contextual information could be used, but in practice two types are most heavily relied on: (i) information highly l
