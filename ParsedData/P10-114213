er (1997) and Bean and Riloff (2004) to identify the most probable NP partition.
    Some clustering algorithms bear a closer resemblance to the way a human creates coreference clusters.
    In these algorithms, not only are the NPs in a text processed in a left-to-right manner, the later coreference decisions are dependent on the earlier ones (Cardie and Wagstaff, 1999; Klenner and Ailloud, 2008).5 For example, to resolve an NP, NPk, Cardie and Wagstaff&#8217;s algorithm considers each preceding NP, NPj, as a candidate antecedent in a right-to-left order.
    If NPk and NPj are likely to be coreferent, the algorithm imposes an additional check that NPk does not violate any constraint on coreference (e.g., gender agreement) with any NP in the cluster containing NPj before positing that the two NPs are coreferent.
    Luo et al.&#8217;s (2004) Bell-tree-based algorithm is another clustering algorithm where the later coreference decisions are dependent on the earlier ones.
