distribution.
    This can be seen in Figure 1 above, where the binomial distribution (dashed lines) is plotted along with the approximating normal distributions (solid lines) for np set to 5, 10, and 20, with n fixed at 100.
    Larger values of n with np held constant give curves that are not visibly different from those shown.
    For these cases, npr--,- np(1 &#8212; p).
    This agreement between the binomial and normal distributions is exactly what makes test statistics based on assumptions of normality so useful in the analysis of experiments based on counting.
    In the case of the binomial distribution, normality assumptions are generally considered to hold well enough when np(1 &#8212; p) &gt; 5.
    The situation is different when np(1&#8212;p) is less than 5, and is dramatically different when np(1 &#8212; p) is less than 1.
    First, it makes much less sense to approximate a discrete distribution such as the binomial with a continuous distribution such as the normal.
    Second, the probabiliti
