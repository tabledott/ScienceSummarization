n separate training bitexts for each of three language pairs.
    SIMR was then evaluated on previously unseen test bitexts in the three language pairs.
    The objective function for optimization and the evaluation metric were the root mean squared distance, in characters, between each TPC and the interpolated bitext map produced by SIMR, where the distance was measured perpendicular to the main diagonal.
    Tables 2 and 3 report SIMR's errors on the training and test bitexts, respectively.
    The TBM samples used for training and testing were derived from segment alignments.
    All the bitexts had been manually aligned by bilingual annotators (Melamed 1997).
    The alignments were converted into sets of coordinates in the bitext space by pairing the character positions at the ends of aligned segment pairs.
    This IBM sampling method artificially reduced the error estimates.
    Most of the aligned segments were sentences, which ended with a period.
    Whenever SIMR matched the periods correctly, the
