probabilities conditioned on lexical heads.
    The models are evaluated on the Penn Wall Street Journal Treebank, showing that their accuracy is competitive with other models in the literature.
    To gain a better understanding of the models, we also give results on different constituent types, as well as a breakdown of precision/recall results in recovering various types of dependencies.
    We analyze various characteristics of the models through experiments on parsing accuracy, by collectingfrequencies ofvarious structures in the treebank, and through linguistically motivated examples.
    Finally, we compare the models to others that have been applied to parsing the treebank, aiming to give some explanation of the difference in performance of the various models.
  
  
    Ambiguity is a central problem in natural language parsing.
    Combinatorial effects mean that even relatively short sentences can receive a considerable number of parses under a wide-coverage grammar.
