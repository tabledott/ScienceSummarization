nd then adequacy annotations.
    Almost all annotators reported difficulties in maintaining a consistent standard for fluency and adequacy judgements, but nevertheless most did not explicitly move towards a ranking-based evaluation.
    Almost all annotators expressed their preference to move to a ranking-based evaluation in the future.
    A few pointed out that adequacy should be broken up into two criteria: (a) are all source words covered?
    (b) does the translation have the same meaning, including connotations?
    Annotators suggested that long sentences are almost impossible to judge.
    Since all long sentence translation are somewhat muddled, even a contrastive evaluation between systems was difficult.
    A few annotators suggested to break up long sentences into clauses and evaluate these separately.
    Not every annotator was fluent in both the source and the target language.
    While it is essential to be fluent in the target language, it is not strictly necessary to know the source languag
