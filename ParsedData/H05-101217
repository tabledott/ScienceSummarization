ce with a second annotator is in the same range as the reannotation by a single annotator.
	
	
			In order to evaluate the performance of the algo rithm, we investigate the effect due to: (a) increasing the training data size, (b) additional feature types, and (c) comparable algorithms.
			7.1 Training Data Size.
			We varied the training data size from 1K sentences to the complete set in Table 2.
			Each batch re-estimates the unknown word class by creating a vocabulary on the training set.
			The trend indicates a reasonable progression of performance and more data is required to determine the saturation point.
			7.2 Feature Types.
			The results obtained by different feature sets areshown in Table 3.
			Each feature type was added incre mentally (Add Feature column) to the line above to determine the effect of the individual feature typesand then removed incrementally from the full sys tem (Subtract Feature column) in order to see the final effect.
			The results indicate that lexical featuresare the most
