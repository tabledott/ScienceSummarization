ination of the simplified additive and multiplicative functions.
    The best results on the task of paraphrasing noun-verb combinations with ambiguous verbs (sales slump is more like declining than slouching) are obtained using the multiplicative approach, and by weighted combination of addition and multiplication (we do not test model combinations in our current experiments).
    The multiplicative approach also performs best (but only by a small margin) in a later application to language modeling (Mitchell and Lapata, 2009).
    Erk and Pad&#180;o (2008; 2009) adopt the same formalism but focus on the nature of input vectors, suggesting that when a verb is composed with a noun, the noun component is given by an average of verbs that the noun is typically object of (along similar lines, Kintsch (2001) also focused on composite input vectors, within an additive framework).
    Again, the multiplicative model works best in Erk and Pad&#180;o&#8217;s experiments.
