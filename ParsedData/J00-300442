would be equally correct if a space had been inserted between the two bigrams.
    On the whole, we find that the order 3 model gives the best results overall, although there is little difference between orders 3, 4, and 5.
  
  
    Word segmentation forms a valuable component of any Chinese digital library system.
    It improves full-text retrieval in two ways: higher-precision searching (that is, fewer false matches), and the ability to incorporate relevance ranking.
    This increases the effectiveness of full-text search and helps to provide users with better feedback.
    For example, one study concludes that the performance of an unsegmented characterbased query is about 10% worse than that of the corresponding segmented query (Broglio, Callan, and Croft 1996).
    Many emerging digital library technologies also presuppose word segmentation&#8212;for example, text summarization, document clustering, and keyphrase extraction all rely on word frequencies.
    These would not work well on unsegmented tex
