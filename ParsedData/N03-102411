 go into (or out of) the same node in an FSA are labeled with the same word, the nodes on the other end of the edges are merged.
    We apply this operation exhaustively over the FSAs produced by the top-down merging procedure.
    Figure 6 illustrates the effect of this operation: the FSA at the top of this figure is compressed into the more compact FSA shown at the bottom of it.
    Note that in addition to reducing the redundant edges, this also gives us paraphrases not available in the FSA before squeezing (e.g.
    {reduced to rubble, blasted to ground}).
    Therefore, the squeezing operation, which implements a limited form of lexically driven alignment similar to that exploited by MSA algorithms, leads to FSAs that have a larger number of paths The evaluation for our finite state representations and algorithm requires careful examination.
    Obviously, what counts as a good result largely depends on the application one has in mind.
    If we are extracting paraphrases for question-reformulation, it d
