he DCA seems to be a reasonable principle, especially when expressed in terms of syntactic dependencies that abstract away word order.
    That is, the thematic (who-did-what-to-whom) relationships are likely to hold true across translations evert for typologically different languages.
    Consider example (1) again: despite the fact that the Basque sentence has a different word order, with the verb appearing at the far right of the sentence, the syntactic dependency relationships of English (subject, object, noun modifier, etc.) are largely preserved across the alignment, as illustrated in Table 1.
    Moreover, the DCA makes possible more elegant formalisms (e.g.
    SITG) and more efficient algorithms It may allow us to use the syntactic analysis for one language to infer annotations for the corresponding sentence in another language, helping to reduce the labor and expense of creating treebanks in new languages (Cabezas et al., 2001; Yarowsky and Ngai, 2001).
    Unfortunately, the DCA is flawed, even for
