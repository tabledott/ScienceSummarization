    Our model avoids the estimation biases associated with heuristic frequency count approaches and uses standard regularisation techniques to avoid degenerate maximum likelihood solutions.
    Having demonstrated the efficacy of our model with very simple features, the logical next step is to investigate more expressive features.
    Promising features might include those over source side reordering rules (Wang et al., 2007) or source context features (Carpuat and Wu, 2007).
    Rule frequency features extracted from large training corpora would help the model to overcome the issue of unreachable reference sentences.
    Such approaches have been shown to be effective in log-linear wordalignment models where only a small supervised corpus is available (Blunsom and Cohn, 2006).
    Finally, while in this paper we have focussed on the science of discriminative machine translation, we believe that with suitable engineering this model will advance the state-of-the-art.
    To do so would require
