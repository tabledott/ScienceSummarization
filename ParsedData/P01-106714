e pairs in the corpus.
    We also counted the number of perfectly aligned sentence pairs in the 50 pairs.
    Perfect means that all alignments in a sentence pair were judged okay by all the human judges.

    For each , For , += cnt += cnt += cnt , and , he adores listening to music he adores listening to music he has unusual ability in english hypocrisy is abhorrent to them he has unusual ability in english he was ablaze with anger hypocrisy is abhorrent to them he was ablaze with anger Our model got a better result compared to IBM Model 5.
    Note that there were no perfect alignments from the IBM Model.
    Errors by the IBM Model were spread out over the whole set, while our errors were localized to some sentences.
    We expect that our model will therefore be easier to improve.
    Also, localized errors are good if the TM is used for corpus preparation or filtering.
    We also measured training perplexity of the models.
    The perplexity of our model was 15.79, and that of IBM Model 5 was 9.
