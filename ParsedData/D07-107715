			Figure 7 shows an examplenoun phrase with two nested CP modifiers.
			As illus trated in the figure, relative clauses in Chinese also occur before the noun they modify, which makes the word order of this sentence quite different from that of the English translation.
			Such distortions in the word reordering will be quite difficult for the word or phrase-based alignment model to capture.
			However, with the application of a reordering ruleto reposition the child CP after its sibling NP un der a parent NP, and the PP VP reordering rule for VP introduced previously, the sentence can be easily transformed into ?French delegation participate 8th handicap people Winter Olympics hold at US Salt Lake City,?
			a sentence whose word order is much closer to that of English.
			CP is typically formed by ?IP+DEC?, in which DEC?s only function is to mark the IP as a relative NP CP IP VP VV ?\ (participate) NP CP IP VP PP P 3 (at) NP NR {I(US) NR ??
