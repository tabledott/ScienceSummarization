lationship between sentence length and the number of derivations.
    Training is difficult without a clear target, and predicting only one derivation at test time is fraught with danger.
    Past work on discriminative SMT only address some of these problems.
    To our knowledge no systems directly address Problem 1, instead choosing to ignore the problem by using one or a small handful of reference derivations in an n-best list (Liang et al., 2006; Watanabe et al., 2007), or else making local independence assumptions which side-step the issue (Ittycheriah and Roukos, 2007; Tillmann and Zhang, 2007; Wellington et al., 2006).
    These systems all include regularisation, thereby addressing Problem 2.
    An interesting counterpoint is the work of DeNero et al. (2006), who show that their unregularised model finds degenerate solutions.
    Some of these discriminative systems have been trained on large training sets (Problem 3); these systems are the local models, for which training is much simpler.
