 to ensure that no node labelled S' can be inserted within it &#8211; i.e., it can not be filled by with a wh-moved element.
    In contrast, since both the subject and the object of to adore have been moved out of the projection of the verb, the path to these arguments do not carry any SIC at all'.
    We now discuss a possible derivation.
    We start out with the most deeply embedded clause, the adores clause.
    Before subserting its nominal arguments, we sister-adjoin the two adjectival trees to the tree for hotdogs.
    This is handled by a SAC associated with the N' node that allows all trees rooted in AdjP to be left sister-adjoined.
    We then subsert this structure and the subject into the to adore d-tree.
    We subsert the resulting structure into the seems clause by substituting its maximal projection node, labelled VP[fin: 1, at the VP[fin: -] frontier node of seems, and by inserting the subject into the d-edge of the seems tree.
    Now, only the S node of the seems tree (which is its maximal
