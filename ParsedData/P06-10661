ll a computationally expensive problem just like reordering at the word level (Knight, 1999).
    Many systems use very simple models to reorder phrases 1.
    One is distortion model (Och and Ney, 2004; Koehn et al., 2003) which penalizes translations according to their jump distance instead of their content.
    For example, if N words are skipped, a penalty of N will be paid regardless of which words are reordered.
    This model takes the risk of penalizing long distance jumps 1In this paper, we focus our discussions on phrases that are not necessarily aligned to syntactic constituent boundary. which are common between two languages with very different orders.
    Another simple model is flat reordering model (Wu, 1996; Zens et al., 2004; Kumar et al., 2005) which is not content dependent either.
    Flat model assigns constant probabilities for monotone order and non-monotone order.
    The two probabilities can be set to prefer monotone or non-monotone orientations depending on the language pairs.
