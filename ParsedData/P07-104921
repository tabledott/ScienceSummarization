hs of the In and Out properties of Aw&#963; where Q = Sign(i) if l = (w, 0) and Q = Sign(&#8722;i) if l = (w, 1).
    In addition, the weight is bounded from above by the best label match strength, s(l): Wt(x &#65533;y) = min(s(l), AQ (In*)) where if AQ (In*) &lt; 0 and AQ (Out) &lt; 0 then d = 1 and otherwise d = 0. y inside the smallest bracket covering x.
    Such links are therefore created in the second case above, when the attachment indication is mixed.
    To explain the third case, recall that s(l) &gt; 0 means that the label l is stronger than Stop on AZ .
    This implies a link unless the properties of w block it.
    One way in which w can block the link is to have a positive strength for the link in the opposite direction.
    Another way in which the properties of w can block the link is if l = (w, 0) and AQ (Out) &lt; 0, that is, if the learning process has explicitly determined that no outbound link from w (which represents x in this case) is possible.
    The same conclusion cannot be drawn
