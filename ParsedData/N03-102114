er dimension than hedges.
    The size of an RTV is bounded by the cardinality of the grammar.
    Thus, the space complexity of B is in (C (G)12D ) On the other hand, The B.ID rules involve only one d-span instead of two, reducing the number of free variables by (C (G)) .
    B.LP rules again involve only one lexical head instead of two, reducing the number of free by a factor of &lt; turns out that the worst-case running time of Parser B is than that of Parser A by a factor of under of any rank and dimensionality.
    6 Conclusion We have proposed Multitext Grammars (MTGs) as a convenient and relatively expressive foundation for building practical models of translational equivalence.
    To encourage their use for this purpose, we have explored algorithms for parsing bilexical MTGs of arbitrary rank and dimensionality.
    Our exploration highlighted some little-known properties of synchronous parsing: (1) some optimizations of monolingual parsers generalize to the synchronous case, but others do not; (2) d
