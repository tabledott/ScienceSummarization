 shows the learning curves of JESS-CM with respect to the size of the unlabeled data, where the x-axis is on the logarithmic scale of the unlabeled data size (Mega-word).
    The scale at the top of the graph shows the ratio of the unlabeled data size to the labeled data size.
    We observe that a small amount of unlabeled data hardly improved the performance since the supervised CRF results are competitive.
    It seems that we require at least dozens of times more unlabeled data than labeled training data to provide a significant performance improvement.
    The most important and interesting behavior is that the performance improvements against the unlabeled data size are almost linear on a logarithmic scale within the size of the unlabeled data used in our experiments.
    Moreover, there is a possibility that the performance is still unsaturated at the 1G-word unlabeled data point.
    This suggests that increasing the unlabeled data in JESS-CM may further improve the performance.
    Suppose J=1, the d
