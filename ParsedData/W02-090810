erms we create a gold standard from the union of the synonyms from the three thesauri.
    With this gold standard in place, it is possible to use precision and recall measures to evaluate the quality of the extracted thesaurus.
    To help overcome the problems of direct comparisons we use several measures of system performance: direct matches (DIRECT), inverse rank (INVR), and precision of the top n synonyms (P(n)), for n = 1, 5 and 10.
    INVR is the sum of the inverse rank of each matching synonym, e.g. matching synonyms at ranks 3, 5 and 28 give an inverse rank score of
  
  
    1 5 + 128, and with at most 200 synonyms, the maximum INVR score is 5.878.
    Precision of the top n is the percentage of matching synonyms in the top n extracted synonyms.
    There are a total of 23207 synonyms for the 70 terms in the gold standard.
    Each measure is averaged over the extracted synonym lists for all 70 thesaurus terms.
