  For this task, we use only the BLEU and NIST scores.
    Both scores are computed caseinsensitive with respect to four reference translations using the mteval-v11b tool1.
    For the NIST task, we use the BLEU score as primary criterion which is optimized on the NIST 2002 evaluation set using the Downhill Simplex algorithm (Press et al., 2002).
    Note that only the eight or nine model scaling factors of Equation 2 are optimized using the Downhill Simplex algorithm.
    The feature weights of the reordering model are trained using the GIS algorithm as described in Section 4.4.
    We use a state-of-the-art baseline system which would have obtained a good rank in the last NIST evaluation (NIST, 2005).
    The translation results for the NIST task are presented in Table 8.
    We observe consistent improvements of the BLEU score on all evaluation sets.
    The overall improvement due to reordering ranges from 1.2% to 2.0% absolute.
