for me a major desapointment :-(&#8221;.
    In future work we will investigate ways to remove noisy data from the Emoticons dataset.
  
  
    This paper has demonstrated that dependency in sentiment classification can take the form of domain, topic, temporal and language style.
    One might suppose that dependency is occurring because classifiers are learning the semantic sentiment of texts rather than the general sentiment of language used.
    That is, the classifiers could be learning authors&#8217; sentiment towards named entities (e.g. actors, directors, companies, etc.).
    However, this does not seem to be the case.
    In a small experiment, we part-ofspeech tagged the Polarity 2004 dataset and automatically replaced proper nouns with placeholders.
    Retraining on this modified text did not significantly affect performance.
    But it may be that something more subtle is happening.
    Possibly, the classifiers are learning the words associated with the semantic sentiment of entities.
    For ex
