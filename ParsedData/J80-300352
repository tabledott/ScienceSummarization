&amp;quot;how&amp;quot; questions have been examined.
    Besides the incorporation of more syntactic information, another critical area that needs work concerns the control of inferencing.
    To allow the use of specialized inferences, a capability that is obviously required by the general theory, much research needs to be done outlining methods of selecting and restricting such inferences.
    This paper has concentrated on recognition.
    Allen [1979] shows how the construction algorithms would have to be modified to allow the generation of surface acts, including indirect forms.
    McDonald [1980] discusses the planning of low-level syntactic form.
    According to the definition of INFORM of section 4.1, any utterance that causes S to infer that A has a plan to achieve KNOW(S,P) by achieving BsWA(KNOW(S,P)) is considered by S to be an INFORM.
    Strawson [1964] argues that one level of recognition of intention is not sufficient for the definition of a speech act.
    Schiffer [1972] gives a series of
