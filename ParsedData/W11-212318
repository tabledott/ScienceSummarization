sequent query will match the full context.
    If the log backoff of wnf is also zero (it may not be in filtered models), then wf should be omitted from the state.
    This logic applies recursively: if wnf+1 similarly does not extend and has zero log backoff, it too should be omitted, terminating with a possibly empty context.
    We indicate whether a context with zero log backoff will extend using the sign bit: +0.0 for contexts that extend and &#8722;0.0 for contexts that do not extend.
    RandLM and SRILM also remove context that will not extend, but SRILM performs a second lookup in its trie whereas our approach has minimal additional cost.
    Section 4.1 explained that state s is stored by applications with partial hypotheses to determine when they can be recombined.
    In this section, we extend state to optimize left-to-right queries.
    All language model queries issued by machine translation decoders follow a left-to-right pattern, starting with either the begin of sentence token or null contex
