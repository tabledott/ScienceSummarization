ting entities from mentions and the search space.
    We use a maximum entropy model to rank paths in the Bell tree, which is discussed in Section 3.
    After presenting the search strategy in Section 4, we show the experimental results on the ACE 2002 and 2003 data, and the Message Understanding Conference (MUC) (MUC, 1995) data in Section 5.
    We compare our approach with some recent work in Section 6.
  
  
    Let us consider traversing mentions in a document from beginning (left) to end (right).
    The process of forming entities from mentions can be represented by a tree structure.
    The root node is the initial state of the process, which consists of a partial entity containing the first mention of a document.
    The second mention is Figure 1: Bell tree representation for three mentions: numbers in [] denote a partial entity.
    In-focus entities are marked on the solid arrows, and active mentions are marked by *.
    Solid arrows signify that a mention is linked with an in-focus partial entit
