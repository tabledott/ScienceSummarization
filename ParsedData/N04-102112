    The same issues affect the parser.
    For example the parser can create verb phrases where none exist, as in the following example in which the tagger correctly did not identify a verb in the sentence: These effects have serious implications for designing syntactic feature functions.
    Features such &#8220;is there a verb phrase&#8221; may not do what you expect.
    One solution would be features that involve the probability of a parse subtree or tag sequence, allowing us to ask &#8220;how good a verb phrase is it?&#8221; Another solution is more detailed features examining more of the structure, such as &#8220;is there a verb phrase with a verb?&#8221;
