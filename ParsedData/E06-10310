  CDER: Efficient MT Evaluation Using Block Movements
  
    Most state-of-the-art evaluation measures for machine translation assign high costs to movements of word blocks.
    In many cases though such movements still result in correct or almost correct sentences.
    In this paper, we will present a new evaluation measure which explicitly models block reordering as an edit operation.
    Our measure can be exactly calculated in quadratic time.
    Furthermore, we will show how some evaluation measures can be improved
  
  
    Research in machine translation (MT) depends heavily on the evaluation of its results.
    Especially for the development of an MT system, an evaluation measure is needed which reliably assesses the quality of MT output.
    Such a measure will help analyze the strengths and weaknesses of different translation systems or different versions of the same system by comparing output at the sentence level.
    In most applications of MT, understandability for humans in terms of readabilit
