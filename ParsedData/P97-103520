ber of repair utterances (#rep) for each of these users.
    Users 5 and 11 correspond to the dialogues in Figures 2 and 3 respectively.
    To normalize ci for user 5, we determine that FT is 38.6 and cc, is 18.9.
    Thus, H(ci ) is -0.83.
    Similarly .1V(ci) for user 11 is -1.51.
    To estimate the performance function, the weights a and wi must be solved for.
    Recall that the claim implicit in Figure 1 was that the relative contribution of task success and dialogue costs to performance should be calculated by considering their contribution to user satisfaction.
    User satisfaction is typically calculated with surveys that ask users to specify the degree to which they agree with one or more statements about the behavior or the performance of the system.
    A single user satisfaction measure can be calculated from a single question, or as the mean of a set of ratings.
    The hypothetical user satisfaction ratings shown in Table 5 range from a high of 6 to a low of 1.
    Given a set of dialogues f
