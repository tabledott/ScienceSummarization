orphological and contextual information Tries provide an effective, efficient and flexible data structure for storing both contextual and morphological patterns and statistics.
    First, they are very compact representations.
    Second, they support a natural hierarchical smoothing procedure for distributional class statistics.
    We consider characterbased tries, in which each node contains a probability distribution (when working with tokenized text, two distributions are considered in each node, one for tokens and one for types).
    The distribution stored at each node contain the probability of each name class given the history ending at that node.
    Each distribution also has two standard classes, named &amp;quot;questionable&amp;quot; (unassigned probability mass in terms of entity classes, to be motivated below) and &amp;quot;non-entity&amp;quot;.
    To simplify the notations, we will refer to a start and end point bounded portion of text being analyzed (in order to determine if it represents a
