 threshold, however, can be gainfully employed to control the trade-off between precision and recall.
    This has not traditionally been done in learning-based coreference resolution research &#8212; possibly because there is not much training data available to sacrifice as a validation set.
    Nonetheless, we hypothesized that estimating a threshold from just the training data might be effective.
    Our results (BASELINE box in Table 3) indicate that this indeed works well.5 With the exception of MUC6, results on all data sets and for all scoring algorithms improve; moreover, the scores approach those for runs using an optimal threshold (box 3) for the experiment as determined by using the test set.
    In all remaining experiments, we learn the threshold from the training set as in the BASELINE system.
    Below, we resume our investigation of the role of three coreference resolution subtasks and measure the impact of each on overall performance.
    Previous work has shown that resolving coreference bet
