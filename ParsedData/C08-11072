es (in analog to lexical resources such as WordNet).
			Supervised learning of broad coverage rule-sets is an arduous task.
			This sparked intensive research on unsupervised acquisition of entailment rules (and similarly paraphrases) e.g.
			(Lin and Pantel, 2001; Szpektor et al, 2004; Sekine, 2005).
			Most unsupervised entailment rule acquisitionmethods learn binary rules, rules between tem plates with two variables, ignoring unary rules, rules between unary templates (templates withonly one variable).
			However, a predicate quite of ten appears in the text with just a single variable(e.g. intransitive verbs or passives), where infer ence requires unary rules, e.g. ?X take a nap?X sleep?
			(further motivations in Section 3.1).In this paper we focus on unsupervised learning of unary entailment rules.
			Two learning ap proaches are proposed.
			In our main approach, rules are learned by measuring how similar the variable instantiations of two templates in a corpusare.
			In addition to adapting state-of-t
