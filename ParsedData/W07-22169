) as the set of all directed spanning trees for a graph G. As McDonald et al. (2005b) noted, there is a one-to-one correspondence between spanning trees of Gx and labeled dependency graphs of x, i.e., T(Gx) is exactly the set of all possible projective and non-projective dependency graphs for sentence x.
    Throughout the rest of this paper, we will refer to any T &#8712; T (Gx) as a valid dependency graph for a sentence x.
    Thus, by definition, every valid dependency graph must be a tree.
  
  
    In this section we examine the class of models that assume each dependency decision is independent.
    Within this setting, every edge in an induced graph Gx for a sentence x will have an associated weight wk ij &#8805; 0 that maps the kth directed edge from node i to node j to a real valued numerical weight.
    These weights represents the likelihood of a dependency occurring from word wi to word wj with label lk.
    Define the weight of a spanning tree T = (VT, ET) as the product of the edge weights It is
