 Schabes [1995].
    Schabes's method can be viewed as performing an abductive inference: given a sentence containing an ambiguous word, it asks which choice wi for that word would best explain the observed sequence of words in the sentence.
    It answers this question by substituting each wi in turn into the sentence.
    The wi that produces the highest-probability sentence is selected.
    Sentence probabilities are calculated using a part-of-speech trigram model.
    We tried Schabes's method on the usual confusion sets; the results are in the last column of Table 7.
    It can be seen that trigrams and the Bayesian hybrid method each have their better moments.
    Trigrams are at their worst when the words in the confusion set have the same part of speech.
    In this case, trigrams can distinguish between the words only by their prior probabilities this follows from the way the method calculates sentence probabilities.
    Thus, for {between, among}, for example, where both words are prepositions, trig
