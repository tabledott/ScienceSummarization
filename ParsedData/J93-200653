AWN IN THE PERUVIAN TOWN OF YUNGUYO, NEAR THE LAKE, VERY NEAR WHERE THE PRESIDENTIAL SUMMIT WAS TO TAKE PLACE.
    Certain sequences of fragments appear frequently, as illustrated in Tables 1 and 2.
    One frequently occurring pair is an S followed by a PP (prepositional phrase).
    Since there is more than one way the parser could attach the PP, and syntactic grounds alone for attaching the PP would yield poor performance, semantic preferences applied by a post-process that combines fragments are called for.
    In our approach, we propose using local syntactic and semantic information rather than assuming a global syntactic and semantic form will be found.
    The first step is to compute a semantic interpretation for each fragment found without assuming that the meaning of each word is known.
    For instance, as described above, the semantic class for any noun phrase can be computed provided the head noun has semantics in the domain.
    Based on the data above, a reasonable approach is an algorithm tha
