ic transitionbased parser using the system 5,, is O(n) in the best case and O(n2) in the worst case.
    But what about the average case?
    Empirical studies, based on data from a wide range of languages, have shown that dependency trees tend to be projective and that most non-projective trees only contain a small number of discontinuities (Nivre, 2006; Kuhlmann and Nivre, 2006; Havelka, 2007).
    This should mean that the expected number of swaps per sentence is small, and that the running time is linear on average for the range of inputs that occur in natural languages.
    This is a hypothesis that will be tested experimentally in the next section.
  
  
    Our experiments are based on five data sets from the CoNLL-X shared task: Arabic, Czech, Danish, Slovene, and Turkish (Buchholz and Marsi, 2006).
    These languages have been selected because the data come from genuine dependency treebanks, whereas all the other data sets are based on some kind of conversion from another type of representation, whi
