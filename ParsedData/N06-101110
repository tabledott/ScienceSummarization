s and up to a particular length (including the empty string ).
    Couplings of the substrings from both sets produce features we use for training.
    Note that couplings with the empty string represent insertions/omissions.
    Consider the following example: ( ,) We build a feature vector by coupling substrings from the two sets: We use the observation that transliteration tends to preserve phonetic sequence to limit the number of couplings.
    For example, we can disallow the coupling of substrings whose starting positions are too far apart: thus, we might not consider a pairing in the above example.
    In our experiments, we paired substrings if their positions in their respective words differed by -1, 0, or 1.
    We use the perceptron (Rosenblatt, 1958) algorithm to train the model.
    The model activation provides the score we use to select best transliterations on line 6.
    Our version of perceptron takes examples with a variable number of features; each example is a set of all features seen so
