    Although lexical statistics are quite accurate on the data covered by observations in the training set, the sparsity of their coverage led us to introduce semantically motivated knowledge sources, which in turn allowed us to compare automatically derived and hand-built semantic resources.
    Various methods of extending the coverage of lexical statistics indicated that the broader coverage of automatic clustering outweighed its imprecision.
    Carefully choosing sentence-level features for representing alternations in verb argument structure allowed us to introduce dependencies between frame element decisions within a sentence without adding too much complexity to the system.
    Integrating semantic interpretation and syntactic parsing yielded only the slightest gain, showing that although probabilistic models allow easy integration of modules, the gain over an unintegrated system may not be large because of the robustness of even simple probabilistic systems.
    Many aspects of our syste
