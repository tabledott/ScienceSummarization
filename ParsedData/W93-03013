ased terminology reuse tool is being developed to do just exactly this.
    The tool depends crucially on the results of an alignment program to determine which parts of the source text correspond with which parts of the target text.
    In working with the translators at AT&amp;T Language Line Services, a commercial translation service, we discovered that we needed to completely redesign our alignment programs in order to deal more effectively with texts supplied by Language Line's customers.
    All too often the texts are not available in electronic form, and may need to be scanned in and processed by an OCR (optical character recognition) device.
    Even if the texts are available in electronic form, it may not be worth the effort to clean them up by hand.
    Real texts are not like the Hansards; real texts are much smaller and not nearly as clean as the ideal texts that have been used in previous studies.
    To deal with these robustness issues, Church (1993) developed a character-based alignment meth
