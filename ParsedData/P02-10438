uss a simple, but imperfect, solution to this problem in section 7.
	
	
			State-of-the-art statistical parsers use many other features, or conditioning variables, such as head words, subcategorization frames, distance measures and grandparent nodes.
			We too can extend the baseline model described in the previous section by including more features.
			Like the models of Goodman (1997), the additional features in our model are generated probabilistically, whereas in the parser of Collins (1997) distance measures are assumed to be a function of the already generated structure and are not generated explicitly.
			In order to estimate the conditional probabilitiesof our model, we recursively smooth empirical es timates e?i of specific conditional distributions with(possible smoothed) estimates of less specific distri butions e?i
