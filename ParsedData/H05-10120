	A Maximum Entropy Word Aligner For Arabic-English Machine Translation
		This paper presents a maximum entropyword alignment algorithm for Arabic English based on supervised training data.We demonstrate that it is feasible to create training material for problems in machine translation and that a mixture of su pervised and unsupervised methods yields superior performance.
		The probabilisticmodel used in the alignment directly models the link decisions.
		Significant improvement over traditional word alignment tech niques is shown as well as improvement onseveral machine translation tests.
		Perfor mance of the algorithm is contrasted with human annotation performance.
	
	
			Machine translation takes a source sequence, S = [s1 s2 . . .
			sK ] and generates a target sequence, T = [t1 t2 . . .
			tM ] that renders the meaning of the source sequence into the target sequence.
			Typically, algorithms operate on sentences.
			In the most general setup, one or more source words can generate 0, 1 or more target w
