ted terms (as suggested by Morris and Hirst [1991]) is not sufficient for determining subtopic breaks.
    Even combining terms that are closely related semantically into single chains is insufficient, since often several different themes are active within the same segment.
    For example, sentences 37 to 51 contain dense interactions among the terms move, continent, shoreline, time, species, and life, and all but the latter occur only in this region.
    (It is, however, the case that the interlinked terms of sentences 57 to 71, space, star, binary, trinary, astronomer, orbit, are closely related semantically, assuming the appropriate senses of the words.)
    Because groups of words that are not necessarily closely related conceptually seem to work together to indicate subtopic structure, I adopt a technique that can take into account the occurrences of multiple simultaneous themes rather than use chains of lexical cohesion relations alone.
    This viewpoint is also advocated by Skorochod'ko (1972), who s
