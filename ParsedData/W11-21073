or evaluation, use of this normalizer is a suitable preprocessing step for other metrics to improve accuracy when reference sentences are stylistically different from hypotheses.
    The original Meteor paraphrase tables (Denkowski and Lavie, 2010b) are constructed using the phrase table &#8220;pivoting&#8221; technique described by Bannard and Callison-Burch (2005).
    Many paraphrases suffer from word accumulation, the appending of unaligned words to one or both sides of a phrase rather than finding a true rewording from elsewhere in parallel data.
    To improve the precision of the paraphrase tables, we filter out all cases of word accumulation by removing paraphrases where one phrase is a substring of the other.
    Table 1 lists the number of phrase pairs found in each paraphrase table before and after filtering.
    In addition to improving accuracy, the reduction of phrase table sizes also reduces the load time and memory usage of the Meteor paraphrase matcher.
    The tables are a modular resource s
