    Thus the probability of the two structures can be written as It will be useful to isolate the decision between the two structures to a single probability term.
    Let the value j be the minimum value of i such that di =&#65533; ei.
    Then we can rewrite the two probabilities as follows: The first thing to note is that 11i=1...j&#8722;1 P(di|d1 ... di&#8722;1,S) = 11i=1...j&#8722;1 P(ei|e1 ... ei&#8722;1, S), so that these probability terms are irrelevant to the decision between the two structures.
    We make one additional assumption, that This is justified for the examples in this section, because once the jth decision is made, the following decisions are practically deterministic.
    Equivalently, we are assuming that P(T1|S) +P(T2|S) &#8776; 1, that is, that very little probability mass is lost to trees other than T1 or T2.
    Given these two equalities, we have isolated the decision between the two structures to the parameters P(dj|d1 ... dj&
