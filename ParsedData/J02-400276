If, however, one is also interested in selecting BACKGROUND sentences, as we are, simply choosing all BACKGROUND sentences would result in low precision of 16% (albeit with a high recall of 83%), which does not seem to be the optimal solution.
    We therefore use a second classifier for finding the most relevant sentences independently that was trained on the relevance gold standard.
    Our best classifier operates at a precision of 46.5% and recall of 45.2% (using the features Location, Section Struct, Paragraph Struct, Title, TF*IDF, Formulaic, and Citation for classification).
    The second classifier (cf. rightmost columns in figure 12) raises the precision for BACKGROUND sentences from 16% to 38%, while keeping recall high at 88%.
    This example shows that the right procedure for relevance determination changes from category to category and also depends on the final task one is trying to accomplish.
