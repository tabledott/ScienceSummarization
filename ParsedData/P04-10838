it never composes terminals.
    The inference rules of Logic C are the multidimensional generalizations of inference rules with the same names in ordinary CKY parsers.
    For example, given a suitable grammar and the input (imperative) sentence pair Wash the dishes / Pasudu moy, Parser C might make the 9 inferences in Figure 4 to infer the multitree in Figure 2.
    Note that there is one inference per internal node of the multitree.
    Goodman (1999) shows how a parsing logic can be combined with various semirings to compute different kinds of information about the input.
    Depending on the chosen semiring, a parsing logic can compute the single most probable derivation and/or its probability, the most probable derivations and/or their total probability, all possible derivations and/or their total probability, the number of possible derivations, etc.
    All the parsing semirings catalogued by Goodman apply the same way to synchronous parsing, and to all the other classes of algorithms discussed in this
