    The components of Victoria and Albert Museum and IBM and Bell Laboratories look identical; however, and is part of the name of the museum in the first example, but a conjunction joining two computer company names in the second.
    Although this problem is well known, a search of the computational literature shows that few solutions have been proposed, perhaps because the conjunct ambiguity problem is harder than PP attachment (though see (Agarwal and Boggess 1992) for a method of conjunct identification that relies on syntactic category and semantic label).
    Similar structural ambiguity exists with respect to the possessive pronoun, which may indicate a relationship between two names (e.g., Israel's Shimon Peres) or may constitute a component of a single name (e.g., Donoghue's Money Fund Report).
    The resolution of structural ambiguity such as PP attachment and conjunction scope is required in order to automatically establish the exact boundaries of proper names.
