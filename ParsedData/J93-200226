um of false positives and false negatives.
    The eighth column shows the percentage of verbs that were misclassified (%MC).
    The next-to-last column shows the precision (PRE)-the true positives divided by all verbs that Lerner judged to be +S.
    The final column shows the recall (REC)-the true positives divided by all verbs that were judged +S by hand.
    Discussion For verbs taking just a tensed clause argument, Table 6 shows that, given the right estimate p, of 7r._5, it is possible to classify these 63 verbs with only 1 false positive and 8 false negatives.
    If the error rate were ignored or approximated as zero then the false positives would go up to 19.
    On the other hand, if the error rate were taken to be as high as 1 in 25 then the false negatives would go up to 20.
    In this case, the sum of both error types is minimized with 2-8 &lt;Pcl&lt; 2-10.
    Table 7 shows similar results for verbs taking just an infinitive argument, where misclassifications are minimized with p_mf = 2-7.
