his suggests that fluency and adequacy should be replaced with ranking tasks in future evaluation exercises.
    To measure the correlation of the automatic metrics with the human judgments of translation quality we used Spearman&#8217;s rank correlation coefficient p. We opted for Spearman rather than Pearson because it makes fewer assumptions about the data.
    Importantly, it can be applied to ordinal data (such as the fluency and adequacy scales).
    Spearman&#8217;s rank correlation coefficient is equivalent to Pearson correlation on ranks.
    After the raw scores that were assigned to systems by an automatic metric and by one of our manual evaluation techniques have been converted to ranks, we can calculate p using the simplified equation: where di is the difference between the rank for systemi and n is the number of systems.
    The possible values of p range between 1(where all systems are ranked in the same order) and &#8722;1 (where the systems are ranked in the reverse order).
    Thus an automa
