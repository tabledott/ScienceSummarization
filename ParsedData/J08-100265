hers applied feature forests to representations of the packed parse results of LFG and the dependency/derivation structures of CCG.
    Their work demonstrated the applicability and effectiveness of feature forest models in parsing with wide-coverage lexicalized grammars.
    Feature forest models were also shown to be effective for wide-coverage sentence realization (Nakanishi, Miyao, and Tsujii 2005).
    This work demonstrated that feature forest models are generic enough to be applied to natural language processing tasks other than parsing.
    The work of Geman and Johnson (2002) independently developed a dynamic programming algorithm for maximum entropy models.
    The solution was similar to our approach, although their method was designed to traverse LFG parse results represented with disjunctive feature structures as proposed by Maxwell and Kaplan (1995).
    The difference between the two approaches is that feature forests use a simpler generic data structure to represent packed forest structures.
