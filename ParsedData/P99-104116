ormation of correct dependency relationships.
    For example, the verb&#8212;object relationship between &amp;quot;take&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;bride&amp;quot; passed the mutual information filter because there are 4 copies of the article containing this phrase.
    If we were able to throw away the duplicates and record only one count of &amp;quot;take&#8212;bride&amp;quot;, it would have not pass the mutual information filter (3).
    The fact that systematic parser errors tend to pass the mutual information filter is both a curse and a blessing.
    On the negative side, there is no obvious way to separate the parser errors from true non-compositional expressions.
    On the positive side, the output of the mutual information filter has much higher concentration of parser errors than the database that contains millions of collocations.
    By manually sifting through the output, one can construct a list of frequent parser errors, which can then be incorporated into the parser so that it can avoid making t
