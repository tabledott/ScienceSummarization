  In the following sections, we first describe the tech- niques used in the proposed morphological nalyzer, we then explain the cwduation metrics and show the systems performance by experimental results.

  The morphological analysis tmsk cau I)e formally defined ,~ finding a set of word segmen- tat.ion and parts of speech ~ssignment that maximize the joint probability of word sequence arm tag sequence P(W, 7).
  In the tri-POS model, the joint probability is approximated bythe product of parts of speech trigram probabilities P(t i l t i_2,t i_ l )  and word output probabil- ities for given part of speech P(wl]ll): r(w,:r) = ]~ r(tdt,_o.,t,_x)r(w, lt4
