(b), &amp;quot;short&amp;quot; spans of text can be linked and &amp;quot;long&amp;quot; ones left separate.
    A simple way to implement this is to count the number of leaves under each branch (nucleus or satellite) in the paragraph structure tree.
    Another shortcoming is the treatment of input elements as indivisible entities.
    This shortcoming is a result of factoring out the problem of aggregation as a separate text planning task.
    Chunking together input elements (to eliminate detail) or taking them apart (to be more detailed) has received scant mention &#8212; see Ellovy 871, and for the related problem of paraphrase see [Schank 75] &#8212; but this task should interact with text structuring in order to provide text that is both optimally detailed and coherent.
    At the present time, only about 20% of the RST relations have been formalized to the extent that they can be used by the structurer.
    This formalization process is difficult, because it goes handin-hand with the development of ter
