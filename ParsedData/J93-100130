    Therefore, this method of estimating parameters is called maximum likelihood estimation (MLE).
    For simple models, MLE is very easy to implement and produces reasonable estimates in many cases.
    More elaborate methods such as the Good-Turing Method (Good 1953) or Deleted Estimation (Jelinek and Mercer 1980, 1985) should be used when the frequencies are small (e.g., less than 10).
    It is often convenient to use these statistical estimates as if they are the same as the true probabilities, but this practice can lead to trouble, especially when the data don't fit the model very well.
    In fact, content words don't fit a binomial very well, because content words tend to appear in &amp;quot;bursts.&amp;quot; That is, content words are like buses in New York City; they are social animals and like to travel in packs.
    In particular, if the word Kennedy appears once in a unit of text (e.g., a paragraph, a discourse, or a genre), then it is much more likely than chance to appear a sec
