uce the morphology structures of a language.
    Our algorithm takes as input a large corpus and produces as output a set of conflation sets indicating the various inflected and derived forms for each word in the language.
    As an example, the conflation set of the word &#8220;abuse&#8221; would contain &#8220;abuse&#8221;, &#8220;abused&#8221;, &#8220;abuses&#8221;, &#8220;abusive&#8221;, &#8220;abusively&#8221;, and so forth.
    Our algorithm extends earlier approaches to morphology induction by combining various induced information sources: the semantic relatedness of the affixed forms using a Latent Semantic Analysis approach to corpusbased semantics (Schone and Jurafsky, 2000), affix frequency, syntactic context, and transitive closure.
    Using the hand-labeled CELEX lexicon (Baayen, et al., 1993) as our gold standard, the current version of our algorithm achieves an F-score of 88.1% on the task of identifying conflation sets in English, outperforming earlier algorithms.
    Our algorithm is also ap
