    Finally we had 101 tables.
    The total number the of articles and clusters we used are shown in Table 2.
    We evaluated the obtained tables as follows.
    For each row in a table, we added a summary of the source articles that were used to extract the relation.
    Then for each table, an evaluator looks into every row and its source article, and tries to come up with a sentence that explains the relation among its columns.
    The description should be as specific as possible.
    If at least half of the rows can fit the explanation, the table is considered &#8220;consistent.&#8221; For each consistent table, the evaluator wrote down the sentence using variable names ($1, $2, ...) to refer to its columns.
    Finally, we counted the number of consistent tables.
    We also counted how many rows in each table can fit the explanation.
    We evaluated 48 randomly chosen tables.
    Among these tables, we found that 36 tables were consistent.
    We also counted the total number of rows that fit each
