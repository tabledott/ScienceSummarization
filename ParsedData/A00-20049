 metric (equation 6, fa false alarms) proposed in (Beeferman et al., 1999).
    Low error probability indicates high accuracy.
    Other performance measures include the popular precision and recall metric (PR) (Hearst, 1994), fuzzy PR (Reynar, 1998) and edit distance (Ponte and Croft, 1997).
    The problems associated with these metrics are discussed in (Beeferman et al., 1999).
    Five degenerate algorithms define the baseline for the experiments.
    B&#8222; does not propose any boundaries.
    B&#8222; reports all potential boundaries as real boundaries.
    B&#8222; partitions the sample into regular segments.
    B(i.,?) randomly selects any number of boundaries as real boundaries.
    B(r,b) randomly selects b boundaries as real boundaries.
    The accuracy of the last two algorithms are computed analytically.
    We consider the status of in potential boundaries as a bit string (1 -4 topic boundary).
    The terms p(iniss) awl p(fa) in equation 6 corresponds to p(samelk) and p(difflk) = 1 -p(samelk
