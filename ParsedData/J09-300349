sTexter and TiMBL classifiers that use all the neutral&#8211;polar features: The SVM word+priorpol baseline classifier has an accuracy of 75.6%, and both the BoosTexter and TiMBL classifiers have an accuracy of 76.5%.
    However, the BoosTexter and TiMBL classifiers using all the features perform notably better in terms of polar recall and F-measure.
    The BoosTexter and TiMBL classifiers have polar recalls that are 7% and 9.2% higher than the SVM baseline.
    Polar F-measures for BoosTexter and TiMBL are 3.9% and 4.5% higher.
    These increases are significant for p &lt; 0.01.
    8.1.2 Feature Set Evaluation.
    To evaluate the contribution of the various features for neutral&#8211;polar classification, we perform a series of experiments in which different sets of neutral&#8211;polar features are added to the word+priorpol baseline and new classifiers are trained.
    We then compare the performance of these new classifiers to the word+priorpol baseline, with the exception of the Ripper classifiers, w
