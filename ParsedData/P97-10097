he polysemous words in the input text are disambiguated in the following steps: Step A. Parse the input text and extract local contexts of each word.
    Let LC. denote the set of local contexts of all occurrences of w in the input text.
    Step B.
    Search the local context database and find words that appeared in an identical local context as w. They are called selectors of w: Step C. Select a sense s of w that maximizes the similarity between w and Selectors.
    Step D. The sense s is assigned to all occurrences of w in the input text.
    This implements the &amp;quot;one sense per discourse&amp;quot; heuristic advocated in (Gale, Church, and Yarowsky, 1992).
    Step C. needs further explanation.
    In the next subsection, we define the similarity between two word senses (or concepts).
    We then explain how the similarity between a word and its selectors is maximized.
    There have been several proposed measures for similarity between two concepts (Lee, Kim, and Lee, 1989; Rada et al., 1989; Resn
