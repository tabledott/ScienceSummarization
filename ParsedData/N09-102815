ight 0 and -2, respectively.
    The first group has a NORMAL order and the second group has a REVERSE order.
    After reordering, the sentence becomes: &#8220;because we what the future has know n&#8217;t do Living exciting is .&#8221;.
    Finally, we have another node rooted at &#8220;has&#8221; that matches the verb rule again.
    After the final reordering, we end up with the sentence: &#8220;because we the future what has know n&#8217;t do Living exciting is .&#8221;.
    We can see in Figure 4 that this sentence has an almost monotonic alignment with a reasonable Korean translation shown in the figure1.
  
  
    As we mentioned in our introduction, there have been several studies in applying source sentence reordering using syntactical analysis for statistical machine translation.
    Our precedence reordering approach based on a dependency parser is motivated by those previous works, but we also distinguish from their studies in various ways.
    Several approaches use syntactical analysis to provi
