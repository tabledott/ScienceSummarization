    Functionality is enough to license the use of the definite description (Lobner 1987).
    An example of definite description classified as discourse-new on these grounds is given in (12).
    When encountering a definite whose head noun occurs in this list, the system checks if a complement is present or if the definite appears in a copular construction (e.g., the fact is that.
    .
    .).
    A second list of special predicates consulted by the system includes what Hawkins called unexplanatory modifiers: these include adjectives such as first, last, best, most, maximum, minimum, and only and superlatives in general.'.
    All of these adjectives are predicate modifiers that turn a head noun into a function, therefore again&#8212;according to Lobrter&#8212;licensing the use of a definite even when no antecedent is present (see examples below).
    When applying this heuristic, the system verifies the presence of a complement for some of the modifiers (first, last), but not for superlatives.
