  solution to the divergence problem relies solely on three types of information: the G?T4; the CST4; and a small set of parametric mechanisms.
  The G?T4 and C$T4 are intended to be language independent, whereas the parameters are intended to encode language-specific information about lexical items.
  Because the interlingual representa- tion preserves relevant lexical-semantic relations, these three types of information are all that are required for providing a systematic solution to the divergence types shown in Figure 1.
  In particular, the solution given here eliminates the n
