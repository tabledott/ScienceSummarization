presentation (FR) feature of X based on the FW of X (X-FW) as follows: - FR = lexical form of X-FW if POS of X-FW is particle, adverb, adnominal or conjunction - FR = inflectional form ofX-FW ifX-FW has an inflectional form.
    - FR = the POS tag ofX-FW, otherwise.
    For a segment X and its dynamic feature C, we set POS tag and POS-subcategory of the HW of X.
    All our experiments are carried out on AlphaSever 8400 (21164A 500Mhz) for training and Linux (PentiumIII 1GHz) for testing.
    We used a third degree polynomial kernel function, which is exactly the same setting in (Kudo and Matsumoto, 2000).
    Performance on the test data is measured using dependency accuracy and sentence accuracy.
    Dependency accuracy is the percentage of correct dependencies out of all dependency relations.
    Sentence accuracy is the percentage of sentences in which all dependencies are determined correctly.
