    A test example is classified by traversing the learned decision tree.
    WEKA implements Quinlan&#8217;s C4.5 decision tree algorithm, with pruning by default.
  
  
    In the SENSEVAL-2 English lexical sample task, participating systems are required to disambiguate 73 words that have their POS predetermined.
    There are 8,611 training instances and 4,328 test instances tagged with WORDNET senses.
    Our evaluation is based on all the official training and test data of SENSEVAL-2.
    For SENSEVAL-1, we used the 36 trainable words for our evaluation.
    There are 13,845 training instances1 for these trainable words, and 7,446 test instances.
    For SENSEVAL-1, 4 trainable words belong to the indeterminate category, i.e., the POS is not provided.
    For these words, we first used a POS tagger (Ratnaparkhi, 1996) to determine the correct POS.
    For a word that may occur in phrasal word form (eg, the verb &#8220;turn&#8221; and the phrasal form &#8220;turn down&#8221;),
