roperties found in a part of the KB that represents information shared between speaker and hearer.
    The authors observed that the problem of finding a (&#8220;Full Brevity&#8221;) description that contains the minimum number of properties is computationally intractable (i.e., NP Hard).
    They combined this with the known fact that speakers often produce nonminimal descriptions anyway (e.g., Pechman 1989).
    Accordingly, they proposed an algorithm that only approximates Full Brevity, while being of only linear complexity.
    Our summary of the algorithm glosses over many details, yet still allows us to discuss completeness.
    In particular, we disregard any special provisions that might be made for the selection of head nouns because, arguably, this has to involve realizational issues.1 The Incremental Algorithm produces a set L of properties P1,.
