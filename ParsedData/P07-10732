(Dietterich et al., 1997); however, it has since been applied to problems in other areas such as classifying image regions in computer vision (Zhang et al., 2002), and text categorization (Andrews et al., 2003; Ray and Craven, 2005).
    We have extended an existing approach to relation extraction using support vector machines and string kernels (Bunescu and Mooney, 2006) to handle this weaker form of MIL supervision.
    This approach can sometimes be misled by textual features correlated with the specific entities in the few training pairs provided.
    Therefore, we also describe a method for weighting features in order to focus on those correlated with the target relation rather than with the individual entities.
    We present experimental results demonstrating that our approach is able to accurately extract relations from the web by learning from such weak supervision.
  
  
    We address the task of learning a relation extraction system targeted to a fixed binary relationship R. The only supervision g
