e extraction process but that did not seem to have harmed overall performance (Spanish test set: F,3=1=73.89; Dutch test set: F,3=1=69.68) Patrick, Whitelaw and Munro (2002) present SLINERC, a language-independent named entity recognizer.
    The system uses tries as well as character n-grams for encoding word-internal and contextual information.
    Additionally, it relies on lists of entities which have been compiled from the training data.
    The overall system consists of six stages, three regarding entity recognition and three for entity categorization.
    Stages use the output of previous stages for obtaining an improved performance (Spanish test set: F,3=1=73.92; Dutch test set: F,3=1=71.36) Tjong Kim Sang (2002) has applied a memory-based learner to the data of the shared task.
    He used a two-stage processing strategy as well: first identifying entities and then classifying them.
    Apart from the base classifier, his system made use of three extra techniques for boosting performance: cascading
