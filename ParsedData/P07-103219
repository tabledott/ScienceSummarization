said the loss stems from several factors.

    The difference arises in the subject of said: in DepBank the subject is and: (ncsubj said and ), whereas in CCGbank there are two subjects: (ncsubj said president ) and (ncsubj said officer ).
    We deal with this difference by replacing any pairs of GRs which differ only in their arguments, and where the arguments are coordinated items, with a single GR containing the coordination term as the argument.
    Ampersands are a frequently occurring problem in WSJ text.

    We fixed this by creating conj GRs between any &amp; and the two words either side; removing the modifier GR between the two words
