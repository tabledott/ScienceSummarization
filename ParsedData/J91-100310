    A problem with the interaction view is that theorists have not provided much detail about the processes involved, though Black (1962) does make some suggestions.
    According to Black, tenor and vehicle... each have a 'system of commonplaces' associated with them.
    These commonplaces are stereotypes, not necessarily definitional, not even necessarily true, just widely agreed upon.
    In interpreting 'man is a wolf,' we 'evoke the wolf-system of related commonplaces' and are led by them 'to construct a corresponding system of implications about the principal subject (Man)' (Black, 1962, p. 41).

    One might distinguish, then, two main differences between the interaction and comparison views.
    First, similarities are &a
