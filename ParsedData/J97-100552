    Cue-prosody is assigned complex if: The ability of humans to reliably code linguistic features similar to those coded in Figure 7 has been demonstrated in various studies.
    Evaluation of prosodic labeling using TOBI, a prosodic transcription system somewhat similar to that used in the Pear corpus, has been found to be quite reliable between transcribers (Pitrelli, Beckman, and Hirschberg 1994).
    The results of a study of 953 spoken cue phrases showed that two judges agreed on whether cue phrases illustrated a discourse signaling usage or not in 878 (92.1%) cases (Hirschberg and Litman 1993).
    For these 878 cases, an algorithm that assigned discourse signaling usages to cues if they were the first lexical item in their intermediate intonational phrase performed with 75% accuracy (Litman 1994), which is analogous to the method used here to assign the value true to the feature cuei.
    When coding involves either relatively objective phen
