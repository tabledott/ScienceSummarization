 rest on semantic judgements which cannot (yet) be made automatically: for example, optional arguments are often 'understood' or implied if missing.
    Others are syntactic tests involving diathesis alternation possibilities (e.g. passive, dative movement, Levin (1993)) which require recognition that the 'same' argument, defined usually by semantic class / thematic role, is occurring across argument positions.
    We hope to exploit this information where possible at a later stage in the development of our approach.
    However, recognizing same/similar arguments requires considerable quantities of lexical data or the ability to back-off to lexical semantic classes.
    At the moment, we exploit linguistic information about the syntactic type, obligatoriness and position of arguments, as well as the set of possible subcategorization classes, and combine this with statistical inference based on the probability of class membership and the frequency and reliability of patterns for classes.
