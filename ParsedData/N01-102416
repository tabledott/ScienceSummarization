ic choose to accept as valid relationships only those vector fIW=UwDk, where Uw represents the row of U corresponding to w and Dk indicates that only the top k diagonal entries of D have been preserved.
    As a last comment, one would like to be able to obtain a separate semantic vector for every word (not just those in the top N).
    SVD computations can be expensive and impractical for large values of N. Yet due to the fact that U and VT are orthogonal matrices, we can start with a matrix of reasonablesized N and &#8220;fold in&#8221; the remaining terms, which is the approach we have followed.
    For details about folding in terms, the reader is referred to Manning and Sch&#252;tze (1999, p. 563).
    To correlate these semantic vectors, we use normalized cosine scores (NCSs) as we had illustrated before (Schone and Jurafsky (2000)).
    The normalized cosine score between two words w1 and w2 is determined by first computing cosine values between each word&#8217;s semantic vector and 200 other randomly
