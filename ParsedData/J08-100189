ic information (expressed by S, O, X, and &#8211;) for coherence-based models.
    The combination of both knowledge sources (Syntax+Salience) yields models with consistently good performance for all our tasks.
    The benefits of full coreference resolution are less uniform.
    This is partly due to mismatches between training and testing conditions.
    The system we employ (Ng and Cardie 2002) was trained on human-authored newspaper texts.
    The corpora we used in our sentence ordering and readability assessment experiments are somewhat similar (i.e., human-authored narratives), whereas our summary coherence rating experiment employed machine generated texts.
    It is therefore not surprising that coreference resolution delivers performance gains on the first two tasks but not on the latter (see Table 5 in Section 4 and Table 10 in Section 6.3).
    Our results further show that in lieu of an automatic coreference resolution system, entity classes can be approximated simply by string matching.
