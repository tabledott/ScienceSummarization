od els is the WordSim-353 dataset (Finkelstein et al, 2001), which consists of 353 pairs of nouns.
			Each pair is presented without context and associated with13 to 16 human judgments on similarity and re latedness on a scale from 0 to 10.
			For example, (cup,drink) received an average score of 7.25, while (cup,substance) received an average score of 1.92.
			Table 3 shows our results compared to previous methods, including C&amp;W?s language model and the hierarchical log-bilinear (HLBL) model (Mnih andHinton, 2008), which is a probabilistic, linear neu ral model.
			We downloaded these embeddings from Turian et al (2010).
			These embeddings were trained on the smaller corpus RCV1 that contains one yearof Reuters English newswire, and show similar cor relations on the dataset.
			We report the result of Model Corpus ??
