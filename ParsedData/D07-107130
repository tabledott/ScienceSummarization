based on precision and recall in recovering attribute-value pairs.
			(For example, the sentence flights to Boston would have a single attribute-valueentry, namely destination = Boston.)
			It is sim ple for us to map from lambda-calculus expressions to attribute-value entries of this form; for example, the expression to(x,Boston) would be mapped to destination = Boston.
			He and Young (2006) gave us their data and annotations, so we can directly compare results on the partial-match criterion.
			Wealso report accuracy for exact matches of lambda calculus expressions, which is a stricter criterion.
			In addition, we report results for the method on the Geo880 domain.
			This allows us to compare directly to the previous work of Zettlemoyer and Collins (2005), using the same split of the data intotraining and test sets of sizes 600 and 280 respec tively.
			We use cross-validation of the training set, asopposed to a separate development set, for optimiza tion of parameters.
