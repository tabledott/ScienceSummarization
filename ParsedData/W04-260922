 there is only one semantic relation per line.
    This can be achieved by specializing the feature pair&#8217;s semantic classes with their immediate WordNet hyponyms.
    The iterative process stops when new training data does not bring any improvements (see Table 6).
    The f-measure results obtained so far are summarized in Table 7.
    Overall, these results are very encouraging given the complexity of the problem.
  
  
    An important way of improving the performance of a system is to do a detailed error analysis of the results.
    We have analyzed the sources of errors in each case and found out that most of them are due to (in decreasing order of importance): (1) errors in automatic sense disambiguation, (2) missing combinations of features that occur in testing but not in the training data, (3) levels of specialization are too high, (4) errors caused by metonymy, (6) errors in the modifier-head order, and others.
    These errors could be substantially decreased with more research effort.
