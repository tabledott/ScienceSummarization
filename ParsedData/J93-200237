    Until a useful definition that trained humans can agree on is developed, it would seem fruitless to attempt machine learning experiments in this domain.
    Although the results of this study are generally encouraging, they also point to some limitations of the statistical model presented here.
    First, it does not take into account variation in the percentage of verbs that can appear in each frame.
    For example, most verbs can take an NP argument, while very few can take an NP followed by a tensed clause.
    This results in too few verbs being classified as +NP and too many being classified as +NPcl, as shown in Table 8.
