 (i.e. h2) is not a helpful feature for Lynx.
    The reason is that we use only a single non-terminal symbol instead of assigning phrasal categories to the target string.
    In addition, we allow the target string consists of only non-terminals, making translation decisions not always based on lexical evidence.
    It is interesting to use bilingual phrases to strengthen the TAT-based model.
    As we mentioned before, some useful non-syntactic phrase pairs can never be obtained in form of TAT because we restrict that there must be a corresponding parse tree for the source phrase.
    Moreover, it takes more time to obtain TATs than bilingual phrases on the same training data because parsing is usually very time-consuming.
    Given an input subtree T (Fj&#65533; j&#65533; ), if Fj&#65533; j&#65533; is a string of terminals, we find all bilingual phrases that the source phrase is equal to Fj&#65533; j&#65533; .
    Then we build a TAT for each bilingual phrase (fJ, 1 , A): the tree of the TAT is T (Fj&#6553
