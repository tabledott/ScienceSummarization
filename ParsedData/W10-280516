extensively in the literature before, adjacent A-N pairs.
    The model built by PLSR performed better than both a simple additive model and a multiplicative model in the first proposed evaluation method.
    Our second evaluation test (using comparison to a gold standard) gave mixed results: the best performance was obtained by the simple additive model, with PLSR coming in second place.
    This is work in progress, but the results look very promising.
    Future developments will certainly focus on the creation of better evaluation methods, as well as on extending the experiments to other techniques (e.g. convolution product as discussed by Widdows, 2008 and Giesbrecht, 2009).
    Another important issue that we still have not touched is the role played by lexical association (collocations) in the prediction models.
    We would like to make sure that we are not modelling the compositionality of noncompositional examples.
    A last word on the view of semantic compositionality suggested by our approach.
