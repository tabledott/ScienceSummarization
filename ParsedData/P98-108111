 below) certainly still leaves room for improvement, although tagger E surprises us with an accuracy well above any results reported so far and makes us less confident about the gain to be accomplished with combination.
    However, that there is room for improvement is not enough.
    As explained above, for combination to lead to improvement, the component taggers must differ in the errors that they make.
    That this is indeed the case can be seen in Table 1.
    It shows that for 99.22% of Tune, at least one tagger selects the correct tag.
    However, it is unlikely that we will be able to identify this terns between the brackets give the distribution of correct/incorrect tags over the systems. tag in each case.
    We should rather aim for optimal selection in those cases where the correct tag is not outvoted, which would ideally lead to correct tagging of 98.21% of the words (in Tune).
  
  
    There are many ways in which the results of the component taggers can be combined, selecting a single tag f
