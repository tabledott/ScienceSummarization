    With this framework in place, one need only fill in the details to create an SVM for a new structured output space: Using the Structured SVM API, we have created two SVM word aligners: a baseline that uses weighted maximum matching for its argmax operator, and a dependency-augmented ITG that will satisfy our requirements for an aligner with a soft cohesion constraint.
    Our x becomes a bilingual sentence-pair, while our y becomes an alignment, represented by a set of links.
    Given a bipartite graph with edge values, the weighted maximum matching algorithm (West, 2001) will find the matching with maximum summed edge values.
    To create a matching alignment solution, we reproduce the approach of (Taskar et al., 2005) within the framework described in Section 4.1: where co is an omission penalty and c, is a commission penalty.
