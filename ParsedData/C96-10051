ffers the prospect hat a disambiguation system might be able to receive as input unrestricted text and tag each word with the most likely sense with fairly reasonable accuracy and efficiency.
  The most extended approach use the context of the word to be disambiguatcd together with inlormation about each of its word senses to solve this problem.
  Interesting experiments have been performed in recent years using preexisting lexical knowledge resources: [Cowie el al.

  93] with LDOCE, [Yarowsky 92] with Rogets International Thesaurus, and [Sussna 93], [Voorhees 9311, [Richardson etal.
  94], [Resnik 95] with WordNet.
  Although each of these techniques looks promising for disambiguation, either they have been only applied to a small number of words, a few sentences or not in a public domain corpus.
  For this reason we have tried to disambiguate all the nouns from real *Eneko Agirre was supported by a grant from the Basque Goverment.
