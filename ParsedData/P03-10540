    Figure 3: Size and devset performance of the cumulatively annotated models, starting with the markovized baseline.
    The two columns show the change in the baseline for each annotation introduced, both cumulatively and for each single annotation applied to the baseline in isolation.
    history models similar in intent to those described in Ron et al. (1994).
    For variable horizontal histories, we did not split intermediate states below 10 occurrences of a symbol.
    For example, if the symbol too rare, we would colit to For vertical histories, we used a cutoff which included both frequency and mutual information between the history and the expansions (this was not appropriate for the horizontal because unreliable at such low counts).
    Figure 2 shows parsing accuracies as well as the number of symbols in each markovization.
    These symbol counts include all the intermediate states which represent partially completed constituents.
    The general trend is tha
