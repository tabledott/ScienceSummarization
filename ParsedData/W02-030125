 see this, we degrade the ME system so that it predicts the classes deterministically without using the Viterbi algorithm.
    We found that this system only marks 51.54 in F-score.
    Thus, it can be said that a dynamic decision is important for this named entity task.
    However, although a method to convert the outputs of a binary SVM to probabilistic values is proposed (Platt, 1999), the way to obtain meaningful probabilistic values needed in Viterbitype algorithms from the outputs of a multi-class SVM is unknown.
    Solving this problem is certainly a part of the future work.
    The second possible reason is that the SVM system in this paper does not use any cut-off or feature truncation method to remove data noise, while the ME system uses a simple feature cut-off method.12 We observed that the ME system without the cut-off only marks 49.11 in 11C, s, r, and d 12Features that occur less than 10 times are removed.
    F-score.
    Thus, such a noise reduction method is also important.
    However, th
