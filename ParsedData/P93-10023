t alignment.
    Large corpora are assumed to be already subdivided into smaller chunks.
    While these algorithms have achieved remarkably good performance, there is definite room for improvement.
    These algorithms are not robust with respect to non-literal translations and small deletions; they can easily misalign small passages because they ignore word identities.
    For example, the type of passage depicted in Figure 1 occurs in the Hansard corpus.
    With length-based alignment algorithms, these passages may well be misaligned by an even number of sentences if one of the corpora contains a deletion.
    In addition, with lengthbased algorithms it is difficult to automatically recover from large deletions.
    In Brown, anchors are used to deal with this issue, but the selection of anchors requires manual inspection of the corpus to be aligned.
    Gale does not discuss this issue.
    Alignment algorithms that use lexical information offer a potential for higher accuracy.
