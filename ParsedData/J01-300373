hat the experts often disagree on this difficult task suggests that a combination of expert judgments might increase the upper bound.
    We tried the simplest combination, by creating a new classification using a majority vote: each verb was assigned the label given by at least two experts.
    Only three cases did not have any majority label; in these cases we used the classification of the most accurate expert.
    This new classification does not improve the upper bound, reaching only 86.4% (K = .80) compared to the gold standard.
    The evaluation is also informative with respect to the performance of the program.
    On the one hand, we observe that if we take the best performance achieved by an expert in this task-86.5%&#8212;as the maximum achievable accuracy in classification, our algorithm then reduces the error rate over chance by approximately 68%, a very respectable result.
    In fact, the accuracy of 69.5% achieved by the program is only 1.5% less than one of the human experts in comparison to
