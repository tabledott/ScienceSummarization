ules with each rule value.
    Instead of grammar rule concatenation, we perform string concatenation.
    The derivation semiring then corresponds to nondeterministic transductions; the Viterbi semiring corresponds to a weighted or probabilistic transducer; and the Viterbi-n-best semiring could be used to get n-best lists from probabilistic transducers. where a derivation is a list of rules of the grammar.'
    Sets containing one rule, such as { (X &#8212;&gt; YZ)} for a CFG, constitute the primitive elements of the semiring.
    The additive operator U produces a union of derivations, and the multiplicative operator produces the concatenation, one derivation concatenated with the next.
    The concatenation operation 0 is defined on both derivations and sets of derivations; when applied to a set of derivations, it produces the set of pairwise concatenations.
    The additive identity is simply the empty set, 0: union with the empty set is an identity operation.
    The multiplicative identity is the set co
