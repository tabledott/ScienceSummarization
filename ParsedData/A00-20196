aera (1982).
    After the sentences have been preprocessed, ALEK counts sequences of adjacent part-ofspeech tags and function words (such as determiners, prepositions, and conjunctions).
    For example, the sequence a/AT full-time/I.
    1 jobINN contributes one occurrence each to the bigrams AT+JJ, JJ+NN, a+JJ, and to the part-of-speech tag trigram AT+JJ+NN.
    Each individual tag and function word also contributes to its own unigram count.
    These frequencies form the basis for the error detection measures.
    From the general corpus, ALEK computes a mutual information measure to determine which sequences of part-of-speech tags and function words are unusually rare and are, therefore, likely to be ungrammatical in English (e.g., singular determiner preceding plural noun, as in *a desks).
    Mutual information has often been used to detect combinations of words that occur more frequently than we would expect based on the assumption that the words are independent.
    Here we use this measure for the o
