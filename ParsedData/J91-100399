 This is quite evident when one examines, for example, the methods Tourangeau and Sternberg propose for relating features across domains in their theory.
    The second of Aristotle's basic principles is finding an analogy, yet Tourangeau and Sternberg (1982, p. 218) themselves say that, &amp;quot;in a sense, we are proposing that metaphors are analogies that include both tenor and vehicle and their different domains as terms.&amp;quot; And, of course, finding an analogy is central to the met* method on CS.
    Regarding the second difference, I would agree that finding a system of commonplaces is distinctive.
    However, the extensions to CS described in Section 6 move toward the direction of finding a system of commonplaces in that the deeper semantic vectors, and sentence representations shown in Figures 20 and 21 contain the information crucial to finding a system of commonplaces.
    Having identified the crucial analogy in (20), the deeper semantic vector contains the two pairs of matched relevant cell
