    Thus, our work is complementary to computational models developed on manually annotated data (Miltsakaki and Kukich 2000; Hasler 2004; Poesio et al. 2004).
    Automatic, albeit noisy, feature extraction allows us to perform a large scale evaluation of differently instantiated coherence models across genres and applications.
    Ranking approaches have enjoyed an increasing popularity at all stages in the generation pipeline, ranging from text planning to surface realization (Knight and Hatzivassiloglou 1995; Langkilde and Knight 1998; Mellish et al. 1998; Walker, Rambow, and Rogati 2001; Karamanis 2003; Kibble and Power 2004).
    In this framework, an underlying system produces a potentially large set of candidate outputs, with respect to various text generation rules encoded as hard constraints.
    Not all of the resulting alternatives will correspond to well-formed texts, and of those which may be judged acceptable, some will be preferable to others.
    The candidate generation phase is followed by
