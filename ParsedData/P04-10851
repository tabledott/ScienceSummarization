eetings and we hypothesize that the ability to automatically identify agreement and disagreement between participants will help us in the summarization task.
    For example, a summary might resemble minutes of meetings with major decisions reached (consensus) along with highlighted points of the pros and cons for each decision.
    In this paper, we present a method to automatically classify utterances as agreement, disagreement, or neither.
    Previous work in automatic identification of agreement/disagreement (Hillard et al., 2003) demonstrates that this is a feasible task when various textual, durational, and acoustic features are available.
    We build on their approach and show that we can get an improvement in accuracy when contextual information is taken into account.
    Our approach first identifies adjacency pairs using maximum entropy ranking based on a set of lexical, durational and structural features that look both forward and backward in the discourse.
    This allows us to acquire, and subs
