ce.
    This procedure is applied recursively until there are no nested verb phrases.
    An example is shown in Figure 8.
    Crossings can be calculated as before.
    Adverbs are a third common cause, as they typically follow the verb in French while preceding it in English.
    Figure 7 shows an example where the span of &#8220;simplement&#8221; overlaps with the span of the verb phrase beginning with &#8220;tells&#8221; (indicated by the solid lines).
    Unlike negation and modals, this case is far less regular.
    It arises from six different syntactic constructions and two of those constructions are implicated in other types of crossings as well.
    Flattening reduces the number of potential head crossings while increasing the number of potential modifier crossings.
    Therefore, we would expect to see a comparable change to the number of crossings measured, and this is exactly what we find, as shown in Tables 4 and 5.
    For example, for S P alignments, the average number of head crossings decrea
