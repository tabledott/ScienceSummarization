on System (ATIS) corpus(HGD90).8 In table 1, we compare results we obtained to results cited in (PS92) using the inside-outside algorithm on the same corpus.
    Accuracy is measured in terms of the percentage of noncrossing constituents in the test corpus, as described above.
    Our system was tested by using the training set to learn a set of transformations, and then applying these transformations to the test set and scoring the resulting output.
    In this experiment, 64 transformations were learned (compared with 4096 context-free rules and probabilities used in the inside-outside algorithm experiment).
    It is significant that we obtained comparable performance using a training corpus only 21% as large as that used to train the inside-outside algorithm.
    After applying all learned transformations to the test corpus, 60% of the sentences had no crossing constituents, 74% had fewer than two crossing constituents, and 85% had fewer than three.
    The mean sentence length of the test corpus was 11.3
