possibilities, a partial path to a node j corresponds to the subset C of all cities on that path together with the last visited Illustration of the algorithm by Held and Karp for a traveling salesman problem with J = 5 cities.
    Not all permutations of cities have to be evaluated explicitly.
    For a given subset of cities the order in which the cities have been visited can be ignored. city j.
    Of all the different paths merging into the node j, only the partial path with the smallest cost has to be retained for further computation.
    In this section, the Held and Karp algorithm is applied to statistical MT.
    Using the concept of inverted alignments as introduced in Section 3.1, we explicitly take care of the coverage constraint by introducing a coverage set C of source sentence positions that have already been processed.
    Here, the correspondence is according to the fact that each source sentence position has to be covered exactly once, fulfilling the coverage constraint.
    The cities of the
