 the original space.
    Tucker decomposition applied to the mode-3 tuple tensor could capture patterns of higher order co-occurrence for each of the modes.
    For example, it might capture at the same time similarities between links such as use and hold and w2 elements such as gun and knife.
    SVD applied after construction of the W1xLW2 matrix, on the other hand, would miss the composite nature of columns such as (use, gun), (use, knife) and (hold, gun).
    Another attractive feature of Tucker decomposition is that it could be applied once to smooth the source tensor, whereas with SVD each matricization must be smoothed separately.
    However, Tucker decomposition and SVD are computationally intensive procedures, and, at least with our current computational resources, we are not able to decompose even the smallest DM tensor (similarly, we cannot apply SVD to a full matricization).
    Given the continuous growth in computational power and the fact that efficient tensor decomposition is a very active ar
