e, accounting for its apparent violations and providing a solution to the interpretation of multi-pronominal utterances.
    Two significant implications of the proposed constraint have been discussed.
    First, the SUBJECT constraint provides an alternative account of anaphora interpretation that appears to be due to structural parallelism.
    This reconciliation of centering/focusing and parallelism is a major advantage of this constraint.
    Second, the speaker identification constraint found in Japanese indicates a close association between centering and the speaker's viewpoint.
    In particular, it sheds light on what underlies the effect of perception reports on pronoun resolution.
    These results, by drawing on facts in two very different languages, demonstrate the cross-linguistic applicability of the centering framework in general.
    The present property-sharing constraint highlights a grammatical aspect that contributes to local discourse coherence.
    It will be integrated into the default
