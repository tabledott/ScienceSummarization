 order.
    Figure 2 presents a grid of horizontal and vertical markovizations of the grammar.
    The raw treebank grammar corresponds to v = 1, h = oc (the upper right corner), while the parent annotation in (Johnson, 1998) corresponds to v = 2, h = oc, and the second-order model in Collins (1999), is broadly a smoothed version of v = 2, h = 2.
    In addition to exact nth-order models, we tried variablenotated models, starting with the markovized baseline.
    The right two columns show the change in F1 from the baseline for each annotation introduced, both cumulatively and for each single annotation applied to the baseline in isolation.
    history models similar in intent to those described in Ron et al. (1994).
    For variable horizontal histories, we did not split intermediate states below 10 occurrences of a symbol.
    For example, if the symbol (VP: [VBZ]... PP PP) were too rare, we would collapse it to (VP: [VBZ]... PP).
    For vertical histories, we used a cutoff which included both frequency an
