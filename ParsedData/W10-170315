    We used the results of the manual evaluation to analyze the translation quality of the different systems that were submitted to the workshop.
    In our analysis, we aimed to address the following questions: Table 5 shows the best individual systems.
    We define the best systems as those which had no other system that was statistically significantly better than them under the Sign Test at p &lt; 0.1.
    Multiple systems are listed as the winners for many language pairs because it was not possible to draw a statistically significant difference between the systems.
    There is no individual system clearly outperforming all other systems across the different language pairs.
    With the exception of FrenchEnglish and English-French one can observe that top-performing constrained systems did as well as the unconstrained system ONLINEB.
    Table 6 shows the best combination systems.
    For all language directions, except SpanishEnglish, one can see that the system combinat
