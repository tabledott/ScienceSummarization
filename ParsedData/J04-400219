mber of extracted phrases and especially increases the percentage of wrong phrases.
    Therefore, we consider only consecutive phrases.
    In the following, we add generalization capability to the bilingual phrase lexicon by replacing words with word classes and also by storing the alignment information for each phrase pair.
    These generalized and alignment-annotated phrase pairs are called alignment templates.
    Formally, an alignment template z is a triple (FJy1 , EI&#65533;1 , &#732;A) Algorithm phrase-extract for extracting phrases from a word-aligned sentence pair.
    Here quasi-consecutive(TP) is a predicate that tests whether the set of words TP is consecutive, with the possible exception of words that are not aligned. that describes the alignment A&#732; between a source class sequence FJy1 and a target class sequence EI&#65533;1 .
    If each word corresponds to one class, an alignment template corresponds to a bilingual phrase together with an alignment within this phrase.
