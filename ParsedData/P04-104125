to our automatic annotation algorithm and evaluate against the DCU 105.
			The results are given in Table 10.
			Our method of resolv ing LDDs at f-structure level results in a preds-only f-score of 80.97%.
			Using (Johnson, 2002)?s method of adding empty nodes to the parse-trees results in an f-score of 79.75%.(Hockenmaier, 2003) provides CCG-based models of LDDs.
			Some of these involve extensive clean up of the underlying Penn-II treebank resource prior to grammar extraction.
			In contrast, in our approach we leave the treebank as is and only add (but never correct) annotations.
			Earlier HPSG work (Tateisi et al, 1998) is based on independently constructedhand-crafted XTAG resources.
			In contrast, we acquire our resources from treebanks and achieve sub stantially wider coverage.
			Our approach provides wide-coverage, robust, and ? with the addition of LDD resolution ? ?deep?or ?full?, PCFG-based LFG approximations.
			Crucially, we do not claim to provide fully adequate sta tistical models.
