hat significant improvements in transliteration performance result from this alternate method of data selection.
    We reran the CLIR experiments on the TDT-2 corpus using the somewhat improved entity transliterator described above, with the same query and document collection specifications as the experiments reported in Table 2.
    The results of this second experiment is reported in Table 4, where the performance of the Big MT transliterator is reproduced for comparison. and without name transliteration Note that the gain in CLIR performance is again only somewhat significant, with the improvement in mAP from 0.501 to 0.517 being significant only at a -value of 0.080.
  
  
    We have presented a name transliteration procedure based on statistical machine translation techniques and have investigated its use in a cross lingual spoken document retrieval task.
    We have found small gains in the extrinsic evaluation of our procedure: mAP improvement from 0.501 to 0.517.
