 by the hypernyms of a concept, rather than just one, to estimate the probability of the concept.
    An estimate would be obtained for each hypernym, and the estimates combined in a linear interpolation.
    An approach similar to this is taken by Bikel (2000), in the context of statistical parsing.
    There is still room for investigation of the hidden-data problem when data are used that have not been sense disambiguated.
    In this article, a very simple approach is taken, which is to split the count for a noun evenly among the noun&#8217;s senses.
    Abney and Light (1999) have tried a more motivated approach, using the expectation maximization algorithm, but with little success.
    The approach described in Clark and Weir (1999) is shown in Clark (2001) to have some impact on the pseudo-disambiguation task, but only with certain values of the &#945; parameter, and ultimately does not improve on the best performance.
    Finally, an issue that has not been much addressed in the literature (except by
