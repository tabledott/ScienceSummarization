  domain-independent: he core algorithm should work in any domain, once an appropriate knowl- edge base and user model has been set up.
  A version of the algorithm has been implemented within the IDAS natural-language neration system [RML92], and it is performing satisfactorily.
  The algorithm presented in this paper only gener- ates definite noun phrases that identify an object that is in the current focus of attention.
  Algorithms and models that can be used to generate pronominal and one-anaphoric referring expressions have been presented elsewhere, .g., [Sid81,GJW83,Da189].
  We have recently begun to look at the problem of gen- erating referring expressions for objects that are not in the current focus of attention; this is discussed in the section on Future Work.
