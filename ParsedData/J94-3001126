 the lexical string must appear in the surface string after every c:c pair.
    If we use either the Dom (T u {E : ED or 0* expressions in defining the coercion relation for this rule, the effect is not what we intend.
    The resulting relation does not allow strings in which a E: c follows c :c, because c is included in the restrictive domain expression.
    But c:E follows and precedes every symbol pair, of course, so the result is a relation that simply prohibits all occurrences of c:c. If, however, we revert to using the domain expression without the { cc} union, we fall back into the difficulty we saw with two-context epenthesis rules: the resulting relation properly ensures that nothing other than b can be inserted after c:c, but it leaves open the possibility of c:c followed by no insertion at all.
    A third formulation is necessary to model the intended interpretation of onecontext epenthesis rules.
    This is given by the relation 7r*AT-7r* if only the left-context is specified, or 7r*T-p7r* if o
