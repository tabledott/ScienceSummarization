refore helps to resolve the morphological one, and vice versa.
  
  
    Morphological analyzers for Hebrew that analyze a surface form in isolation have been proposed by Segal (2000), Yona and Wintner (2005), and recently by the knowledge center for processing Hebrew (Itai et al., 2006).
    Such analyzers propose multiple segmentation possibilities and their corresponding analyses for a token in isolation but have no means to determine the most likely ones.
    Morphological disambiguators that consider a token in context (an utterance) and propose the most likely morphological analysis of an utterance (including segmentation) were presented by Bar-Haim et al. (2005), Adler and Elhadad (2006), Shacham and Wintner (2007), and achieved good results (the best segmentation result so far is around 98%).
    The development of the very first Hebrew Treebank (Sima&#8217;an et al., 2001) called for the exploration of general statistical parsing methods, but the application was at first limited.
