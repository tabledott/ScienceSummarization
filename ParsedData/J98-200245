 otherwise to nouni.
    For LA, we estimated P(prep I verb) and P(prep I nouni) from the training data of each data set and compared them for disambiguation.
    We then evaluated the results achieved by the three methods in terms of accuracy and coverage.
    Here, coverage refers to the proportion as a percentage, of the test quadruples on which the disambiguation method could make a decision, and accuracy refers to the proportion of correct decisions among them.
    In Figure 10, we plot the accuracy-coverage curves for the three methods.
    In plotting these curves, the attachment site is determined by simply seeing if the difference between the appropriate measures for the two alternatives, be it probabilities or selectional association values, exceeds a threshold.
    For each method, the threshold was set successively to 0, 0.01, 0.02, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, and 0.75.
    When the difference between the two measures is less than a threshold, we rule that no decision can be made.
    These curves were o
