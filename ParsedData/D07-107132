sses over the training set, and was set to be 4.
			Each lexical entry in the initial lexicon?0 has an associated feature which counts the num ber of times this entry is seen in a parse.
			The initial parameter value in w for all features of this form was chosen to be some value ?.
			Each of the newCCG rules?the application, composition, crossedcomposition, and type-raising rules described in sec tion 3?has an associated parameter.
			We set al of these parameters to the same initial value ?.
			Finally, when new lexical entries are added to ?
			(in step 2 of the algorithm), their initial weight is set to some value ?.
			In practice, optimization on developmentdata led to a positive value for ?, and negative val ues for ? and ?.
			6.3 Results.
			Table 1 shows accuracy for the method by the exact match criterion on the ATIS test set.
			The two passstrategy actually hurts F-measure in this case, al though it does improve recall of the method.Table 2 shows results under the partial-match cri terion.
