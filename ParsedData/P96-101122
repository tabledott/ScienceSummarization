    S provides another rule template, used in a restricted CCG.
    The tree NF(a) may not be a the analysis of parasitic gaps (Steedman, 1987; Szlegal parse under the restricted grammar.

    It can be shown that when the restriction (18) is used together with (7), the system again finds exactly one 84 'For the proof to work, the rules S and T must be available in the restricted grammar, given that R and Q are.
    This is usually true: since (7) favors standard constituents and prefers application to composition, most grammars will not block the NF derivation while allowing a non-NF one.
