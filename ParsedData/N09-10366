ant to see the book&#8221; (with its correct segmentation indicated) is as follows: y&#9651;uNw&#9651;a&#9651;n&#9651;tNt&#9651;uNs &#9651;iND&#9651;6Nb&#9651;U&#9651;k We can represent any possible segmentation of any possible sentence as a tree generated by the following unigram grammar.
    The nonterminal Phoneme expands to each possible phoneme; the underlining, which identifies &#8220;adapted nonterminals&#8221;, will be explained below.
    In this paper &#8220;+&#8221; abbreviates right-recursion through a dummy nonterminal, i.e., the unigram grammar actually is: A PCFG with these productions can represent all possible segmentations of any Sentence into a sequence of Words.
    But because it assumes that the probability of a word is determined purely by multiplying together the probability of its individual phonemes, it has no way to encode the fact that certain strings of phonemes (the words of the language) have much higher probabilities than other strings containing the same phonemes.
