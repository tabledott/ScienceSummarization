ized features does not perform much better than the baseline model, and further discovery or refinement of word-based features is difficult given the inconsistencies in the training data.
    A model trained and tested on data from a single annotator performs at .5% higher accuracy than the baseline model and should produce more consistent input for applications that require tagged text.
