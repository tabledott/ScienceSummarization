 7 of channel are both translated as &#8220;&#39057;&#36947;&#8221; in Chinese, so these two senses are lumped together.
    (ii) From the word alignment output of GIZA++, we select those occurrences of the noun channel which have been aligned to one of the Chinese translations chosen (as listed in Table 1).
    These occurrences of the noun channel in the English side of the parallel texts are considered to have been disambiguated and &#8220;sense-tagged&#8221; by the appropriate Chinese translations.
    Each such occurrence of channel together with the 3-sentence context in English surrounding channel then forms a training example for a supervised WSD program in the next step.
    The average time taken to perform manual selection of target translations for one SENSEVAL-2 English noun is less than 15 minutes.
    This is a relatively short time, especially when compared to the effort that we would otherwise need to spend to perform manual sense-tagging of training examples.
    This step could also be pote
