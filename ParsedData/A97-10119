@SUBJ) IF (IC AUXMOD HEAD); To get the full benefit of the parser, it is also useful to name the valency slot in the rule.
    This has two effects: (1) the valency slot is unique, i.e. no more than one subject is linked to a finite verb', and (2) we can explicitly state in rules which kind of valency slots we expect to be filled.
    The rule thus is of the form:
  
  
    IF (IC AUXMOD HEAD = subject); The rule above works well in an unambiguous context but there is still need to specify more tolerant rules for ambiguous contexts.
    The rule differs from the previous rule in that it leaves the other readings of the noun intact and only adds a (possible) subject dependency, while both the previous rules disambiguated the noun reading also.
    But especially in the rule above, the contextual test is far from being sufficient to select the subject reading reliably.
    Instead, it leaves open a possibility to attach a dependency from another syntactic function, i.e. the dependency relations remain ambiguous
