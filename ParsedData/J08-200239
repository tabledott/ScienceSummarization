    Subsequently, we will talk about maximizing the sum of the logs of local probabilities rather than the product of local probabilities, which is equivalent.
    The dynamic program works from the leaves of the tree up and finds a best assignment for each subtree, using already computed assignments for its children.
    Suppose we want the most likely consistent assignment for subtree t with child trees t1, ... , tk each storing the most likely consistent assignment of its nodes, as well as the log-probability of the ALLNONE assignment: the assignment of NONE to all nodes in the tree.
    The most likely assignment for t is the one that corresponds to the maximum of: Performance of local model on ALL arguments when enforcing the non-overlapping constraint or not.
    The log-probability of the ALLNONE assignment for a tree t is the log-probability of assigning the root node of t to NONE plus the sum of the log-probabilities of the ALLNONE assignments of the child subtrees of t. Propagating
