ity because it emphasizes the contrast with relational similarity.
    The term semantic relatedness may lead to confusion when the term relational similarity is also under discussion.
    Resnik (1995) describes semantic similarity as follows: Semantic similarity represents a special case of semantic relatedness: for example, cars and gasoline would seem to be more closely related than, say, cars and bicycles, but the latter pair are certainly more similar.
    Rada et al. (1989) suggest that the assessment of similarity in semantic networks can in fact be thought of as involving just taxonomic (IS-A) links, to the exclusion of other link types; that view will also be taken here, although admittedly it excludes some potentially useful information.
    Thus semantic similarity is a specific type of attributional similarity.
    The term semantic similarity is misleading, because it refers to a type of attributional similarity, yet relational similarity is not any less semantic than attributional similarity.
