cture, analyses at the informational and the intentional levels must coexist.
    To illustrate the problem, consider the following example.
    An Example Example 1 A plausible RST analysis of (1) is that there is an EVIDENCE relation between utterance (b), the nucleus of the relation, and utterance (a), the satellite.
    This analysis is licensed by the definition of this relation (Mann and Thompson 1987, p. 10): Relation name: EVIDENCE Constraints on Nucleus: H might not believe Nucleus to a degree satisfactory to S. Constraints on Satellite: H believes Satellite or will find it credible.
    Constraints on Nucleus + Satellite combination: H's comprehending Satellite increases H's belief of Nucleus.
    Effect: H's belief of Nucleus is increased.
    However, an equally plausible analysis of this discourse is that utterance (b) is the nucleus of a VOLITIONAL CAUSE relation, as licensed by the definition (Mann and Thompson 1987, p. 58): Constraints on Nucleus: presents a volitional action or else a situati
