e level, including all frame element judgments and boundaries for one predicate, varied from .66 to .82 depending on the predicate.
    The kappa statistic (Siegel and Castellan 1988) varied from .67 to .82.
    Because of the large number of possible categories when boundary judgments are considered, kappa is nearly identical to the interannotator agreement.
    The system described in this article (which gets .65/.61 precision/recall on individual frame elements; see Table 15) correctly identifies all frame elements in 38% of test sentences.
    Although this .38 is not directly comparable to the .66&#8211;.82 interannotator agreements, it&#8217;s clear that the performance of our system still falls significantly short of human performance on the task.
    The British National Corpus was chosen as the basis of the FrameNet project despite differences between British and American usage because, at 100 million words, it provides the largest corpus of English with a balanced mixture of text genres.
