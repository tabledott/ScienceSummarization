    Kromann (2001) argued for a dependency formalism called Discontinuous Grammar and annotated a large set of Danish sentences using this formalism to create the Danish Dependency Treebank (Kromann, 2003).
    The formalism allows for a word to have multiple parents.
    Examples include verb coordination in which the subject or object is an argument of several verbs, and relative clauses in which words must satisfy dependencies both inside and outside the clause.
    An example is shown in Figure 5 for the sentence He looks for and sees elephants.
    Here, the pronoun He is the subject for both verbs in the sentence, and the noun elephants the corresponding object.
    In the Danish Dependency Treebank, roughly 5% of words have more than one parent, which breaks the single parent (or tree) constraint we have previously required on dependency structures.
    Kromann also allows for cyclic dependencies, though we deal only with acyclic dependency graphs here.
    Though less common than trees, depen
