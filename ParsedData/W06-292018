    As Alpino does not provide an internal structure for multiwords, we had to treat multiwords as one token.
    However, we then lack a proper PoS for the multiword.
    After much discussion, we decided to assign each multiword the CPOSTAG &#8220;MWU&#8221; (multiword unit) and a POSTAG which is the concatenation of the PoS of all the components as predicted by MBT (separated by an underscore).
    Likewise, the FEATS are a concatenation of the morphological features of all components.
    This approach resulted in many different POSTAG values for the training set and even in unseen values in the test set.
    It remains to be tested whether our approach resulted in data sets better suited for parsing than the original.
