  When we derive a sentence using an LTAG, we combine elementary trees flom the grmnmar using adjunction and substitution.
  For extort- pie, to derive the sentence There was no cost estimate for the second phase from the gram- mar in Figure 1, we substitute the tree tbr there into the tree tbr estimate.
  We then adjoin in the trees tbr the auxiliary was, the determiner no, and the modit)ing noun cost.
  Note that these adjunctions occur at different nodes: at VP, NP~ and N, respectively.
  We then adjoin in the preposition, into which we substitute ph, ase, into which we adjoin the and second.
  Note that all adjunctions are by gamma trees, and all sub- stitution by alpha trees.
  If we want to represent this derivation graphi- cally, we can do so in a derivation tree, which we obtain as follows: whelmver we adjoin or sub- stitute a tree t~ into a tree t2, we add a new daughter labeled t~ to the node labeled tg.
  As explained above, the name of each tree used is the lexeme along with the s
