uch simple sentence was parsed using Minipar (Lin, 1998).
    From the parses we extracted all dependency paths between nouns that contain only words present in the TEXTRUNNER relation string.
    These dependency paths were then matched against each pair in the DIRT database, and all pairs of associated relations were collected producing about 26,000 inference rules.
    Following Pantel et al. (2007) we randomly sampled 100 inference rules.
    We then automatically filtered out any rules which contained a negation, or for which the antecedent and consequent contained a pair of antonyms found in WordNet (this left us with 85 rules).
    For each rule we collected 10 random instances of the antecedent, and generated the consequent.
    We randomly sampled 300 of these inferences to hand-label.
  
  
    In figure 5 we compare the precision and recall of LDA-SP against the top two performing systems described by Pantel et al. (ISP.IIM-V and ISP.JIM, both using the CBC clusters (Pantel, 2003)).
