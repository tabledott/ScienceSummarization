   Second order context vectors are designed to identify such relationships, in that exact matching is not required, but rather words that occur in similar contexts will have similar vectors.
    The comparatively good performance of PB1 and PB3 in the case of the Line, Hard and Serve data (see Table 1) suggests that first order context vectors when clustered with UPGMA perform relatively well on larger samples of data.
    Moreover, among the SC experiments on this data, the performance of SC2 is relatively high.
    This further suggests that UPGMA performs much better than Repeated Bisections with larger amounts of training data.
    These observations correspond with the hypothesis drawn from the SENSEVAL-2 results.
    That is, a large amount of training data will lead to a larger feature space and hence there is a greater chance of matching more features directly in the context of the test instances.
    Hence, the first order context vectors that rely on the immediate context of the target word succeed
