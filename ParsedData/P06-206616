ency graphs: projective C planar C well-nested C unrestricted The planarity constraint appears like a very natural one at first sight, as it expresses the intuition that &#8216;crossing edges are bad&#8217;, but still allows a limited form of non-projectivity.
    However, many authors use planarity in conjunction with a special representation of the root node: either as an artificial node at the sentence boundary, as we mentioned in section 2, or as the target of an infinitely long perpendicular edge coming &#8216;from the outside&#8217;, as in earlier versions of Word Grammar (Hudson, 2003).
    In these situations, planarity reduces to projectivity, so nothing is gained.
    Even in cases where planarity is used without a special representation of the root node, it remains a peculiar concept.
    When we compare it with the notion of gaps, for example, we find that, in a planar dependency tree, every gap .i; j/ must contain the root node r, in the sense that i &lt; r &lt; j: if the gap would only contain n
