 the identification of a high-confidence positive entailment enabled it to be returned as the intensive process for most Q/A systems, we expect that TE information can be used to limit the number of passages considered during AP.
    As illustrated in Method 2 in Figure 1, lists of passages retrieved by a PR module can either be ranked (or filtered) using TE information.
    Once ranking is complete, answer extraction takes place only on the set of entailed passages that the system considers likely to contain a correct answer to the user&#8217;s question.
    Method 3.
    In previous work (Harabagiu et al., 2005b), we have described techniques that can be used to automatically generate well-formed natural language questions from the text of paragraphs retrieved by a PR module.
    In our current system, sets of automatically-generated questions (AGQ) are created using a stand-alone AutoQUAB generation module, which assembles question-answer pairs (known as QUABs) from the top-ranked passages returned in resp
