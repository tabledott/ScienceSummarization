 In cases where a turn consisted of several utterances, the control rules were only applied to the final utterance.
    We applied the control rules and found that control did not alternate from speaker to speaker on a turn by turn basis, but that there were long sequences of turns in which control remained with one speaker.
    This seemed to suggest that the dialogues were organised above the level of individual turns into phases where control was located with one speaker.
    The mean number of turns in each phase was 6.63.
  
  
    We then went on to analyse how control was exchanged between participants at the boundaries of these phases.
    We first examined the last utterance of each phase on the grounds that one mechanism for indicating the end of a phase would be for the speaker controlling the phase to give some cue that he (both participants in the dialogues were always male) no longer wished to control the discourse.
    There was a total of 56 shifts of control over the 4 dialogues and we identi
