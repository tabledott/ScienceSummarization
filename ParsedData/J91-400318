e the basic requirements for a theory of computational semantics.
    I will present a conservative approach to decomposition, where lexical items are minimally decomposed into structured forms (or templates) rather than sets of features.
    This will provide us with a generative framework for the composition of lexical meanings, thereby defining the well-formedness conditions for semantic expressions in a language.
    We can distinguish between two distinct approaches to the study of word meaning: primitive-based theories and relation-based theories.
    Those advocating primitives assume that word meaning can be exhaustively defined in terms of a fixed set of primitive elements (e.g.
    Wilks 1975a; Katz 1972; Lakoff 1971; Schank 1975).
    Inferences are made through the primitives into which a word is decomposed.
    In contrast to this view, a relation-based theory of word meaning claims that there is no need for decomposition into primitives if words (and their concepts) are associated through a netw
