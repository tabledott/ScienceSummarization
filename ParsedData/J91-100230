    For example, in chain 6, the intuitive chain {hand-in-hand, matching, whispering, laughing, warm} was not entirely computable.
    Only the italicized words were relatable.
    The words in chain 6 are cohesive by virtue of being general, but strong, &amp;quot;good&amp;quot; words related by their goodness, rather than by their specific meanings.
