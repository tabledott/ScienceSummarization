    In fact, such is the case, as is shown in Table 4.
    The majority, 31 (86.1%), of sentential nows forming part of larger intonational phrases received a H* or complex pitch accent, while all 36 discourse nows forming part of larger intonational phrases were deaccented or bore a L* accent.
    In fact, those discourse nows not distinguishable from sentential by being set apart as separate intonational phrases were generally so distinguishable with respect to pitch accent.
    Of the three discourse tokens whose pitch accent type was not identifiable, which were omitted from Table 3, two were set apart as separate intonational phrases and one was judged either to bear a L* pitch accent or to be deaccented.
    Thus, all three could be distinguished from sentential tokens in terms of accent type and phrasing.
    Furthermore, of the five deaccented sentential nows in Table 4, none was first-in-phrase, while only one of the deaccented discourse tokens was similarly noninitial.
    In fact, of the 1
