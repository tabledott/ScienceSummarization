es are possible.
    A separate mechanism is used to evaluate their plausibility.
    An agent S attempting to infer the plans of another agent A starts with an observed action of A and a (possibly empty) set of goals or expectations which S believes A may be trying to achieve.
    S attempts to construct a plan involving the action and preferably also including some of the expectations.
    Plan inference is a search through a space of partial plans each consisting of two parts.
    One part is constructed using the plan inference rules from the observed action (and called the alternative); the other is constructed using the plan construction rules from an expected goal (and called the expectation).
    The partial plans are manipulated by a set of tasks which decide what rules are to be applied, what &amp;quot;merges&amp;quot; between alternatives and expectations should be attempted, and when the process terminates.
    The partial plans and their associated tasks are rated by a set of heuristics, and the
