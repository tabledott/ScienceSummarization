    In this paper we discuss how large this influence is.
    Therefore we will compare seven different data representation formats for the baseNP recognition task.
    We are particularly interested in finding out whether with one of the representation formats the best reported results for this task can be improved.
    The second section of this paper presents the general setup of the experiments.
    The results ean be found in the third section.
    In the fourth section we will describe some related work.
  
  
    In this section we present and explain the data representation formats and the machine learning algorithm that we have used.
    In the final part we describe the feature representation used in our experiments.
    We have compared four complete and three partial data representation formats for the baseNP recognition task presented in (Ramshaw and Marcus, 1995).
    The four complete formats all use an I tag for words that are inside a baseNP and an 0 tag for words that are outside a baseN
