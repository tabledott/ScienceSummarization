  Since the parser makes decisions analyzing only a window of tokens of a limited size, it gets confused in creating attachments.
    I tried to add some global context features, to be able to distinguish these cases, in particular, a count of the number of punctuation marks seen so far, whether punctuation is present between the focus words.
    None of them helped improving precision and were not used in the submitted runs.
    Most current parsers for Czech do not perform well on Apos (apposition), Coord (coordination) and ExD (ellipses), but they are not very frequent.
    The largest number of errors occur on Obj (166), Adv (155), Sb (113), Atr (98).
    There is also often confusion among these: 33 times Obj instead of Adv, 32 Sb instead of Obj, 28 Atr instead of Adv.
    The high error rate of J (adjective) is expected, mainly due to coordination problems.
    The error of R (preposition) is also relatively high.
    Prepositions are problematic, but their error rate is higher than expected since they
