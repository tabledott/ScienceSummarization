    We define a PCFG-LA as a tuple , where a set of observable non-terminal symbols a set of terminal symbols a set of latent annotation symbols a set of observable CFG rules the probability of the occurrence of a complete symbol at a root node the probability of a rule We use for non-terminal symbols in and for latent annotation symbols in . denotes the set of complete non-terminal symbols, i.e., .
    Note that latent annotation symbols are not attached to terminal symbols.
    In the above definition, is a set of CFG rules of observable (i.e., not annotated) symbols.
    For simplicity of discussion, we assume that is a CNF grammar, but extending to the general case is straightforward. is the set of CFG rules of complete symbols, such as grinned or .
    More precisely, We assume that non-terminal nodes in a parse tree are indexed by integers , starting from the root node.
    A complete tree is denoted by , where is a vector of latent annotation symbols and is the latent annotation s
