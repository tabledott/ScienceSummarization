    Hence it is not possible for the parser to produce the gold standard for every sentence in Sections 02&#8211;21, for either the normal-form or the dependency model.
    These sentences are not used in the training process.
    For parsing the training data, we ensure that the correct category is a member of the set assigned to each word.
    (We do not do this when parsing the test data.)
    The average number of categories assigned to each word is determined by the &#946; parameter in the supertagger.
    A category is assigned to a word if the category&#8217;s probability is within &#946; of the highest probability category for that word.
    Hence the value of &#946; has a direct effect on the size of the packed charts: Smaller &#946; values lead to larger charts.
    For training purposes, the &#946; parameter determines how many incorrect derivations will be used for each sentence for the discriminative training algorithm.
    We have found that the &#946; parameter can have a l
