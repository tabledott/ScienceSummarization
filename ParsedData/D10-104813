s are discussed but not instantiated, e.g., a sports bar below: We now describe the coreference models implemented in the sieve.
    For clarity, we summarize them in Table 1 and show the cumulative performance as they are added to the sieve in Table 2.
    This model links two mentions only if they contain exactly the same extent text, including modifiers and determiners, e.g., the Shahab 3 ground-ground missile.
    As expected, this model is extremely precise, with a pairwise precision over 96%.
    This model links two mentions if any of the conditions below are satisfied: Appositive &#8211; the two nominal mentions are in an appositive construction, e.g., [Israel&#8217;s Deputy Defense Minister], [Ephraim Sneh] , said ... We use the same syntactic rules to detect appositions as Haghighi and Klein (2009).
    Predicate nominative &#8211; the two mentions (nominal or pronominal) are in a copulative subject-object relation, e.g., [The New York-based College Board] is [a nonprofit organization that administe
