e is being built at the next level up.
    For example, while analyzing (2), a parser which deterministically builds old-fashioned trees might just take &amp;quot;my aunt&amp;quot; to be the object of &amp;quot;drove&amp;quot;, attaching it as the object of the VP, only to discover (too late) that this phrase functions instead as genitive determiner of the full NP &amp;quot;my aunt from Peoria's car&amp;quot;.
    In fact, the existing grammar for Parsifal causes exactly this behavior, and for good reason: This parser constructs NPs only up to the head noun .before deciding on their role within the larger context: only after attaching an NP will Parsifal construct the post-modifiers of the NP and attach them, (This involves a mechanism called node reactivation; it is described in [Shipman &amp; Marcus 791.)
    One reason for this within the earlier framework is that, given a PP which immediately follows the head of an NP, it cannot be determined whether that PP should be attached to the preceding NP or to so
