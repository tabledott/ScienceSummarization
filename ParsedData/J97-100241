ences were not due to training.
    Agreement on the placement of map reference points was good; where the coders agreed that a boundary existed, they almost invariably placed the begin and end points of their segments within the same four centimeter segment of the route, and often much closer, as measured on the original A3 (296 x 420 mm) maps.
    In contrast, the closest points that did not refer to the same boundary were usually five centimeters apart, and often much further.
    The study was too small for formal results about transaction category.
    For 64 out of 78 boundaries marked by at least two coders, the category was agreed.
    4.5.2 Diagnostics.
    Because this study was relatively small, problems were diagnosed by looking at coding mismatches directly rather than by using statistical techniques.
    Coders disagreed on where to place boundaries with respect to introductory questions about a route segment (such as &amp;quot;Do you have the swamp?&amp;quot;, when the route giver intends to de
