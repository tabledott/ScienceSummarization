ransformed trees look as in figure 3.
    The transform has the benefit of dramatically reducing the number of left-child chains, without unduly disrupting the immediate dominance relationships that provide features for the model.
    The parse trees that are returned by the parser are then de-transformed to the original form of the grammar for evaluation2.
    Table 1 presents the number of left-child chains of length greater than 2 in sections 2-21 and 24 of the Penn Wall St. Journal Treebank, both with and without the flattened selective left-corner transformation (FSLC), for gold-standard part-of-speech (POS) tags and automatically tagged POS tags.
    When the FSLC has been applied and the set is restricted to those occurring more than once ZSee Johnson (1998) for a presentation of the transform/detransform paradigm in parsing.
