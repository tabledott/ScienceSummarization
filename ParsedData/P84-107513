p in mind that these methods should not be considered a part of the underlying formalism, but merely &amp;quot;syntactic sugar&amp;quot; to increase the system's utility and allow it to conform to a user's intentions.
  
  
    Because so much of the information in the PATR-II grammars under actual development tends to be encoded in the lexicon, most of our research has been devoted to methods for removing redundancy in the lexicon by allowing the users themselves to define primitive constructs and operations on lexical items.
    Primitive constructs, such as the transitive, dyadic, or equi-NP properties of a verb, can be defined by means of templates, that is, DAGs that encode some linguistically isolable portion of the DAG of a lexical item.
    These template DAGs can then be combined to build the lexical item out of the user-defined primitives.
    As a simple example, we could define (with the following syntax) the template Verb as Let Verb be and the template ThirdSing as Let ThirdSing be &lt;agr numbe
