g between classes that will have lots of types (i.e. open class clusters) and clusters that tend to have few types (corresponding to closed class words).
    It is possible that in some languages there might be more subtle category related frequency effects, that could benefit from more complex models of frequency.
  
  
    We used texts prepared for the MULTEXT-East project (Erjavec and Ide, 1998) which consists of data (George Orwell's novel 1984) in seven languages: the original English together with Romanian, Czech, Slovene, Bulgarian, Estonian, and Hungarian.
    These are summarised in Table 2.
    As can be seen they cover a wide range of language families; furthermore Bulgarian is written in Cyrillic, which slightly stretches the range.

    The tags used are extremely fine-grained, and incorporate a great deal of information about case, gender and so on &#8212; in Hungarian for example 400 tags are used with 86 tags used only on
