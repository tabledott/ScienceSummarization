A).
    The most important practical consequence of this result is that any algorithm for finding the maximum A* of W(A) can be used to find the maximum p. of H(p) for p E C. The log-likelihood Lp(p) of the empirical distribution p as predicted by a model p is defined by3 It is easy to check that the dual function lIi(A) of the previous section is, in fact, just the log-likelihood for the exponential model pA; that is With this interpretation, the result of the previous section can be rephrased as: The model p E C with maximum entropy is the model in the parametric family pA(y1x) that maximizes the likelihood of the training sample /3.
    This result provides an added justification for the maximum entropy principle: If the notion of selecting a model p* on the basis of maximum entropy isn't compelling enough, it so happens that this same p is also the model that can best account for the training sample, from among all models of the same parametric form (10).
