  Estimators For Stochastic Unification-Based Grammars
  
    Log-linear models provide a statistically sound framework for Stochastic &amp;quot;Unification-Based&amp;quot; Grammars (SUBGs) and stochastic versions of other kinds of grammars.
    We describe two computationally-tractable ways of estimating the parameters of such grammars from a training corpus of syntactic analyses, and apply these to estimate a stochastic version of Lexical
  
  
    Probabilistic methods have revolutionized computational linguistics.
    They can provide a systematic treatment of preferences in parsing.
    Given a suitable estimation procedure, stochastic models can be &amp;quot;tuned&amp;quot; to reflect the properties of a corpus.
    On the other hand, &amp;quot;Unification-Based&amp;quot; Grammars (UBGs) can express a variety of linguistically-important syntactic and semantic constraints.
    However, developing Stochastic &amp;quot;Unification-based&amp;quot; Grammars (SUBGs) has not proved as straightforward as might
