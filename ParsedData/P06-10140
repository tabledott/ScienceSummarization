  Meaningful Clustering Of Senses Helps Boost Word Sense Disambiguation Performance
  
    Fine-grained sense distinctions are one of the major obstacles to successful Word Sense Disambiguation.
    In this paper, we present a method for reducing the granularity of the WordNet sense inventory based on the mapping to a manually crafted dictionary encoding sense hierarchies, namely the Oxford Dictionary of English.
    We assess the quality of the mapping and the induced clustering, and evaluate the performance of coarse WSD systems in the Senseval-3 English all-words task.
  
  
    Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) is undoubtedly one of the hardest tasks in the field of Natural Language Processing.
    Even though some recent studies report benefits in the use of WSD in specific applications (e.g.
    Vickrey et al. (2005) and Stokoe (2005)), the present performance of the best ranking WSD systems does not provide a sufficient degree of accuracy to enable real-world, language-aware applications.
