   The extent to which each strategy would contribute to accuracy and speed of annotation remains to be determined.
  
  
    Current &amp;quot;coreference&amp;quot; annotation practice, as exemplified by MUC, has overextended itself, mixing elements of genuine coreference with elements of anaphora and predication in unclear and sometimes contradictory ways.
    As a result, the annotated corpus emerging from MUC is unlikely to be as useful for the computational linguistics research community as one might hope (Criterion 4, see Section 1), the more so because generalization to other domains is bound to make problems worse.
    In many domains, for example, other sources of intensionality than change over time occur prominently.
    An example is epistemic modality: van Deemter and Kibble On Coreferring The relation between Henry Higgins and the man you have talked to is analogous to that between Henry Higgins and sales director of Sudsy Soaps in (3), with possible worlds taking the place of points in time: th
