    Psychological studies (Bradley and Lang, 1999) found measurable associations between words and human emotions.
    Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown (1997) described an unsupervised learning method for obtaining positively and negatively oriented adjectives with accuracy over 90%, and demonstrated that this semantic orientation, or polarity, is a consistent lexical property with high inter-rater agreement.
    Turney (2002) showed that it is possible to use only a few of those semantically oriented words (namely, &#8220;excellent&#8221; and &#8220;poor&#8221;) to label other phrases co-occuring with them as positive or negative.
    He then used these phrases to automatically separate positive and negative movie and product reviews, with accuracy of 66&#8211;84%.
    Pang et al. (2002) adopted a more direct approach, using supervised machine learning with words and n-grams as features to predict orientation at the document level with up to 83% precision.
