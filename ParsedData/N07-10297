of basis vectors is inefficient, the direction of the vectors is gradually moved toward a larger positive change in the evaluation metric.
    To improve the chances of finding a global optimum, the algorithm is repeated with varying initial values.
    The modified Powell&#8217;s method has been previously used in optimizing the weights of a standard feature-based MT decoder in (Och, 2003) where a more efficient algorithm for log-linear models was proposed.
    However, this is specific to log-linear models and cannot be easily extended for more complicated functions.
  
  
    The first combination method is based on re-ranking a merged -best list.
    A confidence score from each system is assigned to each unique hypothesis in the merged list.
    The confidence scores for each hypothesis are used to produce a single score which, combined with a 5-gram language model score, determines a new ranking of the hypotheses.
    Generalized linear models (GLMs) have been applied for confidence estimation in speech
