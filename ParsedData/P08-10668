xample, like the red, a modifier of a noun.
    Only those two kinds of dependency structures are well-formed structures in our system.
    Furthermore, we operate over well-formed structures in a bottom-up style in decoding.
    However, the description given above does not provide a clear definition on how to combine those two types of structures.
    In the rest of this section, we will provide formal definitions of well-formed structures and combinatory operations over them, so that we can easily manipulate well-formed structures in decoding.
    Formal definitions also allow us to easily extend the framework to incorporate a dependency language model in decoding.
    Examples will be provided along with the formal definitions.
    Consider a sentence 5 = w1w2...wn.
    Let d1d2...dn represent the parent word IDs for each word.
    For example, d4 = 2 means that w4 depends 'We ignore the left hand side here because there is only one non-terminal X.
    Of course, this formalism can be extended to have mul
