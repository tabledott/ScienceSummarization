    In this experiment, we used French as the source language and English as the target language.
    Figure 3 presents the alignment error rate of word_align.
    It is compared with the error rate of word_align's input, i.e. the initial rough alignment which is produced by char_align.
    The errors are sampled at sentence boundaries, and are measured as the relative distance between the output of the alignment program and the &amp;quot;true&amp;quot; alignment, as defined by the human judges5.
    The histograms present errors in the range of -20-20, which covers about 95% of the data.6.
    It can be seen that word_align decreases the error rate significantly (notice the different scales of the vertical axes).
    In 55% of the cases, there is no error in word_align's output (distance of 0), in 73% the distance from the correct alignment is at most 1, and in 84% the distance is at most 3.
