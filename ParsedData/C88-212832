 systems utilize the same lexical information for both tasks.
  Kasper has used a system for parsing rammars in a unification- based formalism (SItIs Z-PATR system) to parse sentences with re- spect to the large ISI NIGEL grammar, which had been previously used for generation alone.
  Nonetheless, all of these systems rely on often radically different architectures for the two processes.
  Precedent for using a single ar- chitecture for both tasks is much more difficult to find.
  The germ of the idea can be found in the General Syntactic Processor (GSP) de- signed for the MIND system at Rand.
  Kaplan and K~y proposed use of the GSP for parsing with respect o augmented transition etworks and generation by traiisformational grammars [Kaplan, 1973].
  How- ever, detailed implementation was apparently never carried out.
  In any case, although the PrOposal involved using the same arehitecture~ different formalisms (and hence grammars) were presupposed for the two tasks, ttunning a definite-clanse grammar (DCG)
