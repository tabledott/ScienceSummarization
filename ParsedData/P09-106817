ng over the event slot counts.
    In addition, figure 5 shows six of the top 20 scoring narrative schemas learned by our system.
    We artificially required the clustering procedure to stop (and sometimes continue) at six events per schema.
    Six was chosen as the size to enable us to compare to FrameNet in the next section; the mean number of verbs in FrameNet frames is between five and six.
    A low Q was chosen to limit chain splitting.
    We built a new schema starting from each verb that occurs in more than 3000 and less than 50,000 documents in the NYT section.
    This amounted to approximately 1800 verbs from which we show the top 20.
    Not surprisingly, most of the top schemas concern business, politics, crime, or food.
  
  
    Most previous work on unsupervised semantic role labeling assumes that the set of possible automatically built from the verb &#8216;convict&#8217;.
    Each node shape is a chain in the schema. classes is very small (i.e, PropBank roles ARG0 and ARG1) and is known in
