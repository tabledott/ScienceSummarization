 lengths of the two sentences (in characters) and the variance of this difference.
    This probabilistic score is used in a dynamic programming framework to find the maximum likelihood alignment of sentences.
    It is remarkable that such a simple approach works as well as it does.
    An evaluation was performed based on a trilingual corpus of economic reports issued by the Union Bank of Switzerland (UBS) in English, French, and German.
    The method correctly aligned all but 4% of the sentences.
    Moreover, it is possible to extract a large subcorpus that has a much smaller error rate.
    By selecting the best-scoring 80% of the alignments, the error rate is reduced from 4% to 0.7%.
    There were more errors on the English&#8212;French subcorpus than on the English&#8212;German subcorpus, showing that error rates will depend on the corpus considered; however, both were small enough to hope that the method will be useful for many language pairs.
    To further research on bilingual corpora, a much lar
