propose a boundary but where a majority of humans did not.
    However, when either PAUSE or CUE is combined with the more global NP, as in PAUSE/NP and CUE/NP, we see that performance improves.
    These results suggest that another way to improve performance is to consider more sophisticated methods for combining features across the three types of linguistic devices.
    In this section we present two methods for developing segmentation algorithms that combine the features of multiple linguistic devices in more complex ways than simply combining the outputs of independent algorithms.
    Our first method relies on an analysis of the errors made by the best-performing algorithm.
    Our second method uses machine learning tools to automatically construct segmentation algorithms from a large set of input features: features used in our previous experiments, enhancements to hand-coded features, and new features obtainable automatically from our transcripts.
    Both methods consider much more knowledge than pre
