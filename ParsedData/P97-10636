ociations can be filtered out by a simple competition heuristic: Whenever several word tokens ui in one half of the bitext co-occur with a particular word token v in the other half of the bitext, the word that is most likely to be v's translation is the one for which the likelihood L(u, v) of translational equivalence is highest.
    The competitive linking algorithm implements this heuristic: N.B.
    : A and A- need not sum to 1, because they are conditioned on different events. would be the winners in any competitions involving u or v. The competitive linking algorithm is more greedy than algorithms that try to find a set of link types that are jointly most probable over some segment of the bitext.
    In practice, our linking algorithm can be implemented so that its worst-case running time is 0(/m), where 1 and m are the lengths of the aligned segments.
    The simplicity of the competitive linking algorithm depends on the one-to-one assumption: Each word translates to at most one other word.
