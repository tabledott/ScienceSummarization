  Their approach is methodologically similar to ours, in that they compute similarity on the basis of contexts of occurrance, making use of LSA.
    Their hypothesis is that high LSA-based similarity between the MWE and each of its constituent parts is indicative of compositionality.
    They evaluate their technique by assessing the correlation between high semantic similarity of the constituents of an MWE to the MWE as a whole with the likelihood that the MWE appears in WordNet as a hyponym of one of the constituents.
    While the expected correlation was not attested, we suspect this to be more an indication of the inappropriateness of the evaluation used than of the faultiness of the general approach.
    Lin, Baldwin et al., and Schone &amp; Jurafsky, all use as their gold standard either idiom dictionaries or WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998).
    While Schone &amp; Jurafsky show that WordNet is as good a standard as any of a number of machine readable dictionaries, none of these authors shows that the MWEs tha
