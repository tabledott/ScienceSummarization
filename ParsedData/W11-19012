g in general, and improved learning techniques have been developed to push the state of the art in coreference resolution forward (Morton, 2000; Harabagiu et al., 2001; McCallum and Wellner, 2004; Culotta et al., 2007; Denis and Baldridge, 2007; Rahman and Ng, 2009; Haghighi and Klein, 2010).
    Various different knowledge sources from shallow semantics to encyclopedic knowledge are being exploited (Ponzetto and Strube, 2005; Ponzetto and Strube, 2006; Versley, 2007; Ng, 2007).
    Researchers continued finding novel ways of exploiting ontologies such as WordNet.
    Given that WordNet is a static ontology and as such has limitation on coverage, more recently, there have been successful attempts to utilize information from much larger, collaboratively built resources such as Wikipedia (Ponzetto and Strube, 2006).
    In spite of all the progress, current techniques still rely primarily on surface level features such as string match, proximity, and edit distance; syntactic features such as apposition; and sha
