    Cossitt:*ro Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order to ask for clarification by the parliamentary secretary. a cost that favors exact matches and penalizes omissions or garbled matches.
    Thus, for example, we assign a cost of 0 to the pair Time = Later and Time = Plus Tard, but a cost of 10 to the pair Time = Later and Author = Mr. Bateman.
    We set the cost of a deletion at 5.
    For two names, we set the cost by counting the number of insertions, deletions, and substitutions necessary to transform one name, letter by letter, into the other.
    This value is then reduced to the range 0 to 10.
    Given the costs described above, it is a standard problem in dynamic programming to find that alignment of the major anchors in the two corpora with the least total cost [Bellman, 1957].
    In theory, the time and space required to find this alignment grow as the product of the lengths of the two sequences to be aligned.
    In practice, however, by using thresholds and t
