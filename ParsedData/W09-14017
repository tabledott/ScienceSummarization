    Task 2.
    Event enrichment recognition of secondary arguments that further specify the events extracted in Task 1.
    Task 3.
    Negation/Speculation detection detection of negations and speculation statements concerning extracted events.
    Task 1 serves as the backbone of the shared task and is mandatory for all participants.
    Task 2 involves the recognition of Entity type t-entities and assignment of those as secondary event arguments.
    Task 3 addresses the recognition of negated or speculatively expressed events without specific binding to text.
    An example is given in Fig.

    The BioNLP task data were prepared based on the GENIA event corpus.
    The data for the training and development sets were derived from the publicly available event corpus (Kim et al., 2008), and the data for the test set from an unpublished portion of the corpus.
    Table 2 shows statistics of the data sets.
    For data preparation, in addition to filtering out irrelevant annotations from the orig
