two minor complexities that need to be noted.
    The first relates to the inside probability 0(N:4).
    C&amp;C approximate it with the sum of the probabilities of all the parses for Nlk found at that point in the parse.
    This in turn requires a somewhat complicated scheme to avoid repeatedly re-evaluating Equation 4 whenever a new parse is found.
    In this paper we adopt a slightly simpler method.
    We approximate )3(Nk) by the most probable parse for Ni,k, rather than the sum of all the parses. j We justify this on the grounds that our parser eventually returns the most probable parse, so it seems reasonable to base our metric on its value.
    This also simplifies updating 13(N3,k) when new parses are found for Nk.
    Our algorithm compares the probability of the new parse to the best already found for Ni 4.
    If the old one is higher, nothing need be done.
    If the new one is higher, it is simply added to the agenda.
    The second complexity has to do with the fact that in Equation 4 the pr
