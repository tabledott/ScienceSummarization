lt that 13% of frame elements have no matching parse constituent gives a rough idea of the parser&#8217;s accuracy.
    Almost all of these cases in which no matching parse constituent was found are due to parser error.
    Other parser errors include cases in which a constituent is found, but with the incorrect label or internal structure.
    This result also considers only the individual constituent representing the frame element: the parse for the rest of the sentence may be incorrect, resulting in an incorrect value for the grammatical function features described in the previous two sections.
    Collins (1997) reports 88% labeled precision and recall on individual parse constituents on data from the Penn Treebank, roughly consistent with our finding of at least 13% error.

    The distinction between active and passive verbs plays an important role in the connection between semantic role and grammatical function, since direct objects of active verbs often correspond in semantic role to s
