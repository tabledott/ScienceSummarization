sh sentences.
    The source texts were Japanese white papers (JEIDA, 2000).
    The style of translation was generally literal reflecting the nature of government documents.
    We used 12 pairs of texts for evaluation.
    The average number of Japanese sentences per text was 413 and that of English sentences was 495.
    The recall, R, and precision, P, of the program against this corpus were R = 0.982 and P = 0.986, respectively, where The number of pairs in a one-to-n alignment is n. For example, if sentences {J11 and {E1, E2, E31 are aligned, then three pairs (J1, E1), (J1, E2), and (J1, E3) are obtained.
    This recall and precision are quite good considering the relatively large differences in the language structures between Japanese and English.
  
  
    We use BM25 and SIM to evaluate the similarity in articles and sentences, respectively.
    These measures, however, cannot be used to reliably discriminate between correct and incorrect alignments as will be discussed in Section 5.
