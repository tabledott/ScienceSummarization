d found that &#8220;a&#8221;, &#8220;an&#8221;, &#8220;the&#8221; and the absence of articles were often confused.
    We made up pseudo-errors just by replacing the correctly used articles with one of the others.
    The results of detecting article errors using the new training data, including the new corrected sentences described in Section 4.2, and 7558 sentences that contained artificially made errors were as follows.
    We obtained a better recall and precision rate for omission-type errors.
    There were no improvements for replacementtype errors.
    Since some more detailed context might be necessary to decide whether &#8220;a&#8221; or &#8220;the&#8221; must be used, the features we used here might be insufficient.
  
  
    In this paper, we explained how errors in learners&#8217; spoken data could be detected and in the experiment, using the corpus as it was, the recall rate was about 30% and the precision rate was about 50%.
    By adding corrected sentences and artificially made errors, the pr
