e 1: Syntactic Signatm:e for Change of State break subclass 3.1 Ass lgntnent  of  S ignatures For tile first experiment below, we construct a verb- based syntactic signature, while for the second exl)eri- ment, we constructed a class-based signature.
  The first step for constructing a signature is to decide what syntactic information to extract for ttre t)asic syntactic patterns that make up the signature.
  It turns out that a very simple strategy works well, namely, flat parses that contain lists of the major cat- egories in the sentence, the verb, and a handfifl of other elements.
  The "parse", then, for the sentence Tony broke the c rys ta l  vase is simply the syntac- tic pattern [np,v,np].
  For Tony broke the vase to pieces we get [np,v,np,pp(to)].
  Note that the pp node is marked with its head preposition.
  Table l shows an example class, the break subclass of the Change of State verbs (45.1), along with example sentences and the derived syntactic signature based on sentence pat- terns.
