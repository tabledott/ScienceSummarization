labels is more delicate than in traditional grammar, cf.
  the premodifiers AN&gt;, DN&gt;, NN&gt;, GN&gt; (genitival).
  In Constraint Grammar, syntactic labels are as- signed in three steps.
  The basic strategy is: Do as much as possible as early as possible.
  The first step is to provide as many syntactic labels as possible in the lexicon (including morphology).
  For entries having a reduced set of labels (compared to what that morphological class normally has), those labels will be listed in the lexicon.
  Thus, output from lexicon and morphology will indicate that he is @SUB J, that him is either @OBJ, @I-OBJ, or @&lt;P (NB: a considerably reduced subset of all nominal head functions), that went is @+FMAINV, etc.
  The second step is morphosyntactic mapping For all readings that remain after local disambigua- tion and do not yet have any syntactic function label, simple mapping statements tell, for each relevant morphological feature, or combination of features, what its range of syntactic labels is.
