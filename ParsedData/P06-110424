ernel achieves comparable performance with the feature-based methods.
    This shows that the syntactic features embedded in a parse tree are particularly useful for relation extraction and which can be well captured by the parse tree kernel.
    In addition, we find that the relation instance representation (selecting effective portions of parse trees for kernel calculations) is very important for relation extraction.
    The most immediate extension of our work is to improve the accuracy of relation detection.
    This can be done by capturing more features by including more individual kernels, such as the WordNet-based semantic kernel (Basili et al., 2005) and other feature-based kernels.
    We can also benefit from machine learning algorithms to study how to solve the data imbalance and sparseness issues from the learning algorithm viewpoint.
    In the future work, we will design a more flexible tree kernel for more accurate similarity measure.
