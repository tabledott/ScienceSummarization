ally produces lexicons in which each entry is associated with a weight based on the model, we can give a full precision/recall curve (see figure 3).
    We summarize these curves with both the best Fl over all possible thresholds and various precisions px at recalls x.
    All reported numbers exclude evaluation on the seed lexicon entries, regardless of how those seeds are derived or whether they are correct.
    In all experiments, unless noted otherwise, we used a seed of size 100 obtained from Le and considered lexicons between the top n = 2,000 most frequent source and target noun word types which were not in the seed lexicon; each system proposed an already-ranked one-to-one translation lexicon amongst these n words.
    Where applicable, we compare against the EDITDIST baseline, which solves a maximum bipartite matching problem where edge weights are normalized edit distances.
    We will use MCCA (for matching CCA) to denote our model using the optimal feature set (see section 5.3).
