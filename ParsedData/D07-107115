red a dangerous move.
			However, the learning algorithm in our approach can learn weights for the new rules, effectively allowing the model to learn touse them only in appropriate contexts; in the exper iments we show that the rules are highly effective additions when used within a weighted CCG.
			3.1 Application and Composition Rules.
			The first new combinators we consider are the relaxed functional application rules: A\B : f B : g ? A : f(g) (&amp;) B : g A/B : f ? A : f(g) (.)
			These are variants of the original applicationrules, where the slash direction on the principal categories (A/B or A\B) is reversed.6 These rules allow simple reversing of regular word order, for ex ample flights one way N N/N ?x.flight(x) ?f.?x.f(x) ? one way(x) . N ?x.flight(x) ? one way(x) Note that we can recover the correct analysis for this fragment, with the same lexical entries as those used for the conventional word order, one-way flights.
			A second set of new combinators are the relaxed functional composition rules
