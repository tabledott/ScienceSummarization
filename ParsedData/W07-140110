 situated in that country, the prime minister of a state is also a citizen of that state, and so on.
    As in RTE-2, human annotators generated t-h pairs within 4 application settings.
    The IE task was inspired by the Information Extraction (and Relation Extraction) application, where texts and structured templates were replaced by t-h pairs.
    As in the 2006 campaign, the pairs were generated using four different approaches: The common aim of all these processes was to simulate the need of IE systems to recognize that the given text indeed entails the semantic relation that is expected to hold between the candidate template slot fillers.
    In the IR (Information Retrieval) application setting, the hypotheses were propositional IR queries, which specify some statement, e.g.
    &#8220;robots are used to find avalanche victims&#8221;.
    The hypotheses were adapted and simplified from standard IR evaluation datasets (TREC and CLEF).
    Texts (t) that did or did not entail the hypotheses were selected
