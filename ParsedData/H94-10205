structure diting the present Penn Treebank; we intend to automatically ex- tract a bank of predicate-argument structures intended at the very least for parser evaluation from the resulting annotated corpus.
  The remainder of this paper will discuss the implementation of each of four crucial aspects of the new annotation scheme, 114 as well as notational devices to allow predicate-argument structure to be recovered in the face of conjoined struc- ture involving gapping, where redundant syntactic structure within a conjoined structure is deleted.
  In particular, the new scheme: 1.
  Incorporates a consistent treatment of related grammat- ical phenomena.
  The issue here is not that the repre- sentation be "correct" given some theoretical analysis or other, but merely that instances of what are descrip- tively the same phenomenon be represented similarly.
  In particular, the notation should make it easy to auto- matically recover predicate-argument structure.
