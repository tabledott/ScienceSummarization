    The met* method (CS version) Figure 3 shows the sense-frames for the verb senses eat1 and drink1.
    In both, the agent preference is for an animal but the object preferences differ: the preference of eatl is for foodl, i.e., an edible solid, while the preference of drinkl is for drink1 (the noun sense), i.e., a potable liquid.
    The second component of CS is the process of collation.
    It is collation that contains the met* method in CS.
    Collation matches the sense-frames of two word senses and finds a system of multiple mappings between those sense-frames, thereby discriminating the semantic relations between the word senses.
    Figure 4 shows the use of the met* method in CS.
    Figure 4 is similar to the one in Figure 1 except that the diamonds contain the processes used in CS to check for satisfied preferences (diamond 1), metonymic inferences (diamond 2), and releva
