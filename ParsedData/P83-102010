 Note that while a D-theory parser itself has no predicate with which to express direct dominance, the base templates explicitly encode just such information.
    Insofar as the parser makes its assertions of dominance on the basis of the phrase structure rules, the parser will behave very similarly to deterministic tree building parsers.
    In fact, the parser will typically (although, as we will see below, not always) behave in just such a fashion.
  
  
    By and large, we believe that a significant subset of the grammar of English has been successfully embedded within the deterministic tree-building model.
    However, a residue of syntactic phenomena remain which defy simple explication within this framework.
    Some of these phenomena are particular problems for the deterministic tree-building framework.
    Others, for example coordination and gapping phenomena, have defied adequate explication within any existing theory of grammar.
    In the remainder of this paper we will explore a range of such
