  Monotonic Semantic Interpretation
  
    hiyan@cam. sri . corn ralcam. sri. corn ABSTRACT Aspects of semantic interpretation, such as quantifier scoping and reference resolution, are often realised computationally by non-monotonic operations involving loss of information and destructive manipulation of semantic representations.
    The paper describes how monotonic reference resolution and scoping can be carried out using a revised Quasi Logical Form (QLF) representation.
    Semantics for QLF are presented in which the denotations of formulas are extended monotonically as QLF expressions are resolved.
  
  
    The monotonicity property of unification based grammar formalisms is perhaps the most important factor in their widespread use for grammatical description and parsing.
    Monotonicity guarantees that the grammatical analysis of a sentence can proceed incrementally by combining information from rules and lexical entries in a nondestructive way.
    By contrast, aspects of semantic interpretation, s
