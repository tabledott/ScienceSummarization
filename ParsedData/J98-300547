t message understanding systems do not extract the source, this is the most specific we can be for such cases.
    We are experimenting with some techniques to automate the preprocessing stage.
    Our preliminary impressions show that by restricting SUMMONS to templates in which at least five or six slots are filled, we can eliminate most of the irrelevant templates. tween templates, which will trigger certain operators.
    Since slots are matched among templates in chronological order, there is only one sequence in which they can be applied.
    Such patterns trigger reordering of the templates and modification of their individual importance values.
    As an example, if two templates are combined with the refinement operator, the importance value of the combined template will be greater than the sum of the individual importance of the constituent templates.
    At the same time, the values of these two templates are lowered (still keeping a higher value on the later one, which is assumed to be the more co
