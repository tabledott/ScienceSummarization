approach proposed by Luo.
    While our investigation reveals that such an approach gives good accuracy, our findings however indicate that a one-at-a-time, character-based approach to POS tagging gave quite comparable accuracy, with the benefit of incurring much reduced computational cost.
  
  
    Language differences between English and Chinese have made direct porting of an English POS tagging method to Chinese ineffective.
    In Chinese, individual characters encode information that aids in POS tagging.
    Using a character-based approach for Chinese POS tagging is more effective than a word-based approach.
    Our study has also revealed that the one-at-a-time, character-based approach gives relatively good POS tagging accuracy with a much improved training and testing time,
