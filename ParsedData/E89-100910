ot is N:P. Let Ni :P1, Ni :P2 be such that Ni :P1 is specified in T. We say Nl:P2 is connected to Ni :P1 (relative to ,r) if: there is no strict extension P3 of P1 of which P2 is an extension such that N1:P3 is specified in T. So Ni :P2 is connected to Ni :P1 if PI is the maximal subpath of P2 that is specified (with Ni) in T. Now given a set of sentences T, define the path closure pcl(T) of T to be: pcl(T) = (S:S is an extensional sentence in ) (S^Q: S is a definitional sentence in T, with root N:P, and N:PAQ is connected to N:P) It is clear from these definitions that any N:P is connected to itself and thus that T is always a subset of pd( T).
    The path closure contains all those theorems which can be inferred by default from T. To illustrate path closure, consider the following example theory: The situation is slightly more complicated with sentences that have paths on their right-hand sides.
    Such paths are also extended by the subpath used to extend the left-hand side.
    So the sentence: might gi
