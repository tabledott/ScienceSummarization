    Currently, paraphrasing using part of speech transformations is not supported by the system.
    All other paraphrase classes we identified are implemented in our algorithm for theme intersection.

    When reading an original text, it is possible to retrieve the correct temporal sequence of events which is usually available explicitly.
    However, when we put pieces of text from different sources together, we must provide the correct time perspective to the reader, including the order of events, the temporal distance between events and correct temporal references.

    However, in the case of multiple-document summarization, some events may not be described in the same article.
    Furthermore, the order between phrases can cha
