] = hh{ai : a &#8712; A}; &#945;iii.
    Let d[&#8722;&#248;] = d[&#8722;i], where i are the columns with empty stores.
    For example, for d in Figure 5, d[1] keeps column 1, d[&#8722;&#248;] keeps column 2, and d[2, &#8722;2] swaps the two columns.
    Join The join of two denotations d and d' with respect to components j and j' (&#8727; means all components) is formed by concatenating all arrays a of d with all compatible arrays a' of d', where compatibility means a1j = a'1j0.
    The stores are also concatenated (&#945; + &#945;').
    Non-initial columns with empty stores are projected away by applying &#183;[1,&#8722;&#248;].
    The full definition of join is as follows: Aggregate The aggregate operation takes a denotation and forms a set out of the tuples in the first column for each setting of the rest of the columns: Now we turn to the mark (M) and execute (Xi) operations, which handles the divergence between syntactic and semantic scope.
    In some sense, this is the technical core of DCS.
