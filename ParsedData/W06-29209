cted values were compared to the gold standard HEAD and DEPREL.6 The official evaluation metric is the labeled attachment score (LAS), i.e. the percentage of &#8220;scoring&#8221; tokens for which the system has predicted the correct HEAD and DEPREL.
    The evaluation script defines a nonscoring token as a token where all characters of the FORM value have the Unicode category property &#8220;Punctuation&#8221;.7 We tried to take a test set that was representative of the genres in a treebank and did not cut through text samples.
    We also tried to document how we selected this set.8 We aimed at having roughly the same size for the test sets of all languages: 5,000 scoring tokens.
    This is not an exact requirement as we do not want to cut sentences in half.
    The relatively small size of the test set means that even for the smallest treebanks the majority of tokens is available for training, and the equal size means that for the overall ranking of participants, we can simply compute the score on the con
