			its rhs constituents (VBP[3] and NP[4-8]) do not overlap.
			Conversely, NP(x0:DT, x1:CD:, x2:NNS) is not the lhs of any rule extractible from G, since its frontier constituents CD[2] and NNS[2] haveoverlapping spans.3 Finally, the GHKM proce dure produces a single derivation from G, which is shown in Table 1.
			The concern in GHKM was to extract minimalrules, whereas ours is to extract rules of any arbi trary size.
			Minimal rules defined over G are thosethat cannot be decomposed into simpler rules induced by the same graph G, e.g., all rules in Table 1.
			We call minimal a derivation that only con tains minimal rules.
			Conversely, a composed ruleresults from the composition of two or more min imal rules, e.g., rule (b) and (c) compose into: NP(DT(t
