 analysis by one in which all signatures are removed which consist of a single suffix composed of a single letter.
    This set of signatures includes, for example, the singleton signature e, which is a perfectly valid suffix in English; however, if we permit all words ending in e, but having no other related forms, to be analyzed as containing the suffix e, then the e will be inappropriately highly valued in the analysis.
    (We return to this question in Section 11, where we address the question of how many occurrences of a stem with a single suffix we would expect to find in a corpus.)
    In the next stage of analysis, triage, signatures containing a small number of stems or a single suffix are explored in greater detail.
    The challenge of triage is to determine when the data is rich and strong enough to support the existence of a linguistically real signature.
    A special case of this is the question of how many stems must exist to motivate the existence of a signature (and hence, a morphological a
