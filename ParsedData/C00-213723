ikely to either technique) and see how likely such a shuffle 1)roduces a differ- ence (new technique lninus old technique) in the metric(s) of interest @1 our ease, precision and l?-score) that is at least; as large as the difference observed when using the two techniques on the test data.
  n responses to shuttle and assign 4 leads to 2 ~ diflerent w~ys to shuffle and assign I;hose re- sponses.
  So when n. is small, one can try each of the different shuttles once and produce an exact randomization.
  V~;hen n gets large, the mmfl)er of different shutttes gets too large to be exhaustively evaluated.
  ~J?hen one performs a.u approximate randomization where each shuffle is perfornmd with randoln assignments.
  For us, when n &lt; 20 (2" .&lt;_.
  1048576), we use an exact randomization.
  For n &gt; 20, we use an approximate randomization with 1048576 shuf ties.
  Because an approximate randomization uses random nmnbers, which both lead to oc~ casional unusual results and may involve using a not-so-good pseud
