  Nonconcatenative Finite-State Morphology
  
    the last few years, so called in general, and morphology in particular, have become widely accepted as paradigms for the computational treatment of morphology.
    Finite-state morphology appeals to the notion of a finite-state transducer, which is simply a classical finite-state automaton whose transitions are labeled with pairs, rather than with single symbols.
    The automaton operates on a pair of tapes and advances over a given transition if the current symbols on the tapes match the pair on the transition.
    One member of the pair of symbols on a transition can be the designated null symbol, which we will write c. When this appears, the corresponding tape is not examined, and it does not advance as the machine moves to the next state.
    Finite-state morphology originally arose out of a desire to provide ways of analyzing surface forms using grammars expressed in terms of systems of ordered rewriting rules.
