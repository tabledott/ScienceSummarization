icalization of the semantic gra.,nmz:r aids generation.
			Tile description of parsing and germration above rnay seem to imply that these processes cannot be pcrlormcd incrementally, that is, an entire source derivation must be recovered before the corresponding target derivation can be computed.
			The issue deserves clarification.
			In the case wltere the synchronous TAG is order- independent ( hat is, the order of derivation in one TAG does not effect the result in the other, as when no two links share an endpoint) there is a one-to-one mapping between the source and target derivation.
			When par- tial source derivations are recognized by the parser, the corresponding partial target derivation (for example se- mantic inteq)retation) can be incrementally compuled: as the input is read from left to right, interpretations of the partial target derivations corresponding to partial source derivations can be combined in one step to buikl a larger partial target derivation.
