 since the number of shared terms between two long sentences and between a long and a short sentence would probably yield incomparable scores (and sentences are too short to expect normalization to really accommodate for the differences).
    For the purposes of the rest of the discussion these groupings of tokens will be referred to as token-sequences.
    The morphologically analyzed token is stored in a table along with a record of the token-sequence number it occurred in, and the number of times it appeared in the token-sequence.
    A record is also kept of the locations of the paragraph breaks within the text.
    Stop words contribute to the computation of the size of the token-sequence, but not to the computation of the similarity between blocks of text.
    As mentioned above, two methods for determining the score to be assigned at each token-sequence gap are explored here.
    The first, block comparison, compares adjacent blocks of text to see how similar they are according to how many words the ad
