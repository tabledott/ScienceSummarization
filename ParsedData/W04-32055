y verbs of a certain EVCA class (Levin 1993).
    In discussing future work, Klavans and Kan point to extending coverage of the manually constructed EVCA resource as a way of improving the performance of the system.
    A widecoverage repository of verb relations including verbs linked by the similarity relation will provide a way to automatically extend the existing verb classes to cover more of the English lexicon.
    Some existing broad-coverage resources on verbs have focused on organizing verbs into classes or annotating their frames or thematic roles.
    EVCA (English Verb Classes and Alternations) (Levin 1993) organizes verbs by similarity and participation / nonparticipation in alternation patterns.
    It contains 3200 verbs classified into 191 classes.
    Additional manually constructed resources include PropBank (Kingsbury et al. 2002), FrameNet (Baker et al.
    1998), VerbNet (Kipper et al. 2000), and the resource on verb selectional restrictions developed by Gomez (2001).
