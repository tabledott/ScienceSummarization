nvolves three steps.
    (1) Basilisk automatically generates a set of extraction patterns for the corpus and scores each pattern based upon the number of seed words among its extractions.
    This step is identical to the first step of Meta-Bootstrapping.
    Basilisk then puts the best patterns into a Pattern Pool.
    (2) All nouns3 extracted by a pattern in the Pattern Pool are put into a Candidate Word Pool.
    Basilisk scores each noun based upon the set of patterns that extracted it and their collective association with the seed words.
    (3) The top 10 nouns are labeled as the targeted semantic class and are added to the dictionary.
    The bootstrapping process then repeats, using the original seeds and the newly labeled words.
    The main difference between Basilisk and MetaBootstrapping is that Basilisk scores each noun based on collective information gathered from all patterns that extracted it.
    In contrast, Meta-Bootstrapping identifies a single best pattern and assumes that everything it
