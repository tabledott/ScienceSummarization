    Typical values for attributes: $time-dep = &amp;quot;10 a.m.&amp;quot;, $city-fr = &amp;quot;New York&amp;quot;, $city-to = &amp;quot;Miami&amp;quot; is some additional cost associated with producing the syntactic dependency annotation necessary for NLG3, but virtually no additional cost is associated with NLG2, beyond collecting the data itself and identifying the attributes.
