   However, note the presence of noun coordination (n coord q and q coord n), consistently with the common claim that coordinated terms tend to be related taxonomically (Widdows and Dorow 2002).
    Constitutive is mostly a whole&#8211;part relation, and the harvested links do a good job at illustrating such a relation.
    For the Telic, q by n, q through n, and q via n capture cases in which the quale stands in an action&#8211;instrument relation to the target noun (murder by knife).
    These links thus encode the subtype of Telic role that Pustejovsky (1995) calls &#8220;indirect.&#8221; The two verb&#8211;noun links (q obj n and n sbj intr q) instead capture &#8220;direct&#8221; Telic roles, which are typically expressed by the theme of a verb (read a book, the book reads well).
    The least convincing results are those for the Agentive role, where only q obj n and perhaps q out n are intuitively plausible canonical links.
    Interestingly, the manual selections we carried out in Section 6.2.3 also gav
