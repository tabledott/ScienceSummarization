    In order to accommodate the centering model to texts from these genres, we distinguish a third set of expressions; mediated discourse entities in U, (MED).
    On Prince's (1981) familiarity scale, the set of hearer-old discourse entities (OLD) remains the same as before, i.e., it consists of evoked (E) and unused (U) discourse entities, while the set of hearer-new discourse entities (NEW) now consists only of brand-new (BN) discourse entities.
    Inferable (I), containing inferable (IC), and anchored brand-new (BNA) discourse entities, which make up the set of mediated discourse entities, have a status between hearer-old and hearer-new discourse entities.'
    See Figure 3 for Prince's familiarity scale and its relation to the three sets.
    Again, the elements of this set are indistinguishable with respect to their information status&#8212;for instance, inferable and anchored brand-new discourse entities have the same information status because they belong to the set of mediated discourse entities.
