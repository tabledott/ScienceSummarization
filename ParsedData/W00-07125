rd in exactly one place based on probability and lengths of hypothesized stems and affixes.
    He applies the EM algorithm to eliminate inappropriate parses.
    He collects the possible suffixes for each stem calling these a signature which aid in determining word classes.
    Goldsmith (2000) later incorporates minimum description length to identify stemming characteristics that most compress the data, but his algorithm otherwise remains similar in nature.
    Goldsmith's algorithm is practically knowledge-free, though he incorporates capitalization removal and some word segmentation.
    Gaussier (1999) begins with an inflectional lexicon and seeks to find derivational morphology.
    The words and parts of speech from his inflectional lexicon serve for building relational families of words and identifying sets of word pairs and suffixes therefrom.
    Gaussier splits words based on p-similarity &#8212; words that agree in exactly the first p characters.
    He also builds a probabilistic model which indi
