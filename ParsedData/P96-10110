  Efficient Normal-Form Parsing For Combinatory Categorial Grammar
  
    Under categorial grammars that have powerful rules like composition, a simple n-word sentence can have exponentially many parses.
    Generating all parses is inefficient and obscures whatever true semantic ambiguities are in the input.
    This paper addresses the problem for a fairly general form of Combinatory Categorial Grammar, by means of an efficient, correct, and easy to implement normal-form parsing tech- The parser is proved to find exone in each semantic equivalence class of allowable parses; that is, spurious ambiguity (as carefully defined) is shown to be both safely and completely eliminated.
  
  
    Combinatory Categorial Grammar (Steedman, 1990), like other &amp;quot;flexible&amp;quot; categorial grammars, suffers from spurious ambiguity (Wittenburg, 1986).
    The non-standard constituents that are so crucial to CCG's analyses in (1), and in its account of intonational focus (Prevost &amp; Steedman, 1994), remain ava
