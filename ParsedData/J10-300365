rrectness of the sentences being generated from such lattices, even if the sentences do not bear a paraphrastic relationship to the input.
    Even if one were to assume that the syntax-based alignment method would result in better paraphrases, it still would not address the primary weakness of Barzilay and Lee&#8217;s method: Paraphrases are only generated for new sentences that match an already existing lattice, leading to lower coverage.
    In the last decade, there has been a resurgence in research on statistical machine translation.
    There has also been an accompanying dramatic increase in the number of available bilingual parallel corpora due to the strong interest in SMT from both the public and private sectors.
    Recent research in paraphrase generation has attempted to leverage these very large bilingual corpora.
    In this section, we look at such approaches that rely on the preservation of meaning across languages and try to recover said meaning by using cues from the second language.
