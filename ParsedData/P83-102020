 mean some blue coat or other which Don owns; i.e. adding to the description changes the standard referent.
    The key notion here is that because descriptions are always underspecified, there must be some set of conventions for choosing the intended single referent out of the often large (and sometimes infinite) class of objects that any given description is true of.
    Thus, once we claim that the output of syntactic analysis is a description, it is not surprising that there must be some restrictive conventions to determine exactly what such a description refers to.
    Given this, the convention we assume seems a simple and natural one.
  
  
    Another problematic class of constructions for deterministic tree-building theories are those for which it is argued that some kind of active reanalysis process must occur.
    For each of these constructions, there is linguistic evidence (of varied force) which suggests (recast in processing terms) that different syntactic structures must be assigned to that co
