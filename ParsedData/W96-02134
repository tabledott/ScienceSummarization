(Darroch and Ratcliff, 1972) that if p has the form (1) and satisfies the k constraints (2), it uniquely maximizes the entropy H (p) over distributions that satisfy (2), and uniquely maximizes the likelihood L(p) over distributions of the form (1).
    The model parameters for the distribution p are obtained via Generalized Iterative Sca/ing(Darroch and Ratcliff, 1972).
    The joint probability of a history h and tag t is determined by those parameters whose corresponding features are active, i.e., those aj such that f (h,t) = 1.
    A feature, given (h,t), may activate on any word or tag in the history h, and must encode any information that might help predict t, such as the spelling of the current word, or the identity of the previous two tags.
    The specific word and tag context available to a feature is given in the following definition of a history hi: If the above feature exists in the feature set of the model, its corresponding model parameter will contribute towards the joint probability p(hi,ti) w
