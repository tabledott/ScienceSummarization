    Furthermore, human performance measures provide a more intuitive way of assessing the capabilities of a given system than current measures of precision, recall, F-measure, operating curves, etc.
    In addition, reading comprehension tests are written to test a range of skill levels.
    With proper choice of test material, it should be possible to challenge systems to successively higher levels of performance.
    For these reasons, reading comprehension tests offer an interesting alternative to the kinds of special-purpose,
