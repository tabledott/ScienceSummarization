rase, as in the examples).
    The difference between the representations involves structural preferences such as the right-branching preferences encoded by the distance measure.
    Applying the models in this article to treebank analyses that use this type of &#8220;head-centered&#8221; BB = binary-branching structures; FLAT = Penn treebank style annotations.
    In each case the binary-branching annotation style prevents the model from learning that these structures should receive low probability because of the long distance dependency associated with the final PP (in boldface). binary-branching tree will result in a distance measure that incorrectly encodes a preference for right-branching structures.
    To see this, consider the examples in Figure 18.
    In each binary-branching example, the generation of the final modifying PP is &#8220;blind&#8221; to the distance between it and the head that it modifies.
    At the top level of the tree, it is apparently adjacent to the head; crucially, the closer m
