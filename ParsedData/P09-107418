antial) improvements in performance on all metrics over all data sets, especially when measured using the MUC score.
    Conclusion #2: Improving the ability of coreference resolvers to identify coreference elements would likely improve the state-of-the-art immensely &#8212; by 10-20 points in MUC F1 score and from 2-12 F1 points for B3.
    This finding explains previously published results that exhibit striking variability when run with annotated CEs vs. system-extracted CEs.
    On the MUC6 data set, for example, the best published MUC score using extracted CEs is approximately 71 (Yang et al., 2003), while multiple systems have produced MUC scores of approximately 85 when using annotated CEs (e.g.
    Luo et al. (2004), McCallum and Wellner (2004)).
    We argue that providing a resolver with the annotated CEs is a rather unrealistic evaluation: determining whether an NP is part of an annotated coreference chain is precisely the job of a coreference resolver!
    Conclusion #3: Assuming the availability o
