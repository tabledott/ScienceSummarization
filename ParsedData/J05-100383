is is the only essential difference between the new algorithm and the ExpLoss method.
    Results from Collins, Schapire and Singer (2002) show that under these definitions the following guarantee holds: LogLoss&#240;Upd&#240;&#175;a,k, BestWt&#240;k, &#175;a&#222;&#222;&#222; &lt; BestLoss&#240;k, &#175;a&#222; So it can be seen that the update from a&#175; to Upd&#240;&#175;a, k, BestWt&#240;k, &#175;a&#222;&#222; is guaranteed to decrease LogLoss by at least ffiffiffiffiffiffiffi (Wk -W, )2.
    From these results, the algorithms in Figures 3 and 4 could be altered to take the revised definitions of W&#254;k and Wk into account.
    Selecting the feature with the minimum value of BestLoss&#240;k, &#175;a&#222; at each iteration leads to the largest guaranteed decrease in LogLoss.
    Note that this is now an approximation, in that BestLoss&#240;k, &#175;a) is an upper bound on the log-likelihood which may or may not be tight.
    There are convergence guarantees for the method, however, in that as the numb
