veral factors.
    In both CCGbank and DepBank there are two conj GRs arising from the coordination: (conj and president) and (conj and officer).10 The difference arises in the subject of said: in DepBank the subject is and: (ncsubj said and ), whereas in CCGbank there are two subjects: (ncsubj said president ) and (ncsubj said officer ).
    We deal with this problem by replacing any pairs of GRs which differ only in their arguments, and where the arguments are coordinated items, with a single GR containing the coordination term as the argument.
    Two arguments are coordinated if they appear in conj relations with the same coordinating term, where &#8220;same term&#8221; is determined by both the word and sentence position.
    Another source of conj errors is coordination terms acting as sentential modifiers, with category S/S, often at the beginning of a sentence.
    These are labeled conj in DepBank, but the GR for S/S is ncmod.
    So any ncmod whose modifier&#8217;s lexical category is S/S, and whose
