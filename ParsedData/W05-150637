			For each sentence, we measured the time to calculate the k-best list, not including the initial 1-best parsing phase.
			We then averaged the times over our test set to produce the graph of Figure 11, which shows that Algorithm 3 runs an average of about 300 times faster than Algorithm 2.
			Furthermore, we were able to test Algorithm 3 up to.
			k = 106 in a reasonable amount of time.8 8The curvature in the plot for Algorithm 3 for k &lt; 1000 may be due to lack of resolution in the timing function for short times.
	
	
			The problem of k-best parsing and the effect of k-best listsize and quality on applications are subjects of increas ing interest for NLP research.
			We have presented herea general-purpose algorithm for k-best parsing and ap plied it to two state-of-the-art, large-scale NLP systems: Bikel?s implementation of Collins?
			lexicalized PCFGmodel (Bikel, 2004; Collins, 2003) and Chiang?s syn chronous CFG based decoder (Chiang, 2005) for machine translation.
			We hope that this work will
