&#8217;s correlation measures.
    We perturbed the Russian side of the corpus in the following way.
    Articles from each day were randomly moved (with uniform probability) within a -day window.
    We ran single word NE temporal sequence matching alone on the perturbed corpora using each of the three measures (Table 1).
    Some accuracy drop due to misalignment could be accommodated for by using a larger temporal bin for collecting occurrence counts.
    We tried various (sliding) window size for a perturbed corpus with (Table 2).
    DFT metric outperforms the other measures significantly in most cases.
    NEs tend to have distributions with few pronounced peaks.
    If two such distributions are not well aligned, we expect both Pearson and Cosine measures to produce low scores, whereas the DFT metric should catch their similarities in the frequency domain.
  
  
    We have proposed a novel algorithm for cross lingual multi-word NE discovery in a bilingual weakly temporally aligned corpus.
    We have
