imented extensively with salience weighting.
    Our goal was, of course, to optimize RAP's success rate with the training corpus.
    We proceeded heuristically, analyzing cases of failure and attempting to eliminate them in as general a manner as possible.
    The parallelism reward was introduced at this time, as it seemed to make a substantial contribution to the overall success rate.
    A salience factor that was originally present, viz, matrix emphasis, was revised to become the non-adverbial emphasis factor.
    In its original form, this factor contributed to the salience of any NP not contained in a subordinate clause or in an adverbial PP demarcated by a separator.
    This was found to be too general, especially since the relative positions of a given pronoun and its antecedent candidates are not taken into account.
    The revised factor could be thought of as an adverbial penalty factor, since it in effect penalizes NPs occurring in adverbial pps.io We also experimented with the initial weights
