    Transitivity is also not always preserved in the translations.
    For example, flutuar does not take a direct object, so some of the alternations that are related to its transitive meaning are not present.
    For these verbs, we have the induced action alternation by using the light verb fazer (make) before the verb, as in Maria fez o barco flutuar (Mary floated the boat).
    As can be seen in Table 2 the alternations for the Portuguese translations of the verbs in this intersective class indicate that they share similar properties with the English verbs, including the causative/inchoative.
    The exception to this, as just noted, is flutuar (float).
    The result of this is that flutuar should move out of the slide class, which puts it with derivar (drift) and planar (glide) in the closely related roll/run class.
    As in English, derivar and planar are not externally controllable actions and thus don't take the causative/inchoative alternation common to other verbs i
