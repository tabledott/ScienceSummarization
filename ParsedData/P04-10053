er, and the repair.
    Figure 1 shows these three parts for a typical repair.
    Most current probabilistic language models are based on HMMs or PCFGs, which induce linear or tree-structured dependencies between words.
    The relationship between reparandum and repair seems to be quite different: the repair is a &#8220;rough copy&#8221; of the reparandum, often incorporating the same or very similar words in roughly the same word order.
    That is, they seem to involve &#8220;crossed&#8221; dependencies between the reparandum and the repair, shown in Figure 1.
    Languages with an unbounded number of crossed dependencies cannot be described by a context-free or finitestate grammar, and crossed dependencies like these have been used to argue natural languages ... a flight to Boston, uh, I mean, to Denver on Friday ... are not context-free Shieber (1985).
    Mildly context-sensitive grammars, such as Tree Adjoining Grammars (TAGs) and Combinatory Categorial Grammars, can describe such crossing dependencie
