 the agent can be indicated by the subject of the clause.
    The mapping rules make use of intuitions about syntactic cues for indicating semantic roles first embodied in the notion of case [Fillmore1968,Palmer19811.
    Some of these cues are quite general, while other cues are very verb-specific.
    The mapping rules can take advantage of generalities like &amp;quot;SUBJECT to AGENT&amp;quot; syntactic cues while still preserving context sensitivities.
    This is accomplished by making the application of the mapping rules &amp;quot;situation-specific' through the use of PREDICATE ENVIRONMENTS.
    The previous rule is quite general and can be applied to every agent semantic role in this domain.
    This is indicated by the X on the right hand side of the &amp;quot;/&amp;quot; which refers to the predicate environment of the agent, i.e., anything.
    Other rules, such as 'WITH-PP to OBJECT2,&amp;quot; are much less general, and can only apply under a set of specific circumstances.
