 (SOON STR NONPRO=C), our tree requires an additional test on ANIMACY before considering the two NPs coreferent; the Soon tree instead determines two NPs to be coreferent as long as they are the same string.
    Pronoun resolution is also performed quite differently by the two trees, although both consider two pronouns coreferent when their strings match.
    Finally, intersentential and intrasentential pronominal references are possible in our system while intersentential pronominal references are largely prohibited by the Soon system.
  
  
    We investigate two methods to improve existing machine learning approaches to the problem of noun phrase coreference resolution.
    First, we propose three extra-linguistic modifications to the machine learning framework, which together consistently produce statistically significant gains in precision and corresponding increases in F-measure.
    Our results indicate that coreference resolution systems can improve by effectively exploiting the interaction between th
