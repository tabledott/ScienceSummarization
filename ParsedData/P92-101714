nce according to G, and define the bracketing accuracy of the grammar as the proportion of phrases in those analyses that are compatible in the sense defined in Section 2 with the tree bank bracketings of the test set.
    This criterion is closely related to the &amp;quot;crossing parentheses&amp;quot; score of Black et al. (1991).'
    In describing the experiments, we use the notation GB for the grammar estimated by the original inside-outside algorithm, and GB for the grammar estimated by the bracketed algorithm.
    We consider first an artificial language discussed by Lan i and Young (1990).
    Our training corpus consists of 100 sentences in the palindrome language L over two symbols a and b 1Since the grammar inference procedure is restricted to Chomsky normal form grammars, it cannot avoid difficult decisions by leaving out brackets (thus making flatter parse trees), as human annotators often do.
    Therefore, the recall component in Black et al. 's figure of merit for parser is not needed.
