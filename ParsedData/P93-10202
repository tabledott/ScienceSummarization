en though this is a precondition for avoiding circularity in relating segments to linguistic phenomena.
    We present the results of a two part study on the reliability of human segmentation, and correlation with linguistic cues.
    We show that human subjects can reliably perform discourse segmentation using speaker intention as a criterion.
    We use the segmentations produced by our subjects to quantify and evaluate the correlation of discourse segmentation with three linguistic cues: referential noun phrases, cue words, and pauses.
    Figure 1 illustrates how discourse structure interacts with reference resolution in an excerpt taken from our corpus.
    The utterances of this discourse are grouped into two hierarchically structured segments, with segment 2 embedded in segment 1.
    This segmental structure is crucial for determining that the boxed pronoun he corefers with the boxed noun phrase a farmer.
    Without the segmentation, the referent of the underlined noun phrase a man with a goat is a p
