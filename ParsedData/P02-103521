us test set broken down according to parse-quality are shown in Table 2.
    In Table 3 we show the DR measure along with an evaluation measure which facilitates a direct comparison of our results to those of Carroll et al. (1999).
    Following Carroll et al. (1999), we count a dependency relation as correct if the gold standard has a relation with the same governor and dependent but perhaps with a different relation-type.
    This dependency-only (DO) measure thus does not reflect mismatches between arguments and modifiers in a small number of cases.
    Note that since for the evaluation on the Brown corpus, no heldout data were available to adjust the variance parameter of a Bayesian model, we used a plain maximumlikelihood model for disambiguation on this test set.
  
  
    We have presented a first attempt at scaling up a stochastic parsing system combining a hand-coded linguistically fine-grained grammar and a stochastic disambiguation model to the WSJ treebank.
    Full grammar coverage is achieved b
