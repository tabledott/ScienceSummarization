  ABSTRACT It is well-known that there are polysemous words like sentence whose "meaning" or "sense" depends on the context of use.
  We have recently reported on two new word-sense disambiguation systems, one trained on bilin- gual material (the Canadian Hansards) and the other trained on monolingual material (Rogets Thesaurus and Groliers Encyclopedia).
  As this work was nearing com- pletion, we observed a very strong discourse ffect.
  That is, if a polysemous word such as sentence appears two or more times in a well-written discourse, it is extremely likely that they will all share the same sense.
  This paper describes an experiment which confirmed this hypothesis and found that the tendency to share sense in the same discourse is extremely strong (98%).
  This result can be used as an additional source of constraint for improving the performance of th
