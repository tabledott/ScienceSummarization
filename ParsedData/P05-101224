more, the model can be augmented to include features over lexicalized phrase structure parsing decisions to increase dependency accuracy over those parsers.
    We plan on extending our parser in two ways.
    First, we would add labels to dependencies to represent grammatical roles.
    Those labels are very important for using parser output in tasks like information extraction or machine translation.
    Second, we are looking at model extensions to allow nonprojective dependencies, which occur in languages such as Czech, German and Dutch.
