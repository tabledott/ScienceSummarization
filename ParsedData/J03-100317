y one vertex in the scene graph.
    Consider the three vertex-graph pairs in Figure 4, in which circled vertices stand for the intended referent.
    Graph (i) refers to all vertices of the graph in Figure 3 (every object in the scene is next to some other object), graph (ii) can refer to both d1 and d2, and graph (iii) is distinguishing in that it can refer only to d1.
    Note that the graphs might be realized as something next to something else, a chihuahua, and the dog in the doghouse, respectively.
    Here we concentrate on the generation of distinguishing vertex-graph pairs.
    Formally, the notion that a graph H = (VH, EH) can be &#8220;placed over&#8221; another graph G = ft, EG) corresponds to the notion of a subgraph isomorphism (see, e.g., Three distinguishing vertex-graph pairs referring to d1 in Figure 3.
    Read and Corneil [1977] for an overview).
    H can be &#8220;placed over&#8221; G iff there exists a subgraph G' = (VG,, EG,) of G such that H is isomorphic to G'.
    H is isomorphic to
