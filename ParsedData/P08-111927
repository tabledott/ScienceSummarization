ch are much larger open classes, also achieved high accuracy and generated many instances, but the resulting lists are far from complete.
    Even on the web, the doublyanchored hyponym pattern eventually ran out of steam and could not produce more instances.
    However, all of our experiments were conducted using just a single hyponym pattern.
    Other researchers have successfully used sets of hyponym patterns (e.g., (Hearst, 1992; Etzioni et al., 2005; Pas&#184;ca, 2004)), and multiple patterns could be used with our algorithms as well.
    Incorporating additional hyponym patterns will almost certainly improve coverage, and could potentially improve the quality of the graphs as well.
    Our popularity-based algorithm was very effective and is practical to use.
    Our best-performing algorithm, however, was the 2-step process that begins with an exhaustive search (reckless bootstrapping) and then ranks the candidates using the Outdegree scoring function, which represents productivity.
    The first ste
