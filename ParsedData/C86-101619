copied and unil ication is then applied to the copies.
  In this way, the operands are left untouched, us the parsing algorithm requires, but t.he method is computationally inefficient because it involves a great deal of copying.
  1) PATI{ solves the problem in a novel way.
  In [)-PATR, unification is implemented so that the original state of the input structures can be restored after the operation has been completed.
  Whenever a destructive change is about to be nmde in the value of an attribute, the eell and its contents are saved in an array.
  After unification, all the effects of the operation can be undone by restoring the saved values.
  I) PATI{ takes advantage of this option in the following way.
  parser tries to extend A(B): C to A" by unifying C with C", the operation is applied directly to the two feature sets without them being copied in advance.
  If the unification fails, its effects are simply cancelled by restoring the original feature sets from the save array.
  If the operation succeeds
