hich is systematically constructed from an English dictionary (LDOCE).
    The similarity (TOD, w') E [0,1] between words to, w' is computed in the following way: (1) produce an activated pattern by activating the node w; (2) observe activity of the node w1 in the activated pattern.
    The following examples suggest the feature of the similarity cr: pet) = 0.133722 , hat) = 0.001784 , restaurant) = 0.175699 , restaurant) = 0.006260 .
    The similarity a- depends on the significance s(w) E [0, 1], i.e. normalized information of the word w in West's corpus (1953).
    For example: The following examples show the relationship between the word significance and the similarity:
  
  
    LCP of the text T = {w1,&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;, wN} is a sequence {c(Si),&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;, c(SN)} of lexical cohesiveness c(Si).
    Si is the word list which can be seen through a fixedwidth window centered on the i-th word of T: LCP treats the text T as a word list without any punctuation or paragraph boundaries.
