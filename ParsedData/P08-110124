ord segmentation and POS tagging systems in the literature, our proposed model achieved the best accuracy boost from the cascaded baseline, and competent overall accuracy.
  
  
    We proposed a joint Chinese word segmentation and POS tagging model, which achieved a considerable reduction in error rate compared to a baseline twostage system.
    We used a single linear model for combined word segmentation and POS tagging, and chose the generalized perceptron algorithm for joint training. and beam search for efficient decoding.
    However, the application of beam search was far from trivial because of the size of the combined search space.
    Motivated by the question of what are the comparable partial hypotheses in the space, we developed a novel multiple beam search decoder which effectively explores the large search space.
    Similar techniques can potentially be applied to other problems involving joint inference in NLP.
    Other choices are available for the decoding of a joint linear model, such as
