meaning of linguistic sequences.
    For example, assuming that individual words are represented by vectors, we can compute the meaning of a sentence by taking their mean (Foltz et al., 1998; Landauer and Dumais, 1997).
    Vector addition does not increase the dimensionality of the resulting vector.
    However, since it is order independent, it cannot capture meaning differences that are modulated by differences in syntactic structure.
    Kintsch (2001) proposes a variation on the vector addition theme in an attempt to model how the meaning of a predicate (e.g., run) varies depending on the arguments it operates upon (e.g, the horse ran vs. the color ran).
    The idea is to add not only the vectors representing the predicate and its argument but also the neighbors associated with both of them.
    The neighbors, Kintsch argues, can &#8216;strengthen features of the predicate that are appropriate for the argument of the predication&#8217;. animal stable village gallop jokey horse 0 6 2 10 4 run 1 8 4 4 0 U
