    First, we hypothesized that words might be distributionally similar because they share pragmatic usages, such as expressing subjectivity, even if they are not close synonyms.
    Second, as shown above, low-frequency words appear more often in subjective texts than expected.
    We did not want to discard all low-frequency words from consideration but cannot effectively judge the suitability of individual words.
