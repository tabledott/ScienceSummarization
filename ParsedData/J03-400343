could be a purpose clause modifying called) (Ann Taylor, personal communication, 1997). the distance features in the model.
    In section 7.3 we examine how the model interacts with the Penn Treebank style of annotation.
    Finally, in section 7.4 we discuss the need to break down context-free rules in the treebank in such a way that the model will generalize to give nonzero probability to rules not seen in training.
    In each case we use three methods of analysis.
    First, we consider how various aspects of the model affect parsing performance, through accuracy measurements on the treebank.
    Second, we look at the frequency of different constructions in the treebank.
    Third, we consider linguistically motivated examples as a way of justifying various modeling choices.
    In this section we look more closely at the parser, by evaluating its performance on specific constituents or constructions.
    The intention is to get a better idea of the parser&#8217;s strengths and weaknesses.
    First, Ta
