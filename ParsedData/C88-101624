arrangement of the words o1" the generated English locutions into an appropriate sequence.
  To see whcther this can be douc statistically, we explored what would happen in the ilnpossibly optimistic case where the words generated in (2) were exactly those of the l inglish sczttencc (only their order would be unknown): From a large f+uglish corpus we derived estimates of tr igram probabilities, P(e3let, e:~), that the word el follows immediately the sequencc pair e~, % A model of 13,nglish sentence production based on a trigram estimate would conclude that a sentence e~, ca, ..J e,, is generated with probabil ity P(el, e2) P(e3 Iet, e2) P(e41 e2, e3) ..- P(e,, I e,,+ 2, e, I) (6.1) We then rook other l:;nglish sentences (not included in the training COrlmS) and deterntined which of the n t different arrangements el + their n words was most likely, using the lormula (6.1).
  We found that in 63% of sentences of 10 words or less, the most likely arrangement was the original English sentence.
