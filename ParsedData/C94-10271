  A part-of-speech tagger is a system which automat- ically assigns the part of speech to words using con- textual information.
  Potential applications for part- of-speech taggers exist in many areas inclnding speech recognition, speech synthesis, machine translation and information retrieval.
  l)ifiereut methods have been used for the im plemen- ration of part-of-speech taggers.
  TAGGIT (Greene, Rnbin, 1971), an early system, which was used for the initial tagging of the Brown corpus was rule-based.
  It was able to assign the correct part-of-speech to about 77 % of the words in the Brown corpus.
  In another approach contextual dependencies are modelled statistically.
  Churcb (1988) and Kempe (1993) use second order Markov Models and train their systems on large handtagged corpora.
  Using this metbod, they are able to tag more than 96 % of their test words with the correct part-of-speech.
  The need for reliably tagged training data, however, is a prob- lem for lang
