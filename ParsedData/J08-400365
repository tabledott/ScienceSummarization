rsers, on the other.11 For label accuracy (LA), finally, the most noteworthy result is that the strictly projective parsers consistently outperform their pseudo-projective counterparts, although the difference is statistically significant only for the projective, list-based parser.
    This can be explained by the fact that the pseudo-projective parsing technique increases the number of distinct dependency labels, using labels to distinguish not only between different syntactic functions but also between &#8220;lifted&#8221; and &#8220;unlifted&#8221; arcs.
    It is therefore understandable that the pseudo-projective parsers suffer a drop in pure labeling accuracy.
    Despite the very similar performance of all parsers on average over all languages, there are interesting differences for individual languages and groups of languages.
    These differences concern the impact of non-projective, pseudo-projective, and strictly projective parsing, on the one hand, and the effect of adopting an arc-eager or an arc
