antics of verb and preposition combinations was first proposed by Hawkins (2000), and applied to VPCs by Lohse et al. (in preparation).
    In an attempt to normalise the annotators&#8217; entailment judgements, we decided upon an experimental setup where the subject is, for each VPC type, presented with a fixed selection of sentential contexts for that VPC.
    So as to avoid introducing any bias into the experiment through artificially-generated sentences, we chose to extract the sentences from naturallyoccurring text, namely the written component of the British National Corpus (BNC, Burnard (2000)).
    Extraction of the VPCs was based on the method of Baldwin and Villavicencio (2002).
    First, we used a POS tagger and chunker (both built using fnTBL 1.0 (Ngai and Florian, 2001)) to (re)tag the BNC.
    This allowed us to extract VPC tokens through use of: (a) the particle POS in the POS tagged output, for each instance of which we simply then look for the rightmost verb within a fixed window to the left
