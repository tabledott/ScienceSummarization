ed to ignore all words that occur less than five times.
    If appropriate objective functions and predictive value functions can be found for these other tasks, then the method in this paper might be applied to them.
    There has been some research into matching compositional phrases across bitexts.
    For example, Kupiec (1993) presented a method for finding translations of whole noun phrases.
    Wu (1995) showed how to use an existing translation lexicon to populate a database of &amp;quot;phrasal correspondences&amp;quot; for use in example-based MT.
    These compositional translation patterns enable more sophisticated approaches to MT.
    However, they are only useful if they can be discovered reliably and efficiently.
    Their time may come when we have a better understanding of how to model the human translation process.
  
  
    It is well known that two languages are more informative than one (Dagan et at., 1991).
    I have argued that texts in two languages are not only preferable but necess
