    Once slots are initialized as above, our algorithm uses an iteratively updated probability model for role labelling.
    The probability model predicts the role for a slot given certain conditioning information.
    We use a backoff approach with three levels of specificity of probabilities.
    If a candidate role fails to meet the threshold of evidence (counts towards that probability) for a given level, we backoff to the next level.
    For any given slot, we use the most specific level that reaches the evidence threshold for any of the candidates.
    We only use information at a single level to compare candidates for a single slot.
    We assume the probability of a role for a slot is independent of other slots; we do not ensure a consistent role assignment across an instance of a verb.
    Our most specific probability uses the exact combination of verb, slot, and noun filling that slot, yielding .2 2We use only the head noun of potential arguments, not the full N
