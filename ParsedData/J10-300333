ral new, potentially paraphrastic, English candidate patterns are then induced by replacing each of the English words with its synonyms in WordNet, one at a time.
    The figure shows the list of induced patterns for the given example.
    Next, each of the English words in each candidate pattern is translated to Chinese, via a bilingual dictionary.6 Using Chinese translations as the distributional elements to extract a set of English paraphrastic patterns from a large English corpus.
    Given that the bilingual dictionary may contain multiple Chinese translations for a given English word, several Chinese patterns may be created for each English candidate pattern.
    Each Chinese pattern is assigned a probability value via a simple bag-of-words translation model (built from a small bilingual corpus) and a language model (trained on a Chinese collocation database); all translated patterns, along with their probability values, are then considered to be features of the particular English candidate pattern.
