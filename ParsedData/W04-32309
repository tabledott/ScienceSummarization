ed to long path.
    Even if the transition probability of each token is small, the total probability of the path will be amplified when the path is short 2:(b)).
    Length bias occurs in Japanese morphological analysis because the number of output tokens y varies by use of prior lexicons.
    Uchimoto et al. attempted a variant of MEMMs for Japanese morphological analysis with a number of features including suffixes and character types (Uchimoto et al., 2001; Uchimoto et al., 2002; Uchimoto et al., 2003).
    Although the performance of unknown words were improved, that of known words degraded due to the label and length bias.
    Wrong segmentation had been reported in sentences which are analyzed correctly by naive rule-based or HMMs-based analyzers.
  
  
    Conditional random fields (CRFs) (Lafferty et al., 2001) overcome the problems described in Section 2.2.
    CRFs are discriminative models and can thus capture many correlated features of the inputs.
    This allows flexible feature designs for hie
