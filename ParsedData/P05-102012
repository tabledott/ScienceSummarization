creation methods discussed above.
    With three learners, three training instance creation methods, two feature sets, and three clustering algorithms, we can produce 54 coreference systems in total.
    We train an SVM-based ranker for ranking candidate partitions by means of Joachims&#8217; (2002) SVM package, with all the parameters set to their default values.
    To create training data, we first generate 54 candidate partitions for each text in the held-out subset as described above and then convert each partition into a training instance consisting of a set of partition-based features and method-based features.
    Partition-based features are used to characterize a candidate partition and can be derived directly from the partition itself.
    Following previous work on using global features of candidate structures to learn a ranking model (Collins, 2002), the global (i.e., partition-based) features we consider here are simple functions of the local features that capture the relationship between NP pai
