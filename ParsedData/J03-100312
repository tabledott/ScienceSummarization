ional descriptions (descriptions that include references to other objects to single out the target object from its distractors).
    To illustrate the problem, consider the scene depicted in Figure 2.
    In this scene we again see a finite domain of entities D with certain properties P. Here, D = {d1, d2, d3, d4} is the set of entities, and P = { dog, doghouse, small, large, brown, white } is the set of properties.
    Clearly no algorithm can generate a distinguishing description referring to d1 on this basis.
    Intuitively, d1 can be distinguished from d2 only using its relation to the doghouse d3.
    To facilitate this we extend the scene description with a set of relations R = { left of, right of, contain, in }.
    A few algorithms have been developed that address the issue of relational descriptions.
    The earliest is from Dale and Haddock (1992), who offer an extension of the full brevity algorithm.
    The Dale and Haddock algorithm has a problem with infinite recursions; it may produce descript
