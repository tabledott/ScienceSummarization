ach element forms its own cluster.
			An example of the second approach evaluates the clusters by using them to smooth probability distributions (Lee and Pereira 1999).
			Like the entropy scheme, we assume that there is an answer key that defines how the elements are supposed to be clustered.
			Let C be a set of clusters and A be the answer key.
			We define the editing distance, dist(C, A), as the number of operations required to make C consistent with A. We say that C is consistent with A if there is a one to one mapping between clusters in C and the classes in A such that for each cluster c in C, all elements of c belong to the same class in A. We allow two editing operations: ? merge two clusters; and ? move an element from one cluster to another.
			Let B be the baseline clustering where each element is its own cluster.
			We define the quality of a set of clusters C as follows: ( ) ( )ABdist ACdist , ,1?
			Suppose the goal is to construct a clustering consistent with the answer key.
