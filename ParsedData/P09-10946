the following stages.
    Paraphrase planning (Section 3.3) aims to select the units to be paraphrased (called source units henceforth) in an input sentence and the candidate paraphrases for the source units (called target units) from multiple resources according to the given application A.
    Paraphrase generation (Section 3.4) is designed to generate paraphrases for the input sentences by selecting the optimal target units with a statistical model.
    In this work, the multiple paraphrase resources are stored in paraphrase tables (PTs).
    A paraphrase table is similar to a phrase table in SMT, which contains fine-grained paraphrases, such as paraphrase phrases, patterns, or collocations.
    The PTs used in this work are constructed using different corpora and different score functions (Section 3.5).
    If the applications are not considered, all units of an input sentence that can be paraphrased using the PTs will be extracted as source units.
    Accordingly, all paraphrases for the source units will
