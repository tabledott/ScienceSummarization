h 88% accuracy on full morphological and 92% accuracy for POS tagging and word segmentation, for the Morph+Linear initial conditions.
    As expected, EM-HMM improves results (from 80% to 88%).
    Strikingly, EM-HMM improves the uniform initial conditions from 64% to above 85%.
    However, better initial conditions bring us much over this particular local maximum &#8211; with an error reduction of 20%.
    In all cases, the main improvement over the uniform baseline is brought by the morphology-based initial conditions.
    When applied on its own, the linear context brings modest improvement.
    But the combination of the paradigmatic morphology-based method with the linear context improves all measures.
    A most interesting observation is the detrimental contribution of the syntagmatic constraints we introduced.
    We found that 113,453 sentences of the corpus (about 5%) contradict these basic and apparently simple constraints.
    As an alternative to these common-sense constraints, we tried to use a
