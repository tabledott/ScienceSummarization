  There are two apparent possible approaches to a resolution of this problem.
  We might use a logic in vchich logical equivalence classes of expressions are all trivial, that is, any two distinct expressions mean something diiferent.
  In such a logic, there are no artifactual syn- tactic remnants in the syntax of the logical anguage.
  Furthermore, expressions ofthe logic must be relatable to expressions of the natural language with a reversible grammar.
  Alternatively, we could use a logic for which canonical forms, corresponding exactly to the natural language graramars logical forms, do exist.
  The difference between the two approaches is only an apparent one, for in the latter case the equivalence classes of logical forms can be identified as h)gical forms of a new logical anguage with no artifactual distinctlons.
  Thus, the second case reduces to the first.
  The central problem in either case, then~ is discovery of a logical language which exactly and uniquely represents all the meaning distinction
