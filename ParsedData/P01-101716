o make much difference, certainly compared to the boost trigram models get by, in effect, recognizing the complete name.
    It is interesting to note, however, that virtually all linguists believe that a noun-phrase like &#8220;monday night football&#8221; has significant substructure &#8212; e.g., it would look something like Figure 2.
    If we assume this tree-structure the two heads above &#8220;monday&#8221; are &#8220;night&#8221; and &#8220;football&#8221; respectively, thus giving our trihead model the same power as the trigram for this case.
    Ignoring some of the conditioning events, we now get a probability p(h = monday I i = night, j = football), which is much higher than the corresponding bihead version p(h = monday I i = football).
    The reader may remember that h is the head of the current constituent, while i is the head of its parent.
    We now define j to be the grandparent head.
    We decided to adopt this structure, but to keep things simple we only changed the definition of &#8220;
