models such as (Tillman, 2004) have no means of identifying that such a displacement is a swap (S).
			Accord ing to these models, the orientation of in the futurewith respect to what comes previously is discontinuous (D), which is an uninformative fall-back category.
			By identifying h2 (hold ... issue) as a hierarchical block, the hierarchical model can properly deter mine that the block in the near future should have a swap orientation.5 Similar observations can be made regarding blocks h1 and h3, which leads our model to predict either monotone orientation (between h3and ?to?
			and between h3 and ?.?)
			or swap orienta tion (between h1 and with Iran) while local models would predict discontinuous in all cases.
			Another benefit of the hierarchical model is thatits representation of phrases remains the same dur ing both training and decoding, which is not the casefor word-based and phrase-based reordering mod els.
			The deficiency of these local models lies in thefact that blocks handled by phrase-bas
