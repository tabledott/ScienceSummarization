models use a few universal types of features, while others are language-specific.
    Let us note again that, while some types of features only apply to one language, the models have the same basic structure, treating the problem as an abstract classification task.
    The following is a list of the features that are shared across languages ( is considered by default the current token): tokens4 in a window of : ; the part-of-speech associated with token dictionary information (whether the current token is part of a large collection of dictionaries - one boolean value for each dictionary) the output of named mention detectors trained on different style of entities. the previously assigned classification tags5.
    The following sections describe in detail the languagespecific features, and Table 1 summarizes the feature types used in building the models in the three languages.
    Finally, the experiments in Section 4 detail the performance obtained by using selected combinations of feature subsets.
