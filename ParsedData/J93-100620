hat was previously unthinkable.
    Alignment makes possible approaches to partially, or completely, automatic translation based on a large corpus of previous translations that have been deemed acceptable.
    Perhaps the best-known example of this approach is to be found in Sato and Nagao (199W.
    The method proposed there requires a database to be maintained of the syntactic structures of sentences together with the structures of the corresponding translations.
    This database is searched in the course of making a new translation for examples of previous sentences that are like the current one in ways that are relevant for the method.
    Another example is the completely automatic, statistical approach to translation taken by the research group at IBM (Brown et al. 1990), which takes a large corpus of text with aligned translations as its point of departure.
    It is widely recognized that one of the most important sources of information to which a translator can have access is a large body of previou
