ne of the original coding developers, who had not done much coding, move coded a Map Task dialogue from written instructions only, using just the transcript and not the speech source.
    Agreement on move classification was K = .69 (N = 139, k = 4).
    Leaving the coding developer out of the coder pool did not change the results (K = .67, k = 3), suggesting that the instructions conveyed his intentions fairly well.
    The coding developer matched the official Map Task coding almost entirely.
    One coder never used the CHECK move; when that coder was removed from the pool, K = .73 (k = 3).
    When CHECK and QUERY-YN were conflated, agreement was K = .77 (k =-4).
    Agreement on whether a move was an initiation, response, or ready type was good (K = .84).
    Surprisingly, non-HCRC coders appeared to be able to distinguish the CLARIFY move better than in-house coders.
    This amount of agreement seems acceptable given that this was a first coding attempt for most of these coders and was probably done qu
