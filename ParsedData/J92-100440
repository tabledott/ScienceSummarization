    For instance, a reflexive pronoun nearly always refers back to the CURRENT-FOCUS, whereas a nonreflexive form never does, unless it is in the nominative case.
    2.5.2 Semantic Filtering.
    In the more recent versions of the grammar, we have implemented a number of semantic constraints using procedures very similar to those used for syntactic constraints.
    We found it effective to filter on the CURRENT-FOCUS'S semantic category, as well as to constrain absorbers in the gap mechanism to require a match on semantics before they could accept a FLOAT-OBJECT.
    Semantic categories were Parse tree for the sentence, &amp;quot;What street is the Hyatt on?&amp;quot; implemented in a hierarchy such that, for example, RESTAURANT automatically inherits the more general properties BUILDING and PLACE.
    We also introduced semantically loaded categories at the low levels of the parse tree.
    It seems that, as in syntax, there is a trade-off between the number of unique node-types and the number of constr
