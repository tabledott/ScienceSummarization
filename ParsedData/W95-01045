 was not the focus of the work reported here, we simply took (most of) our confusion sets from the list of &amp;quot;Words Commonly Confused&amp;quot; in the back of the Random House unabridged dictionary [Flexner, 19831.
    A final point concerns the two types of errors a spelling-correction program can make: false negatives (complaining about a correct word), and false positives (failing to notice an error).
    We will make the simplifying assumption that both kinds of errors are equally bad.
    In practice, however, false negatives are much worse, as users get irritated by programs that badger them with bogus complaints.
    However, given the probabilistic nature of the methods that will be presented below, it would not be hard to modify them to take this into account.
    We would merely set a confidence threshold, and report a suggested correction only if the probability of the suggested word exceeds the probability of the user's original spelling by at least the threshold amount.
    The reason this
