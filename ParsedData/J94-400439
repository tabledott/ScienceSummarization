hat it does not alter the positions used in the ~?T4 mapping, but it changes the nature of the relation between the different positions (i.e., the "4=~" correspondence).
  Figure 9d characterizes the alteration that takes place.
  Note that the mapping of Z to the corresponding internal argument position is altered so that it is positioned under the constituent that corresponds to W. An example of structural divergence is the case given earlier in (4).
  The syntactic structures and corresponding CLCS are shown here: (23) [C-MAX [I-MAX IN-MAX John] IV-MAX IV entered] [N-MAX the house]]]] [Event GOLoc ([Thing JOHN], [Path TOcoc ([Position INcoc ([Thing JOHN], [Location HOUSE])])])] [C-MAX [I-MAX IN-MAX Juan] [V-MAX IV entr6] [P-MAX en [N-MAX la casa]]]]] Here the verbal object is realized as a noun phrase (the house) in English and as a prepositional phrase (en la casa) in Spanish.
  Structural divergence is resolved by means of the * marker, which forces logical constituents obe realized compositionally atdif
