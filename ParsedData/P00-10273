    Thus, while this paper will discuss our implementation of a stand-alone probabilistic analyzer and retraining process in Steps 2 and 3, the challenge of large-coverage inflection-root alignment expressed in Step 1 is the core of this work.
    In further clarification of the task description, the morphological induction described in this paper assumes, and is based on, only the following limited set of (often optional) available resources: (a) A table (such as Table 2) of the inflectional parts of speech of the given language, along with a list of the canonical suffixes for each part of speech.
    These suffixes not only serve as mnemonic tags for the POS labels, but they can also be used to obtain a noisy set of candidate examples for each part of speech.' the given language is useful to the extraction of context similarity features.
    (f) If available, the various distance/similarity tables generated by this algorithm on previously studied languages can be useful as seed information, especially if
