c penalizes false negatives more heavily than false positives, overpenalizes near misses, and is affected by variation in segment size distribution.
    We propose a simple modification to the Pk metric that remedies these problems.
    This new metric&#8212;called WindowDiff&#8212;moves a fixed-sized window across the text and penalizes the algorithm whenever the number of boundaries within the window does not match the true number of boundaries for that window of text.
  
  
    Text segmentation is the task of determining the positions at which topics change in a stream of text.
    Interest in automatic text segmentation has blossomed over the last few years, with applications ranging from information retrieval to text summarization to story segmentation of video feeds.
    Early work in multiparagraph discourse segmentation examined the problem of subdividing texts into multiparagraph units that represent passages or subtopics.
    An example, drawn from Hearst (1997), is a 21paragraph science news artic
