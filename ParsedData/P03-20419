    The one exception is the synchronous DOP approach of (Poutsma, 2000), which obtains an STSG by decomposing aligned training trees in all possible ways (and using &#8220;naive&#8221; count-based probability estimates).
    However, we would like to estimate a model from unaligned data.
  
  
    For expository reasons (and to fill a gap in the literature), first we formally present non-synchronous TSG.
    Let Q be a set of states.
    Let L be a set of labels that may decorate nodes or edges.
    Node labels might be words or nonterminals.
    Edge labels might include grammatical roles such as Subject.
    In many trees, each node&#8217;s children have an order, recorded in labels on the node&#8217;s outgoing edges.
    An elementary tree is a a tuple (V, V i, E, `, q, s) where V is a set of nodes; V i C_ V is the set of internal nodes, and we write V f = V &#8722; V i for the set of frontier nodes; E C_ V i x V is a set of directed edges (thus all frontier nodes are leaves).
    The graph (V, E) mu
