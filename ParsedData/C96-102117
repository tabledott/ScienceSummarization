sible antecedents.
			If more than one possible antecedent is located for a lexical anaphor, the one with the highest salience weight is determined to be the actual antecedent.
			Once an antecedent has been located, the anaphor is added to the COREF class associated with the antecedent, and the salience of the COREF class is recalculatec~ accordingly.
			The final step is the interpretation f pronouns.
			The basic resolution heuristic, as noted above, is quite sim- ple: generate a set of candidate antecedents, then es- tablish coreference with the candidate which has the greatest salience weight (in the event of a tie, the clos- est candidateis chosen).
			In order to generate the candi- date set, however, those discourse referents with which 115 a pronoun cannot refer must be eliminated from consid- eration.
			This is accomplished by running the overall candidate pool (the set of interpreted iscourse ref- erents whose salience values exceed an arbitrarily set threshold) through two sets of filters: a set
