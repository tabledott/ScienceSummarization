tional random fields (CRFs) are undirected graphical models trained to maximize a conditional probability (Lafferty et al., 2001).
    A common special-case graph structure is a linear chain, which corresponds to a finite state machine, and is suitable for sequence labeling.
    A linear-chain CRF with parameters A = {A,...} defines a conditional probability for a state (or label1) sequence y = y1...yT given an input sequence x = x1...xT to be where ZX is the normalization constant that makes the probability of all state sequences sum to one, fk(yt&#8722;1, yt, x, t) is a feature function which is often binary-valued, but can be real-valued, and Ak is a learned weight associated with feature fk.
    The feature functions can measure any aspect of a state transition, yt&#8722;1 &#8594; yt, and the observation sequence, x, centered at the current time step, t. For example, one feature function might have value 1 when yt&#8722;1 is the state TITLE, yt is the state AUTHOR, and xt is a word appearing in a lexicon
