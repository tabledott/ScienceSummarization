ched sentence pairs This step updates the bilingual lexicon according to the intermediate results of parallel sentence extraction.
    New bilingual word pairs are learned from the extracted sentence pairs based on an EM learning method.
    We use the GIZA++ (Och and Ney, 2000) implementation of the IBM statistical translation lexicon Model 4 (Brown et al., 1993) for this purpose.
    This model is based on the conditional probability of a source word being generated by the target word in the other language, based on EM estimation from aligned sentences.
    Zhao and Vogel (2002) showed that this model lends itself to adaptation and can provide better vocabulary coverage and better sentence alignment probability estimation.
    In our work, we use this model on the intermediate results of parallel sentence extraction, i.e. on a set of aligned sentence pairs that may or may not truly correspond to each other.
    We found that sentence pairs with high alignment scores are not necessarily more similar than oth
