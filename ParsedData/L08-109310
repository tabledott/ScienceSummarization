e of temporal mutual information to detect the peak.
			In Figure 6, we compare the two methods to detect the events in weblogs.
			The relative change of temporal mutual information achieves better performance than the change of temporal mutual information.
			1 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/May_2006 Table 1 and Table 2 list the top 20 collocations based on these two approaches, respectively.
			The results of the first approach show that some collocations are related to the feelings such as ?fell left?
			and time such as ?Saturday night?.
			In contrast, the results of the second approach show more interesting collocations related to the news events at that time, such as terrorists ?zacarias moussaoui?
			and ?paramod mahajan.?
			These two persons were killed in May 3.
			Besides, ?Geena Davis?
			got the golden award in May 3.
			That explains why the collocations detected by relative change of temporal mutual information are better than those detected by change of temporal mutual information.
