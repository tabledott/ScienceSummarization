ping which collapses L&#8217;s non-NONE values into ARG.
    5 The regular expressions look for phrases containing pronouns with part-of-speech tags WDT, WRB, WP, or WP$ (Xavier Carreras, personal communication).
    Then, like the Gildea and Jurafsky (2002) system, we decompose the probability of a labeling L into probabilities according to an identification model PID and a classification model PCLS.
    This decomposition does not encode any independence assumptions, but is a useful way of thinking about the problem.
    Our local models for semantic role labeling use this decomposition.
    We use the same features for local identification and classification models, but use the decomposition for efficiency of training.
    The identification models are trained to classify each node in a parse tree as ARG or NONE, and the classification models are trained to label each argument node in the training set with its specific label.
    In this way the training set for the classification models is smaller.
