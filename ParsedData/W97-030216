es not examine states that were deemed unlikely by the first pass.
    The extra time of running two passes is more than made up for by the time saved in the second pass.
    The mathematics of multiple-pass recognition is fairly simple.
    In the first simple pass, we record the forward probabilities, oi(S1), and backward probabilities, /3(51), of each state i at each time t. Now, a(s: xo(sn gives the overall probability of being in state i at time t given the acoustics.
    Our second pass will use an HMM whose states are analogous to the first pass HMM's states.
    If a first pass state at some time is unlikely, then the analogous second pass state is probably also unlikely, so we can threshold it out.
    There are a few complications to multiple-pass recognition.
    First, storing all the forward and backward probabilities can be expensive.
    Second, the second pass is more complicated than the first, typically meaning that it has more states.
    So the mapping between states in the first pass and
