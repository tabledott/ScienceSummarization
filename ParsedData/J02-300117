tish National Corpus includes automatically assigned syntactic part-of-speech tags for each word but does not include full syntactic parses.
    The FrameNet annotators did not make use of, or produce, a complete syntactic parse of the annotated sentences, although some syntactic information is provided by the grammatical function and phrase type tags of the annotated frame elements.
    The preliminary version of the FrameNet corpus used for our experiments contained 67 frame types from 12 general semantic domains chosen for annotation.
    A complete list of the semantic domains represented in our data is shown in Table 1, along with representative frames and predicates.
    Within these frames, examples of a total of 1,462 distinct lexical predicates, or target words, were annotated: 927 verbs, 339 nouns, and 175 adjectives.
    There are a total of 49,013 annotated sentences and 99,232 annotated frame elements (which do not include the target words themselves).
