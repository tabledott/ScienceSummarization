ction of Bod (2001) obtains state-of-the-art results on the WSJ, comparable to Charniak (2000), Bonnema et al. 's estimator performs worse and is comparable to Collins (1996).
    As to the processing time, the PCFG reduction parses each sentence 100 words) in 3.6 seconds average, while the parser in Bod (2001, 2003), which uses over 5 million subtrees, is reported to take about 220 seconds per sentence.
    This corresponds to a speedup of over 60 times.
    It should be mentioned that the best precision and recall scores reported in Bod (2001) are slightly better than the ones reported here (the difference is only 0.2% for sentences 100 words).
    This may be explained by the fact our best results in Bod (2001) were obtained by testing various subtree restrictions until the highest accuracy was obtained, while in the current experiment we used all subtrees as given by the PCFG-reduction.
    In the following section first results of SL-DOP and LS-DOP with a compact PCFG-reduction. we will see that our new
