et and gives a Z score.
    We use one-tailed tests because we predict the direction of the relationship.
    For all the scores using the automatic thesaurus, we assume that the larger the value, the more compositional the item.
    For the statistics (commonly used for multiword extraction) the relationship is in the other direction: high values are indicative of a non-compositional reading.
    We change the log-likelihood statistic to add a sign where the joint frequency of particle and verb is smaller than anticipated from that expected.
    From these results we can see that some of the measures from the automatic thesaurus correlate significantly with the human compositionality judgements and that these correlations are slightly stronger than those of any of the statistics used.
    The statistics used all correlate (in the other direction) with the human compositionality judgements, although this is slightly less so for the log-likelihood ratio.
    The frequency of the verb and particle seems to bear
