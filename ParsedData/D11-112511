e balance, we consider both possible difference vectors from a pair.
    For example, given the candidate space of Figure 1, since g(1,1) &gt; g(1, 3), we would add ([&#8722;4, 3], +) and ([4, &#8722;3], &#8722;) to our training set.
    We can then feed this training data directly to any off-the-shelf classification tool that returns a linear classifier, in order to obtain a weight vector w that optimizes the above condition.
    This weight vector can then be used directly by the MT system in the subsequent candidate generation phase.
    The exact loss function ls,(Hw, G) optimized depends on the choice of classifier.4 Typical approaches to pairwise ranking enumerate all difference vectors as training data.
    For tuning however, this means O(|I |&#8727; J2max) vectors, where Jmax is the cardinality of the largest J(i).
    Since I and Jmax commonly range in the thousands, a full enumeration would produce billions of feature vectors.
    Out of tractability considerations, we sample from the space of diff
