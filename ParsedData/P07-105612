 predictive features from the target domain do not appear in the source domain.
    To show how SCL deals with those domain mismatches, we look at the adaptation from book reviews to reviews of kitchen appliances.
    We selected the top 1000 most informative features in both domains.
    In both cases, between 85 and 90% of the informative features from one domain were not among the most informative of the other domain4.
    SCL addresses both of these issues simultaneously by aligning features from the two domains.
    Table 2 illustrates one row of the projection matrix 0 for adapting from books to kitchen appliances; the features on each row appear only in the corresponding domain.
    A supervised classifier trained on book reviews cannot assign weight to the kitchen features in the second row of table 2.
    In contrast, SCL assigns weight to these features indirectly through the projection matrix.
    When we observe the feature &#8220;predictable&#8221; with a negative book review, we update parameter
