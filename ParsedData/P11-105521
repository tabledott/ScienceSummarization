    Table 1 presents this approximate precision and recall for MULTIR on each of the relations, along with statistics we computed to measure the quality of the weak supervision.
    Precision is high for the majority of relations but recall is consistently lower.
    We also see that the Freebase matches are highly skewed in quantity and can be low quality for some relations, with very few of them actually corresponding to true extractions.
    The approach generally performs best on the relations with a sufficiently large number of true matches, in many cases even achieving precision that outperforms the accuracy of the heuristic matches, at reasonable recall levels.
    Table 1 also highlights some of the effects of learning with overlapping relations.
    For example, in the data, almost all of the matches for the administrative divisions relation overlap with the contains relation, because they both model relationships for a pair of locations.
