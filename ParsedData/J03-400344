ble 3 has a breakdown of precision and recall by constituent type.
    Although somewhat useful in understanding parser performance, a breakdown of accuracy by constituent type fails to capture the idea of attachment accuracy.
    For this reason we also evaluate the parser&#8217;s precision and recall in recovering dependencies between words.
    This gives a better indication of the accuracy on different kinds of attachments.
    A dependency is defined as a triple with the following elements (see Figure 12 for an example tree and its associated dependencies): Recall and precision for different constituent types, for section 0 of the treebank with model 2.
    Label is the nonterminal label; Proportion is the percentage of constituents in the treebank section 0 that have this label; Count is the number of constituents that have this label.

    Note that in &#8220;normalizing&#8221; dependencies, all POS tags are replaced with TAG, and the NP-C parent in the fifth
