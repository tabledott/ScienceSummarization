lements over which exposure has clearest effect.
    Gibson and Pearlmutter identify it as an &#8220;outstanding question&#8221; whether or not phrase structure statistics are necessary to explain performance effects in sentence comprehension: Are phrase-level contingent frequency constraints necessary to explain comprehension performance, or are the remaining types of constraints sufficient.
    If phraselevel contingent frequency constraints are necessary, can they subsume the effects of other constraints (e.g. locality) ?
    (Gibson and Pearlmutter, 1998, page 13) Equally, formal work in linguistics has demonstrated the inadequacy of context-free grammars as an appropriate model for natural language in the general case (Shieber, 1985).
    To address this criticism, the same prefix probabilities could be computing using tree-adjoining grammars (Nederhof et al., 1998).
    With context-free grammars serving as the implicit backdrop for much work in human sentence processing, as well as linguistics2 simplic
