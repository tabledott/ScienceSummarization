 Likewise, the input to the third pass consists of K of the best distinct chunk and POS tag assignments for the input sentence.
    The top K BFS described above exploits the observed property that the individual steps of correct derivations tend to have high probabilities, and thus avoids searching a large fraction of the search space.
    Since, in practice, it only does a constant amount of work to advance each step in a derivation, and since derivation lengths are roughly proportional to the 'The parameters K,M, and Q were optimized on &amp;quot;held out&amp;quot; data separate from the training and test sets. if cp(b) = true /kik a = a' advance: dxV&#8212;+di... /* Applies relevant tree building procedure to d and returns list of new derivations whose action probabilities pass the threshold Q */ insert: dxh&#8212;+ void /* inserts d in heap h */ extract: h d /* removes and returns derivation in h with highest score */ completed: d&#8212;&gt; {true,false} /* returns true if and only if d is a complete der
