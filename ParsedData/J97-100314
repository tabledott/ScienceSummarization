and Buckley (1993) and Moffat et al. (1994) suggest that it is the nature of the intermediate size of the passages that matters.
    Perhaps a more appropriate use of motivated segment information is in the display of information to the user.
    One obvious way to use segmentation information is to have the system display the passages with the closest similarity to the query, and to display a passage-based summary of the documents' contents.
    As a more elaborate example of using segmentation in full-text information access, I have used the results of TextTiling in a new paradigm for display of retrieval results (Hearst 1995).
    This approach, called TileBars, allows the user to make informed decisions about which documents and which passages of those documents to view, based on the distributional behavior of the query terms in the documents.
    TileBars allows users to specify different sets of query terms, as discussed later.
    The goal is to simultaneously and compactly indicate: TextTiling is used
