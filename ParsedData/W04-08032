automating frame semantics, specifically identifying and labeling semantic roles in sentences.
    An important baseline study of this process has recently appeared in the literature (Gildea and Jurafsky, 2002).
    The FrameNet project (Johnson et al., 2003) has put together a body of hand-labeled data and the Gildea and Jurafsky study has put together a set of suitable metrics for evaluating the performance of an automatic system.
  
  
    This Senseval-3 task calls for the development of systems to meet the same objectives as the Gildea and Jurafsky study.
    The data for this task is a sample of the FrameNet hand-annotated data.
    Evaluation of systems is measured using precision and recall of frame elements and overlap of a system&#8217;s frame element sentence positions with those identified in the FrameNet data.
    The basic task for Senseval-3 is: Given a sentence, a target word and its frame, identify the frame elements within that sentence and tag them with the appropriate frame element name.
