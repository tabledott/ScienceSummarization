 adjunction relate two lexical items.
    It is therefore natural to interpret these operations as establishing a direct linguistic relation between the two lexical items, namely a relation of complementation (predicateargument relation) or of modification.
    In purely CFG-based approaches, these relations are only implicit.
    However, they represent important linguistic intuition, they provide a uniform interface to semantics, and they are, as Schabes &amp; Shieber (1994) argue, important in order to support statistical parameters in stochastic frameworks and appropriate constraints in many frameworks, complementation and modification are in fact made &amp; Kaplan, 1982) provides a separate functional (f-) structure, and dependency grammars (see e.g.
    Mel'euk (1988)) use these notions as the principal basis for syntactic representation.
    We will follow the dependency literature in referring to complementation and modification as syntactic dependency.
