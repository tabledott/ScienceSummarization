lified by the use of a coarse-grained sense inventory.
    For the purposes of this work, therefore, we focused on the second evaluation scheme.
    Here, most of the participating systems outperformed the most-frequent-sense baseline, and the rest obtained only slightly lower scores.
    Feature Space Our experiments used a feature set designed to capture both immediate local context, wider context and syntactic context.
    Specifically, we experimented with six feature categories: &#177;10-word window (10w), &#177;5-word window (5w), collocations (1w), word n-grams (ng), part-ofspeech n-grams (pg) and dependency relations (dp).
    These features have been widely adopted in various WSD algorithms (see Lee and Ng 2002 for a detailed evaluation).
    In all cases, we use the lemmatized version of the word(s).
    The Semeval workshop organizers provided a small amount of context for each instance (usually a sentence or two surrounding the sentence containing the target word).
    This context, as well as the
