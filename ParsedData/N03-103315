7 We present the results of three classes of experiments: experiments with directionality, experiments with lexicalization, and experiments with smoothing.
    In this section, we report experiments using log-linear CMMs to populate nets with various structures, exploring the relative value of neighboring words&#8217; tags.
    Table 2 lists the discussed networks.
    All networks have the same vertical feature templates: (t0, w0) features for known words and various (t0, Q(w1n)) word signature features for all words, known or not, including spelling and capitalization features (see section 3.3).
    Just this vertical conditioning gives an accuracy of 93.69% (denoted as &#8220;Baseline&#8221; in table 2).8 Condition6Tagger results are only comparable when tested not only on the same data and tag set, but with the same amount of training data.
    Brants (2000) illustrates very clearly how tagging performance increases as training set size grows, largely because the percentage of unknown words decreases whil
