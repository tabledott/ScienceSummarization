 lexical entailment.
    Three classes of features were used in the Alignment Classifier: (1) a set of statistical features (e.g. cosine similarity), (2) a set of lexicosemantic features (including WordNet Similarity (Pedersen et al., 2004), named entity class equality, and part-of-speech equality), and (3) a set of string-based features (such as Levenshtein edit distance and morphological stem equality).
    As in (Hickl et al., 2006), we used a twostep approach to obtain sufficient training data for the Alignment Classifier.
    First, humans were tasked with annotating a total of 10,000 alignment pairs (extracted from the 2006 PASCAL Development Set) as either positive or negative instances of alignment.
    These annotations were then used to train a hillclimber that was used to annotate a larger set of 450,000 alignment pairs selected at random from the training corpora described in Section 3.3.
    These machine-annotated examples were then used to train the Maximum Entropy-based classifier that was use
