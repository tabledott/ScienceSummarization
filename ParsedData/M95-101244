lem instances were due to string matching issues for short name forms .
  For example, by not treating embedde d mid-word hyphens as white space, we failed to process "McCann" as a shortened form of "McCann-Erickson".
  Turning now to the template element task, we note that the largest fraction of TE errors are repercussions of errors committed while performing the NE task.
  In particular, the people-name companies that wer e treated as persons during NE processing in turn led to spurious person templates .
  The magnitude of the NE error is mitigated by the fact that identical mentions of incorrectly-tagged named entities are merged for th e sake of TE template generation, and thus do not all individually spawn spurious templates .
  Among the TE errors not arising from NE processing errors, note in particular those that occurred on the most difficult slots , ORG DESCRIPTOR, ORG_LOCALE, and ORG_COUNTRY.
  These are all due in this case to missing locational an d 15 2 Nature of the problem Problem cases Resu
