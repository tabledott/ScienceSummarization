ce, given the context, S assumes that A knows whether S has the salt, the literal interpretation (from (2)) would not produce a reasonable goal for A.
    This supports the nested know-positive inference, and attributes further intention to the speaker (4).
    Once this is done, it is easy to infer that A wants S to pass him the salt (5), hence the request interpretation.
    &amp;quot;Can you pass the salt?&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Do you want to pass the salt?&amp;quot; are treated similarly, for they inquire about the preconditions on PASS(S, A, SALT).
    Example 7.
    &amp;quot;I want the salt.&amp;quot; (= &amp;quot;I want to have the salt.&amp;quot;) Example 7 includes in the step from (3) to (4), an application, through EI.3, of the effect-action rule.
    A informs S of A's goal of having the salt (2) and then depends on S's planning on that goal to infer the PASS action.
    Because the action is the &amp;quot;obvious&amp;quot; way of achieving the goal, S believes that A intended him to infer it.
