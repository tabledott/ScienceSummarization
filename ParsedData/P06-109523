and (Li et al. 2001) report 93% accuracy on extracting temporal relations in Chinese.
    Because these accuracies are on different data sets and metrics, they cannot be compared directly with our methods.
    Recently, researchers have developed other tools for automatically tagging aspects of TimeML, including EVENT (Sauri et al. 2005) at 0.80 F-measure and TIMEX36 tags at 0.82-0.85 F-measure.
    In addition, the TERN competition (tern.mitre.org) has shown very high (close to .95 F-measures) for TIMEX2 tagging, which is fairly similar to TIMEX3.
    These results suggest the time is ripe for exploiting &#8216;imperfect&#8217; features in our machine learning approach.
  
  
    Our research has uncovered one new finding: semantic reasoning (in this case, logical axioms for temporal closure), can be extremely valuable in addressing data sparseness.
    Without it, performance on this task of learning temporal relations is poor; with it, it is excellent.
    We showed that temporal reasoning can be used as a
