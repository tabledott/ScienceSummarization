atic units (Och et al., 1999).
    Several researchers have tried putting &#8220;more syntax&#8221; into translation models: like us, they use statistical versions of synchronous grammars, which generate source and target sentences in parallel and so describe their correspondence.4 This approach offers four features absent from IBM-style models: (1) a recursive phrase-based translation, (2) a syntax-based language model, (3) the ability to condition a word&#8217;s translation on the translation of syntactically related words, and (4) polynomial-time optimal alignment and decoding (Knight, 1999).
    Previous work in statistical synchronous grammars has been limited to forms of synchronous context-free grammar (Wu, 1997; Alshawi et al., 2000; Yamada and Knight, 2001).
    This means that a sentence and its translation must have isomorphic syntax trees, although they may have different numbers of surface words if null words a are allowed in one or both languages.
    This rigidity does not fully describe real d
