    Tying both nouns and verbs improves performance a bit more. data from the Penn Treebank and the Chinese Treebank of varying levels of difficulty imposed through a length filter.
    Attach-Right attaches each word to the word on its right and the last word to $.
    Bold marks best overall accuracy per length bound, and &#8224; marks figures that are not significantly worse (binomial sign test, p &lt; 0.05).
    Leveraging information from one language for the task of disambiguating another language has received considerable attention (Dagan, 1991; Smith and Smith, 2004; Snyder and Barzilay, 2008; Burkett and Klein, 2008).
    Usually such a setting requires a parallel corpus or other annotated data that ties between those two languages.5 Our bilingual experiments use the English and Chinese treebanks, which are not parallel corpora, to train parsers for both languages jointly.
    Sharing information between those two models is done by softly tying grammar w
