be et al., 2002) was implemented to calculate term frequency (raw frequency of a pattern) and document frequency (the number of documents where a pattern appears) for each pattern candidate.
    The algorithm finds the subtrees appearing more frequently than a given threshold by constructing the subtrees level by level, while keeping track of their occurrence in the corpus.
    Thus, it efficiently avoids the construction of duplicate patterns and runs almost linearly in the total size of the maximal tree patterns contained in the corpus.
    The following ranking function was used to rank each pattern candidate.
    The score of subtree, , is where is the number of times that subtree appears across the documents in the relevant document set, . is the set of subtrees that appear in .is the number of documents in the collection containing subtree, and is the total number of the dependency tree as a bunsetsu, phrasal unit. documents in the collection.
    The first term roughly corresponds to the term frequency
