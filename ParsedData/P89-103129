Cs) should be preferred over candidates from the previous utterance, ONLY in the cases where no discourse center has been established or the discourse center is rejected for syntactic or selectional reasons.
    He then uses Hobbs algorithm to produce an ordering of these ISCs.
    This is compatible with the centering framework since it is underspecified as to whether one should always choose to establish a discourse center with a co-specifier from a previous utterance.
    If we adopt Carter's rule into the centering framework, we find that of the 21 cases that Hobbs gets that BFP don't, in 7 cases there is no discourse center established, and in another 4 the current center can be rejected on the basis of syntactic or sortal information.
    Of these Carter's rule clearly gets 5, and another 3 seem to rest on whether one might want to establish a discourse entity from a previous utterance.
    Since the addition of this constraint does not allow BFP to get any examples that neither algorithm got, it seems
