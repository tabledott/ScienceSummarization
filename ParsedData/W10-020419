6).
    Observe that for more than 50% of the terms, all five annotators agree with each other, and for more than 80% of the terms, at least four annotators agree.
    This shows a high degree of agreement on emotion annotations despite no real control over the educational background and qualifications of the annotators.
    We consolidate the semantic orientation (polarity) annotations in a manner identical to the process for emotion annotations.
    Table 7 lists the percent of 2081 target terms assigned a majority class of no, weak, moderate, and strong semantic orientation.
    For example, it tells us that 16% of the target terms are strongly negative.
    The last row in the table lists the percent of target terms that have some semantic orientation (positive or negative) at the various intensity levels.
    Observe that 35% of the target terms are strongly evaluative (positively or negatively).
    Just as in the case for emotions, practical NLP applications often require only two levels of semantic or
