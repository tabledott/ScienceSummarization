    Each equivalence class constitutes a lattice with just one member that contains none of these grammatically irrelevant properties, and this canonical member is the only one a linguist would normally concern himself with.
    However, a grammatical irrelevancy that acquires relevance in the present context is the description of possible translations of a word or phrase, or of one of its interpretations, in one or more other languages.
    A description is an expression over an essentially arbitrary basic vocabulary.
    The relations among sets of descriptions therefore remain unchanged under one-for-one mappings of their basic vocabularies.
    It is therefore possible to arrange that different grammars share no terms except for possible quotations from the languages described.
    Canonical descriptions of a pair of sentences in different languages according to grammars that shared no terms could always be unifi
