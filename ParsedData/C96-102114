he implementation of aCOREF object needs to be aware of po- tenlial circularities, thus a COREF does not actually contain its member discourse r ferents, but rather alisting of their offsets, each factor as a function of the overall success of the algorithm.
			Our values for CNTX-S and POSS-S were de- termined using similar tests.
			An important feature of our implementation of salience, following that of Lappin and Leass, is that it is variable: the salience of a COREF class decreases and increases according to the frequency of reference to the class.
			When an anaphoric link is established between a pronoun and a previously introduced iscourse refer- ent, the pronoun is added to the COREF class associated with the discourse referent, its COREF value is set to the COREF value of the antecedent (i.e., to the COREF ob- ject which represents he class), and the salience of the COREF object is recalculated according to how the new member satisfies the set of salience factors.
			This final step raises the over
