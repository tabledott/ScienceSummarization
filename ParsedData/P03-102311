, ana ) , respectively.
    That is to say, determining whether Ci is coreferential to ana by T1 in the single-candidate model equals to determining whether Ci is better than C0 w.r.t ana by T2 in the twin-candidate model.
    Here we could take C0 as a &#8220;standard candidate&#8221;.
    While the classification in the single-candidate model can find its interpretation in the twincandidate model, it is not true vice versa.
    Consequently, we can safely draw the conclusion that the twin-candidate model is more powerful than the single-candidate model in characterizing the relationships among an anaphor and its candidates.
  
  
    Our competition learning approach adopts the twin-candidate model introduced in the Section 3.
    The main process of the approach is as follows: To determine the boundary of the noun phrases, a pipeline of Nature Language Processing components are applied to an input raw text: Among them, named entity recognition, part-ofspeech tagging and text chunking apply the same Hidden
