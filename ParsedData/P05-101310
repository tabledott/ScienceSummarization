#8595;.
    Thus, the arc from je to jedna will be labeled 5b&#8595; (to indicate that there is a syntactic head below it).
    In the third and final scheme, denoted Path, we keep the extra infor2Note that this is a baseline for the parsing experiment only (Experiment 2).
    For Experiment 1 it is meaningless as a baseline, since it would result in 0% accuracy. mation on path labels but drop the information about the syntactic head of the lifted arc, using the label d&#8593; instead of d&#8593;h (AuxP&#8593; instead of AuxP&#8593;Sb).
    As can be seen from the last column in Table 1, both Head and Head+Path may theoretically lead to a quadratic increase in the number of distinct arc labels (Head+Path being worse than Head only by a constant factor), while the increase is only linear in the case of Path.
    On the other hand, we can expect Head+Path to be the most useful representation for reconstructing the underlying non-projective dependency graph.
    In approaching this problem, a variety of differen
