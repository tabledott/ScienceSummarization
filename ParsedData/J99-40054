pplication: cryptanalysis.
  
  
    In a substitution cipher, a plaintext message like HELLO WORLD is transformed into a ciphertext message like EOPPX YXAPF via a fixed letter-substitution table.
    As with tagging, we can assume an alphabet of v source tokens, a bigram source model, a substitution channel model, and an m-token coded text.
    If the coded text is annotated with corresponding English, then building source and channel models is trivially 0(m).
    Comparing the situation to part-of-speech tagging: Then the problem becomes one of acquiring a channel model, i.e., a table s(f le) with an entry for each code-letter/plaintext-letter pair.
    Starting with an initially uniform table, we can use the estimation-maximization (EM) algorithm to iteratively revise s(f. le) so as to increase the probability of the observed corpus P(f).
    Figure 1 shows a naive EM implementation that runs in 0(mvin) time.
    There is an efficient 0(mv2) EM implementation based on dynamic programming that accomplishes
