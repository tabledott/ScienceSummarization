    The problem is compounded by the following obvious effect on r. values: If P(A) is kept constant, varying values for P(E) yield varying values of r.. What can affect P(E) even if P(A) is constant are prevalence and bias.
    The prevalence problem arises because skewing the distribution of categories in the data increases P(E).
    The minimum value P(E) = 1/m occurs when the labels are equally distributed among the m categories (see Example 4 in Figure 3).
    The maximum value P(E) = 1 occurs when the labels are all concentrated in a single category.
    But for a given value of P(A), the larger the v
