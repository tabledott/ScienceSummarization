 our model are delegated to a lexeme-based PCFG and we show that using a simple treebank grammar, a data-driven lexicon, and a linguistically motivated unknown-tokens handling our model outperforms (Tsarfaty, 2006) and (Cohen and Smith, 2007) on the joint task and achieves state-of-the-art results on a par with current respective standalone models.2
  
  
    Segmental morphology Hebrew consists of seven particles m(&#8220;from&#8221;) f(&#8220;when&#8221;/&#8220;who&#8221;/&#8220;that&#8221;) h(&#8220;the&#8221;) w(&#8220;and&#8221;) k(&#8220;like&#8221;) l(&#8220;to&#8221;) and b(&#8220;in&#8221;). which may never appear in isolation and must always attach as prefixes to the following open-class category item we refer to as stem.
    Several such particles may be prefixed onto a single stem, in which case the affixation is subject to strict linear precedence constraints.
    Co-occurrences among the particles themselves are subject to further syntactic and lexical constraints relative to the stem.
