 often does occur [Merialdo, 1995; Elworthy, 1994], requiring an additional held-out training corpus for determining an appropriate number of training iterations.
    In this experiment, we also used a training set of 120,000 words and a separate test set of 200,000 words.
    Initial state tagging accuracy on the training set is 89.8%.
    After learning 1,729 transformations and applying them to the training set, accuracy increases to 95.6%.
    Initial state tagging accuracy on the test set is 89.9%, with accuracy increasing to 95.6% after applying the learned transformations.
    Expanding the training set to 350,000 words and testing on the same test set, accuracy increases to 96.0%.
    All unsupervised learning results are summarized in table 1.
    In [Merialdo, 1995], tagging experiments are described training a tagger using the BaumWelch algorithm with a dictionary constructed as described above and an untagged corpus.
    Experiments were run on Associated Press articles which were manually tagged
