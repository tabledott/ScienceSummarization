 the case of the SVM with only a single Turney value, accuracy is already at 68.3% (Turney (2002) reports that simply averaging these values on the same data yields 65.8% accuracy).
    The Osgood values are considerably less reliable, yielding only 56.2% accuracy on their own.
    Lemmas outperform unigrams in all experiments, and in fact the simple lemma models outperform even those augmented with the Turney and Osgood features in the experiments on the epinions data.
    The contribution of these new feature types is most pronounced when they are used to train a separate SVM and the two SVMs are combined in a hybrid SVM.
    The best results are obtained using such hybrid SVMs, which yield scores of 84.6% accuracy on the 3-fold experiments and 86.0% accuracy on the 10-fold experiments.
    In the second set of experiments, again, inclusion of Osgood features shows no evidence of yielding any improvement in modeling when other features are present, indeed, as in the previous experiments there are some cases
