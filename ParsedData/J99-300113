 not recognized, as in the case of conceptually neutral pronominal anaphora (e.g., er, 'it,' in example (1d) co-specifying with 316LT, a particular notebook introduced in example (la)).
    Invalid knowledge structures emerge when each entity that has a different denotation at the text surface is also treated as a formally distinct item at the level of text knowledge representation, although they all refer literally to the same entity.
    These false referential descriptions result from unresolved nominal anaphora (e.g., Rechner, 'computer' in example (lc) co-specifies with 316LT in (la)).
    Finally, incohesive or artificially fragmented knowledge structures emerge when entities that are linked by various conceptual relations at the knowledge level occur in a text such that an implicit reference to these relations can be made without the need for explicit signaling at the text surface level.
    Corresponding referential relations cannot be established at the text representation level, since these inferabl
