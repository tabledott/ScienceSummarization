me less important informationally since they emerged from fewer summaries.
    We use the term &#8220;pyramid of order n&#8221; to refer to a pyramid with n tiers.
    Given a pyramid of order n, we can predict the optimal summary content&#8211;it should contain all the SCUs from the top tier, if length permits, SCUs from the next tier and so on.
    In short, an SCU from tier (n &#8722; 1) should not be expressed if all the SCUs in tier n have not been expressed.
    This characterization of optimal content ignores many complicating factors (e.g., ordering, SCU interdependency).
    However, it is predictive: among summaries produced by humans, many seem equally good without having identical content.
    Figure 2, with two SCUs in the uppermost tier and four in the next, illustrates two of six optimal summaries of size 4 (in SCUs) that this pyramid predicts.
    The score we assign is a ratio of the sum of the weights of its SCUs to the sum of the weights of an optimal summary with the same number of SCUs.
