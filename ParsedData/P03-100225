    This paper reports on a novel inductive learning method for identifying predicate argument structures in text.
    The proposed approach achieves over 88% F-measure for the problem of identifying argument constituents, and over 83% accuracy for the task of assigning roles to pre-identified argument constituents.
    Because predicate lexical information is used for less than 5% of the branching decisions, the generated classifier scales better than the statistical method from (Gildea and Palmer, 2002) to unknown predicates.
    This way of identifying predicate argument structures is a central piece of an IE paradigm easily customizable to new domains.
    The performance degradation of this paradigm when compared to IE systems based on hand-crafted patterns is only 10%.
