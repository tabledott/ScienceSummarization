tification phase when the transduction algorithm is applied to test data.
    Some results for different choices of substring lengths can be found in Alshawi, Bangalore, and Douglas (1998).
  
  
    In order to reduce the time required to carry out training evaluation experiments, we have chosen two simple, string-based evaluation metrics that can be calculated automatically.
    These metrics, simple accuracy and translation accuracy, are used to compare the target string produced by the system against a reference human translation from held-out data.
    Simple accuracy is computed by first finding a transformation of one string into another that minimizes the total weight of insertions, deletions, and substitutions.
    (We use the same weights for these operations as in the NIST ASR evaluation software [National Institute of Standards and Technology 1997].)
    Translation accuracy includes transpositions (i.e., movement) of words as well as insertions, deletions, and substitutions.
    We regard the lat
