oun compound is flourishing in modern language.
    It has already made five appearances in this paragraph and at least one diachronic study shows a veritable population explosion (Leonard, 1984).
    While substantial work on noun compounds exists in both linguistics (e.g.
    Levi, 1978; Ryder, 1994) and computational linguistics (Finin, 1980; McDonald, 1982; Isabelle, 1984), techniques suitable for broad coverage parsing remain unavailable.
    This paper explores the application of corpus statistics (Charniak, 1993) to noun compound parsing (other computational problems are addressed in Arens et al, 1987; Vanderwende, 1993 and Sproat, 1994).
    The task is illustrated in example 1: The parses assigned to these two compounds differ, even though the sequence of parts of speech are identical.
    The problem is analogous to the prepositional phrase attachment task explored in Hindle and Rooth (1993).
    The approach they propose involves computing lexical associations from a corpus and using these to selec
