at Japanese/English transliteration in this article.
    Japanese frequently imports vocabulary from other languages, primarily (but not exclusively) from English.
    It has a special phonetic alphabet called katakana, which is used primarily (but not exclusively) to write down foreign names and loanwords.
    The katakana symbols are shown in Figure 1, with their Japanese pronunciations.
    The two symbols shown in the lower right corner ( &#8212;, ) are used to lengthen any Japanese vowel or consonant.
    To write a word like golfbag in katakana, some compromises must be made.
    For example, Japanese has no distinct L and R. sounds: the two English sounds collapse onto the same Japanese sound.
    A similar compromise must be struck for English H and F. Also, Japanese generally uses an alternating consonant-vowel structure, making it impossible to pronounce LFB without intervening vowels.
    Katakana writing is a syllabary rather than an alphabet&#8212;there is one symbol for ga (If), another for gi e
