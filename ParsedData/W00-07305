-2, i-1) where wi is the word appearing at i-th word, ti is the POS tag of wi, and ci is the (extended) chunk label at i-th word.
    Since the chunk labels are not given in the test data, they are decided dynamically during the tagging of chunk labels.
    This technique can be regarded as a sort of Dynamic Programming (DP) matching, in which the best answer is searched by maximizing the total certainty score for the combination of tags.
    In using DP matching, we decided to keep not all ambiguities but a limited number of them.
    This means that a beam search is employed, and only the top N candidates are kept for the search for the best chunk tags.
    The algorithm scans the test data from left to right and calls the SVM classifiers for all pairs of chunk tags for obtaining the certainty score.
    We defined the certainty score as the number of votes for the class (tag) obtained through the pairwise voting.
    Since SVMs are vector based classifier, they accept only numerical values for their featur
