r.
    This is done in the following way: we are given two word graphs w1 and w2 with start and end nodes (s1, g1) and (s2,g2), respectively.
    First, we add an 2-transition (g1, s2) from the end node of the first graph w1 to the start node of the second graph w2 and annotate this edge with the probability of a monotone concatenation pm.
    Second, we create a copy of each of the original word graphs w1 and w2.
    Then, we add an 2-transition (g2, s1) from the end node of the copied second graph to the start node of the copied first graph.
    This edge is annotated with the probability of a inverted concatenation 1 &#8212; pm.
    Now, we have obtained two word graphs: one for a monotone and one for a inverted concatenation.
    The final word graphs is constructed by merging the two start nodes and the two end nodes, respectively.
    Let W(jl, jr) denote the word graph for the source sequence fjr jl .
    This graph is constructed from the word graphs of all subsequences of (jl, jr).
    Therefore, we
