 of paraphrasing is the automatic generation of query variants for submission to information retrieval systems or of patterns for submission to information extraction systems.
    Culicover (1968) describes one of the earliest theoretical frameworks for query keyword expansion using paraphrases.
    One of the earliest works to implement this approach (Sp&#168;arckJones and Tait 1984) generates several simple variants for compound nouns in queries submitted to a technical information retrieval system.
    For example: Original : circuit details Variant 1 : details about the circuit Variant 2 : the details of circuits 1 Inferring words to be similar based on similar contexts can be thought of as the most common instance of employing distributional similarity.
    The concept of distributional similarity also turns out to be quite important for phrasal paraphrase generation and is discussed in more detail in Section 3.1. these techniques is usually effected by utilizing the query log (a log containing the recor
