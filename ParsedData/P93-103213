. If a verb appears m times in the corpus, and n of those times it cooccurs with a cue for s, then the probability that all the cues are false cues is bounded by the binomial distribution: Thus the null hypothesis that the verb does not have the subcategorization frame s can be rejected if the above sum is less than some confidence level C (C = 0.02 in the work reported here).
    Brent was able to use extremely low values for B, (since his cues were sparse but unlikely to be 'Except for the fact that it will only count the first of multiple PPs as an argument. false cues), and indeed found the best performance with values of the order of 2-8.
    However, using my parser, false cues are common.
    For example, when the recorded subcategorization is NP PP(of), it is likely that the PP should actually be attached to the NP rather than the verb.
    Hence I have used high bounds on the probability of cues being false cues for certain triggers (the used values range from 0.25 (for Tv-P( of )) to 0.02).
