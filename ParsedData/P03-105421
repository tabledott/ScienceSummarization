    It has been comprehensively demonstrated that lexical dependencies are useful in resolving major classes of sentence ambiguities, and a parser should make use of such information where possible.
    We focus here on using unlexicalized, structural context because we feel that this information has been underexploited and underappreciated.
    We see this investigation as only one part of the foundation for state-of-the-art parsing which employs both lexical and structural conditioning.
  
  
    To facilitate comparison with previous work, we trained our models on sections 2&#8211;21 of the WSJ section of the Penn treebank.
    We used the first 20 files (393 sentences) of section 22 as a development set (devset).
    This set is small enough that there is noticeable variance in individual results, but it allowed rapid search for good features via continually reparsing the devset in a partially manual hill-climb.
    All of section 23 was used as a test set for the final model.
    For each model, in
