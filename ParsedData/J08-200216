abeling decisions obtained using different syntactic annotation.
    The method of Punyakanok, Roth, and Yih (2005) uses ILP to derive a consistent set of arguments, each of which could be derived using a different parse tree.
    Pradhan, Ward et al. (2005) use stacking to train a classifier which combines decisions based on different annotations, and M`arquez et al.
    (2005) use special-purpose filtering and inference stages which combine arguments proposed by systems using shallow and full analyses.
    Our approach to increasing robustness uses the top k parses from a single parser and is a simple general method to factor in the uncertainty of the parser by applying Bayesian inference.
    It is most closely related to the method described in Finkel, Manning, and Ng (2006) and can be seen as an approximation of that method.
    We describe our system in detail by first introducing simpler local semantic role labeling models in Section 4, and later building on them to define joint models in Section 5.
