ed in the word unigram model.
    The transliteration score according to this model is given by: &#9988; &#9988; &#10014;(2) The phonetic-based and spelling-based models are combined into a single transliteration model.
    The transliteration score for an English word given an Arabic word is a linear combination of the phonetic-based and the spelling-based transliteration scores as follows: Person names are almost always transliterated.
    The translation candidates for typical person names are generated using the transliteration module described above.
    Finite-state devices produce a lattice containing all possible transliterations for a given name.
    The candidate list is created by extracting the n-best transliterations for a given name.
    The score of each candidate in the list is the transliteration probability as given by Equation 3.
    For example, the name &#8220; klyntwn byl&#8221; is transliterated into: Bell Clinton, Bill Clinton, Bill Klington, etc.
