  For instance, if an agenda-based system first computes the probability for a production S &#8212;&gt; NP VP, and then later computes some better probability for the NP, it must update the probability for the S as well.
    This could propagate through much of the chart.
    To remedy this, Caraballo et al. only propagated probabilities that caused a large enough change (Caraballo and Charniak, 1997).
    Also, the question of when an agenda-based system should stop is a little discussed issue, and difficult since there is no obvious stopping criterion.
    Because of these issues, we chose not to implement an agenda-based system for comparison.
    As mentioned earlier, Rayner and Carter (1996) describe a system that is the inspiration for global thresholding.
    Because of the limitation of their system to non-recursive grammars, and the other differences discussed in Section 3, global thresholding represents a significant improvement.
    Collins (1996) uses two thresholding techniques.
