 set L of dependency labels, a dependency graph for a sentence x = w1, ... , wn is a directed graph G = (Vx, A), where The set Vx of nodes is the set of positive integers up to and including n, each corresponding to the linear position of a word in the sentence, plus an extra artificial root node 0.
    The set A of arcs is a set of triples (i, l, j), where i and j are nodes and l is a label.
    For a dependency graph G = (Vx, A) to be well-formed, we in addition require that it is a tree rooted at the node 0, as illustrated in Figure 1.
    Following Nivre (2008a), we define a transition system for dependency parsing as a quadruple 5 = (C, T, cs, Ct), where In this paper, we take the set C of configurations to be the set of all triples c = (E, B, A) such that E and B are disjoint sublists of the nodes Vx of some sentence x, and A is a set of dependency arcs over Vx (and some label set L); we take the initial configuration for a sentence x = w1, ... , wn to be cs(x) = ([0], [1, ... , n], 11); and we take the
