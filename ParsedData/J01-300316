pate M is the &amp;quot;induced action alternation&amp;quot; according to Levin (1993).
    For our thematic analysis, we note that the subject of an intransitive activity verb is specified to be an Agent.
    The subject of the transitive form is indicated by the label Agent of Causation, which indicates that the thematic role assigned to the subject is marked as the role which is introduced with the causing event.
    In a causative alternation, the semantic argument of the subject of the intransitive surfaces as the object of the transitive (Brousseau and Ritter 1991; Hale and Keyser 1993; Levin 1993; Levin and Rappaport Hovav 1995).
    For unergatives, this argument is an Agent and thus the alternation yields an object in the transitive form that receives an Agent thematic role (Cruse 1972).
    These thematic assignments are shown in the first row of Table 3.
    The sentences in (2) illustrate the corresponding forms of an unaccusative verb, melt.
    Unaccusatives are intransitive change-of-state verb
