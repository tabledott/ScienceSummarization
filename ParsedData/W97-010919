d to inappropriate senses.
    Such a wrong disambiguation would further force wrong disambiguations in other quadruples and the overall result would be substantially less accurate.
    Another advantage of this disambiguation mechanism is that the proper nouns, which usually refer to people or companies, can be also disambiguated.
    For example, an unknown name ARBY in quadruple: acquire ARBY for million is matched with disambiguated noun in Q6 and also disambiguated to the COMPANY-1 sense, rather than to,PERSON (note, that even if Q6 was not disambiguated, the COMPANY-1 sense of subsidiary is semantically closer to the sense company of ARBY and therefore, although possible, the disambiguation of ARBY to the first sense of subsidiary (PERSON) would be dismissed).
    Similarity Distance Threshold defines the limit matching distance between two quadruples.
    The matching distance between two quadruples Q1=v1-n1-p-di and Q2=v2-n2-p-d2 is defined as follows (v=verb, n=--noun, p=preposition, d=description no
