 are generally grammatical subjects, and NP nodes under VP nodes are generally objects.
    In most cases the S or VP node determining the value of this feature immediately dominates the NP node, but attachment errors by the parser or constructions such as conjunction of two NPs can cause intermediate nodes to be introduced.
    Searching for higher ancestor nodes makes the feature robust to such cases.
    Even given good parses, this feature is not perfect in discriminating grammatical functions, and in particular it confuses direct objects with adjunct NPs such as temporal phrases.
    For example, town in the sentence &#8220;He left town&#8221; and yesterday in the sentence &#8220;He left yesterday&#8221; will both be assigned a governing category of VP.
    Direct and indirect objects both appear directly under the VP node.
    For example, in the sentence &#8220;He gave me a new hose,&#8221; me and a new hose are both assigned a governing category of VP.
    More sophisticated handling of such cases cou
