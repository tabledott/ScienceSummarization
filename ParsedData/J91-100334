section starts with an explanation of some of the linguistic background behind the met* method.
    I have argued elsewhere (Fass 1989a) that understanding natural language (or semantic interpretation) be viewed as the integration of constraints from language and from context.
    Some language constraints are syntactic, while others are semantic.
    Some language constraints are lexical constraints; that is, constraints possessed by lexical items (words and fixed phrases).
    Lexical syntactic constraints include those on word order, number, and tense.
    This sec tion describes three lexical semantic constraints: preferences, assertions, and a lexical notion of relevance.
    Preferences (Wilks 1973), selection restrictions (Katz 1964), and expectations (Schank 1975) are the same (see Fass 1989c; Fass and Wilks 1983; Wilks and Fass in press): all are restrictions possessed by senses of lexical items of certain parts of speech about the semantic classes of lexical items with which they co-occur.
    Thus
