he current model cannot deal with these types of errors.
    We leave their solutions as future work.
  
  
    We proposed a method for extracting semantic orientations of words.
    In the proposed method, we regarded semantic orientations as spins of electrons, and used the mean field approximation to compute the approximate probability function of the system instead of the intractable actual probability function.
    We succeeded in extracting semantic orientations with high accuracy, even when only a small number of seed words are available.
    There are a number of directions for future work.
    One is the incorporation of syntactic information.
    Since the importance of each word consisting a gloss depends on its syntactic role. syntactic information in glosses should be useful for classification.
    Another is active learning.
    To decrease the amount of manual tagging for seed words, an active learning scheme is desired, in which a small number of good seed words are automatically selected.
