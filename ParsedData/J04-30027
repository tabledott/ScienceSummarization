h frequency and significantly higher precision than baseline (Section 3.2).
    The second are collocations (Section 3.3).
    We demonstrate a straightforward method for automatically identifying collocational clues of subjectivity in texts.
    The method is first used to identify fixed n-grams, such as of the century and get out of here.
    Interestingly, many include noncontent words that are typically on stop lists of NLP systems (e.g., of, the, get, out, here in the above examples).
    The method is then used to identify an unusual form of collocation: One or more positions in the collocation may be filled by any word (of an appropriate part of speech) that is unique in the test data.
    The third type of subjectivity clue we examine here are adjective and verb features identified using the results of a method for clustering words according to distributional similarity (Lin 1998) (Section 3.4).
    We hypothesized that two words may be distributionally similar because they are both potentially subjec
