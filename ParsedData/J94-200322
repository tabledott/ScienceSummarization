s measure must  always be relative since there is no grammar  of discourse.
  Thus methods for exploring these issues must  use compar- ative measures of how some discourses are easier to process than others.
  Centering theory models this by stipulating that some transitions are preferred over others.
  The typology of transitions from one utterance, Ui, to the next is based on two factors: whether the backward-looking center, Cb, is the same from Ui-1 to Ui, and whether this discourse entity is the same as the preferred center, Cp, of Ui.
  8 6 This ranking is consistent with Kunos Empathy Hierarchies and with Kameyamas Expected Center Order (Kuno 1987; Kameyama 1985, 1988).
  This will be discussed in Section 6.
  We do not include discourse ntities for verb phrases or other propositional entities in this ranking since we have not studied their contribution (but see Sidner 1979, 1981 and Carter 1987).
