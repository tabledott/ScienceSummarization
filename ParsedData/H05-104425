			Using just the word token, positive precision is slightly higher than for the 10-feature clas sifier, but positive recall is 11.6% lower.
			Add the prior polarity, and positive recall improves, but at the expense of precision, which is 12.6% lower than for the 10-feature classifier.
			The results for negative expressions are similar.
			The word-token classifier does well on negative recall but poorly on negative precision.
			When prior polarity is added, negative recall improves but negative precision drops.
			It is only with the addition of the polarity features that we achieve both higher precisions and higher recalls.
			To explore how much the various polarity featurescontribute to the performance of the pol
