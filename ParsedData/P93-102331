 3, which also includes the scores obtained for several other sub-optimal choices of the number of clusters.
    We have made these observations related to the evaluation mechanism: there has been increasing concern that the scoring methods used for evaluating the goodness of parsers are producing values which seem extremely good (in the &gt;90% range), while in fact the parse trees produced are not so satisfactory; the blame for this inflation of the scores can be assigned to an inadequate comparison technique, which essentially considers a tree fragment correct when it is a part of (although not exactly matching) the corresponding fragment in the model.
    For other tasks, such as part-of-speech assignment to free text, the comparison techniques are sound, but very high levels of performance (e.g.
    90%) can be obtained by a zeroparameter model which operates at random; clearly this makes the assessment of the significance of an improvement over the base line of the random algorithm much harder.
    As a
