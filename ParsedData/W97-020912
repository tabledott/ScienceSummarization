    One experiment where results were reported was conducted by Cowie et at.
    (1992); their method involved using a stochastic search procedure to maximize the overlap in dictionary definitions (LDOCE) for alternative senses of words co-occurring in a sentence.
    They report an accuracy of 72% for disambiguation to the homograph level, and 47% for disambiguation to the sense level.
    Since the task here involved WordNet sense distinctions, which are rather fine grained, the latter value is more appropriate for comparison.
    Their experiment was more general in that they did not restrict themselves to nouns; on the other hand, their test set involved disambiguating words taken from full sentences, so the percentage correct may have been improved by the presence of unambiguous words.
