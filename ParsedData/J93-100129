 and the variance is o-2 = np(1 &#8212; p).
    Thus, tossing a fair coin three times will produce an average of 3/2 heads with a variance of 3/4.
    How can the binomial be used to model the distribution of Kennedy?
    Let p be the probability that a word chosen at random in English text is Kennedy.
    We can think of a series of words in English text as analogous to tosses of a coin that comes up heads with probability p: the coin is heads if the word is Kennedy, and is tails otherwise.
    Of course, we don't really know the value of p, but in a sample of n words, we should expect to find about np occurrences of Kennedy.
    There are 140 occurrences of Kennedy in the Brown Corpus, for which n is approximately 1,000,000.
    Therefore, we can argue that 1,000, 000p must be about 140 and we can make an estimate, p, of p equal to 140/1, 000, 000.
    If we really believe that words in English text come up like heads when we flip a biased coin, then p is the value of p that makes the Brown Corpus as probab
