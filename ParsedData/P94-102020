 [7], [30] and [5].
    Other works consider multiple contextual features in performing disambiguation without formally characterizing the relationships among the features.
    The majority of these efforts ([13], [31]) weight each feature in predicting the sense of an ambiguous word in accordance with frequency information, without considering the extent to which the features cooccur with one another.
    Gale, Church and Yarowsky ([10]) and Yarowsky ([29]) formally characterize the interactions that they consider in their model, but they simply assume that their model fits the data.
    Other researchers have proposed approaches to systematically combining information from multiple contextual features in determining the sense of an ambiguous word.
    Schutze ([26]) derived contextual features from a singular value decomposition of a matrix of letter four-gram co-occurrence frequencies, thereby assuring the independence of all features.
    Unfortunately, interpreting a contextual feature that is a weighted
