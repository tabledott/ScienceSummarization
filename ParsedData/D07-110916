ary dataset was SEMCOR (Miller et al, 1993), which is a subset of the Brown corpus with many nouns manually labeled with the correct WORDNET sense.
			The words in this dataset are lemmatized, and multi-word expressions that are present in WORDNET are identified.
			Only the wordsin SEMCOR were used in the Gibbs sampling pro cedure; the synset assignments were only used for assessing the accuracy of the final predictions.
			We also used the British National Corpus, whichis not lemmatized and which does not have multi word expressions.
			The text was first run through a lemmatizer, and then sequences of words which matched a multi-word expression in WORDNET were joined together into a single word.
			We took nouns that appeared in SEMCOR twice or in theBNC at least 25 times and used the BNC to compute the information-content analog ? for individ ual nouns (For example, the probabilities in Figure 1 correspond to ?).
