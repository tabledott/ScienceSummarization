mental step toward the larger goals of natural language processing.
  Our approach is complementary to statistically based approaches that find semantic relations between terms, iu that ours requires a sin- gle specially expressed instance of a relation while the others require a statistically significant number of generally expressed relations.
  Weve shown that our approach is also useful as a critiquing component for existing knowledge bases and lexicons.
  We plan to test the pattern discovery algorithm on more relations and on languages other than English (depending on the corpora available).
  We would also like to do some analysis of the noun phrases that are acquired, and to explore the effects of various kinds of modifiers on the appropriateness of the noun phrase.
  We plan to do this in the context of analyzing envi- ronmental impact reports.
