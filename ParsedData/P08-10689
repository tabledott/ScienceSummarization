involved these higher-order interactions.
    Examples of baseline features are provided in Table 1. tag.
    Abbreviations: ht = head POS, hw = head word, hc4 = 4-bit prefix of head, hc6 = 6-bit prefix of head, hc* = full bit string of head; mt,mw,mc4,mc6,mc* = likewise for modifier; st,gt,sc4,gc4,... = likewise for sibling and grandchild.
    The first- and second-order cluster-based feature sets are supersets of the baseline feature sets: they include all of the baseline feature templates, and add an additional layer of features that incorporate word clusters.
    Following Miller et al. (2004), we use prefixes of the Brown cluster hierarchy to produce clusterings of varying granularity.
    We found that it was nontrivial to select the proper prefix lengths for the dependency parsing task; in particular, the prefix lengths used in the Miller et al. (2004) work (between 12 and 20 bits) performed poorly in dependency parsing.2 After experimenting with many different feature configurations, we eventually set
