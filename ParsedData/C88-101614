set R(0 [ e0) = 1 to assure that the null word does not generate any other words.
  The lnollel probability that the word f generates e,,in tile primary process, and e~:,...,e~, in the secondary one, is equal to the product P(ei, l f  ) R(k - 11%) Q(ei2lei,) Q(%lei~)... Q(%leq) (4.1) Given a pair of English and French sentences E and F, by the term generation pattern $ we understand the specification of which English words were generated from which French ones, and which~secondary words from which primary ones.
  Therefore, the probability P(E,$IF) of generating the words of E ira a pattern $ from those of F is given simply by a product of factors like (4.1), one for each French word.
  We can then think of estimating the probabilities P(e, l f ) ,  R(k l e,), and Q(e:l?)
  by the following algorithm at tile start of which all counters are set to 0: 1.
  For a sentence pair E,F of the texts, find that pattern $ that gives the maximal value of P(E,$IF), and then make the (somewhat impulsive) decision that that
