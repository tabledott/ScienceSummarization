edia (1991) instead of the Hansards, thus cir- cumventing many of the objections to our use of the Hansards.
  Yarowskys method inputs a 100-word con- text surrounding a polysemous word and scores each of the 1042 Roget Categories by: H Pr(wlRoget Categoryi) w in  contes t Table 2 shows some results for the polysemous noun crane.
  Each of the 1042 models, Pr(wlRoget Categoryl), is trained by interpolating between local probabilities and global probabilities just as before.
  However, the local probabilities are somewhat more difficult to obtain in this case since we do not have a corpus tagged with Roget Categories, and therefore, it may not be obvi- ous how to extract subsections of the corpus meeting the local conditions.
  Consider the Roget Category: TOOLS/MACHINERY (348).
  Ideally, we would extract 100-word contexts in the 10 million word Grolier En- cyclopedia surrounding words in category 348 and use these to compute the local probabilities.
  Since we dont have a tagged corpus, Yarowsky suggested ex
