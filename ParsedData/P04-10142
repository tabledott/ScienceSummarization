    The development of parsing and estimation algorithms for models which use all derivations extends existing CCG parsing techniques, and allows us to test whether there is useful information in the additional derivations.
    However, we find that the performance of the normal-form model is at least as good as the all-derivations model, in our experiments todate.
    The normal-form approach allows the use of additional constraints on rule applications, leading to a smaller model, reducing the computational resources required for estimation, and resulting in an extremely efficient parser.
    This paper assumes a basic understanding of CCG; see Steedman (2000) for an introduction, and Clark et al. (2002) and Hockenmaier (2003a) for an introduction to statistical parsing with CCG.
  
  
    CCG is unusual among grammar formalisms in that, for each derived structure for a sentence, there can be many derivations leading to that structure.
    The presence of such ambiguity, sometimes ref
