 are obtained regardless of the number of distributionally similar words.
    This is in agreement with the finding of (McCarthy et al., 2004) that, in their word sense ranking method, a larger set of neighbors did not influence the algorithm accuracy.
  
  
    The final question we address is concerned with the potential impact of subjectivity on the quality of a word sense classifier.
    To answer this question, we augment an existing data-driven word sense disambiguation system with a feature reflecting the subjectivity of the examples where the ambiguous word occurs, and evaluate the performance of the new subjectivity-aware classifier as compared to the traditional context-based sense classifier.
    We use a word sense disambiguation system that integrates both local and topical features.
    9The break-even point (Lewis, 1992) is a standard measure used in conjunction with precision-recall evaluations.
    It represents the value where precision and recall become equal.
    Specifically, we use the c
