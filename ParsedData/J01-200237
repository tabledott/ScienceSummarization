 used as the basis for step n+ 1.
    The process stops when no rule reaches a score above a predefined threshold.
    In our experiments this has usually yielded several hundreds of rules.
    Of the four systems, TBL has access to the most features: contextual information (the words and tags in a window spanning three positions before and after the focus word) as well as lexical information (the existence of words formed by the addition or deletion of a suffix or prefix).
    However, the conjunctions of these features are not all available in order to keep the search space manageable.
    Even with this restriction, the search is computationally very costly.
    The most important rule templates are of the form if context = x change tag, to tag) where context is some condition on the tags of the neighbouring words.
    Hence learning speed is roughly cubic in the tagset size.17 When tagging, the system again starts with a baseline annotation for the new text, and then applies all rules that were derived du
