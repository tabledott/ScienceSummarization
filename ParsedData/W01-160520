    While other discourse theoretical approaches posit distinctly different treatments for various levels of the discourse (Van Dijk and Kintsch, 1983; Meyer, 1985), RST relies on a standard methodology to analyze the document at all levels.
    The RST relation set is rich and the concept of nuclearity, somewhat interpretive.
    This gave our annotators more leeway in interpreting the higher levels of the discourse structure, thus introducing some stylistic differences, which may prove an interesting avenue of future research.
  
  
    The RST Corpus consists of 385 Wall Street Journal articles from the Penn Treebank, representing over 176,000 words of text.
    In order to measure inter-annotator consistency, 53 of the documents (13.8%) were double-tagged.
    The documents range in size from 31 to 2124 words, with an average of 458.14 wor
