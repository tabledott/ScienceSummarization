the intersection of the set of standard-parse constituents with the set of candidate-parse constituents.
  So the final count prel iminary to the computation of Recall and Precision is the number of elements in that intersection.
  To return to the first example of the last subsection: Standard parse: ((The prospect) (of (cutting back spending))) Parse for evaluation: (The (prospect (of ((cutting back) spending)))) there are  4 standard-parse constituents, if the convention is adopted of excluding unary constituents~ and 5 candidate-parse constituents, under the same convention.
  Three of these are common to both sets, i.e.
  the intersection here is 3.
  Computing Recall and Precision is accomplished for this parse as follows: Recall = 3 / Precision = 3 / 5 .
  (C) Combining Statistics Gathered In order to evaluate a set of parses, first simply compute a distribution over "Incompatible Constituents" scores for the parses in the set, e.g.
  Incompatible Constituents: 0 I 2 Frequency: 3 I I (Total = 5) Next,
