 example, we could associate with each sense an extended sense&#8212;a set es(s) including the sense itself and its grouped sense&#8212;and then use set-based distance metrics from Section 4.4, for example Passonneau&#8217;s dP.
    To illustrate how this approach could be used to measure (dis)agreement on word sense annotation, suppose that two coders have to annotate the use of call in the following sentence (from the WSJ part of the Penn Treebank, section 02, text w0209): This gene, called &#8220;gametocide,&#8221; is carried into the plant by a virus that remains active for a few days.
    The standard guidelines (in SENSEVAL, say) require coders to assign a WN sense to words.
    Under such guidelines, if coder A classifies the use of called in the above example as an instance of WN1, whereas coder B annotates it as an instance of WN3, we would find total disagreement (dkakb = 1) which seems excessively harsh as the two senses are clearly related.
    However, by using the broader senses proposed by Palm
