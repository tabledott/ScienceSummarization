    Wu (1997)&#8217;s inversion transduction grammar (ITG) is a synchronous grammar formalism in which derivations of sentence pairs correspond to alignments.
    In its original formulation, there is a single non-terminal X spanning a bitext cell with an English and foreign span.
    There are three rule types: Terminal unary productions X &#8212;* (e, f), where e and f are an aligned English and foreign word pair (possibly with one being null); normal binary rules X _* X(L)X(R), where the English and foreign spans are constructed from the children as (X(L)X(R), X(L)X(R)i; and inverted binary rules X --* X(L)X(R), where the foreign span inverts the order of the children (X (L)X(R), X(R)X(L)i.2 In general, we will call a bitext cell a normal cell if it was constructed with a normal rule and inverted if constructed with an inverted rule.
    Each ITG derivation yields some alignment.
    The set of such ITG alignments, AITG, are a strict subset of A1-1 (Wu, 1997).
    Thus, we will view ITG as
