 Klein (2007) and Elsner et al. (2009), we biased these types&#8217; pronoun distributions to the allowed set of pronouns.
    In general, the choice of entity types to prime with prototypes is a domain-specific question.
    For experiments here, we utilized the types which are annotated in the ACE coreference data: person (PERS), organization (ORG), geo-political entity (GPE), weapon (WEA), vehicle (VEH), location (LOC), and facility (FAC).
    Since the person type in ACE conflates individual persons with groups of people (e.g., soldier vs. soldiers), we added the group (GROUP) type and generated a prototype specification.
    We obtained our prototype list by extracting at most four common proper and nominal head words from the newswire portions of the 2004 and 2005 ACE training sets (A04CU and A05ST); we chose prototype words to be minimally ambiguous with respect to type.8 When there are not at least three proper heads for a type (WEA for instance), we did not provide any proper prototypes and instead s
