l cost in computational complexity.
    We expect our relatively unconstrained clone operation to allow for various types of structural divergence by providing a sort of hybrid between tree-based and unstructured, IBM-style models.
    We first present the tree-to-string model, followed by the tree-to-tree model, before moving on to alignment results for a parallel syntactically annotated Korean-English corpus, measured in terms of alignment perplexities on held-out test data, and agreement with human-annotated word-level alignments.
  
  
    We begin by summarizing the model of Yamada and Knight (2001), which can be thought of as representing translation as an Alexander Calder mobile.
    If we follow the process of an English sentence&#8217;s transformation into French, the English sentence is first given a syntactic tree representation by a statistical parser (Collins, 1999).
    As the first step in the translation process, the children of each node in the tree can be re-ordered.
    For any node with m
