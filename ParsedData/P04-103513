arger c makes the minimum-cut algorithm more loath to put proximal sentences in different classes.
    With these in hand8, we set (for j &gt; i)
  
  
    Below, we report average accuracies computed by ten-fold cross-validation over the polarity dataset.
    Section 4.1 examines our basic subjectivity extraction algorithms, which are based on individualsentence predictions alone.
    Section 4.2 evaluates the more sophisticated form of subjectivity extraction that incorporates context information via the minimum-cut paradigm.
    As we will see, the use of subjectivity extracts can in the best case provide satisfying improvement in polarity classification, and otherwise can at least yield polarity-classification accuracies indistinguishable from employing the full review.
    At the same time, the extracts we create are both smaller on average than the original document and more effective as input to a default polarity classifier than the same-length counterparts produced by standard summarization tactics (
