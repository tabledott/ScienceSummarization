ons of each other, but many are bilingual paraphrases.
    For example, in the following extracted sentence pair, the English sentence has the extra phrase &#8220;under the agreement&#8221;, which is missing from the Chinese sentence: The precision of parallel sentences extraction is 65.7% for the top 2,500 pairs using our method, which has a 50% improvement over the baseline.
    In addition, we also found that the precision of parallel sentence pair extraction increases steadily over each iteration, until convergence.
    In this section, we discuss experimental results that lead to the claim that our proposed method can boost a weak IBM Model 4 EM lexical learner.
    6.3.1.
    EM lexical learning is weak on bilingual sentences from very-non-parallel corpora We compare the performances of the IBM Model 4 EM lexical learning on parallel data (130k sentence pairs from Hong Kong News) and very-non-parallel data (7200 sentence pairs from TDT3) by looking at a common set of source words and their top-N transla
