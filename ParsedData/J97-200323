n of Dictionaries.
    Very large-scale dictionaries can be represented by p-subsequential dictionaries because the number of entries and that of the ambiguities they contain are finite.
    The corresponding representation offers fast look-up since the recognition does not depend on the size of the dictionary but only on that of the input string considered.
    The minimization algorithm for sequential and p-subsequential transducers allows the size of these devices to be reduced to the minimum.
    Experiments have shown that these compact and fast look-up representations for large natural language dictionaries can be efficiently obtained.
    As an example, a French morphological dictionary of about 21.2 Mb can be compiled into a p-subsequential transducer of 1.3 Mb, in a few minutes (Mohri 1996b).
    2.4.3 Syntax.
    Finite-state machines are also currently used to represent local syntactic constraints (Silberztein 1993; Roche 1993; Karlsson et al. 1995; Mohri 1994d).
    Linguists can conveniently intr
