ccuracy result is significantly higher than the accuracy results for all of the other classifiers (in both Table 8 and Table 7).
    Finally, higher precision classification can be obtained by simply classifying a sentence as subjective if it contains any of the StrongSubjective nouns.
    On our data, this method produces 87% precision with 26% recall.
    This approach could support applications for which precision is paramount.
  
  
    Several types of research have involved document-level subjectivity classification.
    Some work identifies inflammatory texts (e.g., (Spertus, 1997)) or classifies reviews as positive or negative ((Turney, 2002; Pang et al., 2002)).
    Tong&#8217;s system (Tong, 2001) generates sentiment timelines, tracking online discussions and creating graphs of positive and negative opinion messages over time.
    Research in genre classification may include recognition of subjective genres such as editorials (e.g., (Karlgren and Cutting, 1994; Kessler et al., 1997; Wiebe et al., 20
