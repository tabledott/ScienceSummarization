  We will touch on this point again below .
  Inference The final role of the Alembic inference component is to derive new facts through the application o f carefully-controlled forward inference.
  As was the case with our MUC-5 system, the present Alembic allows only limited forward inference.
  Though the full details of this inference process are of legitimate interest i n 148 their own right, we will only note some highlights here .
  To begin with, the tractability of forward inference in this framework is guaranteed just in case the inference axioms meet a certain syntactic requirement .
  To date, all the rules we have written for even complex domains, such as the joint-venture task in MUC-5, have met this criterion.
  Aside from this theoretical bound on computation, we have found in practice that th e inference system is remarkably fast, with semantic interpret
