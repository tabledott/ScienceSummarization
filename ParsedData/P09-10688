 and labeling is to identify classes of entities that fill predicate slots; semantic roles seem like they&#8217;d be a good model for the kind of argument types we&#8217;d like to learn for narratives.
    Most work on semantic role labeling, however, is supervised, using Propbank (Palmer et al., 2005), FrameNet (Baker et al., 1998) or VerbNet (Kipper et al., 2000) as gold standard roles and training data.
    More recent learning work has applied bootstrapping approaches (Swier and Stevenson, 2004; He and Gildea, 2006), but these still rely on a hand labeled seed corpus as well as a pre-defined set of roles.
    Grenegar and Manning (2006) use the EM algorithm to learn PropBank roles from unlabeled data, and unlike bootstrapping, they don&#8217;t need a labeled corpus from which to start.
    However, they do require a predefined set of roles (arg0, arg1, etc.) to define the domain of their probabilistic model.
