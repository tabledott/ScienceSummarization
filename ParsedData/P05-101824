ring and summary evaluation tasks, by a wide margin.
    We conjecture that this difference in performance stems from the ability of our model to discriminate between various patterns of local sentence transitions.
    In contrast, the baseline model only measures the degree of overlap across successive sentences, without taking into account the properties of the entities that contribute to the overlap.
    Not surprisingly, the difference between the two methods is more pronounced for the second task &#8212; summary evaluation.
    Manual inspection of our summary corpus revealed that low-quality summaries often contain repetitive information.
    In such cases, simply knowing about high cross-sentential overlap is not sufficient to distinguish a repetitive summary from a well-formed one.
    In order to investigate the contribution of linguistic knowledge on model performance we compared the full model introduced above against models using more impoverished representations.
    We focused on three sources o
