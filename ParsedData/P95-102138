 a central role in ruling out the derivation.
    We observe in passing that the SIC associated to the d-edge in the seems d-tree also rules out this derivation.
    The derivation requires that the S node of seems be inserted into the S'/S d-edge of claims.
    However, we would have to stretch the edge over two components which are both ruled out by the SIC, since they violate the projection from seems to its S node.
    Thus, the derivation is excluded by the independently motivated SICs, which enforce the notion of projection.
    This raises the possibility that, in grammars that express certain linguistic principles, substitutability is not needed for ruling out derivations of this nature.
    We intend to examine this issue in future work. for sentence (2b).
    We use the node label VP throughout and use features such as top (for topic) to differentiate different levels of projection.
    Observe that in both trees an argument has been fronted.
    Again, we will use the SICs to enforce the projection
