 rates on the development set with the CLP-based model, but not with the LLR-base model, so we used it only with the former in our final evaluations.
	
	
			We evaluated our models using data from the bilin gual word alignment workshop held at HLT-NAACL 2003 (Mihalcea and Pedersen, 2003).
			We useda subset of the Canadian Hansards bilingual cor pus supplied for the workshop, comprising 500,000English-French sentences pairs, including 447 man ually word-aligned sentence pairs designated as test data.
			The test data annotates particular pairs ofwords either as ?sure?
			or ?possible?
			links.
			Auto matic sentence alignment of the training data wasprovided by Ulrich Germann, and the hand align ments of the words in the test data were created by Franz Och and Hermann Ney (Och and Ney, 2003).Since our discriminative training approach requires a small amount of annotated data for parame ter optimization, we split the test data set into two virtually equal subsets, by randomly ordering the test data pairs, and
