xtensive description given the literature available on it (Jelinek and Mercer, 1980).
    Since the number of parses for a given word prefix Wk grows exponentially with k,I{Tk}1 0(2k), the state space of our model is huge even for relatively short sentences so we had to use a search strategy that prunes it.
    Our choice was a synchronous multistack search algorithm which is very similar to a beam search.
    Each stack contains hypotheses &#8212; partial parses &#8212; that have been constructed by the same number of predictor and the same number of parser operations.
    The hypotheses in each stack are ranked according to the ln(P(W, T)) score, highest on top.
    The width of the search is controlled by two parameters: above pruning strategy proved to be insufficient so we chose to also discard all hypotheses whose score is more than the log-probability threshold below the score of the topmost hypothesis.
    This additional pruning step is performed after all hypotheses in stage k' have been extended wi
