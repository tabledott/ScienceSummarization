 150 instances differed from the majority case.
    Inspecting these remaining inconsistencies showed cases like: where we were inconsistent in inserting the NML node because the Penn Treebank sometimes already has the structure annotated under an NP node.
    Since we do not make changes to existing brackets, we cannot fix these cases.
    Other inconsistencies are rare, but will be examined and corrected in a future release.
    The annotator made a second pass over Section 00 to correct changes made after the beginning of the annotation process.
    Comparing the two passes can give us some idea of how the annotator changed as he grew more practiced at the task.
    We find that the old and new versions are identical in 88.65% of NPs, with labelled precision, recall and F-score being 97.17%, 76.69% and 85.72% respectively.
    This tells us that there were many brackets originally missed that were added in the second pass.
    This is not surprising since the main problem with how Section 00 was annotated
