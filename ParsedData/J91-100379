e verb (through its agent and object preferences) and the targets are the nouns.
    Semantic relations are found for each dependency.
    One way to detect the difference between metaphorical sentences such as (20) and metaphorical/anomalous ones such as (27) is in each sentence to consult the semantic vectors produced in its two main semantic dependencies and compare the matches of the relevant cells that are found by collation.
    Let us go through such an analysis using CS, starting with the first semantic dependency between subject noun and verb.
    In this semantic dependency in both (20) and (27), a relevant analogy is discovered as part of a metaphorical relation between the target car1 and animall, the agent preference of the source drinkl.
    The semantic vector in Figure 16 records the two cells that figure in that relevant analogy.
    Figure 17 shows the same information from the semantic vector but written as a statement.
    When the second semantic dependency is analyzed in (20), the target
