e proposal of Shieber (1988) which starts with all word edges leaving and entering a single vertex.
    But there is essentially no information in such a representation.
    Neither the chart nor any other special data structure is required to capture the fact that a new phrase may be constructible out of any given pair, and in either order, if they meet certain syntactic and semantic criteria.

    Interactions must be considered explicitly between new edges and all edges currently in the chart, because no indexing is used to identify the existing edges that could interact with a given new one.
    5.
    The process is exponential in the worst case because, if a sentence contains a word with k modifiers, then a it will be generated with each of the subsets of those modifiers, all but one of them being rejected when it is finally discovered that their semantics does not subsume the entire input.
    If the relative orders of the modifiers are unconstrained, matters only get worse.
