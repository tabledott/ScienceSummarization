 of clusters that are created to represent senses, and on the degree to which the distinctions correspond to different topics.
    This approach performs very well, especially with pseudowords and homographs.
    However, there is no automatic means to map the sense representations derived from the system onto the more conventional word senses found in dictionaries.
    Consequently, it does not provide disambiguated examples that can be used by other systems.
    Yarowsky (1995) has proposed automatically augmenting a small set of experimenter-supplied seed collocations (e.g., manufacturing plant and plant life for two different senses of the noun plant) into a much larger set of training materials.
    He resolved the problem of the sparseness of his collocations by iteratively bootstrapping acquisition of training materials from a few seed collocations for each sense of a homograph.
    He locates examples containing the seeds in the corpus and analyzes these to find new predictive patterns in these senten
