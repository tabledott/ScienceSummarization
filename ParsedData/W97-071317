 the first version of the modified data was higher that the one computed for the second, we decided to consider the set of 36 textual units labeled by a majority of judges with 2 as a reliable reference set of importance units for the five texts For example, units 4 and 12 from text (1) belong to this reference set Agreement between analysts.
    Once we determined the set of textual units that the judges believed to be important, we needed to determine the agreement between the analysts who built the discourse trees for the five texts Because we did not know the distribution of the importance scores derived from the discourse trees, we computed the correlation between the analysts by applying Spearman's correlation coefficient on the scores associated to each textual unit We interpreted these scores as ranks on a scale that measures the importance of the units in a text The Spearman rank correlation coefficient is an alternative to the usual correlation coefficient It is based on the ranks of the data, and n
