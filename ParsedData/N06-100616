 regression classifier with a Gaussian prior parameter for regularization.
    We also compare our learning results with those achieved by hand-setting the weight parameters for the classifier, effectively incorporating strong prior (human) knowledge into the choice of weights.
    An advantage to the use of statistical classifiers is that they can be configured to output a probability distribution over possible answers rather than just the most likely answer.
    This allows us to get confidence estimates for computing a confidence weighted score (see section 5).
    A major concern in applying machine learning techniques to this classification problem is the relatively small size of the training set, which can lead to overfitting problems.
    We address this by keeping the feature dimensionality small, and using high regularization penalties in training.
  
  
    In the entailment determination phase, the entailment problem is reduced to a representation as a vector of 28 features, over which the statisti
