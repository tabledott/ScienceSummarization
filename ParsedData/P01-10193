tics and the syntax/semantics interface have accounted for approximately nine-tenths of the development time of the English Resource Grammar (ERG), largely because the account of semantics within is so underdetermined.
    In this paper, we begin by giving a formal account of a very simplified form of the algebra and in &#167;3, we consider its interpretation.
    In &#167;4 to &#167;6, we generalize to the full algebra needed to capture the use of in the LinGO English Resource Grammar (ERG).
    Finally we conclude with some comparisons to the an

    The third element (the lzt) is a bag of elementary predications Intuitively, the hook is a record of the value in the semantic entity that can be used to fill a hole in another entity during composition.
    The holes record gaps in the semantic form which occur because it represents a syntactically unsaturated structure.
    Some structures have no holes, such as that for Kim.
    When structures are compos
