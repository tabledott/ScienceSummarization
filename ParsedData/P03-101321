ad relationships.
    We will refer to the alternative model in (8) as capturing sister-head relationships.
    Using sister-head relationships is a way of counteracting the flatness of the grammar productions; it implicitly adds binary branching to the grammar.
    Our proposal is to extend the use of sister-head relationship from non-recursive NPs (as proposed by Collins) to all categories.
    Table 4 shows the linguistic features of the resulting model compared to the models of Carroll and Rooth (1998), Collins (1997), and Charniak (2000).
    The C&amp;R model effectively includes category information about all previous sisters, as it uses contextfree rules.
    The Collins (1997) model does not use context-free rules, but generates the next category using zeroth order Markov chains (see Section 3.3), hence no information about the previous sisters is included.
    Charniak&#8217;s (2000) model extends this to higher order Markov chains (first to third order), and therefore includes category information
