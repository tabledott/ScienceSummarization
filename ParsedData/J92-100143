 by the frequency of alternative syntactic patterns in similar texts.
    Although it may not be possible to completely disambiguate all words prior to parsing, approaches based on stochastic information have been quite successful (Church 1988; Garside, Leech, and Sampson 1987; de Marcken 1990).4 To allow for the fact that the tagger may err, as part of the tagging process the system makes a second pass through the text to remove some systematic errors that result from biases common to statistical approaches.
    For example, they tend to prefer modifiers over nouns and nouns over verbs; for instance, in Example 5, the tagger erroneously marks the word need as a noun.
    You really need the Campbell Soups of the world to be interested in your magazine.
    In this second pass, the system applies a few rules derived from our grammar and resets the tags where necessary.
    For example, to correct for the noun versus verb overgeneralization, whenever a word that can be either a noun or a verb gets tagged as ju
