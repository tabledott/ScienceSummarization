 a set of thematic roles.
			The uninstantiated lexical entry may also state whether thematic roles have to be filled, whether they may be filled more than once, and whether idiosyncratic properties of the fnnetor predetermine the syntactic features of certain syntactic arguments.
			There are three types of rules that instantiate l xical entries: feature instantiation rules, valency instantiation rules, and order instantiation rules.
			An instantiated functor has an ordered valency list containing syntactic specifications of complements and adjuncts together with the appropriate semantic bindings.
			The model can account for the interspersing of complements and adjuncts as they occur in many languages including English.
			The model can also account for right-extraposition phenomena.
			t Therefore, the valency list may constain adjuncts that do not fill a thematic role of the functor but combine semantically with some constituent inside a linearily preceding member of the same valency listfi In the propos
