ccur in part because, besides minor modifications to match the bracketing for special constructions, e.g., negated infinitives, the grammar was not altered to mirror the idiosyncrasies of the WSJ bracketing.
    To increase robustness, the standard grammar has been augmented with a FRAGMENT grammar.
    This grammar parses the sentence as well-formed chunks specified by the grammar, in particular as Ss, NPs, PPs, and VPs.
    These chunks have both c-structures and f-structures corresponding to them.
    Any token that cannot be parsed as one of these chunks is parsed as a TOKEN chunk.
    The TOKENs are also recorded in the c- and f-structures.
    The grammar has a fewest-chunk method for determining the correct parse.
    For example, if a string can be parsed as two NPs and a VP or as one NP and an S, the NP-S option is chosen.
    A sample FRAGMENT c-structure and f-structure are shown in Fig.
