his will allow us to make independence assumptions for smoothing purposes without losing information, by giving analogous rules the same probability.
    Let G = (JV, T , S, R, &#952;) be a Probabilistic Context Free Grammar with nonterminal symbols JV, terminal symbols T, start symbol S E JV, set of productions R of the form N &#8212;* &#946;, N E JV, &#946; E (JV U T )*.
    Let RN indicate the subset of R whose left-hand sides are N. &#952; is a vector of length JRJ, indexed by productions N &#8212;* &#946; E R. &#952;N&#65533;&#946; specifies the probability that N rewrites to &#946;.
    We will let &#952;N indicate the subvector of &#952; corresponding to RN.
    A tied PCFG constrains a PCFG G with a tying relation, which is an equivalence relation over rules Let f(t, r) denote the number of times rule r appears in tree t, and let f(t, &#175;r) = ErE&#175;r f(t, r).
    We see that the complete data likelihood is That is, the likelihood is a product of multinomials, one for each nonterminal equivalence
