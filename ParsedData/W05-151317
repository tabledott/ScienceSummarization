or multi-class classification.
    Because of the large number of training instances, we used Yamada and Matsumoto&#8217;s idea of splitting the training instances into several parts according to POS tags, and training classifiers on each part.
    This greatly reduced the time required to train the SVMs, but even with the splitting of the training set, total training time was about 62 hours.
    Training set splitting comes with the cost of reduction in accuracy of the parser, but training a single SVM would likely take more than one week.
    Yamada and Matsumoto experienced a reduction of slightly more than 1% in dependency accuracy due to training set splitting, and we expect that a similar loss is incurred here.
    When given perfectly tagged text (gold tags extracted from the Penn Treebank), SVMpar has labeled constituent precision and recall of 87.54% and 87.61%, respectively, and dependency accuracy of 90.3% over all sentences in the test set.
    The total time required to parse the entire test set
