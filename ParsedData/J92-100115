   But first, we need to discuss the sources of knowledge that enable a system to identify these cues.
    To identify preference cues such as morphology, word frequency, collocations, semantic contexts, syntactic expectations, and conceptual relations in unrestricted texts, a system needs a large amount of knowledge in each category.
    In most cases, this just means that the understander's lexicon and conceptual hierarchy must include preference information, although processing concerns suggest moving some information out of these structures and into data modules specific to a particular process, such as identifying collocations.
    TRUMP obtains the necessary knowledge from a moderately sized lexicon (8,775 unique roots), specifically designed for use in language understanding, and a hierarchy of nearly 1,000 higher-level concepts, overlaid with approximately 40 concept-cluster definitions.
    It also uses a library of over 1,400 collocational patterns.
    We will consider each in turn.
