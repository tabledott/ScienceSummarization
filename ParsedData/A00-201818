, as that is the program from which our current parser derives.
    That parser, as stated in Figure 1, achieves an average precision/recall of 87.5.
    As noted in [5], that system is based upon a &amp;quot;tree-bank grammar&amp;quot; - a grammar read directly off the training corpus.
    This is as opposed to the &amp;quot;Markovgrammar&amp;quot; approach used in the current parser.
    Also, the earlier parser uses two techniques not employed in the current parser.
    First, it uses a clustering scheme on words to give the system a &amp;quot;soft&amp;quot; clustering of heads and sub-heads.
    (It is &amp;quot;soft&amp;quot; clustering in that a word can belong to more than one cluster with different weights - the weights express the probability of producing the word given that one is going to produce a word from that cluster.)
    Second, Char97 uses unsupervised learning in that the original system was run on about thirty million words of unparsed text, the output was taken as &amp;quot;correct&amp;qu
