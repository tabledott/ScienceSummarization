  Seeing Stars: Exploiting Class Relationships For Sentiment Categorization With Respect To Rating Scales
  
    address the wherein rather than simply decide whether a review is &#8220;thumbs up&#8221; or &#8220;thumbs down&#8221;, as in previous sentiment analysis work, one must determine an author&#8217;s evaluation with respect to a multi-point scale (e.g., one to five &#8220;stars&#8221;).
    This task represents an interesting twist on standard multi-class text categorization because there are several different degrees of similarity between class labels; for example, &#8220;three stars&#8221; is intuitively closer to &#8220;four stars&#8221; than to &#8220;one star&#8221;.
    We first evaluate human performance at task.
    Then, we apply a based on a labeling formulation of the problem, that alters a given-ary classifier&#8217;s output in an explicit attempt to ensure that similar items receive similar labels.
    We show that the meta-algorithm can provide significant improvements over both multi-c
