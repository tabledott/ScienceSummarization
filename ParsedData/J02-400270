 against one annotator, if this feature is used as the sole feature), followed by SegAgent (K = .19), Citations (K = .18), Headlines (K = .17), Agent (K = .08), and Formulaic (K = .07).
    In each case, the unclustered versions of Agent, SegAgent, and Formulaic performed much worse than the clustered versions; they did not improve final results when added into the feature pool.
    Action performs slightly better at K = &#8722;.11 than the baseline by most frequent category, but far worse than random by observed distribution.
    The following features on their own classify each sentence as OWN (and therefore achieve K = &#8722;.12): Relative Location, Paragraphs, TF*IDF, Title, Sentence Length, Modality, Tense, and Voice.
    History performs very badly on its own at K = &#8722;.51; it classifies almost all sentences as BACKGROUND.
    It does this because the probability of the first sentence&#8217;s being a BACKGROUND sentence is almost one, and, if no other information is available, it is very likely tha
