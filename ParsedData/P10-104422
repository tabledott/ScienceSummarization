    Figure 3 plots the precision-recall curve for the pseudo-disambiguation experiment comparing the three different topic models.
    LDA-SP, which uses LinkLDA, substantially outperforms both IndependentLDA and JointLDA.
    Next, in figure 4, we compare LDA-SP with mutual information and Jaccard similarities using both the generalization and primary corpus for computation of similarities.
    We find LDA-SP significantly outperforms these methods.
    Its edge is most noticed at high precisions; it obtains 85% more recall at 0.9 precision compared to mutual information.
    Overall LDA-SP obtains an 15% increase in the area under precision-recall curve over mutual information.
    All three systems&#8217; AUCs are shown in Table 2; LDA-SP&#8217;s improvements over both Jaccard and mutual information are highly significant with a significance level less than 0.01 using a paired t-test.
    In addition to a superior performance in selectional preference evaluation LDA-SP also produces a set of cohere
