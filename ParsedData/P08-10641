    Phrase-based modeling method (Koehn et al., 2003; Och and Ney, 2004a) is a simple, but powerful mechanism to machine translation since it can model local reorderings and translations of multiword expressions well.
    However, it cannot handle long-distance reorderings properly and does not exploit discontinuous phrases and linguistically syntactic structure features (Quirk and Menezes, 2006).
    Recently, many syntax-based models have been proposed to address the above deficiencies 2003).
    Although good progress has been reported, the fundamental issues in applying linguistic syntax to SMT, such as non-isomorphic tree alignment, structure reordering and non-syntactic phrase modeling, are still worth well studying.
    In this paper, we propose a tree-to-tree translation model that is based on tree sequence alignment.
    It is designed to combine the strengths of phrase-based and syntax-based methods.
    The proposed model adopts tree
