on (in fact, it is easy to see that M(f)  is the number of occurrences off in  the total French text), we could then estimate the probability P(e, J f ) of translating the word f by the word e, by the fraction C(e, , f ) /M(f) .
  The problem with the above approach is that it relies on correct identification of the translates of French words, i.e., on the solution of a significant part of tile translation problem.
  In the absence of such identification, the obvious recourse is to profess complete ignorance, beyond knowing that the translate is one of the words of the corresponding English sentence, each of its words being equally likely.
  Step 2 of the above algorithm then must be changed to 2.
  Find the Jth occurrence of the word f in  the French text.
  Let it take place in the Kth sentence, and let the Kth English sentence consist of words e,,, e,~, ..., e,?.
  Then increment he counters C(e,,,f), C(e,,,f) ..... C(o,o,f) by tire fraction 1/n.
  This second approach is based on tile faith that in a larg
