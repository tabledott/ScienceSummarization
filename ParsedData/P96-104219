0 committee members, was demonstrated in (Dagan and Engelson, 1995).
    Here we present and compare results for batch, randomized, thresholded, and two member committee-based selection.
    Figure 1 presents the results of comparing the several selection methods against each other.
    The plots shown are for the best parameter settings that we found through manual tuning for each method.
    Figure 1(a) shows the advantage that sample selection gives with regard to annotation cost.
    For example, complete training requires annotated examples containing 98,000 ambiguous words to achieve a 92.6% accuracy (beyond the scale of the graph), while the selective methods require only 18,000-25,000 ambiguous words to achieve this accuracy.
    We also find test set, comparable to other published results on bigram tagging. that, to a first approximation, all selection methods considered give similar results.
    Thus, it seems that a refined choice of the selection method is not crucial for achieving large reduction
