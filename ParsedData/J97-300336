for the subcategory of capitalized unknown words separately.
    The error rate for a category of words was calculated as follows: Total _Words _in _Set _X Wrongly _Tagged _Words _from _Set _X Thus, for instance, the error rate of tagging the unknown words is the proportion of the mistagged unknown words to all unknown words.
    To see the distribution of the workload between different guessing rule sets we also measured the coverage of a guessing rule set: We collected the error and coverage measures for each of the fifteen subcorpora8 of the Brown Corpus separately, and, using the bootstrap replicate technique (Efron and Tibshirani 1993), we calculated the mean and the standard error for each combination of the taggers with the guessing components.
    For the fifteen accuracy means {cii, J12, , (65} obtained upon tagging the fifteen subcorpora of the Brown Corpus, we generated a large number of bootstrap replicates of the form {b1, b2,.
    , b15} where each mean was randomly chosen with replacements such
