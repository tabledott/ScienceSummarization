e AST.
    In what follows, we will refer to these sentence pairs as anchors.
    As before, it is convenient to think of the AST as a rectangular array, even though it is represented more economically in the program.
    Consider a maximal sequence of empty AST entries, that is, a sequence of sentences in one text for which there are no associated sentences in the other, but which is bounded above and below by an anchor.
    The new associations that are added lie on and adjacent to the diagonal joining the two anchors.
    The distance from the diagonal is a function of the distance of the current candidate sentence pair and the nearest anchor.
    The function is the same one used in the construction of the initial AST.
    As we said earlier, the basic alignment algorithm treats words as atoms; that is, it treats strings as instances of the same word if they consist of identical sequences of letters, and otherwise as totally different.
    The effect of this is that morphological variants of a word are no
