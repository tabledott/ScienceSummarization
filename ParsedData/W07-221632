etween ever pair of nodes, each edge taking on a label representing a single element of the set A U B U C. Now, define k 000wk0 We show below that there exists a bijection between the set of valid 3DMs for S and the set of nonzero weighted dependency graphs in T(G).
    First, it is easy to show that for any 3DM S0, there is a representative dependency graph that has a weight of 1.
    This graph simply consists of the edges (0, a)b, (a, b)c, and (b, c)c, for all (a, b, c) E S0, plus an arbitrarily labeled edge from 00 to 0.
    To prove the reverse, consider a graph with weight 1.
    This graph must have a weight 1 edge into the node a of the form (0, a)b since the graph must be spanning.
    By the definition of the weight function, in any non-zero weighted tree, a must have a single outgoing edge, and that edge must be directed into the node b. Let&#8217;s say that this edge is (a, b)c. Then again by the weighting function, in any nonzero weighted graph, b must have a single outgoing edge that is directed
