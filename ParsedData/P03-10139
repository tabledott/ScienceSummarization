  Our main hypothesis was that the lexicalized models will outperform the unlexicalized baseline model.
    Another prediction was that adding Negra-specific information to the models will increase parsing performance.
    We therefore tested a model variant that included grammatical function labels, i.e., the set of categories was augmented by the function tags specified in Negra (see Section 2.2).
    Adding grammatical functions is a way of dealing with the wordorder facts of German (see Section 2.1) in the face of Negra&#8217;s very flat annotation scheme.
    For instance, subject and object NPs have different wordorder preferences (subjects tend to be preverbal, while objects tend to be postverbal), a fact that is captured if subjects have the label NP-SB, while objects are labeled NP-OA (accusative object), NP-DA (dative object), etc.
    Also the fact that verb order differs between subordinate and main clauses is captured by the function labels: the former are labeled S, while the latter are labeled
