ions, and the human could make the final decision on whether to accept the proposals.
    This approach resembles the work by Grishman et al. (1986) and Hirschman et al.
    (1975) on selectional restrictions.
    The semantic conditions that pass could even ultimately be associated with probabilities, obtained by frequency counts on their occurrences.
    There is obviously a great deal more work to be done in this important area.
  
  
    This section addresses some performance measures for a grammar, including coverage, portability, perplexity, and trainability.
    Perplexity, roughly defined as the geometric mean of the number of alternative word hypotheses that may follow each word in the sentence, is of particular concern in spoken language tasks.
    Portability and trainability concern the ease with which an existing grammar can be ported to a new task, as well as the amount of training data necessary before the grammar is able to generalize well to unseen data.
    To date, four distinct domain-spe
