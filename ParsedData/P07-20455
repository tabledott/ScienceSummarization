nguage is prone to speech recognition errors, which can possibly corrupt the syntax and the meaning of the input.
    There is also empirical evidence that better translations can be obtained from transcriptions of the speech recognizer which resulted in lower scores.
    This suggests that improvements can be achieved by applying machine translation on a large set of transcription hypotheses generated by the speech recognizers and by combining scores of acoustic models, language models, and translation models.
    Recently, approaches have been proposed for improving translation quality through the processing of multiple input hypotheses.
    We have implemented in Moses confusion network decoding as discussed in (Bertoldi and Federico 2005), and developed a simpler translation model and a more efficient implementation of the search algorithm.
    Remarkably, the confusion network decoder resulted in an extension of the standard text decoder.
