   The model was motivated by the observation that longer regions of text tend to have longer translations, and that shorter regions of text tend to have shorter translations.
    In particular, we found that the correlation between the length of a paragraph in characters and the length of its translation was extremely high (0.991).
    This high correlation suggests that length might be a strong clue for sentence alignment.
    Although this method is extremely simple, it is also quite accurate.
    Overall, there was a 4.2% error rate on 1316 alignments, averaged over both English&#8212;French and English&#8212;German data.
    In addition, we find that the probability score is a good predictor of accuracy, and consequently, it is possible to select a subset of 80% of the alignments with a much smaller error rate of only 0.7%.
    The method is also fairly language-independent.
    Both English&#8212;French and English&#8212; German data were processed using the same parameters.
    If necessary, it is poss
