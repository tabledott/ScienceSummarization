on is the key to breaking the bottleneck of semantic representation that is currently the single greatest limitation on the general application of natural language processing techniques.
    In this paper we specifically address questions of polysemy with respect to verbs, and how regular extensions of meaning can be achieved through the adjunction of particular syntactic phrases.
    We base these regular extensions on a fine-grained variation on Levin classes, intersective Levin classes, as a source of semantic components associated with specific adjuncts.
    We also examine similar classes in Portuguese, and the predictive powers of alternations in this language with respect to the same semantic components.
    The difficulty of determining a suitable lexical representation becomes multiplied when more than one language is involved and attempts are made to map between them.
    Preliminary investigations have indicated that a straightforward translation of Levin classes into other languages is not feasibl
