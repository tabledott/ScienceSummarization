			We approach this as a standard classificationproblem for supervised machine learning.
			The al gorithm takes as input a training set of word pairs with class labels and a testing set of word pairs without labels.
			Each word pair is represented as a vector in a feature space and a supervised learning algorithm is used to classify the feature vectors.
			The elements in the feature vectors are based on the frequencies of automatically defined patterns in a large corpus.
			The output of the algorithm is anassignment of labels to the word pairs in the test ing set.
			For some of the experiments, we selecta unique label for each word pair; for other ex periments, we assign probabilities to each possible label for each
