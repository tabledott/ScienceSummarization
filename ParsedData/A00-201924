course, Word97 detects many kinds of errors that ALEK does not.
    Research has been reported on grammar checkers specifically designed for an ESL population.
    These have been developed by hand, based on small training and test sets.
    Schneider and McCoy (1998) developed a system tailored to the error productions of American Sign Language signers.
    This system was tested on 79 sentences containing determiner and agreement errors, and 101 grammatical sentences.
    We calculate that their precision was 78% with 54% recall.
    Park, Palmer and Washburn (1997) adapted a categorial grammar to recognize &amp;quot;classes of errors [that] dominate&amp;quot; in the nine essays they inspected.
    This system was tested on eight essays, but precision and recall figures are not reported.
  
  
    The unsupervised techniques that we have presented for inferring negative evidence are effective in recognizing grammatical errors in written text.
    Preliminary results indicate that ALEK's error detection is p
