e saving to the comb vector representation suggested by Aho, Sethi, and Ullman (1986:244ff) for unambiguous grammars (see Klein and Martin [19891 for a survey of representation techniques).
    The parse table for the ANLT grammar occupies approximately 360 Kbytes of memory, and so represents each action (shift, reduce, or goto) in an average of less than 2.3 bits.
    In contrast to conventional techniques, though, we maintain a faithful representation of the parse table, not replacing error entries with more convenient nonerror ones in order to save extra space.
    Our parsers are thus able to detect failures as soon as theoretically possible, an important efficiency feature when parsing nondeterministically with ambiguous grammars, and a time-saving feature when parsing interactively with them (see next section).
    Table 1 compares the size of the LALR(1) parse table for the ANLT grammar with others reported in the literature.
    From these figures, the ANLT grammar is more than twice the size of Tomit
