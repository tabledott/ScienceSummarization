 many features in addition to the relation-argument co-occurrence frequencies used by other methods.
    They automatically generated positive and negative examples by selecting arguments having high and low mutual information with the relation.
    Since it is a discriminative approach it is amenable to feature engineering, but needs to be retrained and tuned for each task.
    On the other hand, generative models produce complete probability distributions of the data, and hence can be integrated with other systems and tasks in a more principled manner (see Sections 4.2.2 and 4.3.1).
    Additionally, unlike LDA-SP Bergsma et al.&#8217;s system doesn&#8217;t produce human-interpretable topics.
    Finally, we note that LDA-SP and Bergsma&#8217;s system are potentially complimentary &#8211; the output of LDA-SP could be used to generate higher-quality training data for Bergsma, potentially improving their results.
    Topic models such as LDA (Blei et al., 2003) and its variants have recently begun to see use
