n be easily included in the search procedure, since the input sentence positions can be processed in any order.
    The work presented in Berger et al. (1996) that is based on the A* concept, however, introduces word reordering restrictions in order to reduce the overall search space.
    The search procedure presented in this article is based on a DP algorithm to solve the traveling-salesman problem (TSP).
    A data-driven beam search approach is presented on the basis of this DP-based algorithm.
    The cities in the TSP correspond to source positions of the input sentence.
    By imposing constraints on the possible word reorderings similar to that described in Berger et al. (1996), the DP-based approach becomes more effective: when the constraints are applied, the number of word reorderings is greatly reduced.
    The original reordering constraint in Berger et al. (1996) is shown to be a special case of a more general restriction scheme in which the word reordering constraints are expressed in terms of
