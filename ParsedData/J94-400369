    This type of information resembles the information that is defined for lexical items in lexicalist approaches for grammars, such as possible subcategorization frames of a word.
    The major difference is that Hearst captures probabilistic preferences of senses for such syntactic constructs.
    Grammatical formalisms, on the other hand, usually specify only which constructs are possible and at most distinguish between optional and obligatory ones.
    Therefore the information recorded in such grammars cannot distinguish between different senses of a word that potentially have the same subcategorization frames, though in practice each sense might have different probabilistic preferences for different syntactic constructs.
    It is clear that each of the different types of information provides some information that is not captured by the others.
    However, as the acquisition and manipulation of each type of information requires different tools and resources, it is important to assess the relative c
