    In this paper, I have presented a uniform characterization of discourse anaphora in a way that includes definite pronouns, definite NPs, and tensed clauses.
    In doing so, I have argued that the successful use of discourse anaphors depends on two different things: 1. speakers' and listeners' (mutual) beliefs about the ontology of the things and events being discussed, and 2. speakers' and listeners' (mutual) focus of attention.
    The former implicates semantics in the explanation of discourse anaphora, the latter, discourse itself.
    It is important that we as researchers recognize these as two separate systems, as the properties of discourse as an explanatory device are very different from those of semantics.
