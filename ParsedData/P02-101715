  CCM is doing quite well at 71.1%, substantially better than right-branching structure.
    One common issue with grammar induction systems is a tendency to chunk in a bottom-up fashion.
    Especially since the CCM does not model recursive structure explicitly, one might be concerned that the high overall accuracy is due to a high accuracy on short-span constituents.
    Figure 5 shows that this is not true.
    Recall drops slightly for mid-size constituents, but longer constituents are as reliably proposed as short ones.
    Another effect illustrated in this graph is that, for span 2, constituents have low precision for their recall.
    This contrast is primarily due to the single largest difference between the system&#8217;s induced structures and those in the treebank: the treebank does not parse into NPs such as DT JJ NN, while our system does, and generally does so correctly, identifying N units like JJ NN.
    This overproposal drops span-2 precision.
    In contrast, figure 5 also shows the F1 for
