thm.As models increase in complexity, so does the un certainty over parameter estimates.
			In this regime, point estimates are unreliable since they do not take into account the fact that there are different amountsof uncertainty in the various components of the pa rameters.
			The HDP-PCFG is a Bayesian model which naturally handles this uncertainty.
			We present an efficient variational inference algorithm for theHDP-PCFG based on a structured mean-field ap proximation of the true posterior over parameters.The algorithm is similar in form to EM and thus inherits its simplicity, modularity, and efficiency.
			Un like EM, however, the algorithm is able to take theuncertainty of parameters into account and thus in corporate the DP prior.Finally, we develop an extension of the HDP PCFG for grammar refinement (HDP-PCFG-GR).Since treebanks generally consist of coarselylabeled context-free tree structures, the maximum likelihood treebank grammar is typically a poormodel as it makes overly strong independence as
