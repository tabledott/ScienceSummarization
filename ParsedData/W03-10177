tence classification of opinions builds upon the earlier work by using extended lexical models with additional features.
    Unlike the work cited above, we do not rely on human annotations for training but only on weak metadata provided at the document level.
    Our sentence-level classifiers introduce additional criteria for detecting subjective material (opinions), including methods based on sentence similarity within a topic and an approach that relies on multiple classifiers.
    At the document level, our classifier uses the same document labels that the method of (Wiebe et al., 2002) does, but automatically detects the words and phrases of importance without further analysis of the text.
    For determining whether an opinion sentence is positive or negative, we have used seed words similar to those produced by (Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown, 1997) and extended them to construct a much larger set of semantically oriented words with a method similar to that proposed by (Turney, 2002).
    Our focus is o
