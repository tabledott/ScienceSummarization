    Using a bigram language model and assuming Bayes decision rule, we finally obtain the following search criterion for equation (1).
    For the above equation, we assume the segFinally, the SMS normalization model consists of two sub-models: a word-based language model (LM), characterized by P(en  |en&#8722;1 ) and a phrasebased lexical mapping model (channel model), characterized by P ( s k  |e For the phrase-based model training, the sentence-aligned SMS corpus needs to be aligned first at the phrase level.
    The maximum likelihood approach, through EM algorithm and Viterbi search (Dempster et al., 1977) is employed to infer such an alignment.
    Here, we make a reasonable assumption on the alignment unit that a single SMS word can be mapped to a sequence of contiguous English words, but not vice verse.
    The EM algorithm for phrase alignment is illustrated in Figure 1 and is formulated by equation (8).
    The Expectation-Maximization Algorithm The alignment process given in equation (8) is di
