    Existing work in the same realm falls into two classes: the development of resources for specific phenomena or the annotation of corpora.
    An example of the former is Berkeley&#8217;s FrameNet project (Baker et al., 1998), which produces rich semantic frames, annotating a set of examples for each predicator (including verbs, nouns and adjectives), and describing the network of relations among the semantic frames.
    An example of the latter type is the Salsa project (Burchardt et al., 2004), which produced a German lexicon based on the FrameNet semantic frames and annotated a large German newswire corpus.
    A second example, the Prague Dependency Treebank (Hajic et al., 2001), has annotated a large Czech corpus with several levels of (tectogrammatical) representation, including parts of speech, syntax, and topic/focus information structure.
    Finally, the IL-Annotation project (Reeder et al., 2004) focused on the representations required to support a series of increas
