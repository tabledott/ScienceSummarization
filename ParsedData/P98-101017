l parameter settings.
    In experimenting with the maximum context size parameter, we found that the difference between the values of Fo for context sizes of 2 and 3 is less than 0.5% for the optimal threshold.
    Scores for a context size of 1 yielded Fo values smaller by more than 1% than the values for the larger contexts.
    Figure 2 shows recall/precision curves for the three data sets, obtained by varying 9 while keeping the maximum context size at its optimal value.
    The difference between Fo=1 values for different thresholds was always less than 2%.
    Performance may be measured also on a word-by word basis, counting as a success any word which was identified correctly as being part of the target pattern.
    That method was employed, along with recall/precision, by RM95.
    We preferred to measure performance by recall and precision for complete patterns.
    Most errors involved identifications of slightly shifted, shorter or longer sequences.
    Given a pattern consisting of five words, f
