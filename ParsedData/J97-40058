es at the same time-step: each process evolves independently.
    If we permit re-entrancies, that is, if we permit processes to re-merge, we generally introduce context-sensitivity.
    In order to re-merge, processes must be &amp;quot;in synch,&amp;quot; which is to say, they cannot evolve in complete independence of one another.
    Random fields are a particular class of multidimensional random processes, that is, processes corresponding to probability distributions over an arbitrary graph.
    The theory of random fields can be traced back to Gibbs (1902); indeed, the probability distributions involved are known as Gibbs distributions.
    To my knowledge, the first application of random fields to natural language was Mark et al. (1992).
    The problem of interest was how to combine a stochastic contextfree grammar with n-gram language models.
    In the resulting structures, the probability of choosing a particular word is constrained simultaneously by the syntactic tree in which it appears and the cho
