utes on the 1 million words of the Penn Treebank, and tags slightly faster than TNT.
    Since the taggers share many common features, one might think they are not different enough for effective co-training to be possible.
    In fact, both taggers are sufficiently different for co-training to be effective.
    Section 4 shows that both taggers can benefit significantly from the information contained in the other&#8217;s output.
    The performance of the taggers on section 00 of the WSJ Penn Treebank is given in Table 1, for different seed set sizes (number of sentences).
    The seed data is taken from sections 2&#8211;21 of the Treebank.
    The table shows that the performance of TNT is significantly better than the performance of C&amp;C when the size of the seed data is very small.
  
  
    The co-training framework uses labelled examples from one tagger as additional training data for the other.
    For the purposes of this paper, a labelled example is a tagged sentence.
    We chose complete sentence
