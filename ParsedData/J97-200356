 the following way: According to the definition of d, we have: Mohri Transducers in Language and Speech Lemma 4 Let T' be the transducer obtained from T by pushing.
    T' is a subsequential transducer which realizes the same function as T. This proves the lemma.
    0 The following theorem defines the minimization algorithm.
    Let T be a subsequential transducer realizing a power series on the tropical semiring.
    Then applying the following two operations: leads to a minimal transducer.
    This minimal transducer is exactly the one defined in the proof of theorem 14.
    The automata minimization step in the theorem consists of considering pairs of input labels and associated weights as a single label and of applying classical minimization algorithms for automata (Aho, Hoperoft, and Ullman 1974).
    We do not give the proof of the theorem; it can be proved in a way similar to what is indicated in Mohri (1994b).
    In general, there are several distinct minimal subsequential transducers realizing the
