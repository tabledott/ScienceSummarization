ins or Interesse according to its sense, but both of these senses are translated into English as interest, and so we make no attempt to distinguish them.
  
  
    Following Brown et al. [Brown et al., 1994 we choose as the translation of a French sentence F that sentence E for which Pr (EIF) is greatest.
    By Bayes' rule, Since the denominator does not depend on E, the sentence for which Pr (EIF) is greatest is also the sentence for which the product Pr (E) Pr (FIE) is greatest.
    The first factor in this product is a statistical characterization of the English language and the second factor is a statistical characterization of the process by which English sentences are translated into French.
    We can compute neither factors precisely.
    Rather, in statistical translation, we employ models from which we can obtain estimates of these values.
    We call the model from which we compute Pr (E) the language model and that from which we compute Pr (FIE) the translation model.
    The translation model us
