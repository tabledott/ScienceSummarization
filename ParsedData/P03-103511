as FSTs.
    For all S&#8217; &#10065; S, if it can be parsed using G, we assume P(S&#8217;|FT) = 1, and tagged S&#8217; as a factoid candidate.
    As the example in Figure 1 shows, &#21313;&#20108;&#28857;&#19977;&#21313;&#20998; is a factoid (time) candidate with the class model probability P(&#21313;&#20108; &#28857;&#19977;&#21313;&#20998;|TIME) =1, and &#21313;&#20108; and &#19977;&#21313; are also factoid (number) candidates, with P(&#21313;&#20108; |NUM) = P(&#19977;&#21313;|NUM) =1 &#10065; Named entities: For each type of named entities, we use a set of grammars and statistical models to generate candidates as described in Section 5.2.
    In our system, the morphologically derived words are generated using five morphological patterns: (1) affixation: &#26379;&#21451;&#20204; (friend - plural) &#8216;friends&#8217;; (2) reduplication: &#39640;&#20852; &#8216;happy&#8217; 4 &#39640;&#39640;&#20852;&#20852; &#8216;happily&#8217;; (3) merging: &#19978;&#29677; &#8216;on duty&#8217; + &#19979;&#29677; &
