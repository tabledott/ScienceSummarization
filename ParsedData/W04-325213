oid excessive growth of the graph size by adding all possible combinations of sequences consisting of more than one lexical unit (ngrams), we consider only single words as candidates for addition to the graph, with multi-word keywords being eventually reconstructed in the post-processing phase.
    Next, all lexical units that pass the syntactic filter are added to the graph, and an edge is added between those lexical units that co-occur within a window of words.
    After the graph is constructed (undirected unweighted graph), the score associated with each vertex is set to an initial value of 1, and the ranking algorithm described in section 2 is run on the graph for several iterations until it converges &#8211; usually for 20-30 iterations, at a threshold of 0.0001.
    Once a final score is obtained for each vertex in the graph, vertices are sorted in reversed order of their score, and the top vertices in the ranking are retained for post-processing.
    While may be set to any fixed value, usually rangin
