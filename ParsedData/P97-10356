s objective structure, other novel aspects of PARADISE include the use of the Kappa coefficient (Carletta, 1996; Siegel and Castellan, 1988) to operationalize task success, and the use of linear regression to quantify the relative contribution of the success and cost factors to user satisfaction.
    The remainder of this section explains the measures (ovals in Figure 1) used to operationalize the set of objectives, and the methodology for estimating a quantitative performance function that reflects the objective structure.
    Section 2.1 describes PARADISE's task representation, which is needed to calculate the task-based success measure described in Section 2.2.
    Section 2.3 describes the cost measures considered in PARADISE, which reflect both the efficiency and the naturalness of an agent's dialogue behaviors.
    Section 2.4 describes the use of linear regression and user satisfaction to estimate the relative contribution of the success and cost measures in a single performance function.
    Finally,
