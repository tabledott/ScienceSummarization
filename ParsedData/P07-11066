    By defining features, a segmented sentence models, we adapt the perceptron discriminative is mapped into a global feature vector, in which each learning algorithm to the CWS problem.
    Collins dimension represents the count of a particular fea(2002) proposed the perceptron as an alternative to ture in the sentence.
    The term &#8220;global&#8221; feature vecthe CRF method for HMM-style taggers.
    However, tor is used by Collins (2002) to distinguish between our model does not map the segmentation problem feature count vectors for whole sequences and the to a tag sequence learning problem, but defines fea- &#8220;local&#8221; feature vectors in ME tagging models, which tures on segmented sentences directly.
    Hence we are Boolean valued vectors containing the indicator use a beam-search decoder during training and test- features for one element in the sequence. ing; our idea is similar to tha
