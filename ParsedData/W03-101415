ut a dry topic such as stock prices, and the sentence becomes subjective.
    Conversely, add objective topics to a sentence containing two strongly subjective words such as odious and scumbag, and the sentence remains subjective.
    The performance of the high-precision objective classifier is a bit lower than the subjective classifier: 82.6%precision and 16.4% recall on the test set mentioned above (that is, 82.6% of the sentences selected by the objective classifier are objective, and the objective classifier found 16.4% of the objective sentences in the test set).
    Although there is room for improvement, the performance proved to be good enough for our purposes.
    To automatically learn extraction patterns that are associated with subjectivity, we use a learning algorithm similar to AutoSlog-TS (Riloff, 1996).
    For training, AutoSlogTS uses a text corpus consisting of two distinct sets of texts: &#8220;relevant&#8221; texts (in our case, subjective sentences) and &#8220;irrelevant&#8221; texts (i
