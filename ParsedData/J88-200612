Sidner (1983) DFs always are stacked for possible resumption later.
    In Grosz and Sidner (1986) it is an entire focus space (FS) (Grosz 1977) that gets stacked (i.e., the collection of entities L is attending to by virtue of the current discourse segment (DS)) but only when the 9purpose of the current DS is taken to dominate that of the one upcoming.
    Dominance relations are also specified further according to the type of discourse.
    In Grosz and Sidner, they are defined for task-related dialogues and arguments.
    For example, in arguments, one DS purpose (DSP) dominates another if the second provides evidence for a point made in the first.
    When the dominated DSP is satisfied, its corresponding FS is popped.
    This stack mechanism models the listener's attentional state.
    The relations between DSPs constitute the intentional structure of the text.
    Getting a listener to resume a DS via the stack mechanism is taken to require less effort on a speaker's part than returning to elaborate an
