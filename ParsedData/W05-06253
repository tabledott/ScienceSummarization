the arguments supplied by the argument identification stage.
    To reduce the excessive candidates mistakenly output by the previous stage, the classifier can also classify the argument as NULL (&#8220;not an argument&#8221;) to discard the argument.
    The features used here are the same as those used in the argument identification stage with the following additional features.
    The purpose of this stage is to incorporate some prior linguistic and structural knowledge, such as &#8220;arguments do not overlap&#8221; or &#8220;each verb takes at most one argument of each type.&#8221; This knowledge is used to resolve any inconsistencies of argument classification in order to generate final legitimate predictions.
    We use the inference process introduced by (Punyakanok et al., 2004).
    The process is formulated as an integer linear programming (ILP) problem that takes as inputs the confidences over each type of the arguments supplied by the argument classifier.
    The output is the optimal solution th
