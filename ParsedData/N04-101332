    Gildea and Palmer (2002) report F-score results in the 55% range for argument and boundary recognition based on automatic parses.
    From this perspective, the nearly 75% F-score that is achieved for our deterministic rewriting of Collins&#8217; trees into dependencies is remarkable, even if the results are not directly comparable.
    Our scores and Gildea and Palmer&#8217;s are both substantially lower than the 90% typically cited for evaluations based on labeled or unlabeled bracketing, suggesting that extracting semantically relevant dependencies is a more difficult, but we think more valuable, task.
