ebank constituents .1&#176; As a point of comparison, in (SR093) an experiment was done using the inside-outside algorithm on a corpus of WSJ sentences of length 1-15.
    Training was carried out on a corpus of 1,095 sentences, and an accuracy of 90.2% was obtained in bracketing a test set.
    In the corpus we used for the experiments of sentence length 2-15, the mean sentence length was 10.80.
    In the corpus used for the experiment of sentence length 2-25, the mean length was 16.82.
    As would be expected, performance degrades somewhat as sentence length increases.
    In table 3, we show the percentage of sentences in the test corpus that have no crossing constituents, and the percentage that have only a very small number of crossing constituents.'
    We next ran an experiment to determine what performance could be achieved if we dropped the initial right-linear assumption.
    Using the same training and test sets as above, sentences were initially assigned a random binary-branching structure, with
