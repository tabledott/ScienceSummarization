 a phrase with the spans of its modifier constituents, and &#8220;Modifier Crossings&#8221; refers to the case where we compare the spans of pairs of modifiers.
    The &#8220;Phrasal Translations&#8221; line shows the average number of phrasal translations detected per sentence.
    For S alignments, the results are quite promising, with an average of only 0.236 head crossings per sentence and an even smaller average for modifier crossings (0.056).
    However, these results are overly optimistic since often many words in a sentence will not have an S alignment at all, such as &#8220;coming&#8221;, &#8220;in&#8221;, and &#8220;before&#8221; in following example: the full report will be coming in before the fall le rapport complet sera d&#180;epos&#180;e de ici le automne prochain When we use P alignments for these unaligned words (the S P case), we get a more meaningful result.
