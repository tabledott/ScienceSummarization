hers have suggested using them for improving lexical acquisition.
    Korhonen (1997) uses them in subcategorization frame (scF) acquisition to improve the performance of a statistical filter which determines whether a SCF observed for a particular verb is genuine or not.
    They have also been suggested for the recovery of predicate argument structure, necessary for SCF acquisition (Briscoe and Carroll, 1997; Boguraev and Briscoe, 1987).
    And Ribas (1995) showed that selectional preferences acquired using alternations performed better on a word sense disambiguation task compared to preferences acquired without alternations.
    He used alternations to indicate where the argument head data from different slots can be combined since it occupies the same semantic relationship with the predicate.
    Different diathesis alternations give different emphasis and nuances of meaning to the same basic content.
    These subtle changes of meaning are important in natural language generation (Stede, 1998).
