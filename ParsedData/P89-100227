 form or generation.
    For instance, in our hypothetical example, the string 'John eats' will be generated for semantics eat(john, banana).
    The solution is to test at the end of the generation procedure whether the feature structure that is found is complete with respect to the original feature structure.
    However, because of the way in which top-down information is used, it is unclear what semantic information is derived by the rules themselves, and what semantic information is available because of unifications with the original semantics.
    For this reason, socalled &amp;quot;shadow&amp;quot; variables are added to the generator that represent the feature structure derived by the grammar itself.
    Furthermore a copy of the semantics of the original feature structure is made at the start of the generation process.
    Completeness is achieved by testing whether the semantics of the shadow is subsumed by the copy.
    We will outline here how to generate from a quantified logical form sentences w
