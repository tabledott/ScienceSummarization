analysis for the MAN and RAND subsets here.
			Please refer to the task website for these results.
			5 We retain the same ordering for the further analysis tables when we look at subsets of the data.
			Although there are further differences in the systems which would warrant reranking on anindividual analysis, since we combined the subanal yses in one table we keep the order as for 1 and 4 respectively for ease of comparison.There is some variation in rank order of the sys tems depending on which measures are used.
			6 KUis highest ranking on R for best.
			UNT is best at find ing the mode, particularly on oot, though it is the most complicated system exploiting a great many knowledge sources and components.
			IRST2 does well at finding the mode in best.
			The IRST2 best R score is lower because it supplied many answers for each item however it achieves the best R score on the oot task.
			The baselines are outperformed by most systems.
			The WordNet baseline outperformsthose derived from distributional
