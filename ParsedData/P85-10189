t as little as possible to a particular grammar or style of grammar.
    = Furthermore, the grammar designer should not be held down in building an analysis by limitations of the algorithms.
    Thus a solution requiring careful crafting of grammars is inadequate.
    Finally, specialized parsing algorithms eau he designed that make use of information about the part Hilar grammar being parsed to eliminate spurious edges or hypotheses.
    Rather than using a general parsing algorithm on a limited formalism, Ford, Bresnan, and Kaplan [2] chose a specialized algorithm working on grammars in the full LFG formalism to model syntactic preferences.
    Current work at Hewlett-Packard on parsing recent variants of GPSG seems to take this line as well.
    Again, we feel that the separation of burden is inappropriate in such an attack, especially in a grammar-development context.
    Coupling the grammar design and parser design problems in this way leads to the linguistic and technological problems becoming inherent
