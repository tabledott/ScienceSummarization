 to apply a parser to many treebanks.
    We hope that this shared task will improve the situation by introducing a uniform approach to dependency parsing.
    See Section 3 for the detailed task definition and Section 4 for information about the conversion of all 13 treebanks.
    In this shared task, participants had two to three months3 to implement a parsing system that could be trained for all these languages and four days to parse unseen test data for each.
    19 participant groups submitted parsed test data.
    Of these, all but one parsed all 12 required languages and 13 also parsed the optional Bulgarian data.
    A wide variety of parsing approaches were used: some are extensions of previously published approaches, others are new.
    See Section 5 for an overview.
    Systems were scored by computing the labeled attachment score (LAS), i.e. the percentage of &#8220;scoring&#8221; tokens for which the system had predicted the correct head and dependency label.
    Punctuation tokens were excluded
