recall Precision = Rc/R Recall = Rc/Kwhere Rc is number of correct answers in the response, R the total number of answers in the re sponse, and K the total number of answers in the key.
			For the relaxed scoring scheme, precision and recall are defined as Precision = Rcw/R Recall = Rcw/K where Rcw reflects the weighted number of correctanswers.
			A response is not simply counted as 1 (correct) or 0 (incorrect), but is assigned one of the val ues in table 1.

			For example, assigning VAGUE as the relation type for every temporal relation results in a precision of 0.33.

			Three of the teams used statistics exclusively, one used arule-based system and th
