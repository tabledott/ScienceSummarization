ich will then be converted to a target language string by applying a set of tree-to-string transformation rules.
    For example, consider the following example translating from Chinese to English: &#8220;Bush held a meeting2 with Sharon1&#8221; Figure 2 shows how this process works.
    The Chinese sentence (a) is first parsed into a parse tree (b), which will be converted into an English string in 5 steps.
    First, at the root node, we apply rule r1 shown in Figure 1, which translates the Chinese coordination construction (&#8220;... and ...&#8221;) into an English prepositional phrase.
    Then, from step (c) we continue applying rules to untranslated Chinese subtrees, until we get the complete English translation in (e).2 Sh&#175;al&#180;ong Bush held a meeting with Sharon More formally, a (tree-to-string) translation rule (Galley et al., 2004; Huang et al., 2006) is a tuple (lhs(r), rhs(r), 0(r)), where lhs(r) is the sourceside tree fragment, whose internal nodes are labeled by nonterminal symbols (lik
