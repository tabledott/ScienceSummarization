mber of occurrences of peace and piece in the training corpus.
    Table 5: Excerpts from the sorted list of 98 collocations learned for {peace , piece} with f = 2.
    Each line gives a collocation, and the number of peace and piece occurrences it matched.
    The last line of the table gives the total number of occurrences of peace and piece in the training corpus. population.
    Applying the U (xly) metric to the arid example, the value returned now depends on the number of occurrences of desert and dessert in the training corpus.
    If these numbers are 50 and 5, then U(x y) = 0.0, reflecting the uninformativeness of the arid feature in this situation.
    If instead the numbers are 50 and 500, then U( x = 0.402, indicating arid's better-than-chance ability to pick out desert (10 out of 50 occurrences) over dessert (1 out of 500 occurrences).
    To compare the two strength metrics, we tried both on some practice confusion sets.
    Sometimes one metric did substantially better, sometimes the other.
