Others perform the division implicitly without discussing performance (e.g.
    (Cutting et al., 1992)).
    On first glance, it may appear that using a short list, of sentence-final punctuation marks, such as ., ?, and !, is sufficient.
    However, these punctuation marks are not used exclusively to mark sentence breaks.
    For example, embedded quotations may contain any of the sentence-ending punctuation marks and . is used as a decimal point, in email addresses, to indicate ellipsis and in abbreviations.
    Both ! and ? are somewhat less ambiguous *The authors would like to acknowledge the support of ARPA grant N66001-94-C-6043, ARO grant DAAH0494-G-0426 and NSF grant SBR89-20230. but appear in proper names and may be used multiple times for emphasis to mark a single sentence boundary.
    Lexically-based rules could be written and exception lists used to disambiguate the difficult cases described above.
    However, the lists will never be exhaustive, and multiple rules may interact badly since punctu
