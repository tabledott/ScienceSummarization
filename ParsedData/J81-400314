le expresses the extraposition in simple relative clauses.
    It states that a relative pronoun is to be analysed as a marker, followed by some unknown constituents (denoted by `...'), followed by a trace.
    This is shown in Figure 5.1.
    As in the DCG example of the previous section, the extraposed noun phrase is expanded into a trace.
    However, instead of the trace being rewritten into the empty string, the trace is used as part of the analysis of `rel marker'.
    The difference between XG rules and DCG rules is then that the left-hand side of an XG rule may contain several symbols.
    Where a DCG rule is seen as expressing the expansion of a single non-terminal into a string, an XG rule is seen as expanding together several non-contiguous symbols into a string.
    More precisely, an XG rule has the general form Here each segment s, (separated from other segments by `...') is a sequence of terminals and non-terminals (written in DCG notation, with `,' for concatenation).
    The first symbol in s
