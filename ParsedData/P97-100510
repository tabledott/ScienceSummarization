    Such features have not been used in previous work on genre recognition, but we believe they have an important role to play, being at once significant and very frequent.
    Examples include counts of question marks, exclamations marks, capitalized and hyphenated words, and acronyms.
    Derivative cues are ratios and variation measures derived from measures of lexical and character-level features.

    For example, instead of estimating separate weights a, 3, and -y for the ratios words per sentence (average sentence length). characters per word (average word length) and words per type (token/type ratio), respectively, we expres
