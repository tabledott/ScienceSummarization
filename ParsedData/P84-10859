se constituents have been interrupted where and in what order -in other words, they are aware of the embedding structure and other information captured by the ATN configuration.
    The meaning of most clause utterances cannot be determined on the basis of the clause alone, but involves register values of the embedding dcu -as when a question sets up a frame in terms of which its answer is interpreted (cf.
    Scha, 1983) or when, to determine the temporal reference of a clause in a narrative, one needs a &amp;quot;reference time&amp;quot; which is established by the foregoing part of the narrative (section III B 2).
    From such examples, we see that the discourse constituent unit serves as a framework for the semantic interpretation of the clauses which constitute the text.
    By the same token, we see that the semantics of an utterance is not exhaustively described by indicating its illocutionary force and its propositional content.
    An utterance may also cause an update in one or more semantic regist
