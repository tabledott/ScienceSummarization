ally, we obtain lexical entries from the HPSG parse trees.
    The terminal nodes of HPSG parse trees are collected, and they are generalized by removing word-specific or context-specific constraints.
    An advantage of this method is that a wide-coverage HPSG lexicon is obtained because lexical entries are extracted from real-world sentences.
    Obtained lexical entries are guaranteed to construct well-formed HPSG parse trees because HPSG schemas and principles are successfully applied during the development of the HPSG treebank.
    Another notable feature is that we can additionally obtain an HPSG treebank, which can be used as training data for disambiguation models.
    In the following experiments, this HPSG treebank is used for the training of maximum entropy models.
    The lexicon used in the following experiments was extracted from Sections 02&#8211;21 of the Wall Street Journal portion of the Penn Treebank.
    This lexicon can assign correct lexical entries to 99.09% of words in the HPSG treeban
