h as class-based and collocation-specific ones, can be used in combination with one another.
    We also presented the results of a study testing this approach.
    The results suggest that the models produced in this study perform as well as or better than previous efforts on a difficult test case.
    We are investigating several extensions to this work.
    In order to reasonably consider doing large-scale wordsense disambiguation, it is necessary to eliminate the need for large amounts of manually sense-tagged data.
    In the future, we hope to develop a parametric model or models applicable to a wide range of content words and to estimate the parameters of those models from untagged data.
    To those ends, we are currently investigating a means of obtaining maximum likelihood estimates of the parameters of decomposable models from untagged data.
    The procedure we are using is a variant of the EM algorithm that is specific to models of the form produced in this study.
