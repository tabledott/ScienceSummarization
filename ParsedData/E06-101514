cally do: the designer just need to roughly select the interesting whole subtree (correlated with the linguistic phenomenon) and the tree kernel will generate all possible syntactic features from it.
    The task of selecting the most relevant substructures is carried out by the kernel machines themselves.
  
  
    The aim of the experiments is twofold.
    On the one hand, we show that the FTK running time is linear on the average case and is much faster than QTK.
    This is accomplished by measuring the learning time and the average kernel computation time.
    On the other hand, we study the impact of the different tree based kernels on the predicate argument classification accuracy.
    We used two different corpora: PropBank (www.cis.upenn.edu/&#8764;ace) along with PennTree bank 2 (Marcus et al., 1993) and FrameNet.
    PropBank contains about 53,700 sentences and a fixed split between training and testing which has been used in other researches, e.g.
