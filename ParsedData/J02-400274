st part of the sentence has something to do with comparing methods, and the system then (plausibly but incorrectly) decided to classify the sentence as CONTRAST.
    All in all, we feel that the extracted material conveys the rhetorical status adequately.
    An extrinsic evaluation additionally showed that the end result provides considerable added value when compared to sentence extracts (Teufel 2001).
    The classifier for rhetorical status that we evaluated in the previous section is an important first step in our implementation; the next step is the determination of relevant sentences in the text.
    One simple solution for relevance decision would be to use all AIM, BASIS, and CONTRAST sentences, as these categories are rare overall.
    The classifier we use has the nice property of roughly keeping the distribution of target categories, so that we end up with a sensible number of these sentences.
    The strategy of using all AIM, CONTRAST, and BASIS sentences can be evaluated in a similar vein to th
