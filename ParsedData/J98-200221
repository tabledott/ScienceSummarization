ion length, in which case it does so.
    The details of the algorithm are given in Figure 7.
    Note that for simplicity we describe Find-MDL as outputting a tree cut, rather than a complete tree cut model.
    Note in the above algorithm that the parameter description length is calculated as An example application of Find-MDL. entire tree and when it is a proper subtree.
    This contrasts with the fact that the number of free parameters is k for the former, while it is k + 1 for the latter.
    For the purpose of finding a tree cut with the minimum description length, however, this distinction can be ignored (see Appendix A).
    Figure 8 illustrates how the algorithm works (on the co-occurrence data shown at the bottom): In the recursive application of Find-MDL on the subtree rooted at AIRPLANE, the if-clause on line 9 evaluates to true since L' ([AIRPLANE]) = 32.27, L'( [jet, helicopter, airplane]) = 32.72, and hence [AIRPLANE] is returned.
    Then in the call to Find-MDL on the subtree rooted at ARTIF
