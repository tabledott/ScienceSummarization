nges this to &#8220;The 24th meeting of the Standing Committee....&#8221; The root features had a less noticeable effect on rule choice; one interesting change was that the frequency of rules with Chinese root VP / IP and English root VP / S-C increased from 0.2% to 0.7%: apparently the model learned that it is good to use rules that pair Chinese and English verbs that subcategorize for sentential complements.
  
  
    Though exact tree-to-tree translation tends to hamper translation quality by imposing too many constraints during both grammar extraction and decoding, we have shown that using both source and target syntax improves translation accuracy when the model is given the opportunity to learn from data how strongly to apply syntactic constraints.
    Indeed, we have found that the model learns on its own to choose syntactically richer and more wellformed structures, demonstrating that source- and target-side syntax can be used together profitably as long as they are not allowed to overconstrain the tr
