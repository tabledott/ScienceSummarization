tored tree.
    It also brings words further downstream into the look-ahead at the point of specification.
    Note that partial trees are defined in exactly the same way (Figure 2b), but that the nonterminal yields are made up exclusively of the composite nonterminals introduced by the grammar transform.
    This transform has a couple of very nice properties.
    First, it is easily reversible, i.e., every parse tree built with Gf corresponds to a unique parse tree built with G. Second, if we use the relative frequency estimator for our production probabilities, the probability of a tree built with Gf is identical to the probability of the corresponding tree built with G. Finally, let us introduce the term c-command.
    We will use this notion in our conditional probability model, and it is also useful for understanding some of the previous work in this area.
    The simple definition of c-command that we will be using in this paper is the following: a node A c-commands a node B if and only if (i) A does n
