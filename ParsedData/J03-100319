that (v, H) uniquely refers to (w, G).
    Consider, for instance, the task of finding a pair (v,H) that uniquely refers to the vertex labeled d1 in Figure 3.
    It is easily seen that there are a number of such pairs, three of which are depicted in Figure 5.
    We would like to have a mechanism that allows us to give certain solutions to this kind of task preference over other solutions.
    For this purpose we shall use cost functions.
    In general, a cost function is a function that assigns to each subgraph of a scene graph a non-negative number.
    As we shall see, by defining cost functions in different ways, we can mimic various algorithms for the generation of referring expressions known from the literature.
    The basic decision problem for subgraph isomorphism (i.e., testing whether a graph H is isomorphic to a subgraph of G) is known to be NP-complete (see, e.g., Garey and Johnson [1979]).
    Here we are interested in connected H, but unfortunately that restriction does not reduce the theoret
