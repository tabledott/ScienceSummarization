    For example, given the sentence (where the head noun of each mention is subscripted) the task is to group the mentions so that those referring to the same entity are placed together into an equivalence class.
    Many NLP tasks detect attributes, actions, and relations between discourse entities.
    In order to discover all information about a given entity, textual mentions of that entity must be grouped together.
    Thus coreference is an important prerequisite to such tasks as textual entailment and information extraction, among others.
    Although coreference resolution has received much attention, that attention has not focused on the relative impact of high-quality features.
    Thus, while many structural innovations in the modeling approach have been made, those innovations have generally been
