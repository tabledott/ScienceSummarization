 the detailed results on WSJ section 23 are shown in Table 13.
  Table 14 shows the results of individual systems and the improvement gained by the joint inference procedure on the development set.
  Our system reached the highest F1 scores on all the test sets and was the best system among the 19 participating teams.
  After the competition, we improved the system slightly by tuning the weights of the individual systems in the joint inference procedure, where the F1 scores onWSJ test section and the Brown test set are 79.59 points and 67.98 points, respectively.
