nd Zha, 2003).
    The focus of our work, however, is on an orthogonal yet fundamental aspect of this analysis &#8212; the impact of long-range cohesion dependencies on segmentation performance.
    In contrast to previous approaches, the homogeneity of a segment is determined not only by the similarity of its words, but also by their relation to words in other segments of the text.
    We show that optimizing our global objective enables us to detect subtle topical changes. mentation Our work is inspired by minimum-cutbased segmentation algorithms developed for image analysis.
    Shi and Malik (2000) introduced the normalized-cut criterion and demonstrated its practical benefits for segmenting static images.
    Our method, however, is not a simple application of the existing approach to a new task.
    First, in order to make it work in the new linguistic framework, we had to redefine the underlying representation and introduce a variety of smoothing and lexical weighting techniques.
    Second, the comput
