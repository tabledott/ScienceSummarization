e DA classification with dialogue game classification; dialogue games are units above the DA level, i.e., short DA sequences such as question-answer pairs.
    All the work mentioned so far uses statistical models of various kinds.
    As we have shown here, such models offer some fundamental advantages, such as modularity and composability (e.g., of discourse grammars with DA models) and the ability to deal with noisy input (e.g., from a speech recognizer) in a principled way.
    However, many other classifier architectures are applicable to the tasks discussed, in particular to DA classification.
    A nonprobabilistic approach for DA labeling proposed by Samuel, Carberry, and Vijay-Shanker (1998) is transformation-based learning (Brill 1993).
    Finally it should be noted that there are other tasks with a mathematical structure similar to that of DA tagging, such as shallow parsing for natural language processing (Munk 1999) and DNA classification tasks (Ohler, Harbeck, and Niemann 1999), from which furt
