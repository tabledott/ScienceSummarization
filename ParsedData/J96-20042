l structure of the discourse, and then other phenomena are related to them.
    At one time, it was considered sufficient when working with such judgments to show examples based on the authors' interpretation (paradigmatically, (Grosz and Sidner [1986], but also countless others).
    Research was judged according to whether or not the reader found the explanation plausible.
    Now, researchers are beginning to require evidence that people besides the authors themselves can understand, and reliably make, the judgments underlying the research.
    This is a reasonable requirement, because if researchers cannot even show that people can agree about the judgments on which their research is based, then there is no chance of replicating the research results.
    Unfortunately, as a field we have not yet come to agreement about how to show reliability of judgments.
    For instance, consider the following arguments for reliability.
    We have chosen these examples both for the clarity of their arguments and becau
