r parsers.
    The results of this experiment can be seen in Table 5.
    The entries in this table can be compared with those of Table 3 to see how the performance of the combining techniques degrades in the presence of an inferior parser.
    As seen by the drop in average individual parser performance baseline, the introduced parser does not perform very well.
    The average individual parser accuracy was reduced by more than 5% when we added this new parser, but the precision of the constituent voting technique was the only result that decreased significantly.
    The Bayes models were able to achieve significantly higher precision than their non-parametric counterparts.
    We see from these results that the behavior of the parametric techniques are robust in the presence of a poor parser.
    Surprisingly, the non-parametric switching technique also exhibited robust behaviour in this situation.
  
  
    We have presented two general approaches to studying parser combination: parser switching and parse
