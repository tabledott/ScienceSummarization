 complex path sets, tree pumping lemmas can be given.
    We adapt the string pumping lemma for the class of languages corresponding to the complexity of the path set.
    A geometrical progression of language families defined by Weir (1987) involves tree sets with increasingly complex path sets.
    The independence of paths in the tree sets of the k tI grammatical formalism in this hierarchy can be shown by means of tree pumping lemma of the form t1ti3t .
    .
    .t The path set of tree sets at level k +1 have the complexity of the string language of level k. The independence of paths in a tree set appears to be an important property.
    A formalism generating tree sets with complex path sets can still generate only semilinear languages if its tree sets have independent paths, and semilinear path sets.
    For example, the formalisms in the hierarchy described above generate semilinear languages although their path sets become increasingly more complex as one moves up the hierarchy.
    From the point of
