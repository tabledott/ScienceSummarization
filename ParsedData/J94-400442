 Figure 9e characterizes the alteration that takes place.
  Note that the Z position in the CLCS does not have a corresponding realization in the syntax.
  An example of conflational divergence is the case given earlier in (5).
  The syntactic structures and corresponding LCS are shown here: (26) [C-MAX [I-MAX IN-MAX I] [V-MAX [V stabbed[ [N-MAX John]][[ [Event CAUSE ([Thing I], [Event GOposs ([Thing KNIFE-WOUND], [Path TOWARDposs ([Position ATposs (/Thing KNIFE-WOUND], [Thing JOHN])])[)])] [C-MAX [I-MAX IN-MAX Yo] [V-MAX [v le di] [N-MAX pufialadas] [P-MAX a Juan][]] 613 Computational Linguistics Volume 20, Number 4 Here, English uses the single word stab for the two Spanish words dar (give) and pu~aladas (knife-wounds); this is because the effect of the action (i.e., the knife-wound portion of the lexical token) is incorporated into the main verb in English.
  Conflational divergence is resolved by means of the :CONFLATED marker, which suppresses the realization of the filler of a particular position.
