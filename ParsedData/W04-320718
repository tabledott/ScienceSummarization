 pairs of training data, the hypothesized alignments are relatively sparse.
    For the intersection alignments, an average of 23% of nonpunctuation Korean words and 17% of non-punctuation English words have a link to the other language.
    For the union alignments, this improves to 88% for Korean and 22% for English.
    A starker measure of alignment sparsity is the accuracy of English dependency links projected onto Korean.
    Following Hwa et al. (2002), we looked at dependency links in the true English parses from the KTB where both the dependent and the head were linked to words on the Korean side using the intersection alignment.
    Note that Hwa et al. used not only the true English trees, but also hand-produced alignments.
    If we hypothesize that, if English words i and j are in a parent-child relationship, then so are their linked Korean words, then we infer an incomplete dependency graph for the Korean sentences whose precision is around 49%&#8211;53% but whose recall is standard deviations)
