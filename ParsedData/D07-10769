	As the state-of-the-art tree kernel-based method, Zhang et al(2006) explored various structured feature 729 spaces and used the convolution tree kernel over parse trees (Collins and Duffy 2001) to model syntac tic structured information for relation extraction.
			They achieved the F-measures of 61.9 and 63.6 on the 5 relation types of the ACE RDC 2003 corpus and the 7 relation types of the ACE RDC 2004 corpus respectively without entity-related information while the F measure on the 5 relation types in the ACE RDC 2003 corpus reached 68.7 when entity-related infor mation was included in the parse tree.
			One problem with Collins and Duffy?s convolution tree kernel is that the sub-trees involved in the tree kernel computa tion are context-free, that is, they do not consider the information outside the sub-trees.
			This is different from the tree kernel in Culota and Sorensen (2004), where the sub-trees involved in the tree kernel com putation are context-sensitive (that is, with the path from the tree root
