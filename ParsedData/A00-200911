 available sensetagged text, while each of the test sets contains 10%.
    This process is repeated five times so that each fold serves as the source of the test data once.
    The average accuracy of the individual Naive Bayesian classifiers across the five folds is reported in Tables 3 and 4.
    The standard deviations were between .01 and .025 and are not shown given their relative consistency.
    Each classifier is based upon a distinct representation of context since each employs a different combination of right and left window sizes.
    The size and range of the left window of context is indicated along the horizontal margin in Tables 3 and 4 while the right window size and range is shown along the vertical margin.
    Thus, the boxes that subdivide each table correspond to a particular range category.
    The classifier that achieves the highest accuracy in each range category is included as a member of the ensemble.
    In case of a tie, the classifier with the smallest total window of context is i
