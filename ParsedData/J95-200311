    Discourses are more than mere sequences of utterances.
    For a sequence of utterances to be a discourse, it must exhibit coherence.
    In this paper, we investigate linguistic and attentional state factors that contribute to coherence among utterances within a discourse segment.
    These factors contribute to the difference in coherence between the following two discourse segments:2 Discourse (1) is intuitively more coherent than Discourse (2).
    This difference may be seen to arise from different degrees of continuity in what the discourse is about.
    Discourse (1) centers around a single individual, describing various actions he took and his reactions to them.
    In contrast, Discourse (2) seems to flip back and forth among several different entities.
    More specifically, the initial utterance (a) in each segment could begin a segment about an individual named 'John' or one about John's favorite music store or one about the fact that John wants to b
