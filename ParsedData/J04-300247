   In particular, we experiment with a density feature to decide whether or not a PSE instance is subjective: If a sufficient number of subjective elements are nearby, then the PSE instance is considered to be subjective; otherwise, it is discarded.
    The density parameters are a window size W and a frequency threshold T. In this section, we explore the density of manually annotated PSEs in subjectiveelement data and choose density parameters to use in Section 4.4, in which we apply them to automatically identified PSEs in opinion piece data.
    The process for calculating density in the subjective-element data is given in Figure 3.
    The PSEs are defined to be all adjectives, verbs, modals, nouns, and adverbs that appear at least once in a subjective element, with the exception of some stop words (line 0 of Figure 3).
    Note that these PSEs depend only on the subjective-element manual annotations, not on the automatically identified features used elsewhere in the article or on the document-level opini
