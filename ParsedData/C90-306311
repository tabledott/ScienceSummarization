 it turns out that pars- ing the entire corpus is not necessary to evaluate the success of the statistical model!
  As the evalu- ation relates to a limited number of examples, it is sufficient o collect the statistics only for patterns that are relevant for the disambiguation of these ex- amples.
  Therefore, we have extracted from the cor- pus only those sentences that contained at least one cooccurrenee of words from a relevant pattern.
  This procedure allowed us to parse only 10,000 sentences.
  5 Conclusions We have suggested using cooccurrence patterns, au- tomatically acquired from a large corpus, as an alter- native to selectional constraints.
  The initial results indicate that even in its basic form, as presented here, the approach is useful for disambiguation, and many times performs even better than the tradi- tional model.
  This should be considered relative to the effort that would have been required to achieve such coverage and accuracy by manual acquisition of constraints, for the broad doma
