uilt such that all events provide feedback on the event in question.
    For instance, given all narrative events in a document, we can find the next most likely event to occur by maximizing: where n is the number of events in our chain and ei is the ith event. m is the number of events f in our training corpus.
    A ranked list of guesses can be built from this summation and we hypothesize that the more events in our chain, the more informed our ranked output.
    An example of a chain with 3 events and the top 6 ranked guesses is given in figure 1.
    The cloze task (Taylor, 1953) is used to evaluate a system (or human) for language proficiency by removing a random word from a sentence and having the system attempt to fill in the blank (e.g.
    I forgot to the waitress for the good service).
    Depending on the type of word removed, the test can evaluate syntactic knowledge as well as semantic.
    Deyes (1984) proposed an extended task, discourse cloze, to evaluate discourse knowledge (removing phrases
