ically, this method uses the signed difference between the number of words containing the stem &#8220;support&#8221; and the number of words containing the stem &#8220;oppos&#8221; (returning the majority class if the difference is 0).
    No better than 62.67% testset accuracy is obtained by either baseline.
    Using relationship information Applying an SVM to classify each speech segment in isolation leads to clear improvements over the two baseline methods, as demonstrated in Table 4.
    When we impose the constraint that all speech segments uttered by the same speaker receive the same label via &#8220;same-speaker links&#8221;, both test-set and tion accuracy, in percent.
    Here, the initial SVM is run on the concatenation of all of a given speaker&#8217;s speech segments, but the results are computed over speech segments (not speakers), so that they can be compared to those in Table 4. development-set accuracy increase even more, in the latter case quite substantially so.
