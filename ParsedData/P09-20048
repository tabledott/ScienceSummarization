ude two additional features about the contents of the right sibling, Right Sibling Contains a VP and Right Sibling Contains a Trace.
  
  
    Of the 100 connectives annotated in the PDTB, only 11 appear as a discourse connective more than 90% of the time: although, in turn, afterward, consequently, additionally, alternatively, whereas, on the contrary, if and when, lest, and on the one hand...on the other hand.
    There is quite a range among the most frequent connectives: although appears as a discourse connective 91.4% of the time, while or only serves a discourse function 2.8% of the times it appears.
    For training and testing, we used explicit discourse connectives annotated in the PDTB as positive examples and occurrences of the same strings in the PDTB texts that were not annotated as explicit connectives as negative examples.
    Sections 0 and 1 of the PDTB were used for development of the features described in the previous section.
    Here we report results using a maximum entropy classifier2 u
