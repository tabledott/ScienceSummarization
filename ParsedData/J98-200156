 definite description the rewards, but whereas two of them classify the rewards as coreferential, one of them classifies it as bridging.
    What seems to be happening here and in similar cases is that even though we asked the subjects to classify semantically, they ended up using a notion of relatedness that is more like the notion of associative in Experiment 1.
    (We found 10 such cases of partial disagreement between bridging and coreferential in which all three subjects indicated the same antecedent for the definite description.)
    &amp;quot;When we evaluated raising our bid, the risks seemed substantial and persistent over the next five years, and the rewards seemed a long way out.&amp;quot; A particularly interesting version of this problem appears in the following example, when two annotators took the verb to refund as antecedent of the definite description the refund, but one of them interpreted the definite as coreferential with the eventuality, the other as bridging.
    The refund was about $5
