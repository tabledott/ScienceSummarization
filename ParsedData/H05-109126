e grandparent relation is de fined by a single fixed path consisting of two parent relations.?
			We can see this happening also in the task of relation extraction from ACE, where ?importantconcepts?
			are the 5 types of relations, and the ?con stants?
			defining a positive instance are the 5 types of entities.
	
	
			Local and non-local (deep) dependencies are equally important for finding relations.
			In this paper we tried extracting both types of dependencies using a CCG parser, however another approach is to recover deepdependencies from syntactic parses, as in (Camp bell, 2004; Levy and Manning, 2004).
			This mayhave the advantage of preserving the quality of local dependencies while completing the representa tion with non-local dependencies.Currently, the method assumes that the named entities are known.
			A natural extension is to automati cally extract both the entities and their relationships.
			Recent research (Roth and Yih, 2004) indicates thatintegrating entity recognition with relation ext
