 the relative frequency estimator conditioning on left hand sides: p(rhs(r)|lhs(r)) = f(r) ? r?:lhs(r?)=lhs(r) f(r ?)
			(5)f(r) represents the number of times rule r oc curred in the derivations of the training corpus.
			One of the major negative consequences of extracting only minimal rules from a corpus is that an estimator such as Equation 5 can become extremely biased.
			This again can be observed from Figure 3.
			In the minimal-rule extraction ofGHKM, only three rules are extracted from the example corpus, i.e. rules r2, r3, and r4.
			Let?s as sume now that the triple (pi, f1,a1) is represented 99 times, and (pi, f2,a2) only once.
			Given a tree pi, the model trained on that corpus can generate the two strings a?b?c? and b?a?c? only through two derivations, r3 ? r4 and r2, respectively.
			Since all rules in that example have probability 1, and 5If each tree fragment in pi is the lhs of some rule in R, then we have |?| = 2n, where n is the number of nodes of the frontier set F ? G (each node is a b
