oblematic for so called &#8220;low density&#8221; language pairs which do not have very large parallel corpora.
    For example, when words occur infrequently in a parallel corpus parameter estimates for word-level alignments can be inaccurate, which can in turn lead to inaccurate phrase translations.
    Limited amounts of training data can further lead to a problem of low coverage in that many phrases encountered at run-time are not observed in the training data and therefore their translations will not be learned.
    Here we address the problem of unknown phrases.
    Specifically we show that upon encountering an unknown source phrase, we can substitute a paraphrase for it and then proceed using the translation of that paraphrase.
    We derive these paraphrases from resources that are external to the parallel corpus that the translation model is trained from, and we are able to exploit (potentially more abundant) parallel corpora from other language pairs to do so.
