    The two most useful classes of features for recognizing Comparison relations were the first, last and first three words in the sentence and the context features that indicate the presence of a paragraph boundary or of an explicit relation just before or just after the location of the hypothesized implicit relation (19.32 f-score).
    Contingency The two best features for the Contingency vs. Other distinction were verb information (36.59 f-score) and first, last and first three words in the sentence (36.75 f-score).
    Context again was one of the features that led to improvement.
    This makes sense, as Pitler et al. (2008) found that implicit contingencies are often found immediately following explicit comparisons.
    We were surprised that the polarity features were helpful for Contingency but not Comparison.
    Again we looked at the prevalence of opposite polarity pairs.
    While for Comparison versus Other there was not a significant difference, for Conti
