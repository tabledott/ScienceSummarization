e).
    Observe that the percentages for individual emotions do not vary greatly from the average.
    The last row lists the percent of target terms that evoke some emotion (any of the eight) at the various intensity levels.
    We calculated this using the intensity level of the strongest emotion expressed by each target.
    Observe that 30.1% of the target terms strongly evoke at least one of the eight basic emotions.
    Even though we asked Turkers to annotate emotions at four levels of intensity, practical NLP applications often require only two levels&#8212;evoking particular emotion (evocative) or not (non-evocative).
    For each target term&#8211;emotion pair, we convert the four-level annotations into two-level annotations by placing all no- and weak-intensity assignments in the non-evocative bin, all moderate- and strongintensity assignments in the evocative bin, and then choosing the bin with the majority assignments.
    Table 3 gives percent of target terms considered to be evocative.
