sting resources such as WordNet, or to produce semantic lexicons for specialized domains.
    We have developed a weakly supervised bootstrapping algorithm called Basilisk that automatically generates semantic lexicons.
    Basilisk hypothesizes the semantic class of a word by gathering collective evidence about semantic associations from extraction pattern contexts.
    Basilisk also learns multiple semantic classes simultaneously, which helps constrain the bootstrapping process.
    First, we present Basilisk&#8217;s bootstrapping algorithm and explain how it differs from previous work on semantic lexicon induction.
    Second, we present empirical results showing that Basilisk outperforms a previous algorithm.
    Third, we explore the idea of learning multiple semantic categories simultaneously by adding this capability to Basilisk as well as another bootstrapping algorithm.
    Finally, we present results showing that learning multiple semantic categories simultaneously improves performance.
