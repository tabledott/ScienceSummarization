re dealing with Model 2.
    The idea of computing the probabilities of the alignments using one model, but collecting the counts in a way appropriate to a second model is very general and can always be used to transfer a set of parameters from one model to another.
    We created Models 1 and 2 by making various assumptions about the conditional probabilities that appear in Equation (4).
    As we have mentioned, Equation (4) is an exact statement, but it is only one of many ways in which the joint likelihood of f and a can be written as a product of conditional probabilities.
    Each such product corresponds in a natural way to a generative process for developing f and a from e. In the process corresponding to Equation (4), we first choose a length for f. Next, we decide which position in e is connected to fi and what the identity of fi is.
    Then, we decide which position in e is connected to 12, and so on.
    For Models 3, 4, and 5, we write the joint likelihood as a product of conditional probabiliti
