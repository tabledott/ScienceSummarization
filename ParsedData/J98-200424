a constituent during a parse, and so in order to use context on both sides of the constituent, we need to use something like our boundary statistics.
    Our results suggest that a single tag before or after the constituent can be used as a reasonable approximation to the full context on Average CPU time for 95% of the probability mass for the boundary estimates. that side of the constituent.
    Figure 12 shows the average CPU time for each sentence length.
    Since the boundary trigram estimate has none of the overhead associated with the prefix estimate, it is the best performer in terms of CPU time as well.
    We can also see that using just the boundary statistics, which can be precomputed and require no extra processing during parsing, still results in a substantial improvement over the non-best-first &amp;quot;stack&amp;quot; model.
    As another method of comparison between the two best-performing estimates, the context-dependent boundary trigram model and the context-independent trigram model, we
