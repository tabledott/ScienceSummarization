pus, and every time it must occur in a definite construction.
    To evaluate the performance of our algorithm, we hand-tagged each definite NP in the 50 test texts as a syntactically independent existential, a semantically independent existential, an associative existential or a referential NP.
    Figure 8 shows the distribution of definite NP types in the test texts.
    Of the 1,001 definite NPs tested, 63% were independent existentials, so removing these NPs from the coreference resolution process could have substantial savings.
    We measured the accuracy of our classifications using recall and precision metrics.
    Results are shown in Figure 7.
    As a baseline measurement, we considered the accuracy of classifying every definite NP as existential.
    Given the distribution of definite NP types in our test set, this would result in recall of 100% and precision of 72%.
    Note that we are more interested in high measures of precision than recall because we view this method to be the precursor to a
