spect to four factors: sentence length, the number of unknown words (i.e., words not appearing in sections 2&#8211;21 of the Penn treebank) in the sentence, the number of coordinating conjunctions (CC) in the sentence, and the number of prepositions (IN) in the sentence.
    The distributions of classes (better, worse, no change) with respect to each of these factors individually are graphed in Figures 2 to 5.
    Figure 2 shows how the self-training affects fscore as a function of sentence length.
    The top line shows that the f-score of most sentences remain unchanged.
    The middle line is the number of sentences that improved their f-score, and the bottom are those which got worse.
    So, for example, for sentences of length 30, about 80 were unchanged, 25 improved, and 22 worsened.
    It seems clear that there is no improvement for either very short sentences, or for very long ones.
    (For long ones the graph is hard to read.
    We show a regression analysis later in this section that confirms th
