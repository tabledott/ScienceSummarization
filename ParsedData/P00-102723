 effective collaboration of four original similarity measures based on expected frequency distributions, context, morphologically-weighted Levenshtein similarity and an iteratively bootstrapped model of affixation and stem-change probabilities.
    This constitutes a significant achievement in that previous approaches to morphology acquisition have either focused on unsupervised induction of quasiregular concatenative affixation, or handled irregular forms with fully supervised training.
    In contrast, this paper's essentially unsupervised algorithm achieves over 80% accuracy on the most highly irregular forms, and 99.7% accuracy on analyses requiring some stem change, outperforming Mooney and Califf's fully supervised learning algorithm overall and on both of these measures. alignment principles used, as it creates nearly as many problems as it fixes.
    The overall performance advantage is slightly in its favor (with 59 misalignments avoided for 50 problems created), but the cost of this approach is born
