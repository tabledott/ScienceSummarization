n these annotations were included.
    Nonetheless, some distinctions present in the raw treebank trees were valuable.
    For example, an NP with an S parent could be either a temporal NP or a subject.
    For the annotation TMP-NP, we retained the original -TMP tags on NPs, and, furthermore, propagated the tag down to the tag of the head of the NP.
    This is illustrated in figure 6, which also shows an example of its utility, clarifying that CNN last night is not a plausible compound and facilitating the otherwise unusual high attachment of the smaller NP.
    TMP-NP brought the cumulative F1 to 82.25%.
    Note that this technique of pushing the functional tags down to preterminals might be useful more generally; for example, locative PPs expand roughly the same way as all other PPs (usually as IN NP), but they do tend to have different prepositions below IN.
    A second kind of information in the original trees is the presence of empty elements.
    Following Collins (1999), the annotation GAPPED-S mar
