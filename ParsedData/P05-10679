in a tree stands for a lemma in a dependency tree.
    The arrows denote aligned nodes and those resulting inconsistent dependencies are marked with a &#8220;*&#8221;.
    Fox (2002) collected the statistics mainly on French and English data: in dependency representations, the percentage of head crossings per chance (case [b] in the graph) is 12.62%.
    Using the statistics on cross-lingual dependency consistencies from a small word to word aligned Chinese-English parallel corpus1, we found that the percentage of crossing-dependencies (case [b]) between Chinese and English is 4.7% while that of broken dependencies (case [c]) is 59.3%.
    The large number of broken dependencies presents a major challenge for grammar induction based on a top-down style EM learning process.
    Such broken and crossing dependencies can be modeled by SDIG if they appear inside a pair of elementary trees.
    However, if they appear between the elementary trees, they are not compatible with the isomorphism assumption on which SD
