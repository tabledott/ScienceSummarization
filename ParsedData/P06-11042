ng the dot-product with a kernel function between two vectors, or even between two objects.
    A kernel function is a similarity function satisfying the properties of being symmetric and positive-definite.
    Recently, kernel methods are attracting more interests in the NLP study due to their ability of implicitly exploring huge amounts of structured features using the original representation of objects.
    For example, the kernels for structured natural language data, such as parse tree kernel (Collins and Duffy, 2001), string kernel (Lodhi et al., 2002) and graph kernel (Suzuki et al., 2003) are example instances of the wellknown convolution kernels1 in NLP.
    In relation extraction, typical work on kernel methods includes: Zelenko et al. (2003), Culotta and Sorensen (2004) and Bunescu and Mooney (2005).
    This paper presents a novel composite kernel to explore diverse knowledge for relation extraction.
    The composite kernel consists of an entity kernel and a convolution parse tree kernel.
