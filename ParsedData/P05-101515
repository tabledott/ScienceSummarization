    (The inner summation is familiar from work in locally-weighted shows that in aggregate, the vocabularies of distant classes overlap to a degree surprisingly similar to that of the vocabularies of nearby classes.
    Thus, item similarity as measured by TO(cos) may not correlate well with similarity of the item&#8217;s true labels.
    We can potentially develop a more useful similarity metric by asking ourselves what, intuitively, accounts for the label relationships that we seek to exploit.
    A simple hypothesis is that ratings can be determined by the positive-sentence percentage (PSP) of a text, i.e., the number of positive sentences divided by the number of subjective sentences.
    (Termbased versions of this premise have motivated much sentiment-analysis work for over a decade (Das and Chen, 2001; Tong, 2001; Turney, 2002).)
    But counterexamples are easy to construct: reviews can contain off-topic opinions, or recount many positive aspects before describing a fatal flaw.
