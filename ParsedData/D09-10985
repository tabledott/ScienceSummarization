 for which large training data sets are available.
    Unsupervised approaches rely on no labeled data and use either bootstrapped class-specific extraction patterns (Etzioni et al. 2005) to find new elements of a given class (for targeted extraction) or corpusbased term similarity (Pantel and Lin 2002) to find term clusters (in an open extraction framework).
    Finally, semi-supervised methods have shown great promise for identifying and labeling entities (Riloff and Shepherd 1997; Riloff and Jones 1999; Banko et al. 2007; Downey et al.
    2007; Pa&#351;ca et al. 2006; Pa&#351;ca 2007a; Pa&#351;ca 2007b; Pa&#351;ca and Durme 2008).
    Starting with a set of seed entities, semisupervised extraction methods use either classspecific patterns to populate an entity class or distributional similarity to find terms similar to the seed set (Pa&#351;ca&#8217;s work also examines the advantages of combining these approaches).
    Semisupervised methods (including ours) are useful for extending finer grain entity cl
