 important type of feature; segmenta tion features further reduce the AER by 15.8%.
			The other features add small gains in performance which,although are not statistically significant for the align ment F-measure, are important in terms of feature extraction.
			Segmentation features discussed above result in both suffix and prefix features as well asstem features.
			In the Subtract column, for the seg mentation feature, only the suffix and prefix features were removed.
			This result indicates that most of thealignment improvement from the segmentation fea ture comes in the form of new lexical features to link Arabic stems and English words.
			7.3 Comparison to other alignment.
			algorithms In order to gauge the performance of the algorithmwith respect to other alignment strategies, we provide results using GIZA++ and an HMM Max Poste rior Algorithm (Ge, 2004).
			These algorithms, as well as the Model 1 smoothing for the MaxEnt aligner, are all trained on a corpus of 500K sentence pairsfrom the UN para
