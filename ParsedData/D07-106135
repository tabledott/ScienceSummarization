dness that uses only WordNet as its underlying lexical resource.In future work, we hope to integrate other lexical resources such as Wikipedia into the walk.
			Incorporating more types of links from more resources will underline the importance of determining appropriate rela tive weights for all of the types of edges in the walk?s matrix.
			Even for WordNet, we believe that certain link types, such as antonyms, may be more or less appropriate for certain tasks and should weighted accordingly.
			And while our measure of lexical relatedness correlates well with human judgments, we hope to show performance gains in a real-word task from the use of our measure.
