rence models one at a time from highest to lowest precision.
    Each tier builds on the entity clusters constructed by previous models in the sieve, guaranteeing that stronger features are given precedence over weaker ones.
    Furthermore, this model propagates global information by sharing attributes (e.g., gender and number) across mentions in the same cluster.
    We made three considerable extensions to the Raghunathan et al. (2010) model.
    First, we added five additional sieves, the majority of which address the semantic similarity between mentions, e.g., using WordNet distance, and shallow discourse understanding, e.g., linking speakers to compatible pronouns.
    Second, we incorporated a mention detection sieve at the beginning of the processing flow.
    This sieve filters our syntactic constituents unlikely to be mentions using a simple set of rules on top of the syntactic analysis of text.
    And lastly, we added a post-processing step, which guarantees that the output of our system is compat
