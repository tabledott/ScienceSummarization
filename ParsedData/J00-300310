under the auspices of the Discourse Resource Initiative (Core and Allen 1997).
    We began with the DAMSL markup system, but modified it in several ways to make it more relevant to our corpus and task.
    DAMSL aims to provide a domain-independent framework for dialogue annotation, as reflected by the fact that our tag set can be mapped back to DAMSL categories (Jurafsky, Shriberg, and Biasca 1997).
    However, our labeling effort also showed that content- and task-related distinctions will always play an important role in effective DA labeling.
    The Switchboard domain itself is essentially &amp;quot;task-free,&amp;quot; thus giving few external constraints on the definition of DA categories.
    Our primary purpose in adapting the tag set was to enable computational DA modeling for conversational speech, with possible improvements to conversational speech recognition.
    Because of the lack of a specific task, we decided to label categories that seemed inherently interesting linguistically and that co
