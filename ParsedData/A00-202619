stems in how they determine the attribute ordering and lexical choice.
    NLG2 and NLG3 automatically determine attribute ordering by simultaneously searching multiple orderings.
    In grammar-based approaches, such preferences need to be manually encoded.
    NLG2 and NLG3 solve the lexical choice problem by learning the words (via features in the maximum entropy probability model) that correlate with a given attribute and local context, whereas (Elhadad et al., 1997) uses a rule-based approach to decide the word choice.
    While trainable approaches avoid the expense of crafting a grammar to determine attribute ordering and lexical choice, they are less accurate than grammar-based approaches.
    For short phrases, accuracy is typically 100% with grammar-based approaches since the grammar writer can either correct or add a rule to generate the phrase of interest once an error is detected.
    Whereas with NLG2 and NLG3, one can tune the feature patterns, search parameters, and training data itself, but t
