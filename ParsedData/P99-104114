4).
    It can be seen that the overlap between manually compiled dictionaries are quite low, reflecting the fact that different lexicographers may have quite different opinion about which phrases are non-compositional.
    The collocations in Appendix A are classified into three categories.
    The ones marked with '+' sign are found in NTC-EID.
    The ones marked with'x' are parsing errors (we retrieved from the parsed corpus all the sentences that contain the collocations in Appendix A and determine which collocations are parser errors).
    The unmarked collocations satisfy the condition (3) but are not found in NTC-EID.
    Many of the unmarked collocation are clearly idioms, such as &amp;quot;take (the) Fifth Amendment&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;take (its) toll&amp;quot;, suggesting that even the most comprehensive dictionaries may have many gaps in their coverage.
    The method proposed in this paper can be used to improve the coverage manually created lexical resources.
    Most of the parser errors ar
