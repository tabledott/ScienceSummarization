only use join relations can represent arbitrarily complex compositional structures, but they cannot capture higherorder phenomena in language.
    For example, consider the phrase number of major cities, and suppose that number corresponds to the count predicate.
    It is impossible to represent the semantics of this phrase with just a CSP, so we introduce a new aggregate relation, notated E. Consider a tree hE:ci, whose root is connected to a child c via E. If the denotation of c is a set of values s, the parent&#8217;s denotation is then a singleton set containing s. Formally: Figure 3(a) shows the DCS tree for our running example.
    The denotation of the middle node is {s}, where s is all major cities.
    Having instantiated s as a value, everything above this node is an ordinary CSP: s constrains the count node, which in turns constrains the root node to |s|.
    A DCS tree that contains only join and aggregate relations can be viewed as a collection of treestructured CSPs connected via aggregate rela
