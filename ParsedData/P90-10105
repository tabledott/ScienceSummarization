or conversational participants to coordinate their con- tributions to the dialogue and agree on their mu- tual beliefs with respect o a evolving plan, for ex- ample, to agree that a particular subgoal has been achieved.
  A final phenomenon concerns hifts of control and the devices used to achieve this.
  Con- trol shifts occur because it is unusual for a single participant o be responsible for coordinating the achievement of the whole discourse plan.
  When a different participant assumes control of a discourse subgoal then a control shift occurs and the par- ticipants must have mechanisms for achieving this.
  The control framework distinguishes instances in which a control shift is negotiated by the partic- ipants and instances where one participant seizes control.
