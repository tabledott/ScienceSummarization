erefore, three, it is not necessary to manually prealign large bitexts before input to GSA.
    There are numerous ways to improve on the methods presented here.
    If SIMR can be reparameterized so that its parameters are pairwise independent, then it may be possible to optimize these parameters analytically, or at least within a well-founded probabilistic framework.
    Likewise, the parameters in GSA's backing-off heuristics and the heuristics themselves were partially dictated by the scarcity of suitable training data at the time that GSA was being developed.
    All of this is to say that the details of the current implementations of SIMR and GSA are less important than the general approach to bitext mapping advocated here.
