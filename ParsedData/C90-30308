oblem is to work out the precise relations between these modules.
  Local disambiguation Morphological ambiguities may be due to intersec- tion of forms of the same or of different lexical entries, or to intersection of recursive compound paths.
  The latter phenomenon arises if productive compound formation in e.g.
  Finnish, German, and Swedish is N(r) (a) (b) 0 13957 13957 1 440035 487994 2 253779 236298 3 55857 44782 4 38062 29053 5 24135 18911 6 3830 312 7 9551 8913 8 541 23 9 232 47 10 72 2 11 46 5 12 124 13 15 14 28 15+ 33 Out of roughly 1,5 million readings assigned by morphology (1.8 readings/word-form), local disam- 169 biguation discards more than 100,000.
  Especially dramatic the drop is for highly ambiguous words.
  Morphosyntactic mapping After local disambiguation, each word in the sen- tence undergoes morphosyntactic mapping, i.e.
  it is assigned at least one syntactic label, perhaps sev- eral if a unique label is not possible to assign.
  This mapping will be discussed in connection with th
