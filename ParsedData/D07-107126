e domain or underlying database.
			In practice it is easy to compile a list of these atomic entities.
			Second, the lexicon has entries for some function words such as wh-words, and determiners.9
	
	
			There has been a significant amount of previous work on learning to map sentences to under lying semantic representations.
			A wide variety 9Our assumption is that these entries are likely to be domain independent, so it is simple enough to compile a list that can be reused in new domains.
			Another approach, which we may consider in the future, would be to annotate a small subset of the training examples with full CCG derivations, from which these frequently occurring entries could be learned.of techniques have been considered including ap proaches based on machine translation techniques (Papineni et al, 1997; Ramaswamy and Kleindienst, 2000; Wong and Mooney, 2006), parsing techniques(Miller et al, 1996; Ge and Mooney, 2006), tech niques that use inductive logic programming (Zelle and Mooney, 1996; Thomps
