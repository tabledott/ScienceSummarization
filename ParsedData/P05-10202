optimal.
    Another potential weakness of this approach concerns its inability to directly optimize for clusteringlevel accuracy: the coreference classifier is trained and optimized independently of the clustering procedure to be used, and hence improvements in classification accuracy do not guarantee corresponding improvements in clustering-level accuracy.
    Our goal in this paper is to improve the robustness of the standard approach by addressing the above weaknesses.
    Specifically, we propose the following procedure for coreference resolution: given a set of NPs to be clustered, (1) use pre-selected learningbased coreference systems to generate candidate partitions of the NPs, and then (2) apply an automatically acquired ranking model to rank these candidate hypotheses, selecting the best one to be the final partition.
    The key features of this approach are: Minimal human decision making.
    In contrast to the standard approach, our method obviates, to a large extent, the need to make tough or po
