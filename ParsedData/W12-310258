dle of Table 13).
    Five submissions scored higher than the baseline system at p = 0.05 (systems above the middle gray area), which indicates that this shared-task also succeeded in pushing the state-of-the-art performance to new levels in terms of absolute scoring.
    The range of performance for the submissions in the scoring task varies from an MAE of 0.61 up to an MAE of 0.87 (the outlier MAE of 2.09 is reportedly due to bugs).
    We also calculate scoring Oracles using the methods used for the ranking Oracles.
    The difference is that the HTER and (H)BLEU oracles need a way of mapping their scores (which are usually in the [0,100] range) into the [1, 5] range.
    For the comparison here, we did the mapping by excluding the 5% top and bottom outlier scores, and then linearly mapping the remaining range into the [1.5, 5] range.
    The &#8220;Oracle Effort&#8221; scores are not very indicative in this case.
    However, the &#8220;Oracle HTER&#8221; MAE score of 0.56 is a somewhat realistic lowerbou
