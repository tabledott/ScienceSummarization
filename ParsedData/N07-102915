TER (Sim et al., 2007).
    WER alignments do not allow shifts, GIZA++ alignments require careful training and are not always reliable.
    TER alignments do not guarantee that similar but lexically different words are aligned correctly but TER does not require training new models and allows shifts (Snover et al., 2006).
    This work extends the approach proposed in (Sim et al., 2007).
    Due to the varying word order in the MT hypotheses, the decision of confusion network skeleton is essential.
    The skeleton determines the general word order of the combined hypothesis.
    One option would be to use the output from the system with the best performance on some development set.
    However, it was found that this approach did not always yield better combination output compared to the best single system on all evaluation metrics.
    Instead of using a single system output as the skeleton, the hypothesis that best agrees with the other hypotheses on average may be used.
    In this paper, the minimum avera
