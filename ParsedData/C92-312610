 of the properties of the trees in the corpus, and sometimes a part of tile input is found literally in the corpus, and can be treated as one unit in the parsing process.
  Thus the system tries to combine constructions from the corpus so as to reconstruct the input sentence as well as possible.
  ~llte preferred parse out of all parses of the input sentence is obtained by maximizing file conditional probability of a parse given the sentence.
  Finally, the preferred parse is added to the corpus, bringing it into a new state.
  To illustrate the basic idea, consider the following extremely simple exmnple.
  Assume that the whole corpus consists of only the following two trees: S A M: VP A Wa V NP .~.
