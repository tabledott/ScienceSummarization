    As a correlation measure, Champollion uses the Dice coefficient (Dice 1945; Sorensen 1948) commonly used in information retrieval (Salton and McGill 1983; Frakes and Baeza-Yates 1992).
    For a given source language collocation, Champollion identifies individual words in the target language that are highly correlated with the source collocation, thus producing a set of words in the target language.
    These words are then combined in a systematic, iterative manner to produce a translation of the source language collocation.
    Champollion considers all pairs of these words and identifies any that are highly correlated with the source collocation.
    Next, triplets are produced by adding a highly correlated word to a highly correlated pair, and the triplets that are highly correlated with the source language collocation are passed to the next stage.
    This process is repeated until no more highly correlated combinations of words can be found.
