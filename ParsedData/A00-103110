lexicon that should be used for suffix handling.
    Should we use all words, or are some of them better suited than others?
    Accepting that unknown words are most probably infrequent, one can argue that using suffixes of infrequent words in the lexicon is a better approximation for unknown words than using suffixes of frequent words.
    Therefore, we restrict the procedure of suffix handling to words with a frequency smaller than or equal to some threshold value.
    Empirically, 10 turned out to be a good choice for this threshold.
    Additional information that turned out to be useful for the disambiguation process for several corpora and tagsets is capitalization information.
    Tags are usually not informative about capitalization, but probability distributions of tags around capitalized words are different from those not capitalized.
    The effect is larger for English, which only capitalizes proper names, and smaller for German, which capitalizes all nouns.
    We use flags ci that are true if w
