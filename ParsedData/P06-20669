titions the original graph into two planes.
    Bodirsky et al. (2005) present two structural constraints on dependency graphs that characterize analyses corresponding to derivations in Tree Adjoining Grammar: the gap degree restriction and the well-nestedness constraint.
    A gap is a discontinuity in the projection of a node in a dependency graph (Pl&#225;tek et al., 2001).
    More precisely, let 7ri be the projection of the node i.
    Then a gap is a pair (jk, jk+1) of nodes adjacent in 7ri such that Definition 6 The gap degree of a node i in a dependency graph, gd(i), is the number of gaps in 7ri.
    As an example, consider the node labelled i in the dependency graphs in Figure 3.
    In Graph 3a, the projection of i is an interval ((2, 3, 4)), so i has gap degree 0.
    In Graph 3b, 7ri = (2, 3, 6) contains a single gap ((3, 6)), so the gap degree of i is 1.
    In the rightmost graph, the gap degree of i is 2, since 7ri = (2, 4, 6) contains two gaps ((2, 4) and (4, 6)).
