e the one in equation (1), where X and Y are the patterns to be compared, and 6(x, yi) is the distance between the values of the i-th feature in a pattern with n features.
    Distance between two values is measured using equation (2), an overlap metric, for symbolic features (we will have no numeric features in the tagging application).
    We will refer to this approach as IB1 (Aha et al., 1991).
    We extended the algorithm described there in the following way: in case a pattern is associated with more than one category in the training set (i.e. the pattern is ambiguous), the distribution of patterns over the different categories is kept, and the most frequently occurring category is selected when the ambiguous pattern is used to extrapolate from.
    In this distance metric, all features describing an example are interpreted as being equally important in solving the classification problem, but this is not necessarily the case.
    In tagging, the focus word to be assigned a category is obviously more rel
