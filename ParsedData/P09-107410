the Stanford CRF-based Named Entity Recognizer (Finkel et al., 2004) for named entity tagging.
    With these preprocessing components, RECONCILEACL09 uses heuristics to correctly extract approximately 90% of the annotated CEs for the MUC and ACE data sets.
    Feature Set.
    To achieve roughly state-of-theart performance, RECONCILEACL09 employs a fairly comprehensive set of 61 features introduced in previous coreference resolution systems (see Bengtson and Roth (2008)).
    We briefly summarize the features here and refer the reader to Stoyanov et al. (2009) for more details.
    Lexical (9): String-based comparisons of the two CEs, such as exact string matching and head noun matching.
    Proximity (5): Sentence and paragraph-based measures of the distance between two CEs.
    Grammatical (28): A wide variety of syntactic properties of the CEs, either individually or as a pair.
    These features are based on part-of-speech tags, parse trees, or dependency relations.
    For example: one feature indicates
