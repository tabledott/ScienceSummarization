ical analysis for the phrase translation model is a combination of the automatically induced analysis for Model 1 plus the manually induced Al#-deletion in 3.2.2.
    The scores with only automatically induced morphological analysis are 0.21, 0.25, 0.33 and 0.36 for 3.5K, 35K, 350K and 3.3M sentence pair training corpora, respectively.
  
  
    Automatic induction of the desired linguistic knowledge from a word/morpheme-aligned parallel corpus is analogous to (Yarowsky et al. 2001).
    Word segmentation and merge/deletion analysis in morphology is similar to parsing and insertion operation in syntax by (Yamada and Knight 2001).
    Symmetrization of linguistic structures can also be found in (Niessen and Ney 2000).
    5 Our experiments indicate that addition of Al#deletion, cf.
    Phrase Translation Model, does not affect the performance of IBM Model 1.
