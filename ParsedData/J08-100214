ure forests are used for enumerating possible structures of events, that is, they correspond to Y(x) in Equation 1.
    A feature forest &#934; is a tuple (C, D, r, -y, b), where: We denote a feature forest for x as &#934;(x).
    For example, &#934;(x) can represent the set of all possible tag sequences of a given sentence x, or the set of all parse trees of x.
    A feature forest is an acyclic graph, and unpacked structures extracted from a feature forest are trees.
    We also assume that terminal nodes of feature forests are conjunctive nodes.
    That is, disjunctive nodes must have daughters (i.e., -y(d) =&#65533; 0 for all d E D).
    A feature forest represents a set of trees of conjunctive nodes in a packed structure.
    Conjunctive nodes correspond to entities such as states in Markov chains and nodes in CFG trees.
    Feature functions are assigned to conjunctive nodes and express their characteristics.
    Disjunctive nodes are for enumerating alternative choices.
