dal contexts.
    This means, however, that we risk failing on certain rare examples.
    We could not, for example, deal with the sentence, &amp;quot;It then assumed that the pressure was lube oil.&amp;quot;
  
  
    Deduction is explosive, and since the abduction scheme augments deduction with the assumptions, it is even more explosive.
    We are currently engaged in an empirical investigation of the behavior of this abductive scheme on a very large knowledge base performing sophisticated processing.
    In addition to type checking, we have introduced two other techniques that are necessary for controlling the explosion--unwinding recursive axioms and making use of syntactic noncoreference information.
    We expect our investigation to continue to yield techniques for controlling the abduction process.
    We are also looking toward extending the interpretation processes to cover lexical ambiguity, quantifier scope ambiguity and metaphor interpretation problems as well.
    We will also be investigating
