understander should expect (and hence prefer).
    For example, the definition in Figure 4 expresses that fabric materials are common modifiers of clothing (e.g., wool suit) and fill the clothing's MADE-OF role.
    TRUMP's hierarchy also allows the specification of such preferences from the perspective of the filler, where they can be made more general.
    For example, although colors are also common modifiers of clothing (e.g., blue suit), it is better to associate this preference with the filler (c-color-qual) because colors prefer to fill the COLOR role of any physical object.
    (Figure 5 shows an encoding of this preference.)
    The hierarchy also permits the specification of such preferences from the perspective of the relation underlying a role.
    For example, the relation c-made-of in Figure 6 indicates (in its : RELS) that physical objects normally have a MADE-OF role and (in its : PREF) that the role is normally filled by some physical object.
    Figure 7 gives a complete account of the use o
