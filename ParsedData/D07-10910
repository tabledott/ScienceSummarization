	Factored Translation Models
		We present an extension of phrase-based statistical machine translation models that enables the straight-forward integration of additional annotation at the word-level ?may it be linguistic markup or automatically generated word classes.
		In a num ber of experiments we show that factoredtranslation models lead to better translation performance, both in terms of auto matic scores, as well as more grammatical coherence.
	
	
			The current state-of-the-art approach to statistical machine translation, so-called phrase-based models,is limited to the mapping of small text chunks with out any explicit use of linguistic information, may it be morphological, syntactic, or semantic.
			Such additional information has been demonstrated to bevaluable by integrating it in pre-processing or post processing steps.However, a tighter integration of linguistic infor mation into the translation model is desirable for two reasons:?
			Translation models that operate on more gen eral representatio
