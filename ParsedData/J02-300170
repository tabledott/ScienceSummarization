mantic roles is that one predicate may be used with different argument structures: for example, in the sentences &#8220;He opened the door&#8221; and &#8220;The door opened,&#8221; the verb open assigns different semantic roles to its syntactic subject.
    In this section we compare two strategies for handling this type of alternation in our system: a sentence-level feature for frame element groups and a subcategorization feature for the syntactic uses of verbs.
    Then a simple system using the predicate&#8217;s argument structure, or syntactic signature, as the primary feature will be contrasted with previous systems based on local, independent features.
    The system described in previous sections for classifying frame elements makes an important simplifying assumption: it classifies each frame element independent of the decisions made for the other frame elements in the sentence.
    In this section we remove this assumption and present a system that can make use of the information that, for example, a
