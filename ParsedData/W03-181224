 (VPC(head)).
    Looking to the curves for these three rankings, we see that they are all fairly flat, nondescript curves.
    If we partition the data up into low- and high-frequency MWEs, as defined by a threshold of 100 corpus occurrences, we find that the graphs for the low-frequency data (NN(head)LOW and VPC(head)LOW) are both monotonically decreasing, whereas those for high-frequency data (NN(head)HIGH and VPC(head)HIGH) are more haphazard in nature.
    Our hypothesis of lesser instances of hyponymy for lower similarities is thus supported for low-frequency items but not for high-frequency items, suggesting that LSA similarities are more brittle over high-frequency items for this particular task.
    The results for the low-frequency items are particularly encouraging given that the LSAbased similarities were found to correlate poorly with WordNet-derived similarities.
    The results for NN(mod) are more erratic for both low- and highfrequency terms, that is the modifier noun is not as strong a predi
