  Shared Logistic Normal Distributions for Soft Parameter Tying in Unsupervised Grammar Induction
  
    We present a family of priors over probabilistic grammar weights, called the shared logistic normal distribution.
    This family extends the partitioned logistic normal distribution, enabling factored covariance between the probabilities of different derivation events in the probabilistic grammar, providing a new way to encode prior knowledge about an unknown grammar.
    We describe a variational EM algorithm for learning a probabilistic grammar based on this family of priors.
    We then experiment with unsupervised dependency grammar induction and show significant improvements using our model for both monolingual learnand with a non-parallel, multilingual corpus.
  
  
    Probabilistic grammars have become an important tool in natural language processing.
    They are most commonly used for parsing and linguistic analysis (Charniak and Johnson, 2005; Collins, 2003), but are now commonly seen in appli
