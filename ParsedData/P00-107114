or the same question the answer may be easier or more difficult to extract depending on how the answer is phrased in the text.
    Thus we classify the QA systems, not the questions.
    We provide a taxonomy based on three critePercentage of questions in top 5 NIST score Short answer Long answer ria that we consider important for building question answering systems: (1) knowledge base, (2) reasoning, and (3) natural language processing and indexing techniques.
    Knowledge bases and reasoning provide the medium for building question contexts and matching them against text documents.
    Indexing identifies the text passages where answers may lie, and natural language processing provides a framework for answer extraction.
    Out of the 153 questions that our system has answered, 136 belong to Class 1, and 17 to Class 2.
    Obviously, the questions in Class 2 are more difficult as they require more powerful natural language and reasoning techniques.
    As we look for the future, in order to address questio
