ng distribution, then when we sum over data completions, we will only involve bracketings which correspond to valid binary trees.
    This restriction is the basis for our algorithm.
    We now essentially have our induction algorithm.
    We take P(B) to be Pbin(B), so that all binary trees are equally likely.
    We then apply the EM algorithm: E-Step: Find the conditional completion likelihoods P(BIS, O) according to the current O. M-Step: Fix P(B|S, O) and find the O' which maximizes EB P(BIS, O) logP(S, BIO').
    The completions (bracketings) cannot be efficiently enumerated, and so a cubic dynamic program similar to the inside-outside algorithm is used to calculate the expected counts of each yield and context, both as constituents and distituents.
    Relative frequency estimates (which are the ML estimates for this model) are used to set O'.
    To begin the process, we did not begin at the Estep with an initial guess at O.
    Rather, we began at the M-step, using an initial distribution over comple
