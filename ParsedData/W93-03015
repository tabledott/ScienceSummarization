entence (e.g. char_al:gn's output), (2) reduce the number of parameters that need to be estimated, and (3) prepare the ground for the second step, the search for the best alignment (described in section 2.2).
    In the context of their statistical machine translation project (Brown et al., 1990), Brown et al. estimate Pr(f le), the probability that f, a sentence in one language (say French), is the translation of e, a sentence in the other language (say English).
    Pr(f le) is computed using the concept of altgnment, denoted by a, which is a set of connections between each French word in f and the corresponding English word in e. A connection, which we will write f e as con- specifies that position j in f is connected to position i in e. If a French word in f does not correspond to any English word in e, then it is connected to the special word null (position 0 in e).
    Notice that this model is directional, as each French position is connected to exactly one position in the English sentence (which might
