e clearly relevant, but too specific to apply more than a few times in the OTC corpus.
    It may be possible to acquire confidence weights for at least some of the intuitive rules in GTag from Google searches, so that we have a level field for integrating confidence weights from the fairly general GTag rules and the fairly specific VerbOcean-like lexical rules.
    Further, the GTag and VerbOcean rules could be incorporated as features for machine learning, along with features from automatic preprocessing.
    We have taken pains to use freely downloadable resources like Carafe, VerbOcean, and WEKA to help others easily replicate and quickly ramp up a system.
    To further facilitate further research, our tools as well as labeled vectors (unclosed as well as closed) are available for others to experiment with.
