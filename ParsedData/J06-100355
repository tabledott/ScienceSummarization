ntically related to possible senses of other nearby words.
  If all senses of any open-class, non?stop-list word that occurs only once in the text are found to be semantically unrelated to accepted senses of all other nearby words, but some sense of a spelling variation of that word would be related (or is identical to another token in the context), then it is hypothesized that the original word is an error and the variation is what the writer intended; a user would be warned of this possibility.
  For example, if no nearby word in a text is related to diary but one or more are related to dairy, we suggest to the user that it is the latter that was intended.
  The exact window size implied by ?nearby?
  is a parameter to the algorithm, as is the precise definition of spelling variation; see Hirst and Budanitsky (2005).
  
  
  While the performance of the malapropism corrector is inherently limited by these assumptions, we can nonetheless evaluate measures of semantic relatedness by com- paring their effect o
