ng with a particular previous tag is the same as the probability of that nonterminal appearing in any sentence containing that tag.
    We can then count the probability-weighted occurrences of a nonterminal given the previous tag as follows: That is, for each sentence that contains the previous tag tj_i, we increment our count by the probability of the nonterminal Nk occurring immediately following ti_i in that sentence.
    Since we have a complete parse, the inside and outside probabilities and the sentence probability can be easily computed.
    We can also obtain the count C(ti_i) simply by counting the number of sentences in which that tag appears in position j - 1.
    We then obtain the conditional probability for the left boundary statistic as follows: The right boundary statistic is computed in the corresponding way.
    For the experiment using the treebank grammar, these statistics were obtained by counting directly from the Wall Street Journal treebank corpus, just as the grammar rules and trigra
