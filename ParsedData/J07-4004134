ncies than GRs in DepBank, because a dependency is defined as a lexical category-argument slot pair.
    In CCGbank there is a distinction between the direct object of a transitive verb and ditransitive verb, for example, whereas in DepBank these would both be dobj.
    In other words, to get a dependency correct in the CCGbank evaluation, the lexical category&#8212;typically a subcategorization frame&#8212;has to be correct.
    In a final experiment we used the GRs generated by transforming CCGbank as a gold standard, against which we compared the GRs from the transformed parser output.
    The resulting F-score of 89.60% shows the increase obtained from using gold-standard GRs generated from CCGbank rather than the CCGbank dependencies themselves (for which the F-score was 85.20%).
    Another difference between DepBank and CCGbank is that DepBank has been manually corrected, whereas CCGbank, including the test sections, has been produced semiautomatically from the Penn Treebank.
    There are some constru
