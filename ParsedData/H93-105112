x vectors are (6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0).
  However, a concept hat appears 10, 4, 7 , 0, 1, and 2 times in the respective senses, has weights of (1.25, .5, .88, 0, .04, .17), reflecting the fact that it is not as good an indicator for any sense.
  This weighting method is the most effective among several variants that were tried.
  We also experimented with keeping all words in the con- tent vectors, but performance degraded, probably be- cause the weighting function does not handle very high frequency words well.
  This is evident in Table 1, where mr is highly weighted for three different senses.
  Neura l  Network The neural network approach [9] casts sense resolution as a supervised learning paradigm.
  Pairs of [input features, desired response] arc presented to a learning program.
  The programs task is to devise some method for us- ing the input features to partition the training contexts into non-overlapping sets corresponding to the desired responses.
  This is achieved by adjusting link weights so that the
