 being either positive, negative or neutral in sentiment.
    Additionally, the system outputs two rankings, the first a ranking of the sentence by positive polarity and the second a ranking of the sentence by negative polarity.
    Classifying sentences by their sentiment is a subtask of sentiment aggregation systems (Hu and Liu, 2004; Gamon et al., 2005).
    Ranking sentences by their polarity is a critical sub-task in extractive sentiment summarization (Carenini et al., 2006; Lerman et al., 2009).
    To classify sentences as being positive, negative or neutral, we used an augmented vote-flip algorithm (Choi and Cardie, 2009), which is given in Figure 3.
    This intuition behind this algorithm is simple.
    The number of matched positive and negative phrases from the lexicon are counted and whichever has the most votes wins.
    The algorithm flips the decision if the number of negations is odd.
    Though this algorithm appears crude, it benefits from not relying on threshold values for neutral classif
