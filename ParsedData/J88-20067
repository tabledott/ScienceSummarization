   In short, a cooperative speaker must be able to assume that the listener is able to both infer a possible a and single out Ea in his/her evolving Discourse Mode1.6 (This is illustrated in Figure lb.)
    I will consider each of these two types of constraints in turn.
    Speakers assume listeners will have no problem with a when a(NPb,Ea) = Ea.
    Inferring a in other cases follows in large part from the ontology of the entities specified by NPs&#8212;i.e., the ontology of our concepts of individuals, sets, mass terms, generics, etc.
    We view these as having parts (e.g., car: the engine, the wheels), having functional relations (e.g., car: the driver), having roles (e.g., wedding: the bride), etc.
    These needn't be necessary parts, relations, roles, etc.
    Our ontology includes possible parts, relations, etc., and these too make it possible for the listener to infer an a such that a(NPb,Ea) = Eb (e.g., room: the chandelier; car: the chauffeur; wedding: the flower girl).
    Such inferences are dis
