  Overview of BioNLP&amp;rsquo;09 Shared Task on Event Extraction
  
    The paper presents the design and implementation of the BioNLP&#8217;09 Shared Task, and reports the final results with analysis.
    The shared task consists of three sub-tasks, each of which addresses bio-molecular event extraction at a different level of specificity.
    The data was developed based on the GENIA event corpus.
    The shared task was run over 12 weeks, drawing initial interest from 42 teams.
    Of these teams, 24 submitted final results.
    The evaluation results are encouraging, indicating that state-of-the-art performance is approaching a practically applicable level and revealing some remaining challenges.
  
  
    The history of text mining (TM) shows that shared tasks based on carefully curated resources, such as those organized in the MUC (Chinchor, 1998), TREC (Voorhees, 2007) and ACE (Strassel et al., 2008) events, have significantly contributed to the progress of their respective fields.
