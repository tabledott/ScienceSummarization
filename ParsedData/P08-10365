 our model and the proposed class of models can be employed in other tasks beyond sentiment summarization, e.g., segmentation of blogs on the basis of topic labels provided by users, or topic discovery on the basis of tags given by users on social bookmarking sites.3 The rest of the paper is structured as follows.
    Section 2 begins with a discussion of the joint textsentiment model approach.
    In Section 3 we provide both a qualitative and quantitative evaluation of the proposed method.
    We conclude in Section 4 with an examination of related work.
  
  
    In this section we describe a new statistical model called the Multi-Aspect Sentiment model (MAS), which consists of two parts.
    The first part is based on Multi-Grain Latent Dirichlet Allocation (Titov and McDonald, 2008), which has been previously shown to build topics that are representative of ratable aspects.
    The second part is a set of sentiment predictors per aspect that are designed to force specific topics in the model to be direct
