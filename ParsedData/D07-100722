ed statistical models, and presents the advantages of being freely available and widely used.The phrase bilexicon is derived from the inter section of bidirectional IBM Model 4 alignments,obtained with GIZA++ (Och and Ney, 2003), aug mented to improve recall using the grow-diag-finalheuristic.
			The language model is trained on the English side of the corpus using the SRI language mod eling toolkit (Stolcke, 2002).
			The loglinear model weights are learned using Chiang?s implementation of the maximum BLEUtraining algorithm (Och, 2003), both for the base line, and the WSD-augmented system.
			Due totime constraints, this optimization was only con ducted on the IWSLT task.
			The weights used in the WSD-augmented NIST model are based on the best IWSLT model.
			Given that the two tasks are quite different, we expect further improvements on the WSD-augmented system after running maximum BLEU optimization for the NIST task.
	
	
			Using WSD predictions in SMT yields better trans lation quality on all test sets,
