l have a very hard time guessing the correct labeling.
    Thus, if the syntactic parser makes errors, these errors influence directly the semantic role labeling system.
    The theoretically correct way to propagate the uncertainty of the syntactic parser is to consider (sum over) multiple possible parse trees, weighted by their likelihood.
    In Finkel, Manning, and Ng (2006), this is approximated by sampling parse trees.
    We implement this idea by an argmax approximation, using the top k parse trees from the parser of Charniak (2000).
    We use these alternative parses as follows: Suppose t1, ... , tk are trees for sentence s with probabilities P(ti|s) given by the parser.
    Then for a fixed predicate v, let Li denote the best joint labeling of tree ti, with score scoreSRL(Lilti) according to our final joint model.
    Then we choose the labeling L which maximizes This method of using multiple parse trees is very simple to implement and factors in the uncertainty of the parser to some extent.
