lumn, say the jth column, of the bigram matrix.
    Then the value of cell (i,j) indicates the log&#8211;likelihood ratio of the words in the bigram WORDi&lt;&gt;WORDj.
    Each row of the bigram matrix can be seen as a bigram vector that shows the scores of all bigrams in which the word represented by that row occurs as the first word.
    Thus, the words representing the rows of the bigram matrix make the feature set while the words representing the columns form the dimensions of the feature space.
  
  
    The objective of clustering is to take a set of instances represented as either a similarity matrix or context vectors and cluster together instances that are more like each other than they are to the instances that belong to other clusters.
    Clustering algorithms are classified into three main categories, hierarchical, partitional, and hybrid methods that incorporate ideas from both.
    The algorithm acts as a search strategy that dictates how to proceed through the instances.
    The actual choice
