the notable exception of Poutsma, most related works rely on models that are restricted to synchronous context-free grammars (SCFG).While the state-of-the-art hierarchical SMT system (Chiang, 2005) performs well despite stringent constraints imposed on its context-free gram mar, we believe its main advantage lies in its ability to extract hierarchical rules across phrasal boundaries.
			Context-free grammars (such as PennTreebank and Chiang?s grammars) make independence assumptions that are arguably often unrea sonable, but as our work suggests, relaxations of these assumptions by using contextually richer rules results in translations of increasing quality.
			We believe it will be beneficial to account for this finding in future work in syntax-based SMT and in efforts to improve upon (Chiang, 2005).
	
	
			In this paper, we developed probability models for the multi-level transfer rules presented in (Galley et al, 2004), showed how to acquire larger rules that crucially condition on more syntactic context,
