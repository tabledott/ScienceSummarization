  We apply this novel algorithm to POS tagging.
    It obtains an error rate of 2.67% on the standard PTB test set, which represents 3.3% relative error reduction over the previous best result (Toutanova et al., 2003) on the same data set, while using fewer features.
    By using deterministic search, it obtains an error rate of 2.73%, a 5.9% relative error reduction over the previous best deterministic algorithm (Tsuruoka and Tsujii, 2005).
    It should be noted that the error rate is close to the inter-annotator discrepancy on PTB, the standard test set for POS tagging, therefore it is very difficult to achieve improvement.
