he CoNLL-2000 shared task uses statistical methods.
    Pla, Molina and Prieto (2000) use a finite-state version of Markov Models.
    They started with using POS information only and obtained a better performance when lexical information was used.
    Zhou, Tey and Su (2000) implemented a chunk tagger based on HMMs.
    The initial performance of the tagger was improved by a post-process correction method based on error driven learning and by incorporating chunk probabilities generated by a memory-based learning process.
    The two other statistical systems use maximum-entropy based methods.
    Osborne (2000) trained Ratnaparkhi's maximum-entropy POS tagger to output chunk tags.
    Koeling (2000) used a standard maximum-entropy learner for generating chunk tags from words and POS tags.
    Both have tested different feature combinations before finding an optimal one and their final results are close to each other.
    Three systems use system combination.
    Tjong Kim Sang (2000) trained and tested five
