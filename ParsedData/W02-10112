d; indeed, in general, free-form survey responses given in natural language format could be processed using sentiment categorization.
    Moreover, there are also potential applications to message filtering; for example, one might be able to use sentiment information to recognize and discard &#8220;flames&#8221;(Spertus, 1997).
    In this paper, we examine the effectiveness of applying machine learning techniques to the sentiment classification problem.
    A challenging aspect of this problem that seems to distinguish it from traditional topic-based classification is that while topics are often identifiable by keywords alone, sentiment can be expressed in a more subtle manner.
    For example, the sentence &#8220;How could anyone sit through this movie?&#8221; contains no single word that is obviously negative.

    Thus, sentiment seems to require more understanding than the usual topic-based classification.
    So, apart from presenting our results obtained via machin
