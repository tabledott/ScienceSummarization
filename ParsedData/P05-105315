pe &#8220;Founder&#8221; under the type &#8220;ROLE&#8221;.
    It also shows that the ACE RDC task defines some difficult subtypes such as the subtypes &#8220;Based-In&#8221;, &#8220;Located&#8221; and &#8220;Residence&#8221; under the type &#8220;AT&#8221;, which are difficult even for human experts to differentiate.
    In this paper, we explicitly model the argument order of the two mentions involved.
    For example, when comparing mentions m1 and m2, we distinguish between m1-ROLE.Citizen-Of-m2 and m2ROLE.Citizen-Of-m1.
    Note that only 6 of these 24 relation subtypes are symmetric: &#8220;RelativeLocation&#8221;, &#8220;Associate&#8221;, &#8220;Other-Relative&#8221;, &#8220;OtherProfessional&#8221;, &#8220;Sibling&#8221;, and &#8220;Spouse&#8221;.
    In this way, we model relation extraction as a multi-class classification problem with 43 classes, two for each relation subtype (except the above 6 symmetric subtypes) and a &#8220;NONE&#8221; class for the case where the two mentions are not related.
