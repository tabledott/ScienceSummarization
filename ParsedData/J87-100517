everywhere sensitive to the four-part quantifier structure of the target logical form.
    The difference between the nondeterministic and deterministic versions lies only in their implementation of the choice of terms and returning of values.
    This is done either nondeterministically, or by iterating through and returning explicit sets of possibilities.
    A nondeterministic Prolog version and a deterministic COMMON LISP version of the algorithm are given in Appendices A and B.
    The full text of these versions (including auxiliary functions not listed here) is available from the authors.
    A variant of the COMMON LISP version is currently being used at SRI International to generate scopings in the KLAUS system.
    In the specifications below, the let construct implements local variable assignment.
    All assignments are done sequentially, not in parallel.
    The syntax is let (assignments) in (body) The entire expression returns what the body returns.
    Destructuring by pattern matching is allo
