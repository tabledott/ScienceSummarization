 run indexing with words.
    We believe that these results have to be further contrasted, but they strongly suggest that WordNet can be more useful to Text Retrieval than it was previously thought.
    The second question needs further, more finegrained, experiences to be clearly answered.
    However, for our test collection, we find that error rates below 30% still produce better results than standard word indexing, and that from 30% to 60% error rates, it does not behave worse than the standard SMART run.
    We also find that the queries have to be disambiguated to take advantage of the approach; otherwise, the best possible results with synset indexing does not improve the performance of standard word indexing.
    Our first goal now is to improve our retrieval system in many ways. studying how to enrich the query with semantically related synsets, how to cornpare documents and queries using semantic information beyond the cosine measure, and how to obtain weights for synsets according to their position
