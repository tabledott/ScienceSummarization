efore we exclude multi-word cepts.
    Among the one-word cepts, there is a natural order corresponding to the order in which they appear in the English string.
    Let [ii denote the position in the English string of the ith one-word cept.
    We define the center of this cept, 0&#8222; to be the ceiling of the average value of the positions in the French string of the words from its tablet.
    We define its head to be that word in its tablet for which the position in the French string is smallest.
    In Model 4, we replace rn, 1) by two sets of parameters: one for placing the head of each cept, and one for placing any remaining words.
    For [i] &gt; 0, we require that the head for cept i be r[]i and we assume that Pr (II[]i = /1741-1,71, Of), e) = - Oi-i IA(e[i-i]), 8(4)).
    (45) Here, A and 8 are functions of the English and French words that take on a small number of different values as their arguments range over their respective vocabularies.
