ed alignment to permit alignment of non-constituent subphrases on the source side, and translate modifiers using a separate phrase-based model, and DeNeefe et al.
    (2007), who modify syntax-based extraction and binarize trees (following (Wang et al., 2007b)) to improve phrasal coverage.
    Similarly, Marcu et al. (2006) relax their syntax-based system by rewriting target-side parse trees on the fly in order to avoid the loss of &#8220;nonsyntactifiable&#8221; phrase pairs.
    Setiawan et al. (2007) employ a &#8220;function-word centered syntax-based approach&#8221;, with synchronous CFG and extended ITG models for reordering phrases, and relax syntactic constraints by only using a small number function words (approximated by high-frequency words) to guide the phrase-order inversion.
    Zollman and Venugopal (2006) start with a target language parser and use it to provide constraints on the extraction of hierarchical phrase pairs.
    Unlike Hiero, their translation model uses a full range of named nonte
