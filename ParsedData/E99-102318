mats achieved better precision rates, others better recall rates.
    This information is useful for tasks that require chunking structures because some tasks might, be more interested in high precision rates while others might be more interested in high recall rates.
    The 031-1G algorithm has been able to improve the best reported Fo=1 rates for a standard data set, (92.37 versus (Ramshaw and Marcus, 1995)'s 92.03).
    This result was aided by using non-standard parameter values (k=3) and the algorithm was sensitive for redundant input features.
    This means that finding an optimal performance or this task requires searching a large parameter/feature configuration space.
    An interesting topic for future research would be to embed Isl-IG in a standard search algorithm, like hillclimbing, and explore this parameter space.
    Some more room for improved performance lies in computing the POS tags in the data with a better tagger than presently used.
