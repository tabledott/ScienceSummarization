and 3-2 alignments are not even considered by the algorithm, so naturally all three instances of these are counted as errors.
    The most embarrassing category is 1-0, which was never handled correctly.
    In addition, when the algorithm assigns a sentence to the 1-0 category, it is also always wrong.
    Clearly, more work is needed to deal with the 1-0 category.
    It may be necessary to consider language-specific methods in order to deal adequately with this case.
    Since the algorithm achieves substantially better performance on the 1-1 regions, one interpretation of these results is that the overall low error rate is due to the high frequency of 1-1 alignments in English-French and English-German translations.
    Translations to linguistically more different languages, such as Hebrew or Japanese, might encounter a higher proportion of hard matches.
    We investigated the possible dependence of the error rate on four variables: We used logistic regression (Hosmer and Lemeshow 1989) to see how well
