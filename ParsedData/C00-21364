s, tbllowed by a search for the scenario- specific patterns.
  It is possible to build these constituent struc- tures through a flfll syntactic analysis of the text, and the discovery procedure we describe below woul(1 be applicable to such an architec- ture.
  Howe, ver, for re&amp;sellS of slme,(t , coverage, and system rolmstness, the more (:ommon ap- t)roa(:h at present is to peribrni a t)artial syn- tactic analysis using a cascade of finite-state transducers.
  This is the at)t)roa(:h used by our e.xtraction system (Grishman, 1995; Yangarber and Grishman, 1998).
  At; the heart of our syslxan is a regular ex- pression pattern matcher which is Cal)al)le of matching a set of regular exl)ressions against a partially-analyzed text and producing addi- tional annotations on the text.
  This core draws on a set of knowledge bases of w~rying degrees of domain- and task-specificity.
  The lexicon in- cludes both a general English dictionary and definitions of domain and scenario terms.
  The concept base arranges
