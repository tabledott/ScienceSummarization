tates are members of the pairs of Si and S2.
    There exists k &gt; 0 such that: We prove that weights are also the same in Si and 52.
    Let Hy, (0 &gt; j &gt; k), be the set of strings labeling the paths from i3 to qi in T1. cffi(ii, w) is the weight output corresponding to a string w E R. Consider the accumulated weights c11, 1 &lt; i &lt; 2, 0 &lt;j &lt; k, in determinization of T. Each cl; for instance corresponds to the weight not yet output in the paths reaching Si.
    It needs to be added to the weights of any path from qj E S1 to a final state in rev(Ti).
    In other terms, the determinization algorithm will assign the weight c + w) + Ai to a path labeled with wR reaching a final state of T' from Si.
    T&amp;quot; is obtained by pushing from T'.
    Therefore the weight of such We noticed in the proof of the determinization theorem that the minimum weight of the pairs of any subset is 0.
    Therefore: Vj E [O. k], C11 = C21 and S2 =- S1.
    This ends the proof of the theorem.
