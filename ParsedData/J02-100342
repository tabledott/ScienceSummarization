ntal Algorithm would raise further questions, stemming from the fact that our descriptions are structurally complex.
    For example, consider the treatment of relational properties.
    Which is better: adding a relational property to a given incomplete description (... in the wooden shed) or adding a negated property (... which is not a poodle)?
    Making informed decisions about such questions, with proper attention to their combined effects, is a difficult task that is perhaps best tackled using the graph-theoretical approach outlined by Krahmer, van Erk, and Verleg (2001).
    Their approach is specifically suitable for accommodating different GRE algorithms and treats relations in the same way as properties Brevity.
    We have assumed that, on the whole, descriptions ought to be as brief as they can, as long as they are uniquely identifying.
    But in fact, a description can contain much more than is logically necessary for identification, even beyond the redundancies allowed by the Incremental Algor
