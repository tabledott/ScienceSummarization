rect" attachment, is to the noun phrase.
  We present in this paper methods for con- structing statistical models for computing the probability of attachment decisions.
  These models could be then integrated into scoring the probability of an overall parse.
  We present our methods in the context of prepositional phrase (PP) at- tachment.
  Earlier work [11 ] on PP-attachment for verb phrases (whether the PP attaches to the preceding noun phrase or to the verb phrase) used statistics on co-occurences of two bigrams: the main verb (V) and preposition (P) bigram and the main noun in the object noun phrase (N1) and preposition bigram.
  In this paper, we explore the use of more features to help in modeling the distribution of the binary PP-attachment deci- sion.
  We also describe a search procedure for selecting a "good" subset of features from a much larger pool of features for PP-attachment.
  Obviously, the feature search cannot be * Jeff Reynar, f rom University of  Pennsylvania, worked on this project as
