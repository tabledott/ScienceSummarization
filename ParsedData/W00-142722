cted word forms into finite-state transducers (Mohri, 1996).
    The resulting analysers run at a comparable speed to our generator and the (compacted) executables are of similar size.
    However, a full form lexicon is unwieldy and inconvenient to update, and a system derived from it cannot cope gracefully with unknown words because it does not contain generalisations about regular or subregular morphological behaviour.
    The morphological components of current widely-used NLG systems tend to consist of hard-wired procedural code that is tightly bound to the workings of the rest of the system.
    For instance, the Nigel grammar (Matthie.ssen, 1984) contains Lisp code that classifies verb, noun and adjective endings, and these classes are picked up by further code inside the KPIVEL system (Bateman., 2000) itself which performs inflectional generation by stripping off variable length trailing strings and concatenating suf, fixes_ Anorphologically..-suhregular4orrns must be entered explicitly in the lexicon
