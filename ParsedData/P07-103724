 language model than a standard word-level Markov model, thereby exhibiting a preference (in the CCG system especially) for the insertion of a verb with a similar meaning to that contained in the reference sentence.
  
  
    SMT practitioners have on the whole found it difficult to integrate syntax into their systems.
    In this work, we have presented a novel model of PBSMT which integrates supertags into the target language model and the target side of the translation model.
    Using LTAG supertags gives the best improvement over a state-of-the-art PBSMT system for a smaller data set, while CCG supertags work best on a large 2 million-sentence pair training set.
    Adding grammaticality factors based on algebraic compositional operators gives the best result, namely 0.4688 BLEU, or a 6.1% relative increase over the baseline.
    This result compares favourably with the best systems on the NIST 2005 Arabic&#8211;English task.
    We expect more work on system integration to improve results still further,
