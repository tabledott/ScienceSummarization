 accuracy.
    We also ignored features over triples of words since this would explode the size of the feature space.
    We evaluate dependencies on per word accuracy, which is the percentage of words in the sentence with the correct parent in the tree, and on complete dependency analysis.
    In our evaluation we exclude punctuation for English and include it for Czech and Danish, which is the standard.
    To create data sets for English, we used the Yamada and Matsumoto (2003) head rules to extract dependency trees from the WSJ, setting sections 2-21 as training, section 22 for development and section 23 for evaluation.
    The models rely on part-of-speech tags as input and we used the Ratnaparkhi (1996) tagger to provide these for the development and evaluation set.
    These data sets are exclusively projective so we only compare the projective parsers using the exact projective parsing algorithms.
    The purpose of these experiments is to gauge the overall benefit from including second-order features
