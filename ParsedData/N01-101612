ether the orthographic form and/or tag of the next word (ignoring punctuation) are the same as those of the current word.
    Ti has a non-NULL value only if the current word is followed by an interregnum string; in that case Ti is the POS tag of the word following that interregnum.
    As described above, the classifier&#8217;s features are sets of variable-value pairs.
    Given a tuple of variables, we generate a feature for each tuple of values that the variable tuple assumes in the training data.
    In order to keep the feature set managable, the tuples of variables we consider are restricted in various ways.
    The most important of these are constraints of the form &#8216;if Xj is included among feature&#8217;s variables, then so is Xk&#8217;.
    For example, we require that if a feature contains Pi+1 then it also contains Pi for i &#8805; 0, and we impose a similiar constraint on POS tags.
