C to be non-compositional.
  
  
    We devote this section to a description of statistical NLP work on the non-compositionality of MWEs.
    Perhaps the singularly most influential work on MWE non-compositionality is that of Lin (1999).
    We describe Lin&#8217;s method in some detail here as it forms the basis of one of the methods tested in this research.
    Lin&#8217;s method is based on the premise that noncompositional items have markedly different distributional characteristics to expressions derived through synonym substitution over the original word composition.
    Lin took his multiword items from a collocation database (Lin, 1998b).
    For each collocation, he substituted each of the component words with a word with a similar meaning.
    The list of similar meanings was obtained by taking the 10 most similar words according to a corpus-derived thesaurus, the construction of which is described in Lin (1998a).
    The mutual information value was then found for each item produced by this substit
