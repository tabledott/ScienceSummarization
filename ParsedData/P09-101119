er used generic values which worked well enough across all three domains.
    We ran 10 iterations of EM on Models 1&#8211;3.
    Table 3 shows that performance improves with increased model sophistication.
    We also compare our model to the results of Chen and Mooney (2008) in Table 4.
    Figure 4 provides a closer look at the predictions made by each of our three models for a particular example.
    Model 1 easily mistakes pink10 for the recipient of a pass record because decisions are made independently for each word.
    Model 2 chooses the correct record, but having no model of the field structure inside a record, it proposes an incorrect field segmentation (although our evaluation is insensitive to this).
    Equipped with the ability to prefer a coherent field sequence, Model 3 fixes these errors.
    Many of the remaining errors are due to the garbage collection phenomenon familiar from word alignment models (Moore, 2004; Liang et al., 2006).
    For example, the ballstopped record occurs frequentl
