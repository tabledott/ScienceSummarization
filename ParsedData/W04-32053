 some existing resources and describe previous attempts at mining semantics from text.
    Question answering is often approached by canonicalizing the question text and the answer text into logical forms.
    This approach is taken, inter alia, by a top-performing system (Moldovan et al. 2002).
    In discussing future work on the system's logical form matching component, Rus (2002 p. 143) points to incorporating entailment and causation verb relations to improve the matcher's performance.
    In other work, Webber et al. (2002) have argued that successful question answering depends on lexical reasoning, and that lexical reasoning in turn requires fine-grained verb semantics in addition to troponymy (is-a relations between verbs) and antonymy.
    In multi-document summarization, knowing verb similarities is useful for sentence compression and for determining sentences that have the same meaning (Lin 1997).
    Knowing that a particular action happens before another or is enabled by another is also useful to
