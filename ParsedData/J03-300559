ic hierarchy and propose hypothesis testing as a means of determining a suitable level of generalization in the hierarchy.
    Clark and Weir (2002) report pseudodisambiguation results on two data sets, with an experimental setup similar to that of Rooth et al. (1999).
    For the first data set, 3,000 pairs were randomly chosen from 1.3 million (v, n) tuples extracted from the BNC (using the parser of Briscoe and Carroll [1997]).
    The selected pairs contained relatively frequent verbs (occurring between 500 and 5,000 times in the data).
    The data sets were constructed as proposed by Rooth et al. (1999).
    The procedure for creating the second data set was identical, but this time only verbs that occurred between 100 and 1,000 times were considered.
    Clark and Weir (2002) further compared their approach with Resnik&#8217;s (1993) selectional association model and Li and Abe&#8217;s (1998) tree cut model on the same data sets.
    These methods are directly comparable, as they can be used for class-
