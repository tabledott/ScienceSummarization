 into either an iterative or item-based description.
    Instead, we will show how to compute the outside probabilities using a modified interpreter of the same item-based description used for computing the other values.
    In the next section, we describe the basics of semiring parsing.
    In Section 3, we derive formulas for computing most of the values in semiring parsers, except outside values, and then in Section 4, show how to compute outside values as well. hi Section 5, we give an algorithm for interpreting an item-based description, followed in Section 6 by examples of using semiring parsers to solve a variety of problems.
    Section 7 discusses previous work, and Section 8 concludes the paper.
  
  
    In this section we first describe the inputs to a semiring parser: a semiring, an itembased description, and a grammar.
    Next, we give the conditions under which a semiring parser gives correct results.
    At the end of this section we discuss three especially complicated and interesting semir
