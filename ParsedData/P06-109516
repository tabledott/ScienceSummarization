te rule (87% accuracy) was GTag Rule 6.6, which links a past-tense event verb joined by a conjunction to another past-tense event verb as being BEFORE the latter (e.g., they traveled and slept the night ..): The vast majority of the intuition-bred rules have very low accuracy compared to ME-C, with intuitions failing for various feature combinations and relations (for relations, for example, GTag lacks rules for IBEFORE, STARTS, and ENDS).
    The bottom-line here is that even when heuristic preferences are intuited, those preferences need to be guided by empirical data, whereas hand-coded rules are relatively ignorant of the distributions that are found in data.
    One might argue that the above baseline is too weak, since it doesn&#8217;t allow for a rich set of lexical relations.
    For example, pushing can result in falling, killing always results in death, and so forth.
    These kinds of defeasible rules have been investigated in the semantics literature, including the work of Lascarides and Asher cit
