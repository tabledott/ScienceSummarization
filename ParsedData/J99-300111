g head positions in the center lists&#8212;preferred transition types stand for a high degree of local coherence, while less preferred ones signal that the underlying discourse might lack coherence&#8212;one should consider adjacent transition pairs and annotate such pairs with the processing costs they incur.
    This way, we define a dual theory-internal metric of inference load by distinguishing between &amp;quot;cheap&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;expensive&amp;quot; transition types.
    Based on this distinction, some transition types receiving bad marks in isolation are ranked &amp;quot;cheap&amp;quot; when they occur in the appropriate context, and vice versa.
    The article is organized as follows: In Section 2, we introduce the different types of anaphora we consider subsequently, viz. pronominal, nominal, and functional anaphora.
    We then turn to the proposed modification of the centering model.
    After a brief introduction into what we call the &amp;quot;grammatical&amp;quot; centering model (actu
