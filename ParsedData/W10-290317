vation we define our meaning derivation process over the rules of the MR language and use syntactic information as a way to bias the MR construction process.
    That is, our inference process considers the entire space of meaning representations irrespective of the patterns observed in the training data.
    This is possible as the MRs are defined by a formal language and formal grammar.4 The syntactic information present in the natural language is used as soft evidence (features) which guides the inference process to good meaning representations.
    This formulation is a major shift from existing approaches that rely on extracting parsing rules from the training data.
    In existing approaches the space of possible meaning representations is constrained by the patterns in the training data and syntactic structure of the natural language input.
    Our formulation considers the entire space of meaning representations and allows the model to adapt to previously unseen data and always produce a semantic inte
