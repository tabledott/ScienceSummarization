 aligned to the corresponding position in the German string.
    A number of researchers (Alshawi, 1996; Wu, 1997; Yamada and Knight, 2001; Gildea, 2003; Melamed, 2004; Graehl and Knight, 2004; Galley et al., 2004) have proposed models where the translation process involves syntactic representations of the source and/or target languages.
    One class of approaches make use of &#8220;bitext&#8221; grammars which simultaneously parse both the source and target languages.
    Another class of approaches make use of syntactic information in the target language alone, effectively transforming the translation problem into a parsing problem.
    Note that these models have radically different structures and parameterizations from phrase&#8211;based models for SMT.
    As yet, these systems have not shown significant gains in accuracy in comparison to phrase-based systems.
    Reranking methods have also been proposed as a method for using syntactic information (Koehn and Knight, 2003; Och et al., 2004; Shen et al.,
