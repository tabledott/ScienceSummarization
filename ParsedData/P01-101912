e handle in the hook corresponds to the LTOP feature in MRS.
    The new vocabulary is: The revised definition of an EP is as in MRS: Definition 7 Elementary Predications (EPs) An EP contains exactly four components: This is written h:r(a1, ... ,an,sa1, ... ,sam).
    For instance, h:every(x, h1, h2) is an EP.5 We revise the definition of semantic entities to add the hcons conditions and to make hooks and holes pairs of handles and indices.
    We will not repeat the full composition definition, since it is unchanged from that in &#167;2 apart from the addition of the append operation on hcons and a slight complication of eq to deal with the handle/index pairs: where Tr stands for transitive closure as before and hdle and ind access the handle and index of a pair.
    We can extend this to include (several) labelled holes and operations, as before.
    And these revised operations still form an algebra.
    The truth definition for SEMENTS is analogous to before.
    We add to the model a set of labels L (han
