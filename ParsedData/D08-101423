 subjectivity labels projected from English.
    The classifier was tested on the same gold standard data set.
    Thus, the two classifiers used the same training data, the same test data, and the same subjectivity annotations, the only difference being the language used (English or Romanian).
    The results for these experiments are compiled in Table 5.
    Interestingly, the experiment conducted on Romanian shows an improvement of 3.5% to 9.5% over the results obtained on English, which indicates that subjective content may be easier to learn in Romanian versus English.
    The fact that Romanian verbs are inflected for mood (such as indicative, conditional, subjunctive, presumptive), enables an automatic classifier to identify additional subjective markers in text.
    Some moods such as conditional and presumptive entail human judgment, and therefore allow for clear subjectivity annotation.
    Moreover, Romanian is a highly inflected language, accommodating for forms of various words based on number, g
