, which means that two types of errors are possible even when the decision to attach j to i is correct.
    Attaching too early means that right dependents can never be attached to j; postponing the attachment too long means that j will never be added to i.
    None of these errors can occur with the arc-eager strategy, which therefore can be expected to work better for data sets where this kind of &#8220;ambiguity&#8221; is commonly found.
    In order for this to be the case, there must first of all be a significant proportion of left-headed structures in the data.
    Thus, we find that in all the data sets for which the arc-standard parsers do badly, the percentage of left-headed dependencies is in the 50&#8211;75% range.
    However, it must also be pointed out that the highest percentage of all is found in Arabic (82.9%), which means that a high proportion of left-headed structures may be a necessary but not sufficient condition for the arc-eager strategy to work better than the arc-standard strategy.
