  In t roduct ion Almost any natural language sentence is ambiguous in structure, reference, or nuance of meaning.
  Humans overcome these apparent ambiguities by examining the con~ezt of the sentence.
  But what exactly is context?
  Frequently, the correct interpretation is apparent from the words or constituents immediately surrounding the phrase in question.
  This observation begs the following question: How much information about the context of a sentence or phrase is necessary and sufficient to de- termine its meaning?
  This question is at the crux of the debate among computational linguists about the ap- plication and implementation of statistical methods in natural anguage understanding.
  Previous work on disambiguation and probabilistic pars- ing has offered partial answers to this question.
  Hidden Markov models of words and their tags, introduced in [1] and [11] and popularized in the
