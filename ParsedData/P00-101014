ill, Even, Most, and Some features below), some other features (DOW and CCYY) were added based on a granularity hypothesis.
    Specifically, it seems possible that &#8220;today&#8221; meaning the day of the utterance sets a scale of events at a day or a small number of days.
    The generic use, &#8220;nowadays&#8221;, seems to have a broader scale.
    Therefore, terms that might point to one of these scales such as the names of days of the week, the word &#8220;year&#8221; and four digit years were also included in the training features.
    To summarize, the features we used for the &#8220;today&#8221; problem are as follows (features are boolean except for string-valued POS1 and POS2): Poss: whether &#8220;today&#8221; has a possessive inflection Qcontext: whether &#8220;today&#8221; is inside a quotation Said: presence of &#8220;said&#8221; in the same sentence Will: presence of &#8220;will&#8221; in the same sentence Even: presence of &#8220;even&#8221; in the same sentence Most: presence of &#8220;mos
