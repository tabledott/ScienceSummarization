 this as the &#8220;cluster-based feature set&#8221; (CL).
    The BLLIP (43M tokens) and PDT (39M tokens) unlabeled data sets shown in Table 1 were used to construct the hierarchical clusterings used within the approach.
    Note that when this feature set is used within the SSSCM approach, the same set of unlabeled data is used to both induce the clusters, and to estimate the generative models within the SS-SCM model.
    As described in section 2.2, the generative models in the SS-SCM approach are defined through a partition of the original feature vector f(x, y) into k feature vectors r1(x, y) ... rk(x, y).
    We follow a similar approach to that of (Suzuki and Isozaki, 2008) in partitioning f(x, y), where the k different feature vectors correspond to different feature types or feature templates.
    Note that, in general, we are not necessary to do as above, this is one systematic way of a feature design for this approach.
    All results presented in our experiments are given in terms of parent-predict
