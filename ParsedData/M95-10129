  In the sentence above, the only unknown word ("Dooner") is not subject to retagging by lexical rules; in fact, the default NNP tag assignment i s correct.
  Lexical rules play a larger role when the default tagging lexicon is less complete than our own, which we generated from the whole Brown Corpus plus 3 million words of Wall Street Journal text .

  After the initial tagging, contextual rules apply in an attempt to further fix errors in the tagging .
  These rules reassign a words tag on the basis of neighboring words and their tags .
  In this sentence, "more" changes from its initial JJR (comparative adjective) to RBR (comparative adverb) .
  Note that this change is arguably erroneous, depending on how one reads the scope of "more".
