d an integrated model.
    We were already using a generative statistical model for part-of-speech tagging (Weischedel et al. 1993), and more recently, had begun using a generative statistical model for name finding (Bikel et al.
    1997).
    Finally, our newly constructed parser, like that of (Collins 1997), was based on a generative statistical model.
    Thus, each component of what would be the first three stages of our pipeline was based on the same general class of statistical model.
    Although each model differed in its detailed probability structure, we believed that the essential elements of all three models could be generalized in a single probability model.
    If the single generalized model could then be extended to semantic analysis, all necessary sentence level processing would be contained in that model.
    Because generative statistical models had already proven successful for each of the first three stages, we were optimistic that some of their properties &#8212; especially their abilit
