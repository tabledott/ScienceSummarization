    Besides computing the probability that a phrase is removed, we also compute two other types of probabilities: the probability that a phrase is reduced (i.e., the phrase is not removed as a whole, but some components in the phrase are removed), and the probability that a phrase is unchanged at all (i.e., neither removed nor reduced).
    These corpus probabilities help us capture human practice.
    For example, for sentences like &amp;quot;The agency reported that ...&amp;quot; , &amp;quot;The other source says that ...&amp;quot; , &amp;quot;The new study suggests that ...&amp;quot; , the thatclause following the say-verb (i.e., report, say, and suggest) in each sentence is very rarely changed at all by professionals.
    The system can capture this human practice, since the probability that that-clause of the verb say or report being unchanged at all will be relatively high, which will help the system to avoid removing components in the that-clause.
    These corpus probabilities are computed beforeha
