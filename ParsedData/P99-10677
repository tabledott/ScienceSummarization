her language those words that are translations of A and B should also co-occur more frequently than expected.
    This is the only statistical clue used throughout this paper.
    It is further assumed that there is a small dictionary available at the beginning, and that our aim is to expand this base lexicon.
    Using a corpus of the target language, we first compute a co-occurrence matrix whose rows are all word types occurring in the corpus and whose columns are all target words appearing in the base lexicon.
    We now select a word of the source language whose translation is to be determined.
    Using our source-language corpus, we compute a co-occurrence vector for this word.
    We translate all known words in this vector to the target language.
    Since our base lexicon is small, only some of the translations are known.
    All unknown words are discarded from the vector and the vector positions are sorted in order to match the vectors of the target-language matrix.
    With the resulting vector, w
