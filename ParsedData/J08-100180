xplicitly annotated with grade levels, they still represent two broad readability categories, namely, easy and difficult.11 Examples of these two categories are given in Table 9.
    Barzilay and Lapata Modeling Local Coherence Features and Parameter Settings.
    We created two system versions: the first one used solely Schwarm and Ostendorf (2005) features;12 the second one employed a richer feature space&#8212;we added the entity-based representation proposed here to their original feature set.
    We will briefly describe the readability-related features used in our systems and direct the interested reader to Schwarm and Ostendorf for a more detailed discussion.
    Schwarm and Ostendorf (2005) use three broad classes of features: syntactic, semantic, and their combination.
    Their syntactic features are average sentence length and features extracted from parse trees computed using Charniak&#8217;s (2000) parser.
    The latter include average parse tree height, average number of NPs, average number of
