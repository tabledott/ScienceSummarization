rsed by just counting occurrences of terminal symbols. translate (40a-b) into the equation: (44) S = NP VP ADJS + V NP (1+PP) ADJS ADJS and then expand VP using (42) (45) S = NP (V NP (1+PP) ADJS) ADJS + V NP (1+PP) ADJS ADJS and factor S = (NP + 1) V NP (1+PP) That can be simplified considerably because NP (1 + PP) = N E E N E and (48) = E adj' E adj' = (i + so that S = (N E + 1) N E Cat.
