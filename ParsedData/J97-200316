leaving qi and q2.
    See Mohri (1996b) for a full description of this algorithm.
    Figure 5 shows the 2-subsequential transducer obtained by constructing the union of the transducers 7-1 and T2 this way.
    Notice that according to the theorem the result could be a priori 3-subsequential, but these two transducers share no common accepted string.
    In such cases, the resulting transducer is max(p, q)-subsequential.
    The linear complexity of their use makes sequential or p-subsequential transducers both mathematically and computationally of particular interest.
    However, not all transducers, even when they realize functions (rational functions), admit an equivalent sequential or subsequential transducer.
    Consider, for instance, the function f associated with the classical transducer represented in Figure 6; f can be defined by:1 VW E {X}-1-, f (w) = aim' if I w I is even, = Owl otherwise This function is not sequential, that is, it cannot be realized by any sequential transducer.
    Indeed, i
