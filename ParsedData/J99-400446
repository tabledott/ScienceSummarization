 as those Earley's algorithm uses for rules of the form A &#8212;&gt; B and B A.
    In this case, Equation 8 forms a set of linear equations that can be solved by matrix inversion.
    In the more general case, as is likely to happen with epsilon rules, we get a set of nonlinear equations, and must solve them by approximation techniques, such as simply computing successive generations for many iterations.'
    Stolcke (1993) provides an excellent discussion of these cases, including a discussion of sparse matrix inversion, useful for speeding up some computations.
    5 Note that even in the case where we can only use approximation techniques, this algorithm is relatively efficient.
    By assumption, in this case, there is at least one deduction rule with two items in the current generation; thus, the number of deduction trees over which we are summing grows exponentially with the number of generations: a linear amount of computation yields the sum of the values of exponentially many trees.
