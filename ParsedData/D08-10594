  Finally, we show that by using a beam-search decoder, we are able to combine graph-based and transition-based parsing into a single system, with the combined system significantly outperforming each individual system.
    In experiments with the English and Chinese Penn Treebank data, the combined parser gave 92.1% and 86.2% accuracy, respectively, which are comparable to the best parsing results for these data sets, while the Chinese accuracy outperforms the previous best reported by 1.8%.
    In line with previous work on dependency parsing using the Penn Treebank, we focus on projective dependency parsing.
  
  
    Following MSTParser (McDonald et al., 2005; McDonald and Pereira, 2006), we define the graphVariables: agenda &#8211; the beam for state items item &#8211; partial parse tree output &#8211; a set of output items index, prev &#8211; word indexes Input: x &#8211; POS-tagged input sentence.
    Initialization: agenda = [&#8220;&#8221;] put the best items from output to agenda Output: the best ite
