sume they are wrong but with a special caveat for proper nouns.
    WordNet includes few proper noun MWUs.
    Yet several algorithms produce large numbers of proper nouns.
    This biases against them.
    One could contend that all proper nouns MWUs are valid, but we disagree.
    Although such may be MWUs, they are not necessarily MRD headwords; one would not include every proper noun in a dictionary, but rather, those needing definitions.
    To overcome this, we will have two scoring modes.
    The first, &#8220;S&#8221; mode (standing for some) discards any proposed capitalized n-gram whose uncapitalized version is not in WordNet.
    The second mode &#8220;N&#8221; (for none) disregards all capitalized n-grams.
    Table 3 illustrates algorithmic performance as compared to the 2610 MWUs from WordNet.
    The first double column illustrates &#8220;out-of-the-box&#8221; performance on all 177,331 possible n-grams.
    The second double column shows cross-sourcing: only hypothesizing MWUs that appear in a
