accurately both by STEP and by hu man annotators, while the words on the periphery of the category had the lowest scores and were associated with low rates of inter-annotator agreement.
	
	
			Many of the tasks required for effective seman tic tagging of phrases and texts rely on a list ofwords annotated with some lexical semantic fea tures.
			Traditional approaches to the development of such lists are based on the implicit assumption of classical truth-conditional theories of meaningrepresentation, which regard all members of a category as equal: no element is more of a member than any other (Edmonds, 1999).
			In this paper, we challenge the applicability of this assump tion to the semantic category of sentiment, whichconsists of positive, negative and neutral subcate gories, and present a dictionary-based Sentiment Tag Extraction Program (STEP) that we use to generate a fuzzy set of English sentiment-bearing words for the use in sentiment tagging systems 1.
