ation is B if the answer is no: Brill Transformation-Based Error-Driven Learning this tree can be converted into the following transformation list: Assume that two decision trees T1 and T2 have corresponding transformation lists L1 and L2.
    Assume that the arbitrary label names chosen in constructing Ll are not used in L2, and that those in L2 are not used in L1.
    Given a new decision tree T3 constructed from T1 and T2 as follows: X? we construct a new transformation list L3.
    Assume the first transformation in L1 is: Label with S' and the first transformation in L2 is: Label with S&amp;quot; The first three transformations in L3 Will then be: followed by all of the rules in L1 other than the first rule, followed by all of the rules in L2 other than the first rule.
    The resulting transformation list will first label an item as S' if X is true, or as S&amp;quot; if X is false.
    Next, the tranformations from L1 will be applied if X is true, since S' is the initial-state label for L1.
    If X is
