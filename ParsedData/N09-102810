    We go through all children of the node and get the precedence weights for them from the set of precedence tuples.
    If we encounter a child node that has a dependency label not listed in the set of tuples, we give it a default weight of 0 and default order type of NORMAL.
    The children nodes are sorted according to their weights from highest to lowest, and nodes with the same weights are ordered according to the type of order defined in the rule.
    Verb movement is the most important movement when translating from English (SVO) to Korean (SOV).
    In a dependency parse tree, a verb node can potentially have many children.
    For example, auxiliary and passive auxiliary verbs are often grouped together with the main verb and moved together with it.
    The order, however, is reversed after the movement.
    In the example of Figure 2, the correct Korean word order is &#8220;&#65533;&#65533; (hit) T L}(can) .
    Other categories that are in the same group are phrasal verb particle and negation.
