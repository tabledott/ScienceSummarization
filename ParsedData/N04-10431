xamples to configure for new name classes.
    Nevertheless, it did not meet the user's needs.
    To achieve reasonable performance, the HMM-based technology we presented required roughly 150,000 words of annotated examples, and over a million words to achieve peak accuracy.
    Given a typical annotation rate of 5,000 words per hour, we estimated that setting up a name finder for a new problem would take four person days of annotation work &#8211; a period we considered reasonable.
    However, this user's problems were too dynamic for that much setup time.
    To be useful, the system would have to be trainable in minutes or hours, not days or weeks.
    We left the meeting thinking about ways to reduce training requirements to no more than a few hours.
    It seemed that three existing ideas could be combined in a way that might reduce training requirements sufficiently to achieve the objective.
    First were techniques for producing word clusters from large unannotated corpora (Brown et al., 1990; Perei
