sing is a four-stage pipeline consisting of: Since we were interested in exploiting recent advances in parsing, replacing the syntactic analysis stage of the standard pipeline with a modern statistical parser was an obvious possibility.
    However, pipelined architectures suffer from a serious disadvantage: errors accumulate as they propagate through the pipeline.
    For example, an error made during part-of-speech-tagging may cause a future error in syntactic analysis, which may in turn cause a semantic interpretation failure.
    There is no opportunity for a later stage, such as parsing, to influence or correct an earlier stage such as part-of-speech tagging.
    An integrated model can limit the propagation of errors by making all decisions jointly.
    For this reason, we focused on designing an integrated model in which tagging, namefinding, parsing, and semantic interpretation decisions all have the opportunity to mutually influence each other.
    A second consideration influenced our decision towar
