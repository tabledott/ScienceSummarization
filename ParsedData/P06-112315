le 2 shows the lower bound on alignment failure rates with and without gaps for five languages paired with English.
    This table represents the case where the only constraints are from word alignments.
    Wu (1997) has &#8220;been unable to find real examples&#8221; of cases where hierarchical alignment would fail under these conditions, at least in &#8220;fixed-word-order languages that are lightly inflected, such as English and Chinese.&#8221; (p. 385).
    In contrast, we found examples in all bitexts that could not be hierarchically aligned without gaps, including at least 5% of the Chinese/English sentence pairs.
    Allowing constituents with a single gap on one side of the bitext decreased the observed failure rate to zero for all five bitexts.
    Table 3 shows what happened when we used monolingual parse trees to restrict the compositions on the English side.
    The failure rates were above 35% for four of the five language pairs, and 61% for Chinese/English!
    Again, the failure rate fell dram
