as minister gave, minister gave a, and so forth).6 These observations suggest a finer-grained approach to the constituency feature idea, retaining the idea of soft constraints, but applying them using various soft-constraint constituency features.
    Our first observation argues for distinguishing among constituent types (NP, VP, etc.).
    Our second observation argues for distinguishing the benefit of match6This accomplishes coverage of the logically complete set of possibilities, which include not only f matching a constituent exactly or crossing its boundaries, but also f being properly contained within the constituent span, properly containing it, or being outside it entirely.
    Whenever these latter possibilities occur, f will exactly match or cross the boundaries of some other constituent. ing constituents from the cost of crossing constituent boundaries.
    We therefore define a space of new features as the cross product {CP, IP, NP, VP, ...} x {_, +}. where = and + signify matching and crossing b
