ionality in turn enables us to evaluate which linguistic information matters for the sense induction task.
    Previous attempts to handle multiple information sources in the LDA framework (e.g., Griffiths et al. 2005; Barnard et al.
    2003) have been task-specific and limited to only two layers of information.
    Our model provides this utility in a general framework, and could be applied to other tasks, besides sense induction.
  
  
    The core idea behind sense induction is that contextual information provides important cues regarding a word&#8217;s meaning.
    The idea dates back to (at least) Firth (1957) (&#8220;You shall know a word by the company it keeps&#8221;), and underlies most WSD and lexicon acquisition work to date.
    Under this premise, we should expect different senses to be signaled by different lexical distributions.
    We can place sense induction in a probabilistic setting by modeling the context words around the ambiguous target as samples from a multinomial sense distribution.
