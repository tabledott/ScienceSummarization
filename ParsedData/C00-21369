ir distribution is correlated with docmnent relevance (i.e., appears with higher frequency in relevant docu- ments than in non-relewmt ones).
  Add the highest ranking pattern to the pat- tern set.
  (Optionally, at this point, we may present he pattern to the user for review.)
  Use the new pattern set; to induce a new split of the corpus into relevant and non- relevant documents.
  More precisely, docu- ments will now be given a relevance confi- dence measure; documents containing one of the initial seed patterns will be given a score of 1, while documents which arc added to the relevant cortms through newly discovered patterns will be given a lower score.
  I/,epeat the procedure (from step 1) until some iteration limit is reached, or no more patterns can be added.
