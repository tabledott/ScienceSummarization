ocument are writing, reference, english, grammar, style, language, books, book, strunk, and education, the first eight of which were included in our set of 20 tags.
    In the figure, each word that has high posterior probability from one tag has been annotated with that tag.
    The red words come from the style tag, green from the grammar tag, blue from the reference tag, and black from the education tag.
    In this case, the model does very well at assigning individual words to the tags that, subjectively, seem to strongly imply the presence of that tag on this page.
    A more polished rendering could add subtle visual cues about which parts of a page are most appropriate for a particular set of tags.
