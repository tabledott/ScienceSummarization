ific NLP tasks may require different segmentation criteria.
    For example, &#8220;J L;5',W f j!&#8221; could be treated as a single word (Bank of Beijing) for machine translation, while it is more naturally segmented into &#8220;J L&#65533; (Beijing) Wf j!
    (bank)&#8221; for tasks such as text-to-speech synthesis.
    Therefore, supervised learning with specifically defined training data has become the dominant approach.
    Following Xue (2003), the standard approach to of characters which have themselves been seen as words; here an automatic segmentor may split the OOV word into individual single-character words.
    Typical examples of unseen words include Chinese names, translated foreign names and idioms.
    The segmentation of known words can also be ambiguous.
    For example, &#8220;iK IITiiI&#8221; should be &#8220;iK (here) IITi iI (flour)&#8221; in the sentence &#8220;iK IITiiI&#65533;H*TR &amp;quot;&#8221; (flour and rice are expensive here) or &#8220;iK (here) IITiiI (inside)&#8221; in the
