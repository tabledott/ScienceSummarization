which are then used to train a different type of classifier for the same problem.
    Wong and Ng (2007) made the assumption that each proper named belongs to one class (they observed that this is true about 85% of the time for English).
    Suzuki and Isozaki (2008), on the other hand, used the automatically labeled corpus to train HMMs.
    Ando and Zhang (2005) defined an objective function that combines the original problem on the labeled data with a set of auxiliary problems on unlabeled data.
    The definition of an auxiliary problem can be quite flexible as long as it can be automatically labeled and shares some structural properties with the original problem.
    The combined objective function is then alternatingly optimized with the labeled and unlabeled data.
    This training regime puts pressure on the discriminative learner to exploit the structures uncovered from the unlabeled data.
    In the two-stage cluster-based approaches such as ours, clustering is mostly decoupled from the supervised l
