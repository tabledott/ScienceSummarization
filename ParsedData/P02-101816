    The previous section described an algorithm for restoring empty nodes and co-indexing their antecedents.
    This section describes two evaluation procedures for such algorithms.
    The first, which measures the accuracy of empty node recovery but not co-indexation, is just the standard Parseval evaluation applied to empty nodes only, viz., precision and recall and scores derived from these.
    In this evaluation, each node is represented by a triple consisting of its category and its left and right string positions.
    (Note that because empty nodes dominate the empty string, their left and right string positions of empty nodes are always identical).
    Let G be the set of such empty node representations derived from the &#8220;gold standard&#8221; evaluation corpus and T the set of empty node representations column is the number of times the pattern was found, and the Match column is an estimate of the number of times that this pattern matches so
