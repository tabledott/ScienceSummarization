or the leaves are proper artificial concepts.
    That is, one would not expect any language to explicitly verbalize the concept of for example manner of motion verbs which specify the specific instrument used.
    Nevertheless such a structuring is important because it captures semantic intuitions every speaker of German has and it groups verbs according to their semantic relatedness.
    Contrary to WordNet, GertnaNet enforces the use of cross-classification whenever two conflicting hierarchies apply.
    This becomes important for example in the classification of animals, where folk and specialized biological hierarchy compete on a large scale.
    By cross-classifying between these two hierarchies the taxonomy becomes more accessible and integrates different semantic components which are essential to the meaning of the concepts.
    For example, in figure 4 the concept of a cat is shown to biologically be a vertebrate, and a pet in the folk hierarchy, whereas a whale is only a vertebrate and not a pet.
