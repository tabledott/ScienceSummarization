composed in both sentences into a constituent without crossing any phrase boundaries in the tree, as can on and Friday.
    These two constituents can then be composed to cover the entire sentence pair.
    On the other hand, if a constraining tree is applied to the other sentence as shown in Figure 2b, then the word alignment and tree constraint conflict.
    The projection of the VP is discontinuous in the top sentence, so the links that it covers cannot be composed into a constituent without gaps.
    On the other hand, if a gap is allowed, then the VP can compose as on Friday ... left in the top sentence, where the ellipsis represents a gap.
    This VP can then compose with the NP complete a synchronous parse tree.
    Some authors have applied constraining parse trees to both sides of the bitext.
    The example in Figure 3 can be hierarchically aligned using either one of the two constraining trees, but gaps are necessary to align it with both trees.
    We parsed the English side of each bilingual bit
