 be adopted to new translation directions.
    A finite-state control is added, and its usefulness is demonstrated for the translation direction German to English, in which the word order difference between the two languages is mainly due to the German verb group.
    Future work might aim at a tighter integration of the IBM-4 model distortion probabilities and the finite-state control; the finite-state control itself may be learned from training data.
    The applicability of the algorithm applied in the experiments in this article is not restricted to the IBM translation models or to the simplified translation model used in the description of the algorithm in Section 3.
    Since the efficiency of the beam search approach is based on restrictions on the allowed coverage vectors C alone, the approach may be used for different types of translation models as well (e.g., for the multiword-based translation model proposed in Och, Tillmann, and Ney [1999]).
    On the other hand, since the decoding problem for th
