nformation value.
    For each noun and verb pair, we get two mutual information values, for subject and object, n) and C j(v nj) We define the object similarity of two nouns with respect to a verb in terms of the minimum shared COOCCCUrrenCe weights, as in (2).
    The subject similarity of two nouns, SfM,1, is defined analogously.
    Now define the overall similarity of two nouns as the sum across all verbs of the object similarity and the subject similarity, as in (3).
    The metric of similarity in (2) and (3) is but one of many that might be explored, but it has some useful properties.
    Unlike an inner product measure, it is guaranteed that a noun will be most similar to itself.
    And unlike cosine distance, this metric is roughly proportional to the number of different verb contexts that are shared by two nouns.
    Using the definition of similarity in (3), we can begin to explore nouns that show the greatest similarity.
    Table 4 shows the ten nouns most similar to boat, according to our simi
