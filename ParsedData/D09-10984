 two strategies and efficiently computes the exact similarity (cosine, Jaccard, Dice, and Overlap) between all pairs.
    Building entity lexicons is a task of great interest for which structured, semi-structured and unstructured data have all been explored (GoogleSets; Sarmento et al. 2007; Wang and Cohen 2007; Bunescu and Mooney 2004; Etzioni et al.
    2005; Pa&#351;ca et al. 2006).
    Our own work focuses on set expansion from unstructured Web text.
    Apart from the choice of a data source, state-of-the-art entity extraction methods differ in their use of numerous, few or no labeled examples, the open or targeted nature of the extraction as well as the types of features employed.
    Supervised approaches (McCallum and Li 2003, Bunescu and Mooney 2004) rely on large sets of labeled examples, perform targeted extraction and employ a variety of sentence- and corpus-level features.
    While very precise, these methods are typically used for coarse grained entity classes (People, Organizations, Companies)
