f the conditions A1 Ak are all true, then we infer that B is also true.
    The A, can be either items, or (in an extension of the usual convention for inference rules) rules, such as R(A BC).
    We write R(A BC) rather than A BC to indicate that we could be interested in a value associated with the rule, such as the probability of the rule if we were computing inside probabilities.
    If an A, is in the form R(.
    .
    .
    ), we call it a rule.
    All of the A, must be rules or items; when we wish to refer to both rules and items, we use the word terms.
    We now give an example of an item-based description, and its semantics.
    Figure 3 gives a description of a CKY-style parser.
    For this example, we will use the inside semiring, whose additive operator is addition and whose multiplicative operator is multiplication.
    We use the input string xxx to the following grammar: The effect of the unary rule will exactly parallel the first set of loops in the CKY inside algorithm.
    We will instan
