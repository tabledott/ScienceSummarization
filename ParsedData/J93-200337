(1, e) depends only on 7rik, i, m, and /.
    The parameters of Model 3 are thus a set of fertility probabilities, n(cbl ei) E Pr(01011.-1, e); a set of translation probabilities, t(f ei) = Pr(Tik e); and a set of distortion probabilities, d(jli, m, 1) a- Pr (111k = jk1 74-1, 7-(1, 10(1), e).
    We treat the distortion and fertility probabilities for e0 differently.
    The empty cept conventionally occupies position 0, but actually has no position.
    Its purpose is to account for those words in the French string that cannot readily be accounted for by other cepts in the English string.
    Because we expect these words to be spread uniformly throughout the French string, and because they are placed only after all of the other Peter F. Brown et al. The Mathematics of Statistical Machine Translation words in the string have been placed, we assume that Pr(110k+1 = jlir, 71, TO, e) equals 0 unless position j is vacant in which case it equals (00 - k)-1.
    Therefore, the contribution of the distortion probab
