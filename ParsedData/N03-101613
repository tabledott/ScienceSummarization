te summaries, some illustrated in figure 2.
    S1 specifies only the total number of words outside e, while S specifies separately the number to the left and right.
    SX also specifies e&#8217;s label.
    SXL and SXR add the tags adjacent to e on the left and right respectively.
    S1XLR includes both the left and right tags, but merges the number of words to the left and right.4 As the summaries become richer, the estimates become sharper.
    As an example, consider an NP in the context &#8220;VBZ NP , PRP VBZ DT NN .&#8221; shown in figure 2.5 The summary SX reveals only that there is an NP with 1 word to the left and 6 the right, and gives an estimate of &#8722;11.3.
    This score is backed by the concrete parse shown in figure 2(a).
    This is a best parse of a context compatible with what little we specified, but very optimistic.
    It assumes very common tags in very common patterns.
    SXL adds that the tag to the left is VBZ, and the hypothesis that the NP is part of a sentence-initial PP mu
