 for given data [ 11 ].
  More precisely, given any specification of the probabilitics P(e, l f ) ,  R(k l e,), and Q(%le,) , we compute the probabilities P(E,$ [ F) needed in step 1, and after carrying out step 4, wct, sc the freshly obtained probabilities P(e, I f ) ,  R(k ]e,), and Q(e, I e,) to repeat the process fiom step I again, etc.
  We hah the computation when the obtained estimates top changing from iteration to iteration.
  While it can be shown that tile probability estimates obtained in the above process will converge [11,12], it cannot be proven that the values obtained will be the desired ones.
  A heuristic argument can be formulated making it plausible that a more complex but computationally excessive version [13] will succceC Its truncated modification leads to a glossary that seems a very satisfactory one.
  We present some interesting examples of its P(e, I f )  entries in Figure 3.
  Two important aspects of this process have not yet been dealt with: the initial selection of values of P(
