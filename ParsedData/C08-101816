 in the manner of Cohn and Lapata (2007) (see Section 5for details) and augment it with a larger grammar obtained from a parallel bilingual corpus.
			Crucially, our second grammar will not contain com pression rules, just paraphrasing ones.
			We leave itto the model to learn which rules serve the com pression objective.
			Our paraphrase grammar extraction method uses bilingual pivoting to learn paraphrases over syntax tree fragments, i.e., STSG rules.
			Pivoting treats the paraphrasing problem as a two-stage translation process.
			Some English text is translated to a foreign language, and then translated back into English (Bannard and Callison-Burch, 2005): p(e ? |e) = ? f p(e ? |f)p(f |e) (4) where p(f |e) is the probability of translating an English string e into a foreign string f and p(e ?|f) the probability of translating the same for eign string into some other English string e ? .
			We.
			thus obtain English-English translation probabili ties p(e ? |e) by marginalizing out the foreign text.Inste
