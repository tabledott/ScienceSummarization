 no parses.
    However, an underspecified verb sense yields three parses, differing in the subcategorization frame of the verb &amp;quot;list.&amp;quot; For more complex sentences, even with this very limited protocol, the number of parses for the appropriate word sense can reach into the hundreds.
    Using the rule probabilities acquired through supervised training (described in the previous section), the likelihood of the ambiguous interpretations resulting from a sentence with an unknown word was computed.
    Then we tested whether the tree ranked most highly matched the tree previously selected by a person as the correct one.
    This tree equivalence test was based on the tree's structure and on the rule applied at each node; while an underspecified tree might have some less-specified feature values than the chosen fully specified tree, it would still be equivalent in the sense above.
    Of 160 inputs with an unknown word, in 130 cases the most likely tree matched the correct one, for an error rate o
