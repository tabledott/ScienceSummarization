uts, much in the same way speech recognizers employ language models at the sentence level.
    Our evaluation results demonstrate the effectiveness of our entity-based ranking model within the general framework of coherence assessment.
    First, we evaluate the utility of the model in a text ordering task where our algorithm has to select a maximally coherent sentence order from a set of candidate permutations.
    Second, we compare the rankings produced by the model against human coherence judgments elicited for automatically generated summaries.
    In both experiments, our method yields a significant improvement over a state-of-the-art coherence model based on Latent Semantic Analysis (Foltz et al., 1998).
    In the following section, we provide an overview of existing work on the automatic assessment of local coherence.
    Then, we introduce our entity-based representation, and describe our ranking model.
    Next, we present the experimental framework and data.
    Evaluation results conclude the pap
