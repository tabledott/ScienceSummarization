provements in performance.
    Collins (2000) shows similar improvements through a quite different model based on boosting approaches to reranking (Freund et al. 1998).
    An initial model&#8212;in fact Model 2 described in the current article&#8212;is used to generate N-best output.
    The reranking approach attempts to rerank the N-best lists using additional features that are not used in the initial model.
    The intention of this approach is to allow greater flexibility in the features that can be included in the model.
    Finally, Bod (2001) describes a very different approach (a DOP approach to parsing) that gives excellent results on treebank parsing, comparable to the results of Charniak (2000) and Collins (2000).
    We now give a more detailed comparison of the models in this article to the parser of Charniak (1997).
    The model described in Charniak (1997) has two types of parameters: For example, the dependency parameter for an NP headed by profits, which is the subject of the verb rose, wou
