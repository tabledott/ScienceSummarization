ch as correctness and complexity, and the search mechanism used when executing the machine.
    In the experimental evaluation in Section 6, we will use the standard technique of approximating oracles with classifiers trained on treebank data.
    However, in the formal characterization of different parsing algorithms in Sections 4 and 5, we will concentrate on properties of the underlying transition systems.
    In particular, assuming that both o(c) and t(c) can be performed in constant time (for every o, t and c), which is reasonable in most cases, the worst-case time complexity of a deterministic parser based on a transition system S is given by an upper bound on the length of transition sequences in S. And the space complexity is given by an upper bound on the size of a configuration c E C, because only one configuration needs to be stored at any given time in a deterministic parser.
  
  
    The stack-based algorithms make use of a stack to store partially processed tokens, that is, tokens that have be
