&#8221; 15 &#8220;bad&#8221;), we carried out an evaluation of the full candidate set similar to the one for English-French discussed in Section 2.2.3.
    This was a threefold cross-validation experiment in which decision tree classifiers were tuned on the features extracted for each candidate pair by structure-based classification.23 In addition to the four structural scores, we included two language identification confidence scores (one for the English page, one for the Arabic page); these were available as part of the Internet Archive&#8217;s bookkeeping information for each URL and required no additional computation on our part.
    Table 5 shows precision and recall of each fold&#8217;s classifier applied to the corresponding test set of page pairs.
    The value of the parameter-tuning process is dramatically confirmed by comparing the learned parameters with STRAND&#8217;s default parameters (manually determined by Resnik [1999]).
    Note, however, that the candidate generation system is highly preci
