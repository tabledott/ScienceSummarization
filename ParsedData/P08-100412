 of a relation, I-REL, indicating the continuation of a predicted relation, or O, indicating the token is not believed to be part of an explicit relationship.
    An illustration is given in Figure 1.
    The set of features used by O-CRF is largely similar to those used by O-NB and other stateof-the-art relation extraction systems, They include part-of-speech tags (predicted using a separately trained maximum-entropy model), regular expressions (e.g.detecting capitalization, punctuation, etc.
    ), context words, and conjunctions of features occurring in adjacent positions within six words to the left and six words to the right of the current word.
    A unique aspect of O-CRF is that O-CRF uses context words belonging only to closed classes (e.g. prepositions and determiners) but not function words such as verbs or nouns.
    Thus, unlike most RE systems, O-CRF does not try to recognize semantic classes of entities.
    O-CRF has a number of limitations, most of which are shared with other systems that per
