matrix can specify a segment completely, in which case it is equivalent to the unanalyzable segment names we have been using, or it can leave it underspecified.
    Feature matrices therefore constitute an abbreviatory convention with the advantage that what is easy to abbreviate will be motivated to just the extent that the features themselves are motivated.
    An underspecified segment corresponds to a set of fully specified segments, and a rule that contains underspecified segments corresponds to a set of rules that are to be applied in batch mode.
    Feature matrices based on a well-motivated set of features allow the phonologist to capture significant generalizations and thus effectively to reduce the components of our batch rules to a single rule in most cases.
    A significant addition that has been made to the basic machinery of feature-based rules consists of variables written with lowercase Greek letters a, 0, 7, etc. and ranging over the values + and -.
    We can use them, for example, to colla
