 In an earlier section we discussed using stop words and frequency cutoffs to keep only the high &#8220;information content&#8221; words.
    In addition to those, we also experimented with a term frequency &#183; inverse document frequency cutoff.
    Term frequency and inverse document frequency are commonly used metrics in information retrieval.
    For a given word, term frequency (tf) is the number of times a word appears in the corpus.
    The document frequency is number of documents in which the word occurs.
    Inverse document frequency (idf) is then computed as The tf &#183; idf value is an indicator of the specificity of a word.
    The higher the tf &#183; idf value, the lower the specificity.
    Figure 3 shows a plot of tf &#183; idf cutoff on the x-axis against the correlation of the Gloss Vector measure with human judgments on the y-axis.
    The tf &#183;idf values ranged from 0 to about 4200.
    Note that we get lower correlation as the cutoff is raised.
