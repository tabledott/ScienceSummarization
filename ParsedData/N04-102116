successful.
    We hope that this feature will compensate for a weak model of word movement in the baseline system.
    Chinese POS sequences are projected to English using the word alignment.
    Relative positions are indicated for each Chinese tag.
    The feature function was also tried without the relative positions: 14 (measure) open border cities The table shows an example tagging of an English hypothesis showing how it was generated from the Chinese sentence.
    The feature function is the log probability output by a trigram language model over this sequence.
    This is similar to the HMM Alignment model (Vogel, Ney, and Tillmann, 1996) but in this case movement is calculated on the basis of parts of speech.
    The Projected POS feature function was one of the strongest performing shallow syntactic feature functions, with a %BLEU score of 31.8.
    This feature function can be thought of as a trade-off between purely word-based models, and full generative models based upon shallow syntax.
