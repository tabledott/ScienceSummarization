  Finally, the seventh divergence type is a lexical divergence: in (7), the event is lexically realized as the main verb break in English but as a different verb forzar (literally force) in Spanish.
  The next section discusses the divergence classification given above, comparing the current divergence categories with those of other researchers.
  Section 3 formally defines the terms used to classify divergences.
  Section 4 uses this terminology to formalize the divergence classification and to define the solution to the divergence problem in the context of detailed examples.
  Finally, Section 5 discusses certain issues of relevance to the divergence problem including the resolution of several (recursively) interacting divergence types.
  Classification of Machine Translation Divergences The divergence problem in machine translation has received increasingly greater at- tention in recent literature (see, for example, Barnett et al.
