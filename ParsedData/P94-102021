 combination of letter four-grams is difficult.
    Further, the clustering procedure used to assign word meaning based on these features is such that the resulting sense clusters do not have known statistical properties.
    This makes it impossible to generalize the results to other data sets.
    Black ([3]) used decision trees ([4]) to define the relationships among a number of pre-specified contextual features, which he called &amp;quot;contextual categories&amp;quot;, and the sense tags of an ambiguous word.
    The tree construction process used by Black partitions the data according to the values of one contextual feature before considering the values of the next, thereby treating all features incorporated in the tree as interdependent.
    The method presented here for using information from multiple contextual features is more flexible and makes better use of a small data set by eliminating the need to treat all features as interdependent.
    The work that bears the closest resemblance to the work
