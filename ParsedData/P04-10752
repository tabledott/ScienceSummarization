Practically, a batch of examples are selected at a time, called batchedbased sample selection (Lewis and Catlett 1994) since it is time consuming to retrain the model if only one new example is added to the training set.
    Many existing work in the area focus on two approaches: certainty-based methods (Thompson et al. 1999; Tang et al.
    2002; Schohn and Cohn 2000; Tong and Koller 2000; Brinker 2003) and committee-based methods (McCallum and Nigam 1998; Engelson and Dagan 1999; Ngai and Yarowsky 2000) to select the most informative examples for which the current model are most uncertain.
    Being the first piece of work on active learning for name entity recognition (NER) task, we target to minimize the human annotation efforts yet still reaching the same level of performance as a supervised learning approach.
    For this purpose, we make a more comprehensive consideration on the contribution of individual examples, and more importantly maximizing the contribution of a batch based on three criteria: inf
