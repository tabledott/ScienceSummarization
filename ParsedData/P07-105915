abilities p&#966;(syn|trg) and p&#966;,(trg|syn) from relative frequencies of phrases in bilingual tables.
    In contrast to Bannard and Callison-Burch (2005), we applied the same inference step to infer also lexical translation probabilities pw(syn|trg) and pw,(trg|syn) as defined in Koehn et al. (2003) for para-phrases.
    Furthermore, we deployed features for the number of words lw, number of phrases c&#966; , a reordering score pd , and a score for a 6-gram language model pLM trained on English web data.
    The final model combines these features in a log-linear model that defines the probability of paraphrasing a full sentence, consisting of a sequence of I phrases qa-translation (how, how) (to, to) (live, live) (with, with) (cat, pet) (allergies, allergies) (how, how) (to, to) (live, live) (with, with) (cat, cat) (allergies, allergy) (how, how) (to, to) (live, live) (with, with) (cat, cat) (allergies, food) (how, how) (to, to) (live, live) (with, with) (cat, cats) (allergies, allergies) paraphrasing
