se of both the English features and the Chinese features in a unified framework.
    The framework of the proposed approach is illustrated in Figure 1.
    The framework consists of a training phase and a classification phase.
    In the training phase, the input is the labeled English reviews and some amounts of unlabeled Chinese reviews1.
    The labeled English reviews are translated into labeled Chinese reviews, and the unlabeled Chinese reviews are translated into unlabeled English reviews, by using machine translation services.
    Therefore, each review is associated with an English version and a Chinese version.
    The English features and the Chinese features for each review are considered two independent and redundant views of the review.
    The co-training algorithm is then applied to learn two classifiers and finally the two classifiers are combined into a single sentiment classifier.
    In the classification phase, each unlabeled Chinese review for testing is first translated into English revi
