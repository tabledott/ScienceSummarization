  We asked two subjects to write headline headlines for 73 AP stories from the TIPSTER corpus for January 1, 1989, by selecting words in order from the story.
    Of the 146 headlines, 2 did not meet the &#8220;select-words-in-order&#8221; criteria because of accidental word reordering.
    We found that at least one fluent and accurate headline meeting the criteria was created for each of the stories.
    The average length of the headlines was 10.76 words.
    Later we examined the distribution of the headline words among the sentences of the stories, i.e. how many came from the first sentence of a story, how many from the second sentence, etc.
    The results of this study are shown in Figure 1.
    We observe that 86.8% of the headline words were chosen from the first sentence of their stories.
    We performed a subsequent study in which two subjects created 100 headlines for 100 AP stories from August 6, 1990.
    51.4% of the headline words in the second set were chosen from the first sentence.
