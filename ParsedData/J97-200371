n the previous subsets constructed.
    We have produced an implementation of the determinization that allows one both to completely expand the result or to expand it on demand.
    Arcs leaving a state of Mohri Transducers in Language and Speech the determinized transducer are expanded only if necessary This characteristic of the implementation is important.
    It can then be used, for instance, at any step in an onthe-fly cascade of composition of transducers in speech recognition to expand only the necessary part of a lattice or transducer (Pereira and Riley 1996; Mohri, Pereira, and Riley 1996).
    One of the essential implications of the implementation is that it contributes to saving space during the search stage.
    It is also very useful in speeding up the n-best decoder in speech recognition.'
    The determinization and minimization algorithms for string-to-weight transducers seem to have other applications in speech processing.
    Many new experiments can be done using these algorithms at diffe
