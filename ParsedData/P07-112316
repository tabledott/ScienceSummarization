ifier could be used to harvest subjective sentences from unlabeled Romanian data (e.g., for a subsequent bootstrapping process).
    The system is not very effective for objective classification, however.
    Recall that the objective classifier relies on the weak subjectivity clues, for which the transfer of subjectivity in the translation process was particularly low.
  
  
    Given the low number of subjective entries found in the automatically generated lexicon and the subsequent low recall of the lexical classifier, we decided to also explore a second, corpus-based approach.
    This approach builds a subjectivity-annotated corpus for the target language through projection, and then trains a statistical classifier on the resulting corpus (numerous statistical classifiers have been trained for subjectivity or sentiment classification, e.g., (Pang et al., 2002; Yu and Hatzivassiloglou, 2003)).
    The hypothesis is that we can eliminate some of the ambiguities (and consequent loss of subjectivity) observe
