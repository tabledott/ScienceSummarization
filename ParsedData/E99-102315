    Ramshaw and Marcus used transformationbased learning (TBL) for developing two chunkers (Ramshaw and Marcus, 1995).
    One was trained to recognize baseNPs and the other was trained to recognize both NP chunks and VP chunks.
    Ramshaw and Marcus approached the chunking task as a tagging problem.
    Their baseNP training and test data from the Wall Street Journal corpus are still being used as benchmark data for current chunking experiments.
    (Ramshaw and Marcus, 1995) shows that baseNP recognition (F0=1=92.0) is easier than finding both NP and VP chunks (F0=1=88.1) and that increasing the size of the training data increases the performance on the test set.
    The work by Ramshaw and Marcus has inspired three other groups to build chunking algorithms.
    (Argamon et al., 1998) introduce Memory-Based Sequence Learning and use it for different chunking experiments.
    Their algorithm stores sequences of POS tags with chunk brackets and uses this information for recognizing chunks in unseen d
