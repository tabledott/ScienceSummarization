			The results from the previous section motivate theneed for a more refined evaluation.
			They sug gest that for certain error annotation tasks, such as preposition usage, it may not be appropriate to use only one rater and that if one uses multiple raters 869for error annotation, there is the possibility of cre ating an adjudicated set, or at least calculating the variability of the system?s performance.
			However,annotation with multiple raters has its own disadvantages as it is much more expensive and time consuming.
			Even using one rater to produce a sizeable evaluation corpus of preposition errors is extremely costly.
			For example, if we assume that500 prepositions can be annotated in 4 hours us ing our annotation scheme, and that the base rate for preposition errors is 10%, then it would take atleast 80 hours for a rater to find and mark 1000 er rors.
			In this section, we propose a more efficient annotation approach to circumvent this problem.
