and bowner (ball owner).
			The predicateargument knowledge, K , specifies, for each predicate, the semantic constraints on its arguments.
			Con straints are specified in terms of the concepts that can fill each argument, such as player(team, unum) and bowner(player).
			A special semantic label nullis used for nodes that do not correspond to any con cept in the domain.Figure 2 shows the basic algorithm for build ing an MR from an SAPT.

			construction of the MR for the SAPT in Figure 1.Nodes are numbered in the order in which the con struction of their MR?s are completed.
			The first step, GETSEMANTICHEAD , determines which of anode?s children is its semantic head based on hav ing a matching semantic label.
			In the example, node N3 is determined to be the semantic head of the sentence, si
