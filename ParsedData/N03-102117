um rank of its production rules.
    MTG(R) is the class of MTGs of rank R. Each row of P and M corresponds to a different component of multitext.
    Each permutation is written as a row in P, and each link is written as a column in M, as in Equation 3 below.
    If Xd is empty, then the dth component of every link in M must be empty too.
    If Xd is not empty, then at least one of the links in M must have a non-empty dth component.
    The position of a non-empty terminal or nonterminal relative to other non-empty elements of its component is its role.
    If there are m non-empty nonterminals in component (row) d of M then Pd is a permutation of roles from 1 to Tn.
    Pd is empty if and only if Xd is empty.
    The D-MTG derivation process begins with the start link $, which is a vector of D copies of the special start symbol $ E N. The derivation continues with nondeterministic application of production rules.
    The semantics of = are the usual semantics of rewriting systems, i.e., that the expression
