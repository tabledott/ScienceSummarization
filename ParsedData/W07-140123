, it incites to overcome certain current limitations, and to set realistic and, at the same time, stimulating goals for the future.
    First at all, theoretical refinements both of the task and the models applied to it need to be developed.
    In particular, more efforts are required to improve knowledge acquisition, as little progress has been made on this front so far.
    Also the data set generation and the evaluation methodology need to be refined and extended.
    A major problem in the current setting of the data collection is that the distribution of the examples is arbitrary to a large extent, being determined by manual selection.
    Therefore new evaluation methodologies, which can reflect realistic distributions should be investigated, as well as the possibility of evaluating Textual Entailment Recognition within additional concrete application scenarios, following the spirit of the QA Answer Validation Exercise.
