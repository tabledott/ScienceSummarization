r is constant for the given category sequence, but not for different category sequences.
    However, the dependency structures with high enough PCS to be among the highest probability structures are likely to have similar category sequences.
    Thus we ignore the normalisation factor, thereby simplifying the parsing process.
    (A similar argument is used by Collins (1996) in the context of his parsing model.)
    The estimate in equation 10 suffers from sparse data problems, and so a backing-off strategy is employed.
    We omit details here, but there are four levels of back-off: the first uses both words and both categories; the second uses only one of the words and both categories; the third uses the categories only; and a final level substitutes pos-tags for the categories.
    One final point is that, in practice, the number of dependencies can vary for a given category sequence (because multiple arguments for the same slot can 5One of the problems with the model is that it is deficient, assigning pr
