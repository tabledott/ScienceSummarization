equently process, knowledge about who speaks to whom.
    We hypothesize that pragmatic features that center around previous agreement between speakers in the dialog will influence the determination of agreement/disagreement.
    For example, if a speaker disagrees with another person once in the conversation, is he more likely to disagree with him again?
    We model context using Bayesian networks that allows capturing of these pragmatic dependencies.
    Our accuracy for classifying agreements and disagreements is 86.9%, which is a 4.9% improvement over (Hillard et al., 2003).
    In the following sections, we begin by describing the annotated corpus that we used for our experiments.
    We then turn to our work on identifying adjacency pairs.
    In the section on identification of agreement/disagreement, we describe the contextual features that we model and the implementation of the classifier.
    We close with a discussion of future work.
