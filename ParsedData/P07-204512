    Moses was the subject of this year&#8217;s Johns Hopkins University Workshop on Machine Translation (Koehn et al. 2006).
    The decoder is the core component of Moses.
    To minimize the learning curve for many researchers, the decoder was developed as a drop-in replacement for Pharaoh, the popular phrase-based decoder.
    In order for the toolkit to be adopted by the community, and to make it easy for others to contribute to the project, we kept to the following principles when developing the decoder: It was developed in C++ for efficiency and followed modular, object-oriented design.
  
  
    Non-factored SMT typically deals only with the surface form of words and has one phrase table, as shown in Figure 1.
    In factored translation models, the surface forms may be augmented with different factors, such as POS tags or lemma.
    This creates a factored representation of each word, Figure 2.
    Mapping of source phrases to target phrases may be decomposed into se
