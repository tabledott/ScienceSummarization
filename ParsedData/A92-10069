lier one.
    As is argued by McDonald et al., such an architecture contributes to processing efficiency.
    We will now discuss the three modules of Joyce in more detail.
  
  
    Prior to the design of the text planning component of Joyce, several existing approaches were studied.
    Since the structure of the descriptive text (Figure 2) does not mirror the structure of the domain, Paris's &amp;quot;procedural strategy&amp;quot; (Paris and McKeown 1987) cannot be used in general.
    Hovy's RST-based planner (Hovy 1988) assumes that content selection has already been performed, contrary to the situation in the Ulysses application; furthermore, there are efficiency problems in a pure STRIPS-like planning paradigm.
    We therefore found McKeown's schema-based approach (McKeown 1985) to be the most promising.
    However, it turned out that general rhetorical schemas cannot adequately capture the structure of the intended texts.
    In (Kittredge et al 1991), we argue that planning certain types of texts -
