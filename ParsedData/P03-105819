raining examples in the parallel corpora for some of the senses of some nouns.
    For instance, no occurrences of sense 5 of the noun circuit (racing circuit, a racetrack for automobile races) could be found in the parallel corpora.
    To ensure a fairer comparison, for each of the 10-trial manually sense-tagged training data that gave rise to the accuracy figure M2 of a noun w, we extracted a new subset of 10-trial (manually sense-tagged) training data by ensuring adherence to the number of training examples found for each sense of w in the corresponding parallel text training set that gave rise to the accuracy figure P2 for w. The accuracy figures thus obtained for the difficult nouns are listed in the column labeled M3 in Table 3.
    M3 thus gave the accuracy of training on manually sense-tagged data but restricted to the number of training examples found in each sense from parallel corpora.
    9.8 training examples and 6.2 test examples contain this collocation.
    This alone would have accounted for
