ed, a hole in one structure (the semantic head) is filled with the hook of the other (by equating the variables) and their lzts are appended.
    It should be intuitively obvious that there is a straightforward relationship between this algebra and the shown in Figure 1, although there are other architectures which would share the same encoding.
    We now give a formal description of the algebra.
    In this section, we simplify by assuming that each entity has only one hole, which is unlabelled, and only consider two sorts of variables: events and individuals.
    The set of semantic entities is built from the following vocabulary : The following shows the equivalents of the structures in Figure 1 in our algebra: ify compositional principles and does not formalize composition.
    We attempt to rectify these problems, by developing an algebra which gives a general way of expressing composition.
    The semantic algebra lets us specify the allowable operations in a less cumbersome notation than e.g., big big
