es become uniform), rater disagreement increases.
    This result is intuitive: if the occurrences of a particular word cannot be easily separated into coherent clusters (perhaps indicating high polysemy instead of homonymy), then human judgement will be naturally more difficult.
    Rater variance depends more directly on the actual word similarity: word pairs at the extreme ranges of similarity have significantly lower variance as raters are more certain.
    By removing word pairs with similarity judgements in the middle two quartile ranges (4.4 to 7.5) we find significantly higher variance correlation (Figure 4 right).
    This result indicates that multi-prototype similarity variance accounts for a secondary effect separate from the primary effect that variance is naturally lower for ratings in extreme ranges.
    Although the entropy of the prototypes correlates with the variance of the human ratings, we find that the individual senses captured by each prototype do not correspond to human intuition for
