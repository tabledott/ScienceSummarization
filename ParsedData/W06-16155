o MEDLINE.
    We discuss related work on domain adaptation in section 8 and conclude in section 9.
  
  
    Figure 1 shows two PoS-tagged sentences, one each from the Wall Street Journal (hereafter WSJ) and MEDLINE.
    We chose these sentences for two reasons.
    First, we wish to visually emphasize the difference between the two domains.
    The vocabularies differ significantly, and PoS taggers suffer accordingly.
    Second, we want to focus on the phrase &#8220;with normal signal transduction&#8221; from the MEDLINE sentence, depicted in Figure 2(a).
    The word &#8220;signal&#8221; in this sentence is a noun, but a tagger trained on the WSJ incorrectly classifies it as an adjective.
    We introduce the notion ofpivot features.
    Pivot features are features which occur frequently in the two domains and behave similarly in both.
    Figure 2(b) shows some pivot features that occur together with the word &#8220;signal&#8221; in our biomedical unlabeled data.
    In this case our pivot features are a
