verbs were used for subject/object extraction.
    For verbs whose total frequency was greater than 150, but whose VBD frequency was in the range 100-200, we extracted subjects and objects of the VBD occurrences only.
    For higher frequency verbs, we used only the first 100 VBD occurrences.'
    The same script for computing the overlap of the extracted subjects and objects was then used on the resulting subject/verb and verb/object tuples for both group 1 and group 2 verbs.
    The animacy feature was calculated over subject/verb tuples extracted automatically for both groups of verbs from the parsed corpus.
    The data collection described above yields the following data points in total: TRANS: 27403; PASS: 20481; VBN: 36297; CAUS: 11307; ANIM: 7542.
    (Different features yield different totals because they were sampled independently, and the search patterns to extract some features are more imprecise than others.)
    The aggregate means by class of the normalized frequencies for all verbs are shown i
