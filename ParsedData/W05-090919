r language dataset* We computed translation by translation correlations between human assessments and other metrics besides the METEOR score, namely precision, recall and Fmean* Tables 4 and 5 show the correlations for the various scores* We observe that recall by itself correlates with human assessment much better than precision, and that combining the two using the Fmean formula the exact matching improves correlations* Some further improvement in correlation is produced by adding the synonymy mo dule* described above results in further improvement* By penalizing the Fmean score using the chunk count we get some further marginal improvement in correlation* To observe the effect of various unigram mapping modules on the correlation between the METEOR score and human assessments, we ran METEOR with different sequences of stages with different mapping modules in them* In the first experiment we ran METEOR with only one stage that used the &amp;quot;exact&amp;quot; mapping mo dule* This module matches unigrams
