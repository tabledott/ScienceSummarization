on (far below 50%), and very large errors in the number of clusters.
    Our system has fairly good pairwise precisions and small mean error in the number of clusters, which verifies that our results are sound.
    Many of our system&#8217;s remaining errors involve nominals.
    Additional features should be considered to distinguish mentions that have the same head but are different entities.
    For pronouns, many remaining errors can be corrected using linguistic knowledge like binding theory and salience hierarchy.
    Our heuristics for identifying appositives and predicate nominals also make many errors, which often can be fixed with additional name entity recognition capabilities (e.g., given &#8220;Mike Sullivan, VOA News&#8221;, it helps to know that the former is a person and the latter an organization).
    The most challenging case involves phrases with different heads that are both proper nouns (e.g., &#8220;Mr.
    Bush&#8221; and &#8220;the White House&#8221;).
    Handling these cases require
