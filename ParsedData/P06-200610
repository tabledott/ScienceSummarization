herence constraints are not used to filter the phrase structure derivation space.
    The grammar finds at least one parse rooted in the start category for 85% of the Susanne treebank, a 140K word balanced subset of the Brown Corpus, which we have used for development (Sampson, 1995).
    Much of the remaining data consists of phrasal fragments marked as independent text sentences, for example in dialogue.
    Grammatical coverage includes the majority of construction types of English, however the handling of some unbounded dependency constructions, particularly comparatives and equatives, is limited because of the lack of fine-grained subcategorization information in the PoS tags and by the need to balance depth of analysis against the size of the derivation space.
    On the Susanne corpus, the geometric mean of the number of analyses for a sentence of length n is 1.31'.
    The microaveraged F1-score for GR extraction on held-out data from Susanne is 76.5% (see section 4.2 for details of the evaluation sch
