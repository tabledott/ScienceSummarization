table showed the result&#8217; from &#8216;table show result&#8217;.
    The evaluators were then asked to rate the semantic similarity of each verb pair within the context of those sentences, and offer a score between 1 and 7 for each entry.
    Each entry was given an arbitrary classification of HIGH or LOW by the authors, for the purpose of calculating mean high/low scores for each model.
    For example, the first two pairs in table 4 were classified as HIGH, whereas the second two pairs as LOW.
    Evaluation Methodology The evaluation methodology for the second experiment was identical to that of the first, as are the scales for means and scores.
    Here also, Spearman&#8217;s &#961; is deemed a more rigorous way of determining how well a model tracks difference in meaning.
    This is both because of the imprecise nature of the classification of verb pairs as HIGH or LOW; and since the objective similarity scores produced by a model that distinguishes sentences of different meaning from those of simil
