notated corpus of semantic verb-argument relations.
			Specifically, we use the data provided in the CoNLL-2004 shared task of semantic-role labeling (Carreras and Ma`rquez, 2003) which consists of a portion of thePropBank corpus, allowing us to compare the per formance of our approach with other systems.
			Previous approaches to the SRL task have madeuse of a full syntactic parse of the sentence in or der to define argument boundaries and to determine the role labels (Gildea and Palmer, 2002; Chen and Rambow, 2003; Gildea and Hockenmaier, 2003;Pradhan et al, 2003; Pradhan et al, 2004; Sur deanu et al, 2003).
			In this work, following the CoNLL-2004 shared task definition, we assume thatthe SRL system takes as input only partial syn tactic information, and no external lexico-semantic knowledge bases.
			Specifically, we assume as input resources a part-of-speech tagger, a shallow parser that can process the input to the level of basedchunks and clauses (Tjong Kim Sang and Buch holz, 2000; Tjong Kim Sang and
