  A Statistical Approach To Anaphora Resolution
  
    This paper presents an algorithm for identifying pronominal anaphora and two experiments based upon this algorithm.
    We incorporate multiple anaphora resolution factors into a statistical framework &#8212; specifically the distance between the pronoun and the proposed antecedent, gender/number/animaticity of the proposed antecedent, governing head information and noun phrase repetition.
    We combine into a single probability that enables to identify the referent.
    Our first experiment shows the relative contribution of each source of information and demonstrates a success rate 82.9% for all sources combined. experiment investigates a method for unsupervised learning of gender/number/animaticity information.
    We present some experiments illustrating the accuracy of the method and note that with this information added, our pronoun resolution method achieves 84.2% accuracy.
