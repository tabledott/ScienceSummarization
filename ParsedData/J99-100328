ttern of candidate points of correspondence in a bitext space, after noise filtering.
    The true points of correspondence trace the true bitext map parallel to the main diagonal. distance of the chain's points from the chain's least-squares line.
    If this distance exceeds the maximum point dispersal threshold, the chain is rejected.
    The angle of each chain's least-squares line is compared to the arctangent of the bitext slope.
    If the difference exceeds the maximum angle deviation threshold, the chain is rejected.
    In a search rectangle containing n points, there are 211 possible chains&#8212;too many to search by brute force.
    The properties of TPCs listed above provide two ways to constrain the search.
    The Linearity property leads to a constraint on the chain size.
    Chains of only a few points are unreliable, because they often line up straight by coincidence.
    Chains that are too big will span too long a segment of the TBM to be well approximated by a line.
