e bimodality of this ratio for several values of n(u,v) is illustrated in Figure 3.
    This figure was plotted after the model's first iteration over 300000 aligned sentence pairs from the Canadian Hansard bitext.
    Note that the frequencies are plotted on a log scale &#8212; the bimodality is quite sharp.
    The linking algorithm creates all the links of a given type independently of each other, so the number k(&#8222;,&#8222;) of links connecting word types u and v has a binomial distribution with parameters n(&#8222;,v) and p(&#8222;,v).
    If u and v are mutual translations, then P(u,v) tends to a relatively high probability, which we will call A+.
    If u and v are not mutual translations, then p(u,&#8222;) tends to a very low probability, which we will call A. A+ and A- correspond to the two peaks in the frequency distribution of k(&#8222;,,)/n(u,v) in Figure 2.
    The two parameters can also be interpreted as the percentage of true and false positives.
    If the translation in the bitext is con
