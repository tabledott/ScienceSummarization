    5.3 Performance Comparisons We compare the performance of our system to three other methods.
    First, we use standard TF*IDF, a method that with various alterations, remains at the core of many information retrieval and text matching systems [Salton and Buckley 1988; Salton 1989].
    We compute the total frequency (TF) of words in each text unit.
    We also compute the number of units each word appears in in our training set (DF, or document frequency).
    Then each text unit is represented as a vector of TF*IDF scores calculated as Similarity between text units is measured by the cosine of the angle between the corresponding two vectors (i.e., the normalized inner product of the two vectors).
    A further cutoff point is selected to convert similarities to hard decisions of &amp;quot;similar&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;not similar&amp;quot;; different cutoffs result in different tradeoffs between recall and precision.
    Second, we compare our method aga
