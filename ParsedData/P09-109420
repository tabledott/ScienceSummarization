ion results show that 93% and 97.8% of the test sentences can be paraphrased by Baseline-1 and Baseline-2.
    The average number of unit replacements per sentence is 4.23 and 5.95, respectively.
    This result suggests that Baseline-1 is less capable than Baseline-2, which is mainly because its paraphrase resource is limited.
    The generated paraphrases are also labeled by our two raters and the labeling results can be found in the lower part of Table 1.
    As can be seen, Baseline-1 performs poorly compared with our method and Baseline-2, as the percentage of label &#8220;1&#8221; is the highest for both adequacy and fluency.
    This result demonstrates that it is necessary to combine multiple paraphrase resources to improve the paraphrase generation performance.
    Table 1 also shows that Baseline-2 performs comparably with our method except that it does not consider paraphrase applications.
    However, we are interested how many paraphrases generated by Baseline-2 can achieve the given applications
