    Meanwhile, the [participial-phrase] passes along the original FLOATOBJECT (&amp;quot;which hospital&amp;quot;) to its right sibling, the adverbial prepositional phrase, &amp;quot;to [object].&amp;quot; The phrase &amp;quot;which hospital&amp;quot; is finally absorbed by the preposition's object.
    The example used to illustrate the power of ATNs (Woods 1986), &amp;quot;John was believed to have been shot,&amp;quot; also parses correctly, because the [object] node following the verb &amp;quot;believed&amp;quot; acts as both an absorber and a (re)generator.
    Cases of crossed traces are automatically blocked because the second CURRENT-FOCUS gets moved into the FLOAT-OBJECT position at the time of the second activator, overriding the preexisting FLOAT-OBJECT set up by the earlier activator.
    The wrong FLOAT-OBJECT is available at the position of the first trace, and the parse dies: *(Which books)i did you ask John (where)1 Bill bought (t,) (tj)?
