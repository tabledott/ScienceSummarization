ite variable, perhaps because location expressions often do not include specific place names.
    3 The low recall is attributable to the fact that the heuristic asigned antecedents only for names and pronouns, and completely ignored definite noun phrases and plural pronous.
    These results indicate that the sample tests are an appropriate and challenging task.
    The simple techniques described above provide a system that finds the correct answer sentence almost 40% of the time.
    This is much better than chance, which would yield an average score of about 4-5% for the sentence metrics, given an average document length of 20 sentences.
    Simple linguistic techniques enhance the baseline system score from the low 30% range to almost 40% in all three metrics.
    However, capturing the remaining 60% will clearly require more sophisticated syntactic, semantic, and world knowledge sources.
  
  
    Our pilot study has shown that reading comprehension is an appropriate task, providing a reasonable startin
