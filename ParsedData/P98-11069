wing three conditions: As an example, consider a grammar containing the three dependency rules di (rule 2), d2 (rule 3), and d3 (rule 4), as well as the LP rule pi (rule 5).
    In addition, we have some lexical mappings (they are obvious from the example), and the start symbol is Vfinite,&#177;.
    A sample derivation is shown in Figure 3, with the sentential form representation on top and the corresponding tree representation below.
    Using this kind of representation, we can derive a bottom-up parser in the following straightforward manner.5 Since syntactic and linear governors coincide, we can derive deterministic finite-state machines which capture both the dependency and the LP rules for a given governor category.
    We will refer to these FSMs as rule-FSMs, and if the governor is of category C, we will refer to a C-rule-FSM.
    In a rule-FSM, the transitions are labeled by categories, and the transition corresponding to the governor labeled by its category and a special mark (such as #).
