fferent MCR versions along with relations extracted from SemCor, which we call supervised and unsupervised relations, respectively.
    The unsupervised relations that yielded bests results are also used in this paper (c.f Section 3.1).
  
  
    Our WSD algorithm can be applied over nonenglish texts, provided that a LKB for this particular language exists.
    We have tested the graphalgorithms proposed in this paper on a Spanish dataset, using the Spanish WordNet as knowledge source (Atserias et al., 2004a).
    We used the Semeval-2007 Task 09 dataset as evaluation gold standard (M`arquez et al., 2007).
    The dataset contains examples of the 150 most frequent nouns in the CESS-ECE corpus, manually annotated with Spanish WordNet synsets.
    It is split into a train and test part, and has an &#8220;all words&#8221; shape i.e. input consists on sentences, each one having at least one occurrence of a target noun.
    We ran the experiment over the test part (792 instances), and used the train part for calcu
