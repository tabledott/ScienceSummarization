    Let be an entity, and be the (many-to-one) map from mention index to entity index .
    For an active mention index , define for some the set of indices of the partially-established entities to the left of (note that ), and the set of the partially-established entities.
    The link model is then the probability linking the active mention with the in-focus entity .
    The random variable takes value from the set and signifies which entity is in focus; takes binary value and is if links with .
    As an example, for the branch from (b2) to (c4) in Figure 1, the active mention is &#8220;3&#8221;, the set of partial entities to the left of &#8220;3&#8221; is , the active entity is the second partial entity &#8220;[2]&#8221;.
    Probability measures how likely mention &#8220;3&#8221; links with the entity &#8220;[2].&#8221; The model only computes how likely links with ; It does not say anything about the possibility that starts a new entity.
