			All parameters were optimized onthe development set.
			Recall, precision, and align ment error rates on the test set are shown in Table 1.
			For comparison, we aligned our parallel corpus with IBM Model 4 using Och?s Giza++ softwarepackage (Och and Ney, 2003).4 We used the de fault configuration file included with the version ofGiza++ that we used, which resulted in five itera tions of Model 1, followed by five iterations of the HMMmodel, followed by five iterations of Model 4.We trained the models in both directions, English to-French and French-to-English, and computed the union, intersection, and what Och and Ney
