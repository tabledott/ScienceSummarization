    In one model, they were first-in-phrase and bore a H* or complex pitch accent&#8212;thus distinguishing them from discourse uses that were first-in-phrase.
    In the other, they were not first-in-phrase and bore any type pitch accent.
    The association between discourse/sentential models and discourse/sentential judgments for this study, as for our previous studies of now and well, is significant at the .001 level.
    However, for the single-speaker, multi-cue phrase data in RJB86, our prosodic models successfully classified only 662 tokens (75.4%), a considerably smaller proportion than for the previous studies.
    We found one major reason for the poorer performance of our models on the multi-cue phrase data.
    A large percentage of the tokens that do not fit our prosodic models were coordinate conjunctions.
    When these are removed from our sample, our prosodic models correctly classify 442 tokens (85.3% of the data).
    It is also worth noting that coordinate conjunctions wer
