rt, and thus do achieve incrementality.
  
  
    We have presented a dynamic programming algorithm for shift-reduce parsing, which runs in linear-time in practice with beam search.
    This framework is general and applicable to a largeclass of shift-reduce parsers, as long as the feature functions satisfy boundedness and monotonicity.
    Empirical results on a state-the-art dependency parser confirm the advantage of DP in many aspects: faster speed, larger search space, higher oracles, and better and faster learning.
    Our final parser outperforms all previously reported dependency parsers trained on the Penn Treebanks for both English and Chinese, and is much faster in speed (even with a Python implementation).
    For future work we plan to extend it to constituency parsing.
