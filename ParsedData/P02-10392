describes an algorithm for such a decoder, and reports experimental results.
    Other statistical machine translation systems such as (Wu, 1997) and (Alshawi et al., 2000) also produce a tree given a sentence.
    Their models are based on mechanisms that generate two languages at the same time, so an English tree is obtained as a subproduct of parsing.
    However, their use of the LM is not mathematically motivated, since their models do not decompose into P and unlike the noisy channel model.
    Section 2 briefly reviews the syntax-based TM, and Section 3 describes phrasal translation as an extension.
    Section 4 presents the basic idea for decoding.
    As in other statistical machine translation systems, the decoder has to cope with a huge search sentence that maximizes P , which also maximizes P according to Bayes&#8217; rule.
    A different decoder is needed for different choices of LM and TM.
    Since P and P space.
    Section 5 describes how to prune the search space for practical decoding.
