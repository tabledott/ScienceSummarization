ally identifying opin ions, emotions, and sentiments in text.
			Much of this research explores sentiment classification, a text categorization task in which the goal is to classifya document as having positive or negative polar ity (e.g., Das and Chen (2001), Pang et al (2002), Turney (2002), Dave et al (2003), Pang and Lee(2004)).
			Other research efforts analyze opinion expressions at the sentence level or below to recog nize opinions, their polarity, and their strength (e.g., Dave et al (2003), Pang and Lee (2004), Wilson et al.
			(2004), Yu and Hatzivassiloglou (2003), Wiebeand Riloff (2005)).
			Many applications could benefit from these opinion analyzers, including prod uct reputation tracking (e.g., Morinaga et al (2002), Yi et al (2003)), opinion-oriented summarization (e.g., Cardie et al (2004)), and question answering (e.g., Bethard et al (2004), Yu and Hatzivassiloglou (2003)).
			We focus here on another aspect of opinion analysis: automatically identifying the sources of the opinions.
