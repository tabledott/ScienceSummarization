, including lexical representation, syntactic generalization, sociolinguistic variation, processing issues, and evaluation.
    This first version drew most heavily from the implementation of the English grammar, with some further insights drawn from the grammar of Japanese.
    Extensions to the matrix will be based on careful study of existing implemented grammars for other languages, notably German, Spanish and Japanese, as well as feedback from those using the first version of the matrix.
    For lexical representation, one of the most urgent needs is to provide a language-independent type hierarchy for the lexicon, at least for major parts of speech, establishing the mechanisms used for linking syntactic subcategorization to semantic predicate-argument structure.
    Lexical rules provide a second mechanism for expressing generalizations within the lexicon, and offer ready opportunities for cross-linguistic abstractions for both inflectional and derivational regularities.
