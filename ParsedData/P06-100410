e sparsity of word counts through stem equivalence classes.
    We also remove words matching a prespecified list of stop words.
    Graph Topology As we noted in the previous section, the normalized cut criterion considers long-term similarity relationships between nodes.
    This effect is achieved by constructing a fullyconnected graph.
    However, considering all pairwise relations in a long text may be detrimental to segmentation accuracy.
    Therefore, we discard edges between sentences exceeding a certain threshold distance.
    This reduction in the graph size also provides us with computational savings.
    Similarity Computation In computing pairwise sentence similarities, sentences are represented as vectors of word counts.
    Cosine similarity is commonly used in text segmentation (Hearst, 1994).
    To avoid numerical precision issues when summing a series of very small scores, we compute exponentiated cosine similarity scores between pairs of sentence vectors: We further refine our analysis b
