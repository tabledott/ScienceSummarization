rt as constructed during the parse of aaa with the grammar in (a).
    The two columns to the right in (b) list the forward and inner probabilities, respectively, for each state.
    In both a and columns, the &#8226; separates old factors from new ones (as per equations 11, 12 and 13).
    Addition indicates multiple derivations of the same state.
    Null productions X &#8212;&gt; E introduce some complications into the relatively straightforward parser operation described so far, some of which are due specifically to the probabilistic aspects of parsing.
    This section summarizes the necessary modifications to process null productions correctly, using the previous description as a baseline.
    Our treatment of null productions follows the (nonprobabilistic) formulation of Graham, Harrison, and Ruzzo (1980), rather than the original one in Earley (1970).
    4.7.1 Computing 1-expansion probabilities.
    The main problem with null productions is that they allow multiple prediction-completion cycles in be
