n the same way.
    For example, prepositional phrase (PP) attachment is (notoriously) ambiguous in English (and related European languages), but is strictly unambiguous in Chinese and largely unambiguous Japanese; see two languages for better disambiguation, which has been applied not only to this PP-attachment problem (Fossum and Knight, 2008; Schwartz et al., 2003), but also to the more fundamental problem of syntactic parsing which subsumes the former as a subproblem.
    For example, Smith and Smith (2004) and Burkett and Klein (2008) show that joint parsing (or reranking) on a bitext improves accuracies on either or both sides by leveraging bilingual constraints, which is very promising for syntax-based machine translation which requires (good-quality) parse trees for rule extraction (Galley et al., 2004; Mi and Huang, 2008).
    However, the search space of joint parsing is inevitably much bigger than the monolingual case, forcing existing approaches to employ complicated modeling and crude approximati
