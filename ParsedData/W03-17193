 useful discussion.
    Thus, while we do not subscribe to the view that any of the extant standards are, in fact, appropriate for any particular application, nevertheless, it seems desirable to have a contest where people are tested against more than one standard.
    A third point is that we decided early on that we would not be lenient in our scoring, so that alternative segmentations as in the case of Mao Zedong, cited above, would not be allowed.
    While it would be fairly straightforward (in many cases) to automatically score both alternatives, we felt we could provide a more objective measure if we went strictly by the particular segmentation standard being tested on, and simply did not get into the business of deciding upon allowable alternatives.
    Comparing segmenters is difficult.
    This is not only because of differences in segmentation standards but also due to differences in the design of systems: Systems based exclusively (or even primarily) on lexical and grammatical analysis will often
