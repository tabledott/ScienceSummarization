 be included in the lexicon.
    Both T and y were tuned on held-out data.
    To construct the final lexicon, the remaining nodes &#8211; those with polarity scores above y &#8211; are extracted and assigned their corresponding polarity.
    Graph propagation algorithms rely on the existence of graphs that encode meaningful relationships between candidate nodes.
    Past studies on building polarity lexicons have used linguistic resources like WordNet to define the graph through synonym and antonym relations (Kim and Hovy, 2004; Esuli and Sabastiani, 2009; Blair-Goldensohn et al., 2008; Rao and Ravichandran, 2009).
    The goal of this study is to examine the size and quality of polarity lexicons when the graph is induced automatically from documents on the web.
    Constructing a graph from web-computed lexical co-occurrence statistics is a difficult challenge in and of itself and the research and implementation hurdles that arise are beyond the scope of this work (Alfonseca et al., 2009; Pantel et al., 200
