he 3 judges.
    Considering Low Majority on judges, the precision value is 42.39%.
    Average Yield was 5.5 templates per verb.
    These figures may be compared (informally, as data is incomparable) with average yield of 10.1 and average precision of 50.3% for the 9 &#8220;pivot&#8221; templates of (Lin and Pantel, 2001).
    The comparison suggests that it is possible to obtain from the (very noisy) web a similar range of precision as was obtained from a clean news corpus.
    It also indicates that there is potential for acquiring additional templates per pivot, which would require further research on broadening efficiently the search for additional web data per pivot.
    Agreement among judges is measured by the Kappa value, which is 0.55 between J#1 and J#2, 0.57 between J#2 and J#3, and 0.63 between J#1 and J#3.
    Such Kappa values correspond to moderate agreement for the first two pairs and substantial agreement for the third one.
    In general, unanimous agreement among all of the three judges h
