heuristically labeled training examples, CRF learning, and our constraints will result in superior performance.
    The error analysis in Section 5.2 also suggests natural directions for future work.
    For instance, since many of REVERB&#8217;s errors are due to incorrect arguments, improved methods for argument extraction are in order.
