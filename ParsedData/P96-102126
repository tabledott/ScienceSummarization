xed; in fact the BTG's minimal grammar size has been an important advantage over more linguistically-motivated ITG-based models.
    We have also implemented a generalized version that accepts arbitrary grammars not restricted to normal form, with two motivations.
    The pragmatic benefit is that structured grammars become easier to write, and more concise.
    The expressiveness benefit is that a wider family of probability distributions can be written.
    As stated earlier, the normal form theorem guarantees that the same set of shapes will be explored by our search algorithm, regardless of whether a binary-branching BTG or an arbitrary BTG is used.
    But it may sometimes be useful to place probabilities on n-ary productions that vary with n in a way that cannot be expressed by composing binary productions; for example one might wish to encourage longer straight productions.
    The generalized version permits such strategies.
    Currently we are evaluating robustness extensions of the algorithm that p
