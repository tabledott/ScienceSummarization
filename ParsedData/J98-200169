ses first-mention and subsequent-mention is K = 0.70 overall (K = 0.77 for the three annotators on the converted annotation), if all definite descriptions to which the system cannot assign a classification are treated as first-mention; the coefficient of agreement is K = 0.78 if we do not count the definite descriptions that the system cannot classify (K = 0.81 for the annotators on just those definite descriptions).
    The version of the system that also attempts to recognize bridging references has a worse performance, which is not surprising given the problems our subjects had in classifying bridging descriptions.
    This version of the system finds a classification for 355 descriptions out of 464, and its agreement with the three annotators is K = 0.63 if the cases that the system cannot classify are not counted (K = 0.70 for the three annotators on three categories with just these definites); K = 0.57 if we count the cases that the system does not classify as discourse-new (for 447 descriptions); and K
