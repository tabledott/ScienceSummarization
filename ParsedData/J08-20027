 restricted case of linear chain Conditional Markov Random Fields (sequence models) (Lafferty, McCallum, and Pereira 2001; Sha and Pereira 2003), or at least models that have strong Markov properties, which allow efficient dynamic programming algorithms (Cohn and Blunsom 2005).
    Instead, we consider a densely connected CRF structure, with no Markov properties, and use approximate inference by re-ranking the n-best solutions of a simpler model with stronger independence assumptions (for which exact inference is possible).
    Such a rich graphical model can represent many dependencies but there are two dangers&#8212;one is that the computational complexity of training the model and searching for the most likely labeling given the tree can be prohibitive, and the other is that if too many dependencies are encoded, the model will over-fit the training data and will not generalize well.
    We propose a model which circumvents these two dangers and achieves significant performance gains over a similar local mo
