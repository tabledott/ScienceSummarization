 Kaplan (Bresnan and Kaplan, 1982) have shown that the parsing problem for LFG is decidable because LFGs are offline parsable.
    This result can be adapted easily to DCGs, showing that the parsing problem for offline-parsable DCGs is decidable.
    Strong stability can now be defined: a parsing algorithm is strongly stable if it always terminates for offline-parsable grammars.
    For example, a direct DCG version of the Earley parsing algorithm is stable but not strongly so.
    In the following complexity arguments, we restrict ourselves to offline-parsable grammars.
    This is a reasonable restriction for two reasons: (i) since general DCGs have Turing machine power, there is no useful notion of computational complexity for the parser on its own; (ii) there are good reasons to believe that linguistically relevant grammars must be offline-parsable (Bresnan and Kaplan, 1982).
    In estimating the added complexity of doing online unification, we start from the fact that the length of any derivation of a t
