ort on manual tagging we decided to combine two existing resources: SEMCOR (Landes, Leacock, and Tengi 1998), and SENSUS (Knight and Luk 1994).
    SEMCOR is a 200,000 word corpus with the content words manually tagged as part of the WordNet project.
    The semantic tagging was carried out by trained lexicographers under disciplined conditions that attempted to keep tagging inconsistencies to a minimum.
    SENSUS is a large-scale ontology designed for machine-translation and was itself produced by merging the ontological hierarchies of WordNet, LDOCE (as derived by Bruce and Guthrie, see Section 4.4), and the Penman Upper Model (Bateman et al., 1990) from ISI.
    To facilitate the merging of these three resources to produce SENSUS, Knight and Luk were required to derive a mapping between the senses in the two lexical resources.
    We used this mapping to translate the WordNet-tagged content words in SEMCOR to LDOCE tags.
    The mapping of senses is not one-to-one, and some WordNet synsets are mapped onto
