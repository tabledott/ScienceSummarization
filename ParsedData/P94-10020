  Multi-Paragraph Segmentation Of Expository Text
  
    This paper describes TextTiling, an algorithm for partitioning expository texts into coherent multi-paragraph discourse units which reflect the subtopic structure of the texts.
    The algorithm uses domain-independent lexical frequency and distribution information to recognize the interactions of multiple simultaneous themes.
    Two fully-implemented versions of the algorithm are described and shown to produce segmentation that corresponds well to human judgments of the major subtopic boundaries of thirteen lengthy texts.
  
  
    The structure of expository texts can be characterized as a sequence of subtopical discussions that occur in the context of a few main topic discussions.
    For example, a popular science text called Stargazers, whose main topic is the existence of life on earth and other planets, can be described as consisting of the following subdiscussions (numbers indicate paragraph numbers): Subtopic structure is sometimes marked in
