o propose a Gibbs sampler but apply it to the polynomial space of derivation trees, rather than the exponential space of the DeNero et al. (2008) model.
    The restrictions imposed by our tree structure make sampling considerably more efficient for long sentences.
    Following the broad shift in the field from finite state transducers to grammar transducers (Chiang, 2007), recent approaches to phrase-based alignment have used synchronous grammar formalisms permitting polynomial time inference (Wu, 1997; Cherry and Lin, 2007; Zhang et al., 2008b; Blunsom et al., 2008).
    However this asymptotic time complexity is of high enough order (O(|f|3|e|3)) that inference is impractical for real translation data.
    Proposed solutions to this problem include imposing sentence length limits, using small training corpora and constraining the search space using a word-alignment model or parse tree.
    None of these limitations are particularly desirable as they bias inference.
    As a result phrase-based alignment m
