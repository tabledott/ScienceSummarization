have been consulted (Aone and McKee 1996; McCarthy 2000).
    We extend these results by showing that thematic information can be induced from linguistically-guided counts in a corpus, without the use of thematic role tagging or external resources such as WordNet.
    Finally, our results converge with the increasing agreement that corpus-based techniques are fruitful in the automatic construction of computational lexicons, providing machine readable dictionaries with complementary, reusable resources, such as frequencies of argument structures.
    Moreover, these techniques produce data that is easily updated, as the information contained in corpora changes all the time, allowing for adaptability to new domains or usage patterns.
    This dynamic aspect could be exploited if techniques such as the one presented here are developed, which can work on a rough collection of texts, and do not require a carefully balanced corpus or timeconsuming semantic tagging.
  
  
    We conclude from the discussion above th
