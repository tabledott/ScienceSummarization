grammars, and tractability for practical applications are desirable properties.
    Various tasks such as segmentation, word alignment, and bracket annotation are naturally incorporated as subproblems, and a high degree of compatibility with conventional monolingual methods is retained.
    In conjunction with automatic procedures for learning word translation lexicons, SITGs bring relatively underexploited bilingual Wu Bilingual Parsing correlations to bear on the task of extracting linguistic information for languages less studied than English.
    We are currently pursuing several directions.
    We are developing an iterative training method based on expectation-maximization for estimating the probabilities from parallel training corpora.
    Also, in contrast to the applications discussed here, which deal with analysis and annotation of parallel corpora, we are working on incorporating the SITG model directly into our run-time translation architecture.
    The initial results indicate excellent performan
