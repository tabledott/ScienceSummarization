s characters, C-1 and C1, are identical.
			Most features appeared in the first-order tem plates with a few of character identity features in the both zero-order and first-order templates.
			We also did normalization of punctuations due to the fact that Mandarin has a huge variety of punctuations.
			Table 1 shows the number of data features and lambda weights in each corpus.

			3.2.1 Results on Sighan bakeoff 2003 Experiments done while developing this system showed that its performance was signifi cantly better than that of Peng et al (2004).
			As seen in Table 2, our system?s F-score was 0.863 on CTB (Chinese Treebank from Univer 169 sity of Pennsylvania) versus 0.849 F on Peng et al.
			(2004).
			We do not at present have a good understanding of which aspects of our system give it superior performance.
