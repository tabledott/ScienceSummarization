  Global Thresholding And Multiple-Pass Parsing
  
    We present a variation on classic beam thresholding techniques that is up to an order of magnitude faster than the traditional method, at the same performance level.
    We also present a new thresholding technique, global thresholding, which, combined with the new beam thresholding, gives an additional factor of two improvement, and a novel technique, multiple pass parsing, that can be combined with the others to yield yet another 50% improvement.
    We use a new search algorithm to simultaneously optimize the thresholding parameters of the various algorithms.
  
  
    In this paper, we examine thresholding techniques for statistical parsers.
    While there exist theoretically efficient (0(n3)) algorithms for parsing Probabilistic Context-Free Grammars (PCFGs) and related formalisms, practical parsing algorithms usually make use of pruning techniques, such as beam thresholding, for increased speed.
    We introduce two novel thresholding techniques,
