    For example, the representation above for book refers to several word senses, all of which are logically related by the semantic template for an artifactual object.
    That is, it contains information, it has a material extension, it serves some function, and it is created by some particular act or event.
    In the qualia structures given below, we adopt the convention that [a, 0] denotes conjunction of formulas within the feature structure, while [a; 0] will denote disjunction.
    Such an analysis allows us to minimally structure objects according to these four qualia.
    As an example of how objects cluster according to these dimensions, we will briefly consider three object types: (1) containers (of information), e.g., book, tape, record; (2) instruments, e.g., gun, hammer, paintbrush; and (3) figure-ground objects, e.g., door, room, fireplace.
    Because of how their qualia structures differ, these classes appear in vastly different grammatical contexts.
    As with containers in g
