upertree at that node.13 Features may get their values from three different sources: &#8226; The derivation process: from unification with features from trees that adjoin or substitute.
    Elementary trees are combined by substitution and adjunction operations.
    Substitution inserts elementary trees at the substitution nodes of other elementary trees.
    Figure 7(a) shows two elementary trees and the tree resulting from the substitution of one tree into the other.
    In this operation, a node marked for substitution in an elementary tree is replaced by another elementary tree whose root label matches the label of the node.
    The top FS of the resulting node is the result of unification of the top features of the two original nodes, while the bottom FS of the resulting node is simply the bottom features of the root node of the substituting tree.
    In an adjunction operation, an auxiliary tree is inserted into an elementary tree.
    Figure 7(b) shows an auxiliary tree adjoining into an elementary tre
