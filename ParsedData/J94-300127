nguages Li and L2, L1L2 is the regular language containing all strings xi x2 such that xi E Li and x2 E L2.
    We use superscripts for repeated concatenation: Ln contains the concatenation of n members of L, and L* contains strings with arbitrary repetitions of strings in L, including zero.
    The operator Opt is used for optionality, so that Opt(L) is L U {&#8364;}.
    We write L for the complement of L, the regular language containing all strings not in L, namely, E* &#8212; L. Finally, Rev(L) denotes the regular language consisting of the reversal of all the strings in L. There are a number of basic connections between regular relations and regular languages.
    The strings that can occur in the domain and range of a regular relation R (Dom(R) = R/E* and Range(R) = E*/R) are the regular languages accepted by the finite-state machines derived from T(R) by changing all transition labels a:b to a and b respectively, for all a and b in E. Given a regular language L, the identity relation /d(L) that carries
