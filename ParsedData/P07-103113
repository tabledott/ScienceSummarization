    Over half of the disagreements that occur (in either measure) are caused by how company names are bracketed.
    While we have always separated the company name from post-modifiers such as Corp and Inc, DepBank does not in most cases.
    These results show that consistently and correctly bracketing noun phrase structure is possible, and that interannotator agreement is at an acceptable level.
    Looking at the entire Penn Treebank corpus, the annotation tool finds 60959 ambiguous NPs out of the 432639 NPs in the corpus (14.09%).
    22851 of these (37.49%) had brackets inserted by the annotator.
    This is as we expect, as the majority of NPs are right-branching.
    Of the brackets added, 22368 were NML nodes, while 863 were JJP.
    To compare, we can count the number of existing NP and ADJP nodes found in the NPs that the bracketing tool presents.
    We find there are 32772 NP children, and 579 ADJP, which are quite similar numbers to the amount of nodes we have added.
    From this, we can s
