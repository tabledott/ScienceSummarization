 the model performed a selection, i.e., those cases for which the bound Bc, passed the threshold.
    The precision denotes the proportion of cases for which the model performed a correct selection out of all the applicable cases.
    We compare the precision of our method, which we term TWS (for Target Word Selection), with that of the Word Frequencies procedure, which always selects the most frequent target word.
    In other words, the Word Frequencies method prefers the alternative that has the highest a priori probability of appearing in the target language corpus.
    This naive &amp;quot;straw-man&amp;quot; is less sophisticated than other methods suggested in the literature, but it is useful as a common benchmark since it can be easily implemented.
    The success rate of the Word Frequencies procedure can serve as a measure for the degree of lexical ambiguity in a given set of examples, and thus different methods can be partly compared by their degree of success relative to this procedure.
