 database of pre-existing proper names, is in the 90's while the processing rate is over 40Mg of text per hour on a RISC/6000 machine.
    (See (Ravin and Wacholder 1996) for details.)
    This efficient processing has been achieved at the cost of limiting the extent to which the program can 'understand' the text being analyzed and resolve potential ambiguity.
    Many wordsequences that are easily recognized by human readers as names are ambiguous for Nominator, given the restricted set of tools available to it.
    In cases where Nominator cannot resolve an ambiguity with relatively high confidence, we follow the principle that 'noisy information' is to be preferred to data omitted, so that no information is lost.
    In ambiguous cases, the module is designed to make conservative decisions, such as including non-names or non-name parts in otherwise valid name sequences.
    It assigns weak types such as ?HUMAN or fails to assign a type if the available information is not sufficient.
