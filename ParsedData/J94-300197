ernative choices among the rules in a block can be modeled as the union of the regular relations they denote individually, and regular relations are closed under this operation.
    Thus this kind of grammar also reduces to a finite composition of regular relations.
    In a more intricate arrangement, the grammar might specify a block of alternatives made up of rules that are not adjacent in the ordering sequence.
    For example, suppose the grammar consists of the sequence (R1, R2, R3, R4, R3), where R2 and R4 constitute a block of exclusive alternatives.
    This cannot be handled by simple union of the block rules, because that would not incorporate the effect of the intervening rule R3.
    However, this grammar can be interpreted as abbreviating a choice between two different sequences, (R1, R2, R3, R5) and (R1, R3, R4, R5), and thus denotes the regular relation Ri 0 KR2 0 R3) U (R3 0R4)] 0 R5 The union and composition operators can be interleaved in different ways to show that a wide variety of rule c
