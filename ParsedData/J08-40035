mbiguation is required, this approach can be coupled with a statistical model for parse selection that ranks competing analyses with respect to plausibility.
    Although it is often necessary, for efficiency reasons, to prune the search space prior to the ranking of complete analyses, this type of parser always has to handle multiple analyses.
    By contrast, parsers for formal languages are usually based on deterministic parsing techniques, which are maximally efficient in that they only derive one analysis.
    This is possible because the formal language can be defined by a non-ambiguous formal grammar that assigns a single canonical derivation to each string in the language, a property that cannot be maintained for any realistically sized natural language grammar.
    Consequently, these deterministic parsing techniques have been much less popular for natural language parsing, except as a way of modeling human sentence processing, which appears to be at least partly deterministic in nature (Marcus 1980;
