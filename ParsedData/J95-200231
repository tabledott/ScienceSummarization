p;quot; can give rise to cyclic completions. where q = 1 - p. Presented with the input a (the only string the grammar generates), after one cycle of prediction, the Earley chart contains the following states.
    The 1)-1 factors are a result of the left-corner sum 1 &#177; q q2 + &#8226; &#8226; &#8226; = (1 - q) 1.
    After scanning 0S -&gt; .a, completion without truncation would enter an infinite loop.
    First oT .S is completed, yielding a complete state oT -4 S., which allows 0S -&gt; .T to be completed, leading to another complete state for S. etc.
    The nonprobabilistic Earley parser can just stop here, but as in prediction, this would lead to truncated probabilities.
    The sum of probabilities that needs to be computed to arrive at the correct result contains infinitely many terms, one for each possible loop through the T S production.
    Each such loop adds a factor of q to the forward and inner probabilities.
    The summations for all completed states turn out as The approach taken here to
