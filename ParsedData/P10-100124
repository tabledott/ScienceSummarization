iblings, so that the score of a dependency parse is given by: Above, y is simultaneously decomposed into several different types of parts; trivial modifications to the Model 1 parser allow it to evaluate all of the necessary parts in an interleaved fashion.
    A similar treatment of Model 2 yields five feature mappings: the four above plus ftsib(x, h, m, s, t), which represents tri-sibling parts.
    The lower-order feature mappings fdep, fsib, and fgch are based on feature sets from previous work (McDonald et al., 2005a; McDonald and Pereira, 2006; Carreras, 2007), to which we added lexicalized versions of several features.
    For example, fdep contains lexicalized &#8220;in-between&#8221; features that depend on the head and modifier words as well as a word lying in between the two; in contrast, previous work has generally defined in-between features for POS tags only.
    As another example, our second-order mappings fsib and fgch define lexical trigram features, while previous work has generally used PO
