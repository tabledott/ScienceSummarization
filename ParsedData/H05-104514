unding each answer and proposes a lexico syntactic pattern to extract that answer from the text.The heuristics are not perfect, however, so the result ing set of patterns needs to be manually reviewed by a person.
			In order to build a fully automatic system that does not depend on manual review, we combinedAutoSlog?s heuristics with statistics from the an notated training data to create a fully automatic supervised learner.
			We will refer to this learner as AutoSlog-SE (Statistically Enhanced variation of AutoSlog).
			AutoSlog-SE?s learning process has three steps: Step 1: AutoSlog?s heuristics are applied to every noun phrase (NP) in the training corpus.
			Thisgenerates a set of extraction patterns that, col lectively, can extract every NP in the training corpus.
			Step 2: The learned patterns are augmented withselectional restrictions that semantically constrain the types of noun phrases that are legiti mate extractions for opinion sources.
			We used 358the semantic classes shown in Figure 1 as se l
