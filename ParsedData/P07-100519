ction 3.1 into Hiero and reran the experiment.
    The weights obtained by MERT are shown in the row Hiero+WSD of Table 2.
    We note that a negative weight is learnt for Ptywsd.
    This means that in general, the model prefers grammar rules having chunks that matches WSD translations.
    This matches our intuition.
    Using the weights obtained, we translated the test sentences and obtained a BLEU score of 30.30, as shown in the row Hiero+WSD of Table 1.
    The improvement of 0.57 is statistically significant at p &lt; 0.05 using the sign-test as described by Collins et al. (2005), with 374 (+1), 318 (&#8722;1) and 227 (0).
    Using the bootstrap-sampling test described in (Koehn, 2004b), the improvement is statistically significant atp &lt; 0.05.
    Though the improvement is modest, it is statistically significant and this positive result is important in view of the negative findings in (Carpuat and Wu, 2005) that WSD does not help MT.
    Furthermore, note that Hiero+WSD has higher n-gram precisions
