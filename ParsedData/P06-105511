st estimate of the grammar probabilities, leading to overfitting.
    Therefore, it would be to our advantage to split the latent annotations only where needed, rather than splitting them all as in Matsuzaki et al. (2005).
    In addition, if all symbols are split equally often, one quickly (4 split cycles) reaches the limits of what is computationally feasible in terms of training time and memory usage.
    Consider the comma POS tag.
    We would like to see only one sort of this tag because, despite its frequency, it always produces the terminal comma (barring a few annotation errors in the treebank).
    On the other hand, we would expect to find an advantage in distinguishing between various verbal categories and NP types.
    Additionally, splitting symbols like the comma is not only unnecessary, but potentially harmful, since it needlessly fragments observations of other symbols&#8217; behavior.
    It should be noted that simple frequency statistics are not sufficient for determining how often to spli
