greement was measured by the average of preci sion and recall.
			The numbers for TempEval are even lower, with an agreement of 0.72 for anchorings of events to times (tasks A and B) and an agreement of0.65 for event orderings (task C).
			Obviously, num bers like this temper the expectations for automatic temporal linking.
			The lower number for TempEval came a bit asa surprise because, after all, there were fewer relations to choose form.
			However, the TempEval an notation task is different in the sense that it did not give the annotator the option to ignore certain pairs of events and made it therefore impossible to skip hard-to-classify temporal relations.
	
	
			In full temporal annotation, evaluation of temporal annotation runs into the same issues as evaluation of anaphora chains: simple pairwise comparisons maynot be the best way to evaluate.
			In temporal annota tion, for example, one may wonder how the response in (1) should be evaluated given the key in (2).
