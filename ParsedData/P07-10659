sented to it.
    The error rate Err is, This implies that, unlike a conventional lossless data structure, the model&#8217;s accuracy depends on other components in system and how it is queried.
    We take advantage of the monotonicity of the ngram event space to place upper bounds on the frequency of an n-gram prior to testing for it in the filter and potentially truncate the outer loop in Algorithm 2 when we know that the test could only return postive in error.
    Specifically, if we have stored lower-order ngrams in the filter, we can infer that an n-gram cannot present, if any of its sub-sequences test negative.
    Since our scheme for storing frequencies can never underestimate an item&#8217;s frequency, this relation will generalise to frequencies: an n-gram&#8217;s frequency cannot be greater than the frequency of its least frequent sub-sequence as reported by the filter, We use this to reduce the effective error rate of BFLMs that we use in the experiments below.
    A standard BF can implement a
