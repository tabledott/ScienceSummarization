, Sent-H).
    A subgoal for the generation of a node node(np/NP, Sent-P) will result.
    To this subgoal, the second rule will apply, leading to a subgoal for generation of the node node(det(N)/NP, Sent-P1), which itself, by virtue of the third rule, leads to another instance of the NP node generation subgoal.
    Of course, the loop may now be repeated an arbitrary number of times.
    Graphing the tree being constructed by the traversal of this algorithm, as in Figure 1, immediately exhibits the potential for nontermination in the control structure.
    (The repeated goals along the left branch are presented in boldface in the figure.
    Dashed lines indicate portions of the tree yet to be generated.)
    This is an instance of the general problem familiar from logic programming that a logic program may not terminate when called with a goal less instantiated than what was intended by the program's designer.
    Several researchers have noted that a different ordering of the branches in the top-down trave
