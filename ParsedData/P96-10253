0,000 sentences of the Penn Treebank (Marcus et al. 93).
    Given S and B, the reduced sentence S' is defined as the subsequence of S which is formed by removing punctuation and reducing all baseNPs to their head-word alone.
    (heads of baseNPs are marked in bold).
    Arrows show modifier head dependencies.
    Section 2.1 describes how arrows are labeled with non-terminal triples from the parse-tree.
    Non-head words within baseNPs are excluded from the dependency structure; (d) B, the set of baseNPs, and D, the set of dependencies, are extracted from (c).
    Thus the reduced sentence is an array of word/tag Sections 2.1 to 2.4 describe the dependency model.
    Section 2.5 then describes the baseNP model, which uses bigram tagging techniques similar to (Ramshaw and Marcus 95; Church 88).
    The dependency model is limited to relationships between words in reduced sentences such as Example 1.
    The mapping from trees to dependency structures is central to the dependency model.
    It is defined in
