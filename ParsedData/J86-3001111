ce of A.
    In the task dialogue of Section 3.2, many actions that are essential to the task (e.g., the apprentice picking up the Allen wrench and applying it correctly to the setscrews) are never even mentioned in the dialogue.
    Note that it is unnecessary for the ICP or OCP to have a complete plan relating all of the ai to A at the start of the discourse (or discourse segment).
    All that is required is that, for any given segment, the OCP be able to determine what intention to act the segment corresponds to and which other intentions dominate that intention.
    Finally, unlike the belief case, the third conjunct here requires only that the OCP recognize that the ICP believes a generates relationship holds.
    The OCP can do A by virtue of doing the ai without coming himself to believe anything about the relationships between A and the ai.
    As in the belief case, there is an equivalence that links the generates relation among actions to the dominance relation between intentions.
