    By examining the dendrogram in Figure 3, it is clear that the clusters start with documents with matching features, and then the other documents cluster around this core.
    In addition to improving disambiguation performance, these extracted features help distinguish the different clusters, and provide information about the different people.
    Another method for using these extracted features is to give higher weight to words which have ever been seen as filling a pattern.
    For example, if 1756 is extracted as a birth year from a syntactic-based pattern for the polysemous name, then whenever 1756 is observed anywhere in context (outside an extraction pattern), it is given a higher weighting and added to the document vector as a potential biographic feature.
    In our experiments, we did this only for words which appeared as values for a feature more than a threshold of 4 times.
    Then, whenever the word was seen in a document, it was given a weight equal to the log of
