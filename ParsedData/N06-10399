 instead of a single article.
    We call this cluster of articles a &#8220;basic cluster.&#8221; Using basic clusters instead of single articles also helps to increase the redundancy of data.
    We can give more confidence to repeated basic patterns.
    Note that the notion of &#8220;basic cluster&#8221; is different from the clusters used for creating tables explained above.
    In the following sections, a cluster for creating a table is called a &#8220;metacluster,&#8221; because this is a cluster of basic clusters.
    A basic cluster consists of a set of articles that report the same event which happens at a certain time, and a metacluster consists of a set of events that contain the same relation over a certain period.
    We try to increase the number of articles in a basic cluster by looking at multiple news sources simultaneously.
    We use a clustering algorithm that uses a vector-space-model to obtain basic clusters.
    Then we apply cross-document coreference resolution to connect entities of
