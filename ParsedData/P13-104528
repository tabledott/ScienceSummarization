 multiple times, Charniak-RS: the state of the art self-trained and discriminatively re-ranked Charniak-Johnson parser combining (Charniak, 2000; McClosky et al., 2006; Charniak and Johnson, 2005).
    See Kummerfeld et al. (2012) for more comparisons.
    We compare also to a standard RNN &#8216;CVG (RNN)&#8217; and to the proposed CVG with SU-RNNs.
    Analysis of Error Types.
    Table 2 shows a detailed comparison of different errors.
    We use the code provided by Kummerfeld et al. (2012) and compare to the previous version of the Stanford factored parser as well as to the Berkeley and Charniak-reranked-self-trained parsers (defined above).
    See Kummerfeld et al. (2012) for details and comparisons to other parsers.
    One of the largest sources of improved performance over the original Stanford factored parser is in the correct placement of PP phrases.
    When measuring only the F1 of parse nodes that include at least one PP child, the CVG improves the Stanford parser by 6.2% to an F1 of 77.54%.
