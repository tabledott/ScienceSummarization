    But the main advantage is that the complexity of the new subgraph isomorphism algorithm is only quadratic in the number of vertices of the input referring graph.
    Note that with this approach we do not lose information from the scene graph, nor do we lose completeness.
    In sum, the basic approach to subgraph isomorphisms is NP-complete, but there exist various reformulations of the problem that can be solved more efficiently.
    Deciding which (combination) of these is the most suitable in practice, however, is beyond the scope of this article.
    Finally, it is worth stressing that the NP-completeness is due to the presence of edges representing relations between different vertices.
    If we restrict the approach to properties (looping edges), testing for subgraph isomorphisms becomes trivial.
  
  
    In this section we give a high-level sketch of the graph-based generation algorithm.
    The algorithm (called makeReferringExpression) consists of two main components, a subgraph construction a
