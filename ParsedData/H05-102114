se alignments of the training bitext where the initial reordering model parameters (?0(x, u)) are set to a uniform value of 0.05.
			The counts Cx,u(s, b) are then obtained over the phrase alignments.
			Finally the ML estimates of the parameters are computed using Eqn 13 (MJ-1) or Eqn 14 (MJ-2).
			We will refer to the Viterbi trained models as MJ-1 VT and MJ-2 VT. Table 3 shows the MJ-1 VT parameters for some example phrase-pairs in the Arabic-English (A-E) task.
