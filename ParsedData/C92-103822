, P is the list of preferred attributes, D is the set of distractom (contrast set members) that have not yet been ruled out, and L is the list of attr ibute-value pairs returned, a make-referring-expression is the top level function.
  This returns a list of attr ibute-value pairs that specify a referring expression for the intended ref- a For simplicity of expo6ition, the algorithm as described here returns failure if it is not pesaible to rule out all the mernbem of the contrast set.
  A more robust algorithm might attempt o pur~m other strategies here, e.g, gen- erating a referring expression of the form one of the Xs, or modifying the contrast set by adding navigation i for- mation (navigation is discussed in the section on Future Work).
  Note that the attributes are tried in the or- der specified in the *preferred-attributes* li t, and that a value for type is always included, even if type has no discriminatory power.
  find-best-value takes an attribute and an initial value; it returns a value for that
