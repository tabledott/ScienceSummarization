    AdaBoost.MH can be applied to the problem using these pseudolabels in place of supervised examples.
    For the experiments in this paper we made a couple of additional modifications to the CoBoost algorithm.
    The algorithm in Fig.
    (2) was extended to have an additional, innermost loop over the (3) possible labels.
    The weak hypothesis chosen was then restricted to be a predictor in favor of this label.
    Thus at each iteration the algorithm is forced to pick features for the location, person and organization in turn for the classifier being trained.
    This modification brings the method closer to the DL-CoTrain algorithm described earlier, and is motivated by the intuition that all three labels should be kept healthily populated in the unlabeled examples, preventing one label from dominating &#8212; this deserves more theoretical investigation.
    We also removed the context-type feature type when using the CoBoost approach.
    This &amp;quot;default&amp;quot; feature type has 100%
