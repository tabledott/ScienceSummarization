ce pairs are extracted from different corpora using existing and the proposed methods.
    We then identify bilingual word pairs that appear in the matched sentence pairs by using a bilingual lexicon (bilexicon).
    The lexical matching score is then defined as the sum of the mutual information score of a known set of word pairs that appear in the corpus: where f(Wc,We) is the co-occurrence frequency of bilexicon pair (Wc,We) in the matched sentence pairs. f(Wc) and f(We) are the occurrence frequencies of Chinese word Wc and English word We, in the bilingual corpus. parallel corpus (Hong Kong Law), a comparable noisy parallel corpus (Hong Kong News), and a very-non-parallel corpus (TDT 3).
    We can see that the more parallel or comparable the corpus, the higher the overall lexical matching score is.
  
  
    It is well known that existing work on sentence alignment from parallel corpus makes use of one or multiple of the following principles (Manning and Sch&#369;tze, 1999, Somers 2001): more words that a
