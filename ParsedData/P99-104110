 ZN 0.67 1.28 1.64 1.96 2.33 2.58 We further assume that the estimations of P(A), P(BIA) and P(CIA) in (2) are accurate.
    The confidence interval for the true probability gives rise to a confidence interval for the true mutual information (mutual information computed using the true probabilities instead of estimations).
    The upper and lower bounds of this interval are obtained by substituting 11 with k+zs V-k and L=z11/-1-4. in (2).
    Since our confidence of p falling between/.1/--V-In. is N%, we can have N% confidence that the true mutual information is within the upper and lower bound.
    We use the following condition to determine whether or not a collocation is compositional: (3) A collocation a is non-compositional if there does not exist another collocation /3 such that (a) 13 is obtained by substituting the head or the modifier in a with a similar word and (b) there is an overlap between the 95% confidence interval of the mutual information values of a and 0.
    For example, the following tab
