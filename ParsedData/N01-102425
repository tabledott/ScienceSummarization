note that there is a path that can be followed along solid edges from every correct word to every other correct variant.
    This suggests that taking into consideration link transitivity (i.e., if X&lt;Y1, Y1&lt;Y2, Y2&lt;Y3,... and Yt&lt;Z, then X&lt;Z) may drastically reduce the number of deletions.
    There are two caveats that need to be considered for transitivity to be properly pursued.
    The first caveat: if no rule exists that would transform X into Z, we will assume that despite the fact that there may be a probabilistic path between the two, we will disregard such a path.
    The second caveat is that the algorithms we test against.
    Furthermore, since we will say that paths can only consist of solid CELEX has limited coverage, many of these loweredges, namely each Pr(Y&lt;Yi i+1) on every path must frequency words could not be scored anyway.
    This exceed the specified threshold. cut-off also helps each of the algorithms to obtain Given these constraints, suppose now there is a stronger st
