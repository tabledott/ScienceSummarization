different domains (reviews of automobiles, banks, movies, and travel destinations).
    The accuracy ranges from 84% for automobile reviews to 66% for movie reviews.
  
  
    If you are considering a vacation in Akumal, Mexico, you might go to a search engine and enter the query &#8220;Akumal travel review&#8221;.
    However, in this case, Google1 reports about 5,000 matches.
    It would be useful to know what fraction of these matches recommend Akumal as a travel destination.
    With an algorithm for automatically classifying a review as &#8220;thumbs up&#8221; or &#8220;thumbs down&#8221;, it would be possible for a search engine to report such summary statistics.
    This is the motivation for the research described here.
    Other potential applications include recognizing &#8220;flames&#8221; (abusive newsgroup messages) (Spertus, 1997) and developing new kinds of search tools (Hearst, 1992).
    In this paper, I present a simple unsupervised learning algorithm for classifying a review as recommended
