 taking the intersection of the alignments produced by IBM-4 E&#8594;F and IBM-4 F&#8594;E.
    The row IBM-4 Refined shows results obtained by refining the intersection of alignments in order to increase recall.
    Our algorithm achieved over 44% relative error reduction when compared with IBM-4 used in either direction and a 25% relative error rate reduction when compared with IBM-4 Refined.
    It also achieved a slight relative error reduction when compared with IBM-4 Intersect.
    This demonstrates that we are competitive with the methods described in (Och and Ney, 2000).
    In Table 2, one can see that our algorithm is high precision, low recall.
    This was expected as our algorithm uses the one-to-one constraint, which rules out many of the possible alignments present in the evaluation data.
    Table 3 shows the contributions of features to our algorithm&#8217;s performance.
    The initial (02) row is the score for the algorithm (described in Section 4.1) that generates our initial alignment.
