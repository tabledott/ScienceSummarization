ces to the community to facilitate further research: manually aligned document pairs, and an edited test set.
    Hopefully this will encourage research into Wikipedia as a resource for machine translation.
    Secondly, we improve on prior pairwise models by introducing a ranking approach for sentence pair extraction.
    This ranking approach sidesteps the problematic class imbalance issue, resulting in improved average precision while retaining simplicity and clarity in the models.
    Also by modeling the sentence alignment of the articles globally, we were able to show a substantial improvement in task accuracy.
    Furthermore a small sample of annotated articles is sufficient to train these global level features, and the learned classifiers appear very portable across languages.
    It is difficult to say whether such improvement will carry over to other comparable corpora with less document structure and meta-data.
    We plan to address this question in future work.
    Finally, initial investigation
