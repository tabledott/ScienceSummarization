urate with respect to manually-made clusterings (Section 3).
    Second, we evaluate the performance of WSD systems when using coarse-grained sense inventories (Section 4).
    We conclude the paper with an account of related work (Section 5), and some final remarks (Section 6).
  
  
    In this section, we present an approach to the automatic construction of a coarse-grained sense inventory based on the mapping of WordNet senses to coarse senses in the Oxford Dictionary of English.
    In section 2.1, we introduce the two dictionaries, in Section 2.2 we illustrate the creation of sense descriptions from both resources, while in Section 2.3 we describe a lexical and a semantic method for mapping sense descriptions of WordNet senses to ODE coarse entries.
    WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998) is a computational lexicon of English which encodes concepts as synonym sets (synsets), according to psycholinguistic principles.
    For each word sense, WordNet provides a gloss (i.e. a textual definition) and a set of relation
