   The diff files sum to 457 bytes, versus 269,339 bytes for the original files, or less than 0.2%.
    A few sentences were not parsable; these were assigned right branching period high structure, a good heuristic (Brill, 1993).
    We also ran experiments using Bod's data, 75 sentence test sets, and no limit on sentence length.
    However, while Bod provided us with his data, he did not provide us with the split into test and training that he used; as before we used ten random splits.
    The results are disappointing, as shown in Table 2.
    They are noticeably worse than those of Bod, and again very comparable to those of Pereira and Schabes.
    Whereas Bod reported 96% exact match, we got only 86% using the less restrictive zero crossing brackets criterion.
    It is not clear what exactly accounts for these differences.2 It is also noteworthy that the results are much better on Bod's data than on the minimally edited data: crossing brackets rates of 96% and 97% on Bod's data versus 90% on minimally e
