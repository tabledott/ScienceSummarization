    Then the sum over L(G) that is implicit in q,3 [f] can be expanded out, and solving for 3 is simply a matter of arithmetic.
    Things are a bit trickier if L(G) is too large to enumerate.
    DD&amp;L show that we can solve equation (2) if we can estimate gold [f = ic] for k from 0 to the maximum value of f in the training corpus.
    (See Appendix 1 for details.)
    We can estimate gold if = k] by means of random sampling.
    The idea is actually rather simple: to estimate how often the feature appears in &amp;quot;the average dag,&amp;quot; we generate a representative mini-corpus from the distribution iloid and count.
    That is, we generate dags at random in such a way that the relative frequency of dag x is gold (x) (in the limit), and we count how often the feature of interest appears in dags in our generated mini-corpus.
    The application that DD&amp;L consider is the induction of English orthographic constraints, that is, inducing a field that assigns high probability to &amp;quot;English-s
