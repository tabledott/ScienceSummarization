tions.
    This also holds for entities not directly realized in an utterance.
    On our view, after referring to &amp;quot;a house&amp;quot; in If, a reference to &amp;quot;the door&amp;quot; in Un4.1 might be gotten via inference from the representation for &amp;quot;a house&amp;quot; in Cf( U,,).
    Thus when the proposed anchors are constructed there is no possibility of having an infinite number of potential Cf's for an utterance of finite length.
    Another question is whether the preference ordering of transitions in constraint 3 should always be the same.
    For some examples, particularly where Un contains a single pronoun and Un...1 is a retention, some informants seem to have a preference for shifting, whereas the centering algorithm chooses a continuation (see figure 8).
    Many of our informants have no strong preference as to the co-specification of the unstressed &amp;quot;She&amp;quot; in Un+4.
    Speakers can avoid ambiguity by stressing a pronoun with respect to its phonological enviro
