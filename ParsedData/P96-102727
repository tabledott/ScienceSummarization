way of associating their referents with the above noun phrases because the variables corresponding to those referents are internal.
    We conclude that, as a matter of principle, no edge should be constructed if the result of doing so would be to make internal an index occurring in part of the input semantics that the new phrase does not subsume.
    In other words, the semantics of a phrase must contain all predicates from the input specification that refer to any indices internal to it.
    This strategy does not prevent the generation of an exponential number of variants of phrases containing modifiers.
    It limits proliferation of the ill effects, however, by allowing only the maximal one to be incorporated in larger phrases.
    In other words, if the final result has phrases with m and n modifiers respectively, then 2' versions of the first and 211' of the second will be created, but only one of each set will be incorporated into larger phrases and no factor of 2'14-no will be introduced into the cos
