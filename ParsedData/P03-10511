    His technique pre-supposes at most one prefix and one suffix per stem regardless of the actual number and meanings of prefixes/suffixes associated with the stem.
    (Beesley 1996) presents a finite-state morphological analyzer for Arabic, which displays the root, pattern, and prefixes/suffixes.
    The analyses are based on manually acquired lexicons and rules.
    Although his analyzer is comprehensive in the types of knowledge it presents, it has been criticized for their extensive development time and lack of robustness, cf.
    (Darwish 2002).
    (Yarowsky and Wicentowsky 2000) presents a minimally supervised morphological analysis with a performance of over 99.2% accuracy for the 3,888 past-tense test cases in English.
    The core algorithm lies in the estimation of a probabilistic alignment between inflected forms and root forms.
    The probability estimation is based on the lemma alignment by frequency ratio similarity among different inflecti
