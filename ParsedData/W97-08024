logy for the database format, database compilation, as well as the Princeton WordNet interface, applying extensions only where necessary.
    This results in maximal compatibility.
  
  
    Gertna.Net shares the basic database division into the four word classes noun, adjective, verb, and adverb with WordNet, although adverbs are not implemented in the current working phase.
    For each of the word classes the semantic space is divided into some 15 semantic fields.
    The purpose of this division is mainly of an organizational nature: it allows to split the work into packages.
    Naturally, the semantic fields are closely related to major nodes in the semantic network.
    However, they do not have to agree completely with the net's top-level ontology, since a lexicographer can always include relations across these fields and the division into fields is normally not shown to the user by the interface software.
    GermaNet only implements lemmas.
    We assume that inflected forms are mapped to base forms
