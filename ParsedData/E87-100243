ng its essential character.
    In particular, these extensions will leave us clearly within the domain of finite-state devices.
    The extensions have to do with separating the process of reading or writing a symbol on a tape, from advancing the tape to the next position.
    The quadruples that label the transitions in the transducers we shall be constructing will be elements each consisting of two parts, a symbol, and an instruction concerning the movement of the tape I shall use the following notation for this.
    A unadorned symbol will be read in the traditional way, namely, as requiring the tape on which that symbol appears to move to the next position as soon as it has been read or written.
    If the symbol is shown in brackets, on the other hand, the tape will not advance, and the quadruple specifying the next following transition will therefore clearly have to be one that specifies the same symbol for that tape, since the symbol will still be under the read-write head when that transition is take
