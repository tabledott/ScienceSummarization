			and ?mediated?
			in ?IL-18-ediated?

			The Pennsylvania biology corpus (Kulick et al, 2004) partially solves this problem by separating a token where two or more subtokens are connected with hyphens, but in the cases where a shared part of the word is not separated by a hyphen (e.g. ?metric?

			The current GTB follows the GENIA corpus that it retains the tokeniza tion criteria of the original Penn Treebank, but this must be reconsidered in future.
			For analysis of coordination with ellipsis, if the information on full forms is available, one strategy would be to leave the inside structure of coordination unannotated in the treebank corpus (and in the phase of text analysis the structure is not established in the phase of parsing b
