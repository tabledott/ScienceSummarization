iguity, often one interpretation is much more prevelant than the others.
    The error rates on the baseline approximately double on TE2, reflecting the difference between TE2 and TR1, and the small size of TR1.
    The performance of our classifiers is good on TE1 (third column), and only slightly worse on TE2 (fifth column).
    We attribute the increase in error reduction over the baseline for TE2 to successfully learned generalizations.
    We investigated the performance of the classifiers on unanalyzed words.
    The performance is generally below the baseline BL.
    We attribute this to the almost complete absence of unanalyzed words in training data TR1.
    In future work we could attempt to improve performance in these cases; however, given their small number, this does not seem a priority.
  
  
    Once we have the results from the classifiers for the ten morphological features, we combine them to choose an analysis from among those returned by the morphological analyzer.
    We investigate sever
