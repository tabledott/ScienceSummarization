  Probabilistic Disambiguation Models For Wide-Coverage HPSG Parsing
  
    This paper reports the development of loglinear models for the disambiguation in wide-coverage HPSG parsing.
    The estimation of log-linear models requires high computational cost, especially with widecoverage grammars.
    Using techniques to reduce the estimation cost, we trained the models using 20 sections of Penn Treebank.
    A series of experiments empirically evaluated the estimation techniques, and also examined the performance of the disambiguation models on the parsing of real-world sentences.
  
  
    Head-Driven Phrase Structure Grammar (HPSG) (Pollard and Sag, 1994) has been studied extensively from both linguistic and computational points of view.
    However, despite research on HPSG processing efficiency (Oepen et al., 2002a), the application of HPSG parsing is still limited to specific domains and short sentences (Oepen et al., 2002b; Toutanova and Manning, 2002).
