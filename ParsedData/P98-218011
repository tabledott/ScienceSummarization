    This observation of symmetry led to the hypothesis that similar words are typically connected in MindNet by semrel paths that frequently exhibit certain patterns of relations (exclusive of the words they actually connect), many patterns being symmetrical, but others not.
    Several experiments were performed in which word pairs from a thesaurus and an anti-thesaurus (the latter containing dissimilar words) were used in a training phase to identify semrel path patterns that indicate similarity.
    These path patterns were then used in a testing phase to determine the substitutional similarity or dissimilarity of unseen word pairs (algorithms are described in Richardson 1997).
    The results, summarized in the table below, demonstrate the strength of this integrated approach, which uniquely exploits both the paradigmatic and the synta
