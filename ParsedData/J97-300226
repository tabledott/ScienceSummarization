the optimal parse tree are then given recursively for any q = (s, t, u, v) by: The time complexity of this algorithm in the general case is e(N3T3V3), where N is the number of distinct nonterminals and T and V are the lengths of the two sentences.
    This is a factor of V3 more than monolingual chart parsing, but has turned out to remain quite practical for corpus analysis, where parsing need not be real-time.
  
  
    Segmentation of the input sentences is an important step in preparing bilingual corpora for various learning procedures.
    Different languages realize the same concept using varying numbers of words; for example, a single English word may surface as a compound in French.
    This complicates the problem of matching the words between a sentence-pair, since it means that compounds or collocations must sometimes be treated as lexical units.
    The translation lexicon is assumed to contain collocation translations to facilitate such multiword matchings.
    However, the input sentences do not
