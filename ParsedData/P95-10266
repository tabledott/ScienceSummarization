    In general, the decision-list algorithm is well suited for the task of sense disambiguation and will be used as a component of the unsupervised algorithm below.
  
  
    Words not only tend to occur in collocations that reliably indicate their sense, they tend to occur in multiple such collocations.
    This provides a mechanism for bootstrapping a sense tagger.
    If one begins with a small set of seed examples representative of two senses of a word, one can incrementally augment these seed examples with additional examples of each sense, using a combination of the one-senseper-collocation and one-sense-per-discourse tendencies.
    Although several algorithms can accomplish similar ends,6 the following approach has the advantages of simplicity and the ability to build on an existing supervised classification algorithm without modification.'
    As shown empirically, it also exhibits considerable effectiveness.
    The algorithm will be illustrated by the disambiguation of 7538 instances of the p
