 This manifests itself in an overly high degree of nondeterminism in the generation process.
    For instance, various nondeterministic possibilities for generating a noun phrase (using different cases, say) might be entertained merely because the NP occurs before the verb which would more fully specify, and therefore limit, the options.
    This nondeterminism has been observed in practice.
    We can think of a parsing or generation process as discovering an analysis tree,3 one admitted by the grammar and satisfying certain syntactic or semantic conditions, by traversing a virtual tree and constructing the actual tree during the traversal.
    The conditions to be satisfied&#8212;possessing a given yield in the parsing case, or having a root node labeled with given semantic information in the case of generation&#8212;reflect the different premises of the two types of problem.
    From this point of view, a naive top-down parser or generator performs a depth-first, left-to-right traversal of the tree.
