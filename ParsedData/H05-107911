cate symbols from the DRS are mapped to WordNet synsets using a variant of Lesk?s WSD algorithm (Manning and Schuetze, 1999).
			Examples 78 and 1952 would be supported by knowledge similar to: ?x(clinton(x)?person(x)) ?x(book(x)?artifact(x)) ?x(artifact(x)?
			?person(x)) ?x(soar(x)?rise(x)) Finally, axioms covering geographical knowledge about capitals, countries and US states are extracted automatically from the CIA factbook.
			An example: ?x?y(paris(x)?france(y)?in(x,y)) 3.4 Model Building.
			While theorem provers are designed to prove that a formula is a theorem (i.e., that the formula is true in any model), they are generally not good at deciding that a formula is not a theorem.
			Model builders are designed to show that a formula is true in at least one model.
			To exploit these complementary approaches to inference, we use both a theorem prover and amodel builder for any inference problem: the theo rem prover attempts to prove the input whereas the model builder simultaneously tries to find a mode
