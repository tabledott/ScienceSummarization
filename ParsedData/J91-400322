t is performed generatively.
    Rather than assuming a fixed set of primitives, let us assume a fixed number of generative devices that can be seen as constructing semantic expressions.'
    Just as a formal language is described more in terms of the productions in the grammar than its accompanying vocabulary, a semantic language is definable by the rules generating the structures for expressions rather than the vocabulary of primitives itself.6 How might this be done?
    Consider the sentences in Example 21 again.
    A minimal decomposition on the word closed is that it introduces an opposition of terms: closed and not-closed.
    For the verbal forms in 21b and 21c, both terms in this opposition are predicated of different subevents denoted by the sentences.
    In 21a, this opposition is left implicit, since the sentence refers to a single state.
    Any minimal analysis of the semantics of a lexical item can be termed a generative operation, since it operates on the predicate(s) already literally provi
