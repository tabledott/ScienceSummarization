ed in the linguistic context.
    A 5-token sliding window is used for the context.
    Hacioglu has previously described a chunk based semantic labeling method (Hacioglu et al., 2004).
    This system uses SVM classifiers to first chunk input text into flat chunks or base phrases, each labeled with a syntactic tag.
    A second SVM is trained to assign semantic labels to the chunks.
    The system is trained SVMs were trained for begin (B) and inside (I) classes of all arguments and outside (O) class for a total of 78 one-vs-all classifiers.
    Again, TinySVM5 along with YamCha6 (Kudo and Matsumoto, 2000; Kudo and Matsumoto, 2001) are used as the SVM training and test software.
    Table 11 presents the system performances on the PropBank test set for the chunk-based system.
  
  
    We combined the semantic parses as follows: i) scores for arguments were converted to calibrated probabilities, and arguments with scores below a threshold value were deleted.
    Separate thresholds were used for each parser.
