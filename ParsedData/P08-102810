ted in a distinct space from u and v, as is the case for tensor products.
    It also allows us to derive models in which composition makes use of background knowledge K and models in which composition has a dependence, via the argument R, on syntax.
    To derive specific models from this general framework requires the identification of appropriate constraints to narrow the space of functions being considered.
    One particularly useful constraint is to hold R fixed by focusing on a single well defined linguistic structure, for example the verb-subject relation.
    Another simplification concerns K which can be ignored so as to explore what can be achieved in the absence of additional knowledge.
    This reduces the class of models to: However, this still leaves the particular form of the function f unspecified.
    Now, if we assume that p lies in the same space as u and v, avoiding the issues of dimensionality associated with tensor products, and that f is a linear function, for simplicity, of the cartes
