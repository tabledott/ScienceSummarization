ndle phonological changes that operate across word boundaries.
    Another approach to solving this computational problem would be to use the reversed cascade of rules during recognition, but to somehow make the filtering information of particular rules available earlier in the process.
    However, no general and effective techniques have been proposed for doing this.
    The more radical approach that we explore in this paper is to eliminate the cascade altogether, representing the information in the grammar as a whole in a single more unified device, namely, a finite-state transducer.
    This device is constructed in two phases.
    The first is to create for each rule in the grammar a transducer that exactly models its behavior.
    The second is to compose these individual rule transducers into a single machine that models the grammar as a whole.
    Johnson (1972) was the first to notice that the noncyclic components of standard phonological formalisms, and particularly the formalism of The Sound Patte
