ng and 1 for testing.
    The final result is an average over the 10 different splits, given in Table 9, where o- is the standard deviation of the overall accuracy.
    We also performed 10-fold cross-validation using MXPOST and TNT, a publicly available Markov model PO S tagger (Brants, 2000).
    The difference between MXPOST and c&amp;c represents a reduction in error rate of 4.3%, and the difference between TNT and C&amp;C a reduction in error rate of 10.8%.
    We also compare our performance against other published results that use different training and testing sections.
    Collins (2002) uses WSJ 0018 for training and WSJ 22-24 for testing, and Toutanova and Manning (2000) use WSJ 00-20 for training and WSJ 23-24 for testing.
    Collins uses a linear perceptron, and Toutanova and Manning (T&amp;M) use a ME tagger, also based on MXPOST.
    Our performance (in Table 10) is slightly worse than Collins', but better than T&amp;M (except for unknown words).
    We noticed during development that unknown
