 expressive power since, while syntactic relations are invariably subject to c-command or dominance constraints, there is no way to state that two trees from a set must be in a dominance relation in the derived tree.
    MCTAG with Domination Links (MCTAG-DL) (Becker et al., 1991) are multicomponent systems that allow for the expression of dominance constraints.
    However, MCTAG-DL share a further problem with MCTAG: the derivation structures cannot be given a linguistically meaningful interpretation.
    Thus, they fail to address the first problem we discussed (in Section 1.1).
    Vijay-Shanker (1992) points out that use of adjunction for clausal complementation in TAG corresponds, at the level of dependency structure, to substitution at the foot node' of the adjoined tree.
    However, adjunction (rather than substitution) is used since, in general, the structure that is substituted may only form part of the clausal complement: the remaining substructure of the clausal complement appears above the root
