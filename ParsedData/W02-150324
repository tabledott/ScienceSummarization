navian languages.
    Thus, the ParGram project has shown that it is possible to use a single grammar development platform and a unified methodology of grammar writing to develop large-scale grammars for typologically different languages.
    The grammars&#8217; analyses show a large degree of parallelism, despite being developed at different sites.
    This is achieved by intensive meetings twice a year.
    The parallelism can be exploited in applications using the grammars: the fewer the differences, the simpler a multilingual application can be (see (Frank, 1999) on a machine-translation prototype using ParGram).
