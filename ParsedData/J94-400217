    The search splits to consider singular and plural antecedents separately (steps 4-6) to allow a general treatment of number ambiguity (as in the Spanish possessive pronoun su or the German pronoun sie occurring as an accusative object). c. The syntactic filter is applied, using the list of disjoint pronoun-NP pairs generated earlier.
    The filter excludes any candidate paired in the list with the pronoun being resolved, as well as any candidate that is anaphorically linked to an NP paired with the pronoun. unambiguous as to number).
    7.
    The selected candidate is declared to be the antecedent of the pronoun.
    The following properties of RAP are worth noting.
    First, it applies a powerful syntactic and morphological filter to lists of pronoun&#8212;NP pairs to reduce the set of possible NP antecedents for each pronoun.
    Second, NP salience measures are specified largely in terms of syntactic properties and relations (as well as frequency of occurrence).
    These include a hierarchy of gr
