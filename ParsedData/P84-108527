operations.
    The propositions expressing the meanings of their constituents are evaluated with respect to the same possible world -- the successive constituents simply add up to one description.
    (We may note that some of the binary structures which we shall not consider further now, certainly correspond to intensional operations.
    &amp;quot;If A then B&amp;quot; is a clear example.)
    Since we will not discuss adjacency structures in any detail in this paper, the problem of accommodating speaker change and different illocutionary forces in the discourse semantics will be left for another occasion.
    We shall discuss three kinds of sequential structures: lists, narratives, and topic chaining.
    Perhaps the paradigmatic sequential structure is the list: a series of clauses C1&amp;quot; Ck which have a semantic structure of the form F(a1) = v,, F(ak) = vk, i.e., the clauses express propositions which convey the values which one function has for a series of alternative arguments.
    For instance,
