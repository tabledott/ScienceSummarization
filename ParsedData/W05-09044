; fluency.
    For example, in the BLEU metric, the overlapping fractions of n-grams with more than one word are considered as a kind of metric for the fluency of the hypothesis.
    Consider the following simple example:
  
  
    If we use BLEU to evaluate the two sentences, hypothesis 2 has two bigrams a dog and I had which are also found in the reference, and hypothesis 1 has no bigrams in common with the reference.
    Thus hypothesis 2 will get a higher score than hypothesis 1.
    The result is obviously incorrect.
    However, if we evaluate their fluency based on the syntactic similarity with the reference, we will get our desired results.
    Figure 1 shows syntactic trees for the example sentences, from which we can see that hypothesis 1 has exactly the same syntactic structure with the reference, while hypothesis 2 has a very different one.
    Thus the evaluation of fluency can be transformed as computing the syntactic similarity of the hypothesis and the references.
