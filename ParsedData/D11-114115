    We deliberately choose not to annotate @usernames as entities in our data set because they are both unambiguous, and trivial to identify with 100% accuracy using a simple regular expression, and would only serve to inflate our performance statistics.
    While there is ambiguity as to the type of @usernames (for example, Because Twitter contains many distinctive, and infrequent entity types, gathering sufficient training data for named entity classification is a difficult task.
    In any random sample of tweets, many types will only occur a few times.
    Moreover, due to their terse nature, individual tweets often do not contain enough context to determine the type of the entities they contain.
    For example, consider following tweet: KKTNY in 45min without any prior knowledge, there is not enough context to determine what type of entity &#8220;KKTNY&#8221; refers to, however by exploiting redundancy in the data (Downey et al., 2010), we can determine it is likely a reference to a television show si
