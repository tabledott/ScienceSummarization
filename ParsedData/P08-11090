  Efficient Feature-based Conditional Random Field Parsing
  
    Discriminative feature-based methods are widely used in natural language processing, but sentence parsing is still dominated by generative methods.
    While prior feature-based dynamic programming parsers have restricted training and evaluation to artificially short sentences, we present the first general, featurerich discriminative parser, based on a conditional random field model, which has been successfully scaled to the full WSJ parsing data.
    Our efficiency is primarily due to the use of stochastic optimization techniques, as well as parallelization and chart prefiltering.
    On WSJ15, we attain a state-of-the-artF-score a 14% relative reduction in error over previous models, while being two orders of magnitude faster.
    On sentences of length our system achieves an F-score of a 36% relative reduction in error over a generative baseline.
  
  
    Over the past decade, feature-based discriminative models have become the tool of cho
