    Sense-frames are dictionary entries for individual word senses.
    Sense-frames are composed of other word senses that have their own sense-frames, much like Quillian's (1967) planes.
    Each sense-frame consists of two parts, an arcs section and a node section, that correspond to the genus and differentia commonly found in dictionary definitions (Amsler 1980).
    The arcs part of a sense-frame contains a labeled arc to its genus term (a word sense with its own sense-frame).
    Together, the arcs of all the sense-frames comprise a densely structured semantic network of word senses called the sense-network.
    The node part of a sense-frame contains the differentia of the word sense defined by that senseframe, i.e., information distinguishing that word sense from other word senses sharing the same genus.
    The two lexical semantic constraints mentioned earlier, preferences and assertions, play a prominent part in sense-frame nodes.
