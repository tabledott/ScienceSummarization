	Anaphora For Everyone: Pronominal Anaphora Resolution Without A Parser
		We present an algorithm for anaphora res- olutkm which is a modified and extended version of that developed by (Lappin and Leass,/994).
		In contrast to that work, our al- gorithm does not require in-depth, full, syn..
		tactic parsing of text.
		Instead, with minimal compromise in output quality, the modifica- tions enable the resolution process to work from tile output of a part of speech tag- ge~; enriched only with annotations of gram- matica\] functkm of lexical items in the in- put text stream.
		Evaluation of the results of our in-tplementation demonstrates that ac- curate anaphora resolution can be realized within natural anguage processing fl'ame- works which do not--~,)r cannot- employ ro- bust and rcqiable parsing components.
	
	
			(l,appin and Leass, 1994) describe an algorithm for pronominal anaphora resolution with high rate of cor- rect analyses.
			While one of the strong points of this algorithm is that it operates pr
