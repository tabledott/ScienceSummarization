    The first compares a range of probabilistic model selection methodologies and finds that none outperform the Naive Bayesian classifier, which attains accuracy of 74%.
    The second compares a range of machine learning algorithms and finds that a decision tree learner (78%) and a Naive Bayesian classifier (74%) are most accurate.
    The line data was first studied by (Leacock et al., 1993).
    They evaluate the disambiguation accuracy of a Naive Bayesian classifier, a content vector, and a neural network.
    The context of an ambiguous word is represented by a bag-of-words where the window of context is two sentences wide.
    This feature set is abbreviated as 2 sentence b-o-w in Table 6.
    When the Naive Bayesian classifier is evaluated words are not stemmed and capitalization remains.
    However, with the content vector and the neural network words are stemmed and words from a stop-list are removed.
    They report no significant differences in accuracy among the three approaches; the Naive Baye
