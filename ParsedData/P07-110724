rce of error in our system is between coreferent proper and nominal mentions.
    The most common examples of this kind of error are appositive usages e.g.
    George W. Bush, president of the US, visited Idaho.
    Another error of this sort can be seen in figure 2, where the corporation mention is not labeled coreferent with the The Weir Group mention.
    Examples such as these illustrate the regular (at least in newswire) phenomenon that nominal mentions are used with informative intent, even when the entity is salient and a pronoun could have been used unambiguously.
    This aspect of nominal mentions is entirely unmodeled in our system.
    Since we do not have labeled cross-document coreference data, we cannot evaluate our system&#8217;s crossdocument performance quantitatively.
    However, in addition to observing the within-document gains from sharing shown in section 3, we can manually inspect the most frequently occurring entities in our corpora.
    Table 3 shows some of the most frequently occu
