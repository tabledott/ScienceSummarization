uster as the most frequently represented relation; we call this the major relation of the cluster.
    NE pairs with relation R in a cluster whose major relation was R were counted as correct; the correct pair count, , is defined as the total number of correct pairs in all clusters.
    Other NE pairs in the cluster were counted as incorrect; the incorrect pair count, , is also defined as the total number of incorrect pairs in all clusters.
    We evaluated clusters based on Recall, Precision and F-measure.
    We defined these measures as follows.
    Recall (R) How many correct pairs are detected out of all the key pairs?
    The key pair count, , is defined as the total number of pairs manually classified in clusters of two or more pairs.
    Recall is defined as follows: Precision (P) How many correct pairs are detected among the pairs clustered automatically?
    Precision is defined as follows: F-measure (F) F-measure is defined as a combination of recall and precision according to the following formula
