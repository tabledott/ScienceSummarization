examples are extracted using the parsing algorithm itself.
    The training examples required for the cascaded chunking model is much smaller than that for the probabilistic model.
    The model reduces the training cost significantly and enables training using larger amounts of annotated corpus.
    &#8226; No assumption on the independence between dependency relations The probabilistic model assumes that dependency relations are independent.
    However, there are some cases in which one cannot parse a sentence correctly with this assumption.
    For example, coordinate structures cannot be always parsed with the independence constraint.
    The cascaded chunking model parses and estimates relations simultaneously.
    This means that one can use all dependency relations, which have narrower scope than that of the current focusing relation being considered, as feature sets.
    We describe the details in the next section.
    The cascaded chunking model can be combined with any machine learning algorithm th
