e.
    For example, given the verb-subject relationship, the prior probability for (person) tends to be significantly higher than the prior probability for (insect).
    However, once the identity of the predicate is taken into account, the probabilities can change &#8212; if the verb is buzz, then the probability for (insect) can be expected to be higher than its prior, and (person) will likely be lower.
    In probabilistic terms, it is the difference between this conditional or posterior distribution and the prior distribution that determines selectional preference.
    Information theory provides an appropriate way to quantify the difference between the prior and posterior distributions, in the form of relative entropy (Kullback and Leibler, 1951).
    The model defines the selectional preference strength of a predicate as: Intuitively, SR(p) measures how much information, in bits, predicate p provides about the conceptual class of its argument.
    The better Pr(c) approximates Pr(c1p), the less influenc
