    These shortcomings might be traced back to the fact that the centering model, up to now, did not consider the role of the (main) verb of the utterance under scrutiny.
    Other cases, such as VP anaphora (Hardt 1992), temporal anaphora (Kameyama, Passonneau, and Poesio 1993; Hitzeman, Moens, and Grover 1995) have already been examined within the centering model.
    The particular phenomenon of paycheck anaphora is described by Hardt (1996), though he uses only a rather simplified centering model for this work.
    Other cases are only dealt with in the focusing framework such as propositional anaphora (Dahl and Ball 1990).

    Evaluations of the centering model have so far only been carried out manually.
    This is clearly no longer rewarding, so appropriate computational support environments have to be provided.
    What we have in mind is a kind of discourse structure ba
