associating lemmas during a training phase.
    In this paper, however, the concern is not to limit the terms to a set of allowed terms.
    As opposed to Turney (2000) and Frank et al. (1999), who experiment with keyword extraction from full-length texts, this work concerns keyword extraction from abstracts.
    The reason for this is that many journal papers are not available as full-length texts, but as abstracts only, as is the case for example on the Internet.
    The starting point for this work was to examine whether the data representation suggested by Frank et al. was adequate for constructing a keyword extraction model from and for abstracts.
    As the results were poor, two alternatives to extracting n-grams as the potential terms were explored.
    The first approach was to extract all noun phrases in the documents as judged by an NP-chunker.
    The second selection approach was to define a set of POS tag sequences, and extract all words or sequences of words that matched any of these, relying o
