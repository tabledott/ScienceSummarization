here lij denotes the link between word i and word j, and d(i) denotes the degree of word i, which means the number of words linked with word i.
    Two words without connections are regarded as being connected by a link of weight 0.
    We call this network the gloss network (G).
    We construct another network, the glossthesaurus network (GT), by linking synonyms, antonyms and hypernyms, in addition to the the above linked words.
    Only antonym links are in DL.
    We enhance the gloss-thesaurus network with cooccurrence information extracted from corpus.
    As mentioned in Section 2, Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown (1997) used conjunctive expressions in corpus.
    Following their method, we connect two adjectives if the adjectives appear in a conjunctive form in the corpus.
    If the adjectives are connected by &#8220;and&#8221;, the link belongs to SL.
    If they are connected by &#8220;but&#8221;, the link belongs to DL.
    We call this network the gloss-thesaurus-corpus network (GTC).
    We suppose
