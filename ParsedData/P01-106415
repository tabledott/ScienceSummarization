Maekawa and Koiso, 2000).
    Our proposed algorithm finds the maximumprobability segmentation of a given text.
    This is a new approach for domain-independent text segmentation.
    A probabilistic approach, however, has already been proposed by Yamron, et al. for domain-dependent text segmentation (broadcast news story segmentation) (Yamron et al., 1998).
    They trained a hidden Markov model (HMM), whose states correspond to topics.
    Given a word sequence, their system assigns each word a topic so that the maximum-probability topic sequence is obtained.
    Their model is basically the same as that used for HMM part-of-speech (POS) taggers (Manning and Sch&#168;utze, 1999), if we regard topics as POS tags.11 Finding topic boundaries is equivalent to finding topic transitions; i.e., a continuous topic or segment is a sequence of words with the same topic.
    Their approach is indirect compared with our approach, which directly finds the maximumprobability segmentation.
    As a result, their model ca
