2011) annotated tweets using an augmented version of the PTB tagset and presumably followed the PTB annotation guidelines.
    We wrote new guidelines because the PTB conventions are inappropriate for Twitter in several ways, as shown in the design of Gimpel et al.&#8217;s tagset.

    For example, the PTB tokenization splits contractions containing apostrophes: I&#8217;m ==&gt;.

    One strategy would be to analyze these forms into a PTB-style tokenization, as discussed in Forsyth (2007), who proposes to analyze doncha as do/VBP ncha/PRP, bu
