ethod predicts sets of equally informative summaries, identifies semantic differences between more and less highly ranked summaries, or constitutes a tool that can be applied directly to further analysis of content selection.
    In Section 2, we describe the DUC method.
    In Section 3 we present an overview of our method, contrast our scores with other methods, and describe the distribution of scores as pyramids grow in size.
    We compare our approach with previous work in Section 4.
    In Section 5, we present our conclusions and point to our next step, the feasibility of automating our method.
    A more detailed account of the work described here, but not including the study of distributional properties of pyramid scores, can be found in (Passonneau and Nenkova, 2003).
  
  
    Within DUC, different types of summarization have been studied: the generation of abstracts and extracts of different lengths, single- and multi-document summaries, and summaries focused by topic or opinion.
