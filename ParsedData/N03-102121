    Inference of synchronous structures requires a synchronous parser.
    A synchronous parser is an algorithm that can infer the syntactic structure of each component text in a multitext and simultaneously infer the correspondence relation between these structures.4 To facilitate complexity analysis (below), we specify our parsers using declarative inference rules.'
    &amp;quot;X :- Y, Z&amp;quot; means that X can be inferred from Y and Z. V means the same thing.
    An item that appears in an inference rule stands for the proposition that the item is in the parse chart.
    A production rule that appears in an inference rule stands for the proposition that the production is in the grammar.
    Such specifications are nondeterministic: they do not indicate the order in which a parser should attempt inferences.
    A deterministic parsing strategy can always be chosen later, to suit the application.
    Any reasonable parsing strategy will have the same asymptotic complexity (McAllester, 20
