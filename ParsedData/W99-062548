tage of correct answers over both categories of similar and non-similar pairs) is considered, the numbers are much closer together: 98.8% for our approach; 96.6% and 97.8% for TF*IDF on the two P-R points mentioned for that method above; 96.5% and 97.6% for SMART, again at the two P-R points mentioned for SMART earlier; and 97.5% for the default baseline.5 Nevertheless, since the challenge of identifying sparsely occurring similar small text units is our goal, the accuracy measure and the baseline technique of classifying everything as not similar are included only for reference but do not reflect our task.
  
  
    We computed statistics on how much each feature helps in identifying similarity, summarized in Table 2.
    Primitive features are named according to the type of the feature (e.g., Verb for the feature that counts the number of matching verbs according to exact matches).
    Composite feature names indicate the restrictions applied to primitives.
    For example, the composite feature Distance &l
