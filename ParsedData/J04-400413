 becomes a new right-sibling of the NPB node (see Figure 3).6 While such a transformation is reasonable, it is interesting to note that Collins&#8217; parser performs no equivalent detransformation when parsing is complete, meaning that when the parser produces the &#8220;repaired&#8221; structure during testing, there is a spurious NP bracket.7 The gap feature is discussed extensively in chapter 7 of Collins&#8217; thesis and is applicable only to his Model 3.
    The preprocessing step in which gap information is added locates every null element preterminal, finds its co-indexed WHNP antecedent higher up in the tree, replaces the null element preterminal with a special trace tag, and threads the gap feature in every nonterminal in the chain between the common ancestor of the antecedent and the trace.
    The threaded-gap feature is represented by appending -g to every node label in the chain.
    The only detail we would like to highlight here is that an implementation of this preprocessing step should chec
