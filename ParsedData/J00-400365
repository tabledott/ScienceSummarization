    The overall recall and precision results for the heuristics for identifying discoursenew descriptions presented in Section 4.2 are shown in Table 11.
    In this table we do not distinguish between the two types of discourse-new descriptions, unfamiliar and larger-situation (Hawkins 1978).
    As already mentioned in Section 4.2, distinguishing between the two types of discourse-new descriptions identified by Hawkins, Prince, and others isn't easy even for humans (Fraurud 1990; Poesio and Vieira 1998); and indeed, our heuristics for recognizing discourse-new descriptions work better when evaluated together.
    The column headed if represents the number of cases of descriptions classified as discourse-new in the standard annotation; + indicates the total number of discourse-new descriptions correctly identified; &#8212; the number of errors.
    These results are for the version of the system that uses the best version of the heuristics for dealing with an
