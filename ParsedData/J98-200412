    An alternative way to rewrite the &amp;quot;ideal&amp;quot; figure of merit is as follows: Once again applying the usual independence assumption that given a nonterminal, the tag sequence it generates depends only on that nonterminal, we can rewrite the figure of merit as follows: To derive an estimate of this quantity for practical use as a figure of merit, we make some additional independence assumptions.
    We assume that p(Kk I tod, tk,n) 19(1\111,k), that is, that the probability of a nonterminal is independent of the tags before and after it in the sentence.
    We also use a trigram model for the tags themselves, giving We can calculate 13(Nk) as usual.
    The p(N1) term is estimated from our PCFG and the training data from which the grammar was learned.
    We estimate p(N9 as the sum of the counts for all rules having N' as their left-hand side, divided by the sum of the counts for all rules.1 The p(ti,k I ti-2,t1_1) term is just the probability of the tag sequence t1. tk_i according to a tri
