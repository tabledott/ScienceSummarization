 with the model proposed by Chiang, the SPMT models introduced in this paper are fully grounded in syntax; this makes them good candidates for exploring the impact that syntaxbased language models could have on translation performance.
    From a machine translation perspective, the SPMT translation model family we have proposed in this paper is promising.
    To our knowledge, we are the first to report results that show that a syntax-based system can produce results that are better than those produced by a strong phrasebased system in experimental conditions similar to those used in large-scale, well-established independent evaluations, such as those carried out annually by NIST.
    Although the number of syntax-based rules used by our models is smaller than the number of phrase-based rules used in our state-of-the-art baseline system, the SPMT models produce outputs of higher quality.
    This feature is encouraging because it shows that the syntactified translation rules learned in the SPMT models can ge
