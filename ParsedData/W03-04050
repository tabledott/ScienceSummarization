  Unsupervised Personal Name Disambiguation
  
    This paper presents a set of algorithms for distinguishing personal names with multiple real referents in text, based on little or no supervision.
    The approach utilizes an unsupervised clustering technique over a rich feature space of biographic facts, which are automatically extracted via a language-independent bootstrapping process.
    The induced clustering of named entities are then partitioned and linked to their real referents via the automatically extracted biographic data.
    Performance is evaluated based on both a test set of handlabeled multi-referent personal names and via automatically generated pseudonames.

    While word senses and translation ambiguities may typically have 2-20 alternative meanings that must be resolved through context, a personal name such as &#8220;Jim Clark&#8221; may potentially refer to hundreds or thousa
