han our monolingual data sets.
    Second, the mapped clustering may not necessarily correspond to an acceptable target language clustering in terms of monolingual likelihood.
    In order to tackle these issues, we propose the following more complex model.
    First, to find clusterings that are good according to both the source and target language, and to make use of more unlabeled data, we model word sequences in each language by the monolingual language model with likelihood function defined by equation (1).
    Denote these likelihood functions respectively by LS(wS; CS) and LT (wT; CT), where we have overloaded notation so that the word sequences denoted by wS and wT include much more plentiful non-aligned data when taken as an argument of the monolingual likelihood functions.
    Second, we couple the clusterings defined by these individual models, by introducing additional factors based on word alignments, as proposed by Och (1999): and the symmetric LS|T(wS; AS|T, CS, CT).
    Note that the simple pr
