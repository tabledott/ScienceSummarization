 occurs with equal frequency in a corpus, and so the prior probabilities exhibit a uniform, uninformative distribution.
    Then a corpus with an average polysemy of 5, and 2 senses marked correct on each ambiguous token, will have a baseline not less than 40%.
    However, one with an average polysemy of 2, and only a single sense on each, will have a baseline of at least 50%.
    Test corpora in which each ambiguous token has exactly two senses were used by Brown et al. (1991), Yarowsky (1995) and others.
    Our system was tested using a technique known as 10-fold cross validation.
    This process is carried out by splitting the available data into ten roughly equal subsets.
    One of the subsets is chosen as the test data and the TiMBL algorithm is trained on the remainder.
    This is repeated ten times, so that each subset is used as test data exactly once, and results are averaged across all of the test runs.
    This technique provides two advantages: first, the best use can be made of the available
