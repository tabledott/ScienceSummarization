.
    The ratio of categories in the first check were A=0.62, B=0.09, C=0.09, and D=0.20.
    Comparing these figures with those in Table 1, we concluded that first and second evaluations were consistent.
    Sorted alignments: AVSIM vs. BM25 We sorted the same alignments in Table 1 in decreasing order of AVSIM and BM25.
    Alignments judged to be A or B were regarded as correct.
    The number, N, of correct alignments and precision, P, up to each rank are shown in Table 2.
    From the table, we can conclude that AVSIM ranks correct alignments higher than BM25.
    Its greater accuracy indicates that it is important to take similarities in sentence alignments into account when estimating the validity of article alignments.
  
  
    Table 2 shows that AVSIM is reliable in ranking correct and incorrect alignments.
    This section reveals that not only rank order but also absolute values of AVSIM are reliable for discriminating between correct and incorrect alignments.
    That is, they correspond well with
