a clustering algorithm has to be chosen.
    Finch and Chater (1992) use the Spearman Rank Correlation Coefficient and a hierarchical clustering, Sch&#252;tze (1995) uses the cosine between vector angles and Buckshot clustering.
    An extension to this generic scheme is presented in (Clark, 2003), where morphological Proceedings of the COLING/ACL 2006 Student Research Workshop, pages 7&#8211;12, Sydney, July 2006. c&#65533;2006 Association for Computational Linguistics information is used for determining the word class of rare words.
    Freitag (2004) does not sum up the contexts of each word in a context vector, but the most frequent instances of four-word windows are used in a co-clustering algorithm.
    Regarding syntactic ambiguity, most approaches do not deal with this issue while clustering, but try to resolve ambiguities at the later tagging stage.
    A severe problem with most clustering algorithms is that they are parameterised by the number of clusters.
    As there are as many different word cl
