he relevance decision, and also skim-reading the whole paper before making the decision.
    This resulted in 5 to 28 sentences per paper and a total of 1,183 sentences.
    Implicitly, rhetorical classification of the extracted sentences was already given as each of these sentences already had a rhetorical status assigned to it.
    However, the rhetorical scheme we used for this task is slightly different.
    We excluded TEXTUAL, as this category was designed for document uses other than summarization.
    If a selected sentence had the rhetorical class TEXTUAL, it was reclassified into one of the other six categories.
    Figure 8 shows the resulting category distribution among these 1,183 sentences, which is far more evenly distributed than the one covering all sentences (cf.
    Figure 7).
    CONTRAST and OWN are the two most frequent categories.
    We did not verify the relevance annotation with human experiments.
    We accept that the set of sentences chosen by the human annotator is only one possi
