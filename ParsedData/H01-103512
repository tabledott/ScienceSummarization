h data, using Brill (1995) and Ramshaw &amp; Marcus (1994), respectively.
  As illustrated in Figure 5, each word within an English noun phrase is then subscripted with the number of its NP in the sentence, and this subscript is projected onto the aligned French (or Chinese) words.
  In the most common case, the corresponding French/Chinese noun phrase is simply the maximal span of the projected subscript.
  Figure 6 shows some of the projection challenges encountered.
  Nearly all such cases of interwoven projected NPs are due to align- ment errors, and a strong inductive bias towards NP cohesion was utilized to resolve these incompatible projections.
