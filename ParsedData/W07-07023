translation.
			By preferring more likely sequences of supertags, it is conceivable that the output of the decoder is 9 more grammatical.
			However, its not clear exactlyhow syntactic information can benefit a flat structured model: the constraints contained within su pertags are not enforced and relationships between supertags are not linear.
			We perform experiments to explore the nature and limits of the contribution of supertags, using different orders of n-gram models, reordering models and focussed manual evaluation.
			It seems that the benefit of using n-gram supertagsequence models is largely from improving reordering, as much of the gain is eroded by using a lexi calised reordering model.
			This is supported by the manual evaluation which shows a 44% improvement in reordering Dutch-English verb final sentences.
			The second and novel way we use supertags is to direct the translation process.
			Supertags on thesource sentence allows the decoder to make decisions based on the structure of the inp
