    Examples include shoot the breeze, pull strings, and push one&#8217;s luck.
    We refer to these as verb+noun idiomatic combinations (VNICs).
    The class of VNICs accommodates a large number of idiomatic expressions (Cowie et al., 1983; Nunberg et al., 1994).
    Moreover, their peculiar behaviour signifies the need for a distinct treatment in a computational lexicon (Fellbaum, 2005).
    Despite this, VNICs have been granted relatively little attention within the computational linguistics community.
    We look into two closely related problems confronting the appropriate treatment of VNICs: (i) the problem of determining their degree of flexibility; and (ii) the problem of determining their level of idiomaticity.
    Section 2 elaborates on the lexicosyntactic flexibility of VNICs, and how this relates to their id
