    One can judge the program informally by simply examining the results and determining if the program's gender decisions are correct (occasionally looking at the text for difficult cases).
    Figure 1 shows the 43 noun phrases with the highest salience figures (run using the Hobbs algorithm).
    An examination of these show that all but three are correct.
    (The three mistakes are &amp;quot;husband,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;wife,&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;years.&amp;quot; We return to the significance of these mistakes later.)
    As a measure of the utility of these results, we also ran our pronoun-anaphora program with these statistics added.
    This achieved an accuracy rate of 84.2%.
    This is only a small improvement over what was achieved without the data.
    We believe, however, that there are ways to improve the accuracy of the learning method and thus increase its influence on pronoun anaphora resolution.
    Finally we attempted a fully automatic direct test of the accuracy of b
