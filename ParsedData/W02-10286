r extracted noun phrases are recorded.
    Figure 2 shows the bootstrapping process that follows, which we explain in the following sections.
    The first step in the bootstrapping process is to score the extraction patterns based on their tendency to extract known category members.
    All words that are currently defined in the semantic lexicon are considered to be category members.
    Basilisk scores each pattern using the RlogF metric that has been used for extraction pattern learning (Riloff, 1996).
    The score for each pattern is computed as: where Fi is the number of category members extracted by patterni and Ni is the total number of nouns extracted by patterni.
    Intuitively, the RlogF metric is a weighted conditional probability; a pattern receives a high score if a high percentage of its extractions are category members, or if a moderate percentage of its extractions are category members and it extracts a lot of them.
    The top N extraction patterns are put into a pattern pool.
