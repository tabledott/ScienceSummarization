 (1997), Collins (1997), Inui et al. (1997), Johnson (1998)&#8212;that conditioning the probabilities of structures on the context within which they appear, for example on the lexical head of a constituent (Charniak 1997; Collins 1997), on the label of its parent nonterminal (Johnson 1998), or, ideally, on both and many other things besides, leads to a much better parsing model and results in higher parsing accuracies.
    One way of thinking about conditioning the probabilities of productions on contextual information (e.g., the label of the parent of a constituent or the lexical heads of constituents), is as annotating the extra conditioning information onto the labels in the context-free rules.
    Examples of this are bilexical grammars&#8212;such as Eisner and Satta (1999), Charniak (1997), Collins (1997)&#8212;where the lexical heads of each constituent are annotated on both the right- and left-hand sides of the context-free rules, under the constraint that every constituent inherits the lexical head fr
