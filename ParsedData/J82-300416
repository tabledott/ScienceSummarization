BI * ICI = IAI * I8 &#8226; CI, where A, B, and C are sets of trees and Eventually, we have NP expressed as an infinitely long polynominal (5b) above.
    This expression can be simplified by introducing a notation for exponentiation.
    Let x' be an abbreviation for multiplying x x &#8226; ... &#8226; x, i times.
    Note that parentheses are interpreted differently in algebraic equations than in context-free rules.
    In context-free rules, parentheses denote optionality, where in equations they denote precedence relations among algebraic operations.
  
  
    Ambiguity coefficients take on an important practical significance when we can model them directly without resorting to successive approximation as above.
    This can result in substantial time and space savings in certain special cases where there are much more efficient ways to compute the coefficients than successive approximation (chart parsing).
    Equation (9) is such a special case; the coefficients follow a well-known combinatoric series c
