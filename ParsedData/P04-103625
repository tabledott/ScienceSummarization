he possibility of finding predominant senses in domain specific corpora on a sample of nouns.
    In the future, we will perform a large scale evaluation on domain specific corpora.
    In particular, we will use balanced and domain specific corpora to isolate words having very different neighbours, and therefore rankings, in the different corpora and to detect and target words for which there is a highly skewed sense distribution in these corpora.
    There is plenty of scope for further work.
    We want to investigate the effect of frequency and choice of distributional similarity measure (Weeds et al., 2004).
    Additionally, we need to determine whether senses which do not occur in a wide variety of grammatical contexts fare badly using distributional measures of similarity, and what can be done to combat this problem using relation specific thesauruses.
    Whilst we have used WordNet as our sense inventory, it would be possible to use this method with another inventory given a measure of semantic rela
