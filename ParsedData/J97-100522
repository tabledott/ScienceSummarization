 of the segments to identify.
    Our statistical results indicate that, despite the freedom of the task, naive subjects independently perform surprisingly similar segmentations of the same discourse.
    We also show by example that subjects' segmentations reflect the presumed episode structure of the narrative.
    We ask subjects to segment discourse using a nonlinguistic criterion in order to avoid circularity when we later investigate the correlation of linguistic devices with segments derived from the segmentation task results.
    Abstracting statistically significant results from the subjects' responses is thus the second goal of our study of the segmentation task.
    Here we briefly review our statistical results and summarize the motivation for our method of abstracting a single segmentation for a given narrative from a set of subjects' responses.
    As noted below, more detailed discussion of the statistic we use is presented elsewhere.
