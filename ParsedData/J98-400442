e points labeled with a pair of categories KB correspond to PCFGs induced applying the Parent transform to nodes labeled A with parents labeled B.
    (Some labels are elided to make the remaining labels legible).
    The x-axis shows the difference in number of productions in the PCFG after selective parent transform and the untransformed treebank PCFG, and the y-axis shows the difference in the average of the precision and recall scores. is usually influenced by considerations of parsimony; thus the Chomsky adjunction representation of PP modification may be preferred because it requires only a single context-free rule, rather than a rule schema abbreviating a potentially unbounded number of rules that would be required in flat tree representations of adjunction.
    But in a PCFG model the additional nodes required by the Chomsky adjunction representation represent independence assumptions that seem not to be justified.
    In general, in selecting a tree structure one faces a bias/variance trade-off, in t
