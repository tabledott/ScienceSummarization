ce weights by between 0.6 BLEU and 1.8 BLEU, and beats the log-linear baseline by a large margin.
    The final block in table 2 shows models trained on feature subsets and on the SVM feature described in 3.4.
    The general-language features have a slight advantage over the similarity features, and both are better than the SVM feature.
  
  
    We have already mentioned the closely related work by Matsoukas et al (2009) on discriminative corpus weighting, and Jiang and Zhai (2007) on (nondiscriminative) instance weighting.
    It is difficult to directly compare the Matsoukas et al results with ours, since our out-of-domain corpus is homogeneous; given heterogeneous training data, however, it would be trivial to include Matsoukas-style identity features in our instance-weighting model.
    Although these authors report better gains than ours, they are with respect to a non-adapted baseline.
    Finally, we note that Jiang&#8217;s instance-weighting framework is broader than we have presented above, encompa
