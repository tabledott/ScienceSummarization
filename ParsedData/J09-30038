negative out of context are neutral in context, meaning that they are not even being used to express a sentiment.
    Similarly, words that are neutral out of context, neither positive or negative, may combine to create a positive or negative expression in context.
    The focus of this work is on the recognition of contextual polarity&#8212;in particular, disambiguating the contextual polarity of words with positive or negative prior polarity.
    We begin by presenting an annotation scheme for marking sentiment expressions and their contextual polarity in the Multi-perspective Question Answering (MPQA) opinion corpus.
    We show that, given a set of subjective expressions (identified from the existing annotations in the MPQA corpus), contextual polarity can be annotated reliably.
    Using the contextual polarity annotations, we conduct experiments in automatically distinguishing between prior and contextual polarity.
    Beginning with a large lexicon of clues tagged with prior polarity, we identify the c
