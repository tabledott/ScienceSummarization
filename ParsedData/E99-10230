  Representing Text Chunks
  
    Dividing sentences in chunks of words is a useful preprocessing step for parsing, information extraction and information retrieval.
    (Ramshaw and Marcus, 1995) have introduced a &amp;quot;convenient&amp;quot; data representation for chunking by converting it to a tagging task.
    In this paper we will examine seven different data representations for the problem of recognizing noun phrase chunks.
    We will show that the the data representation choice has a minor influence on chunking performance.
    However, equipped with the most suitable data representation, our memory-based learning chunker was able to improve the best published chunking results for a standard data set.
  
  
    The text corpus tasks parsing, information extraction and information retrieval can benefit from dividing sentences in chunks of words.
    (Ramshaw and Marcus, 1995) describe an error-driven transformation-based learning (TBL) method for finding NP chunks in texts.
    NP chunks (or baseNP
