matically from these corpora, under various experimental conditions.
    In the experiments described in Section 3.4, we started out with five out-of-domain initial parallel corpora of various sizes and obtained five dictionaries and five out-ofdomain trained classifiers (per language pair).
    We now plug in each of these classifiers (and their associated dictionaries) in our extraction system (Section 2) and apply it to our comparable corpora.
    We thus obtain five Arabic-English and five Chinese-English extracted corpora.
    Note that in each of these experiments the only resource used by our system is the initial, out-of-domain parallel corpus.
    Thus, the experiments fit in the framework of interest described in Section 1, which assumes the availability of (limited amounts of) out-of-domain training data and (large amounts of) in-domain comparable data.
    Table 2 shows the sizes of the extracted corpora for each initial corpus size, for both Chinese-English and Arabic-English.
    As can be seen,
