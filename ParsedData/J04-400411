preterminal subtrees whose root label is one of {&#8216;&#8216;, &#8217;&#8217;, .}.
    There are two reasons to remove these types of subtrees when parsing the English Treebank: First, in the treebanking guidelines (Bies 1995), quotation marks were given the lowest possible priority and thus cannot be expected to appear within constituent boundaries in any kind of consistent way, and second, neither of these types of preterminals&#8212;nor any punctuation marks, for that matter&#8212;counts towards the parsing score.
    An NP is basal when it does not itself dominate an NP; such NP nodes are relabeled NPB.
    More accurately, an NP is basal when it dominates no other NPs except possessive NPs, where a possessive NP is an NP that dominates POS, the preterminal possessive A nonhead NPB child of NP requires insertion of extra NP. marker for the Penn Treebank.
    These possessive NPs are almost always themselves base NPs and are therefore (almost always) relabeled NPB.
