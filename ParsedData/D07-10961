a single parser on data from thirteen different languages, which enabled a comparison not only of parsing and learning methods, but also of the performance that can be achieved for different languages (Buchholz and Marsi, 2006).
			In dependency-based syntactic parsing, the task is to derive a syntactic structure for an input sentence by identifying the syntactic head of each word in the sentence.
			This defines a dependency graph, where the nodes are the words of the input sentence and the arcs are the binary relations from head to dependent.
			Often, but not always, it is assumed that all words except one have a syntactic head, which means that the graph will be a tree with the single independent word as the root.
			In labeled dependency parsing, we additionally require the parser to assign a specific type (or label) to each dependency relation holding between a head word and a dependent word.
			In this year?s shared task, we continue to explore data-driven methods for multilingual dependencyparsing, bu
