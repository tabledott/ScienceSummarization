ent, when such a sequence of characters was encountered, each of the characters was treated as a separate word, as in the CAW algorithm above.
    This variation of the greedy algorithm, using the same list of 57472 words, produced an initial score of F=82.9.
    A sequence of 2450 transformations was learned from the training set; applied to the test set, they improved the score from F=82.9 to 87.7, a 28.1% error reduction.
    The score produced using this variation of the maximum matching algorithm combined with a rule sequence (87.7) is nearly equal to the score produced by the NMSU segmenter segmenter (87.9) discussed in the next section.
    The previous three experiments showed that our rule sequence algorithm can produce excellent segmentation results given very simple initial segmentation algorithms.
    However, assisting in the adaptation of an existing algorithm to different segmentation schemes, as discussed in Section 1, would most likely be performed with an already accurate, fullydeveloped alg
