    The use of topical context has been discussed in the field of information retrieval for several years (Anthony 1954; Salton 1968).
    Recent WSD work has exploited topical context: Yarowsky (1992) uses a 100-word window, both to derive classes of related words and as context surrounding the polysemous target, in his experiments using Roget's Thesaurus (see Section 2.3.2).
    Voorhees, Leacock, and Towell (1995) experiment with several statistical methods using a two-sentence window; Leacock, Towell, and Voorhees (1993, 1996) have similarly explored topical context for WSD.
    Gale, Church, and Yarowsky (1993), looking at a context of &#177;50 words, indicate that while words closest to the target contribute most to disambiguation, they improved their results from 86% to 90% by expanding context from &#177;6 (a typical span when only microcontext is considered) to &#177;50 words around the target.
    In a related study, they make a claim that for a given discourse, ambiguous words are used in a s
