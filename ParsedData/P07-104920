he first adjacency point on that side of x which was not yet used.
    This means that the adjacency points on each side have to be used one by one, but may be used more than once.
    The reason is that optional arguments of x usually do not have an adjacency point of their own but have the same labels as obligatory arguments of x and can share their adjacency point.
    The Axi with the strongest matching label is selected, with a preference for the unused adjacency point.
    As in the learning process, label matching is blocked between words which are separated by stopping punctuation.
    The best matching label l = (w, S) from x to y can be either a class (S = 0) or an adjacency (S = 1) label at Axi .
    If it is a class label, w can be seen as taking the place of x and all words separating it from y (which are already linked to x).
    If l is an adjacency label, w can be seen to take the place of y.
    The calculation of the weight Wt(x *d y) of the link from x to y is therefore based on the strengt
