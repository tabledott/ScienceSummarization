valuated using the 0-crossingbrackets measure, which represents the percentage of sentences for which none of the constituents in the parser's parse violates the constituent boundaries of any constituent in the correct parse.
    After over ten years of grammar development, the IBM parser achieved a 0-crossing-brackets score of 69%.
    On this same test set, SPATTER scored 76%.
    The experiment is intended to illustrate SPATTER's ability to accurately parse a highly-ambiguous, large-vocabulary domain.
    These experiments use the Wall Street Journal domain, as annotated in the Penn Treebank, version 2.
    The Penn Treebank uses 46 part-of-speech tags and 27 non-terminal labels.2 The WSJ portion of the Penn Treebank is divided into 25 sections, numbered 00 - 24.
    In these experiments, SPATTER was trained on sections 02 - 21, which contains approximately 40,000 sentences.
    The test results reported here are from section 00, which contains 1920 sentences.3 Sections 01, 22, 23, and 24 will be used as t
