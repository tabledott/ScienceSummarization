    Bracketing is another intermediate corpus annotation, useful especially when a fullcoverage grammar with which to parse a corpus is unavailable (for Chinese, an even more common situation than with English).
    Aside from purely linguistic interest, bracket structure has been empirically shown to be highly effective at constraining subsequent training of, for example, stochastic context-free grammars (Pereira and Schabes 1992; Black, Garside, and Leech 1993).
    Previous algorithms for automatic bracketing operate on monolingual texts and hence require more grammatical constraints; for example, tactics employing mutual information have been applied to tagged text (Magerman and Marcus 1990).
    Our method based on SITGs operates on the novel principle that lexical correspondences between parallel sentences yields information from which partial bracketings for both sentences can be extracted.
    The assumption that no grammar is available means that constituent categories a
