 words in the sentence are affected by the hedge cue.
    The system combines several classifiers and works in two phases: in the first phase hedge cues (i.e., words indicating speculative language) are identified, and in the second phase the full scope of these hedge cues is found.
    This means that for a sentence like the one in Example (1) taken from the BioScope corpus (Szarvas et al., 2008), the system performs two actions: first, it detects that suggest, might, and or are hedge signals; second, it detects that suggest has as its scope expression of c-jun, jun B and jun D genes might be involved in terminal granulocyte differentiation or in regulating granulocyte functionality, that might has as its scope be involved in terminal granulocyte differentiation or in regulating granulocyte functionality, and that or has as its scope in regulating granulocyte functionality.
