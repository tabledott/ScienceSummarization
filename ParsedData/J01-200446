nstituents and all incomplete constituents are closed.
    This structure is evaluated for precision and recall, which is entirely appropriate for these incomplete as well as complete parses.
    If we fail to identify nodes later in the parse, recall will suffer, and if our early predictions were bad, both precision and recall will suffer.
    Of course, the percentage of these failures are reported as well.
    The first set of results looks at the performance of the parser on the standard corpora for statistical parsing trials: Sections 2-21 (989,860 words, 39,832 sentences) of the Penn Treebank (Marcus, Santorini, and Marcinkiewicz 1993) served as the training data, Section 24 (34,199 words, 1,346 sentences) as the held-out data for parameter estimation, and Section 23 (59,100 words, 2,416 sentences) as the test data.
    Section 22 (41,817 words, 1,700 sentences) served as the development corpus, on which the parser was tested until stable versions were ready to run on the test data, to avoid developing
