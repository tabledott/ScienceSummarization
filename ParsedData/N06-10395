&#8220;Taiwan&#8221;) represent a certain relation that has something in common: a hurricane name and the place it affected.
    By finding multiple parallel correspondences between two articles, we can estimate the similarity of their relations.
    Generally, in a clustering task, one groups items by finding similar pairs.
    After finding a pair of articles that have a similar relation, we can bring them into the same cluster.
    In this case, we cluster articles by using their basic patterns as features.
    However, each basic pattern is still connected to its entity so that we can extract the name from it.
    We can consider a basic pattern to represent something like the &#8220;role&#8221; of its entity.
    In this example, the entities that had &#8220;headed&#8221; as a basic pattern are hurricanes, and the entities that had &#8220;was-hit&#8221; as a basic pattern are the places it affected.
    By using basic patterns, we can align the entities into the corresponding column that represents a cer
