  A special problein in Model 3 and Model 4 con- cerns the deficiency of tile model.
  This results in problems in re-estimation of the parameter which describes the fertility of the empty word.
  In nor- real EM-training, this parameter is steadily decreas- ing, producing too many aligmnents with tile empty word.
  Therefore we set tile prot)ability for aligning a source word with tile emt)ty word at a suitably chosen constant value.
  As in tile HMM we easily can extend the depen- dencies in the alignment model of Model 4 easily using the word class of the previous English word E = G(ci,), or the word class of the French word F = G(I j)  (Brown et al., 1993).
  5 Inc lud ing  a Manual Dictionary We propose here a simple method to make use of a bilingual dictionary as an additional knowledge source in the training process by extending the train- ing corpus with the dictionary entries.
  Thereby, the dictionary is used already in EM-training and can improve not only the alignment fox" words which are in the
