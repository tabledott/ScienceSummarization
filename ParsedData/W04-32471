y creating a compressed version of a given text that provides useful information for the user.
    In this paper, we focus on multi-document generic text summarization, where the goal is to produce a summary of multiple documents about the same, but unspecified topic.
    Our summarization approach is to assess the centrality of each sentence in a cluster and include the most important ones in the summary.
    In Section 2, we present centroid-based summarization, a wellknown method for judging sentence centrality.
    Then we introduce two new measures for centrality, Degree and LexPageRank, inspired from the &#8220;prestige&#8221; concept in social networks and based on our new approach.
    We compare our new methods and centroidbased summarization using a feature-based generic summarization toolkit, MEAD, and show that new features outperform Centroid in most of the cases.
    Test data for our experiments is taken from Document Understanding Conferences (DUC) 2004 summarization evaluation to compare our
