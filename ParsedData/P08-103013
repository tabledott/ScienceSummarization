ed by review and adjudication of the two annotations.
    Both cross-sentence and cross-document inferences provided significant improvement over the baseline with local confidence thresholds controlled.
    We conducted the Wilcoxon Matched-Pairs Signed-Ranks Test on a document basis.
    The results show that the improvement using crosssentence inference is significant at a 99.9% confidence level for both trigger and argument labeling; adding cross-document inference is significant at a 99.9% confidence level for trigger labeling and 93.4% confidence level for argument labeling.
    From table 5 we can see that for trigger labeling our approach dramatically enhanced recall (22.9% improvement) with some loss (7.4%) in precision.
    This precision loss was much larger than that for the development set (0.3%).
    This indicates that the trigger propagation thresholds optimized on the development set were too low for the blind test set and thus more spurious triggers got propagated.
    The improved trigger l
