ut of the scope of this study), we randomly selected 700 positive-sentiment and 700 negative-sentiment documents.
    We then divided this data into three equal-sized folds, maintaining balanced class distributions in each fold.
    (We did not use a larger number of folds due to the slowness of the MaxEnt training procedure.)
    All results reported below, as well as the baseline results from Section 4, are the average three-fold cross-validation results on this data (of course, the baseline algorithms had no parameters to tune).
    To prepare the documents, we automatically removed the rating indicators and extracted the textual information from the original HTML document format, treating punctuation as separate lexical items.
    No stemming or stoplists were used.
    One unconventional step we took was to attempt to model the potentially important contextual effect of negation: clearly &#8220;good&#8221; and &#8220;not very good&#8221; indicate opposite sentiment orientations.
