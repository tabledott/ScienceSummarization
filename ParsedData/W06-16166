aints are not satisfied (e.g. verbs with two subjects or incompatible coordination arguments).
    An example of this for Dutch is illustrated in Figure 2 which was produced by the parser of McDonald et al. (2005b).
    Here the parse contains a coordination of incompatible word classes (a preposition and a verb).
    Our approach is able to include additional constraints which forbid configurations such as those in Figure 2.
    While McDonald and Pereira (2006) address the issue of local attachment decisions by defining scores over attachment pairs, our solution is more general.
    Furthermore, it is complementary in the sense that we could formulate their model using ILP and then add constraints.
    The method we present is not the only one that can take global constraints into account.
    Deterministic dependency parsing (Nivre et al., 2004; Yamada and Matsumoto, 2003) can apply global constraints by conditioning attachment decisions on the intermediate parse built.
    However, for efficiency a greedy
