est parse for sentences in held out test data.
    The experiment was repeated here, except that both the Labelled Tree and Labelled Recall Algorithm were run for each sentence.
    In contrast to previous research, we repeated the experiment ten times, with different training set, test set, and initial conditions each time.
    Table 1 shows the results of running this experiment, giving the minimum, maximum, mean, and standard deviation for three criteria, Consistent Brackets Recall, Consistent Brackets Tree, and sus Bracketed Recall for Pereira and Schabes Bracketed Recall.
    We also display these statistics for the paired differences between the algorithms The only statistically significant difference is that for Consistent Brackets Recall Rate, which was significant to the 2% significance level (paired t-test).
    Thus, use of the Bracketed Recall Algorithm leads to a 10% reduction in error rate.
    In addition, the performance of the Bracketed Recall Algorithm was also qualitatively more appealing.
