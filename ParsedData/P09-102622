   In order to analyze why OpPr outperforms OpPMI, we need to compare Tables 2 and 3.
    Table 2 reports the conditional probabilities learned from the web corpus for polaritytarget pairs used in OpPr, and Table 3 reports the PMI of these same targets with the debate topics used in OpPMI.
    First, we observe that the PMI numbers are intuitive, in that all the words, except for &#8220;e-mail,&#8221; show a high PMI relatedness to both topics.
    All of them are indeed semantically related to the domain.
    Additionally, we see that some conclusions of the OpPMI system are similar to those of the OpPr system, for example, that &#8220;Storm&#8221; is more closely related to the Blackberry than the iPhone.
    However, notice two cases: the PMI values for &#8220;phone&#8221; and &#8220;e-mail&#8221; are intuitive, but they may cause errors in debate analysis.
    Because the iPhone and the Blackberry are both phones, the word &#8220;phone&#8221; does not have any distinguishing power in debates.
