tes a new COREF class for each one, and calcu- lates its salience weight according to how the discourse referent satisfies the set of salience factors.
			The second step involves the interpretation f lexical anaphors (reflexives and reciprocals).
			A list of candi- date antecedent-anaphor pairs is generated for every lexical anaphor, based on the hypothesis that a lexical anaphor must refer to a coargument.
			In the absence of configurational information, coarguments are iden- tified using grammatical function information (as de- termined by LINGSOFT) and precedence relations.
			A reflexive can have one of three possible grammatical function values: direct object, indirect object, or oblique.
			In the first case, the closest preceding discourse referent with grammatical function value subject is identified as a possible antecedent.
			In the latter cases, both the clos- est preceding subject and the closest preceding direct object hat is not separated from the anaphor by a sub- ject are identified as pos
