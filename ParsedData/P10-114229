    There has been an increasing amount of work on investigating semantic features for coreference resolution.
    One of the earliest kinds of semantic knowledge employed for coreference resolution is perhaps selectional preference (Dagan and Itai, 1990; Kehler et al., 2004b; Yang et al., 2005; Haghighi and Klein, 2009): given a pronoun to be resolved, its governing verb, and its grammatical role, we prefer a candidate antecedent that can be governed by the same verb and be in the same role.
    Semantic knowledge has also been extracted from WordNet and unannotated corpora for computing the semantic compatibility/similarity between two common nouns (Harabagiu et al., 2001; Versley, 2007) as well as the semantic class of a noun (Ng, 2007a; Huang et al., 2009).
    One difficulty with deriving knowledge from WordNet is that one has to determine which sense of a given word to use.
    Some researchers simply use the first sense (Soon et al., 2001) or all possible senses (Ponzetto and
