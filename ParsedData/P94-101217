as follows: The prior Pr(Li =-&#8226; L2) is evaluated as before.
    We assume all Si values are approximately independent, giving (5) Pr(,30 , , on ILI L2) Pf.
    H Pr(di (Li L2) The same dynamic programming optimization can then be used.
    However, the computation and memory costs grow linearly with the number of lexical cues.
    This may not seem expensive until one considers that the pure length-based method only uses resources equivalent to that of a single lexical cue.
    It is in fact important to choose as few lexical cues as possible to achieve the desired accuracy.
    Given the need to minimize the number of lexical cues chosen, two factors become important.
    First, a lexical cue should be highly reliable, so that violations, which waste the additional computation, happen only rarely.
    Second, the chosen lexical cues should occur frequently, since computing the optimization over many zero counts is not useful.
    In general, these factors are quite domainspecific, so lexical cues must
