stems in full text collection suggests that finding secondary arguments in full text is much more challenging.
    In detail, a significant improvement was made for Location arguments (36.59%&#8212;*50.00%).
    A further breakdown of the results of site extraction, shown in table 8, shows that finding site arguments for Phosphorylation, Binding and Regulation events are all significantly improved, but in different ways.
    The extraction of protein sites to be phosphorylated is approaching a practical level of performance (84.21%), while protein sites to be bound or to be regulated remains challenging to be extracted.
    Table 9 shows final evaluation results of Task 3.
    For reference, the reported performance of the taskwinning system in 2009, Kilicoglu09(Kilicoglu and Bergler, 2009), is shown in the top.
    Among the two teams participated in the task, UTurku showed a better performance in extracting negated events, while ConcordU showed a better performance in extracting speculated events.
