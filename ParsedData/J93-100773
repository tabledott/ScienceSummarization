    Although very similar in meaning, the two words select different prepositions.
    Moreover, the difference of meaning of the two prepositions does not account for the wording choices.
    Similarly, sentences (5)&#8212;(6) and (7)&#8212;(8) illustrate the fact that &amp;quot;aftermath&amp;quot; selects the preposition &amp;quot;of&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;aftershock&amp;quot; selects &amp;quot;from.&amp;quot; Grammatical collocations are very similar to lexical collocations in the sense that they also correspond to arbitrary and recurrent word co-occurrences (Benson 1990).

    The open class word is the meaning bearing element, it is the base; and the closed class word is the collocator.
    For lexicographers, grammatical collocations are somehow s
