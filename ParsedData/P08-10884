ach matched pair of word types (i, j) E m, we need to generate the observed feature vectors of the source and target word types, fS(si) E RdS and fT (tj) E RdT .
    The feature vector of each word type is computed from the appropriate monolingual corpus and summarizes the word&#8217;s monolingual characteristics; see section 5 for details and figure 2 for an illustration.
    Since si and tj are translations of each other, we expect fS(si) and fT(tj) to be connected somehow by the generative process.
    In our model, they are related through a vector zi,j E Rd representing the shared, language-independent concept.
    Specifically, to generate the feature vectors, we first generate a random concept zi,j &#8212; N(0, Id), where Id is the d x d identity matrix.
    The source feature vector fS(si) is drawn from a multivariate Gaussian with mean WSzi,j and covariance FS, where WS is a dS x d matrix which transforms the language-independent concept zi,j into a languagedependent vector in the source space.
