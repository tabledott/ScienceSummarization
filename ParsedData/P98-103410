 by removing problematic rules.
    The next section presents two such methods for automatically pruning the base NP grammar.
  
  
    As described above, our goal is to use the base NP corpus to extract and select a set of noun phrase rules that can be used to accurately identify base NPs in novel text.
    Our general pruning procedure is shown in Figure 3.
    First, we divide the base NP corpus into two parts: a training corpus and a pruning corpus.
    The initial base NP grammar is extracted from the training corpus as described in Section 2.
    Next, the pruning corpus is used to evaluate the set of rules and produce a ranking of the rules in terms of their utility in identifying base NPs.
    More specifically, we use the rule set and the longest match heuristic to find all base NPs in the pruning corpus.
    Performance of the rule set is measured in terms of labeled precision (P): We then assign to each rule a score that denotes the &amp;quot;net benefit&amp;quot; achieved by using the rule during
