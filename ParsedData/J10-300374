gorial Grammars (Steedman 1996) are employed, which can help denote a syntactic constituent with children missing on the left and/or right hand sides.
    An example would be the complex type VP/(NP/NNS) which denotes a verb phrase missing a noun phrase to its right which, in turn, is missing a plural noun to its right.
    The primary benefit of using complex types is that less useful paraphrastic phrase pairs from different syntactic categories such as (accurately, precise), that would have been allowed in the unconstrained pivot-based approach, are now disallowed.
    The biggest advantage of this approach is the use of syntactic knowledge as one form of additional evidence in order to filter out phrase pairs from categories (a) and (b) as defined in the context of our manual inspection of pivot-based paraphrases above.
    Indeed, the authors conduct a manual evaluation to show that the syntactically constrained paraphrase pairs are better than those produced without such constraints.
    However, there a
