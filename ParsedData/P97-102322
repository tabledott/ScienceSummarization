ct nodes, we also decouple the partitioning and labeling components of our system and score the partition found under the best matching conditions for the actual labels.
    Thus the simulation measures only how well the system separates positive from negative adjectives, not how well it determines which is which.
    However, in all the experiments performed on real corpus data (Section 8), the system correctly found the labels of the groups; any misclassifications came from misplacing an adjective in the wrong group.
    The whole procedure of constructing the random graph and finding and scoring the groups is repeated 200 times for any given combination of P and k, and the results are averaged, thus avoiding accidentally evaluating our system on a graph that is not truly representative of graphs with the given P and k. We observe (Figure 3) that even for relatively low P, our ability to correctly classify the nodes approaches very high levels with a modest number of links.
    For P =-- 0.8, we need only a
