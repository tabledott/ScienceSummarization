 agreement discussed in Section 3.
    The rates of agreement for each class thus obtained are presented in Table 9.
    Again, we find that the annotators found it easier to agree on co-referential definite descriptions, harder to agree on bridging references; the percentage agreement on the classes larger situation and unfamiliar taken individually is much lower than the agreement on the class larger situation/unfamiliar taken as a whole.
    The results in Table 9 confirm the indications obtained by computing agreement for a smaller number of classes: our subjects agree pretty much on coreferential definite descriptions, but bridging references are not a natural class.
    We discuss the cases of disagreement in more detail next. among annotators: about classification, and about the identification of an antecedent.
    There were 29 cases of complete classification disagreement among annotators, i.e., cases in which no two annotators classified a definite description in the same way, and 144 cases of parti
