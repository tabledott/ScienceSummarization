			sure such as pairwise agreement of rankings or a ranking correlation coefficient, such as Spearman?s.One could also use the rankings to estimate prob ability distributions and compare the distributions with measures such as alpha-skew divergence (Lee, 1999).
			A simple definition would be where the rankings assign different predominant senses to a word.
			Taking this simple definition of deviation, we demonstrate how this might be done for our corpora.
			We compared the automatic rankings from the BNC with those from each domain specific corpus (SPORTS and FINANCE) for all polysemous nouns in SemCor.
			Although the majority are assigned thesame first sense in the BNC as in the domain spe cific corpora, a significant proportion (31% SPORTS and 34% FINANCE) are not
