nText allows the user to change the part of speech that is being displayed, or to tag words that should not have been skipped.
  After the text has been syntactically tagged, all contiguous strings of proper nouns are joined with an underscore.
  For example, the string "Mr. Charles C. Carpenter" is output as "Mr._Charles_C._Carpenter."
  Here, too, the user can manually correct any mistaken concatenations.
