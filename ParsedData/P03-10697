ould be impossible if Si and Si&#8722;1 were actual sentences.
    It is unlikely to find the exact same sentence repeated several times in a corpus.
    What we can find and count is the number of times a given structure or word appears in the corpus.
    We will therefore estimate P(Si|Si&#8722;1) from features that express its structure and content (these features are described in detail in Section 3): where &#57737;a&#57737;i,1&#57738;,a&#57737;i,2&#57738; ...a&#57737;i,n&#57738;&#57738; are features relevant for sentence Si and &#57737;a&#57737;i&#8722;1,1&#57738;,a&#57737;i&#8722;1,2&#57738; ...a&#57737;i&#8722;1,m&#57738;&#57738; for sentence Si&#8722;1.
    We will assume that these features are independent and that P(Si|Si&#8722;1) can be estimated from the pairs in the Cartesian product defined over the features expressing sentences Si and Si&#8722;1: Assuming that the features are independent again makes parameter estimation easier.
