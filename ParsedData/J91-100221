systematic semantic way, it will be hard to represent the relationship in a traditional frame or semantic network formalism.
    Of the 16 nonsystematic semantic lexical chains given as examples in Halliday and Hasan (1976), 14 were found in Roget's Thesaurus (1977) using the relations given in Section 3.2.2.
    This represents an 87% hit rate (but not a big sample space).
    Word associations show a strong tendency to be findable in a thesaurus.
    Of the 16 word association pairs given in Hirst (1987), 14 were found in Roget's Thesaurus (1977).
    Since two of the word senses were not contained in the thesaurus at all, this represents a 100% hit rate among those that were.
    Situational word relationships are not as likely to be found in a general thesaurus.
    An example of a situational relationship is between car and lights, where the two words are clearly related in the situation involving a car's lights, but the relationship will not be found between them in a general thesaurus.
