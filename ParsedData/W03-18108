our, then the mutual information of this and the original multiword must be significantly different for the original multiword to be considered non-compositional.
    He evaluated this manually on a sample.
    As well as finding noncompositional multiwords, there were also a higher proportion of parser errors that met these criteria.
    Bannard et al. (2003) are investigating compositionality by looking at the contribution of the verb, and the particle to the semantics of the verb and particle combination; this follows on from Bannard's earlier work (2002) where he showed that compositionality judgements correlate with human judgements of similarity between the head verb and the verb and particle combination.
    Bannard et al. (2003) point out that Lin's method of using substitution of component words in a multiword with semantic neighbours is a good indication of productivity, but not necessarily of compositionality, since an institutionalised non-productive combination, such as frying pan would not have
