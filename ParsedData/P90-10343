    The stumbling block to any automatic use of distributional patterns has been that no sufficiently robust syntactic analyzer has been available.
    This paper reports an investigation of automatic distributional classification of words in English, using a parser developed for extracting grammatical structures from unrestricted text (Hindle 1983).
    We propose a particular measure of similarity that is a function of mutual information estimated from text.
    On the basis of a six million word sample of Associated Press news stories, a classification of nouns was developed according to the predicates they occur with.
    This purely syntax-based similarity measure shows remarkably plausible semantic relations.
  
  
    A 6 million word sample of Associated Press news stories was analyzed, one sentence at a time, by a deterministic parser (Fidditch) of the sort originated by Marcus (1980).
    Fidditch provides a single syntactic analysis -- a tree or sequence of trees -- for each se
