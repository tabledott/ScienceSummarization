e syntax of the logical formalism they cannot be ruled out as linguistically illformed.
    By contrast, QLF makes these violations semantically unevaluable.
    Unscoped Terms: When a term's index is not mentioned in any scope list, the term may be quantified in at any point within the formula.
    For anaphoric terms whose referent has been resolved to some individual constant, it does matter where the quantification rule is applied; since the term existentially quantifies over things identical to a single object, the scope of the quantification is immaterial.
    It is thus convenient to leave anaphoric terms like this unscoped in QLF.
    Although this makes the QLF look (syntactically) as though it is not fully resolved, semantically it is.
    For other unscoped terms, alternative applications of the quantifier rule may well lead to distinct truth conditions, and in these cases the QLF is genuinely unresolved.
    Context Dependence: Fully resolved QLFs are context-independent in the same sense that hol
