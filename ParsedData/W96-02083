ve normal form) learners (Mooney, 1995) and a decisionlist learner (Rivest, 1987).
    Tests on all methods used identical training and test sets, and ten separate random trials were run in order to measure average performance and allow statistical testing of the significance of any observed differences.
    On this particular task, we found that the Bayesian and perceptron methods perform significantly better than the remaining methods and discuss a potential reason for this observed difference.
    We also discuss the role of bias in machine learning and its importance in explaining the observed differences in the performance of alternative methods on specific problems.
    Research in machine learning over the last ten years has been particularly concerned with experimental comparisons and the relative performance of different classification methods (Shavlik &amp; Dietterich, 1990; Kulikowski &amp; Weiss, 1991; Langley, 1996).
    In particular, the UCI Machine Learning Data Repository (Merz, Murphy, &amp;
