 the measure of XLE performance.
    Performance parameters of both the Collins parser and the XLE system were adjusted on a heldout set consisting of a random selection of 1/5 of the PARC 700 dependency bank; experimental results were then based on the other 560 sentences.
    For Model 3 of the Collins parser, a beam size of 1000, and not the recommended beam size of 10000, was found to optimize parsing speed at little loss in accuracy.
    On the same heldout set, parameters of the stochastic disambiguation system and parameters for parsing performance were adjusted for a Core and a Complete version of the XLE system, differing in the size of the constraint-set of the underlying grammar.
    For both XLE and the Collins parser we wrote conversion programs to transform the normal (tree or fstructure) output into the corresponding relations of the dependency bank.
    This conversion was relatively straightforward for LFG structures (King et al., 2003).
    However, a certain amount of skill and intuition wa
