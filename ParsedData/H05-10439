INE distinguishes parts from properties using WordNet?s IS-A hi erarchy (which enumerates different kinds of properties) and morphological cues (e.g., ?-iness?, ?-ity?

			3.2 Experiments: Explicit Feature Extraction.
			In our experiments we use sets of reviews for 7 product classes (1621 total reviews) which include the pub licly available data sets for 5 product classes from (Huand Liu, 2004).
			Hu?s system is the review mining sys tem most relevant to our work.
			It uses association rulemining to extract frequent review noun phrases as features.
			Frequent features are used to find potential opinion words (only adjectives) and the system uses Word Net synonyms/antonyms in conjunction with a set of seedwords in order to find actual opinion words.
			Finally, opinion words are used to extract associated infrequent fea tures.
			The system only extracts explicit features.On the 5 datasets in (Hu and Liu, 2004), OPINE?s precision is 22% higher than Hu?s at the cost of a 3% re call drop.
