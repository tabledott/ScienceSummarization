ct seed words according to their discriminative power.
    The dimensionality of WoRM vectors we have chosen is not optimal.
    A high dimensionality of vectors is usually favorable (Gale &amp; Church 1994).
    On the other hand, high dimensionality can also lead to noise, Therefore, dimensionality reduction methods such as the Singular Value Decomposition (Shiitze 1992) or clustering is often used.
    In our case, this means that we should choose a large subset of highly discriminative seed word pairs.
    Additionally, the Word Relation Matrix could be used in combination with other word signature features for non-parallel corpora.
    In addition to the evaluation results, we have also discovered that the content words in the same segment with a word or term all contribute to the occurrence of this word.
    This feature represents some of the long-distance relations between the word and multiple other words which are not its immediate neighbors.
    The information can be used in language modeling in a
