oving polar atoms randomly.
    These lexicons had 0.8, 0.5, 0.2 times the polar atoms, respectively, compared to L. Table 9 shows the precisions and recalls using these lexicons for the learning process.
    Though the cd values vary, the precision was stable, which means that our method was robust even for different sizes of the lexicon.
    The smaller the initial lexicon, the higher the relative recall, because the polar atoms which were removed from L were recovered in the learning process.
    This result suggests the possibility of the initial lexicon (the digital camera domain). the bootstrapping method from a small initial lexicon.
    As seen in the agreement study, the polar atoms used in our study were intrinsically meaningful to humans.
    This is because the atoms are predicate-argument structures derived from predicative clauses, and thus humans could imagine the meaning of a polar atom by generating the corresponding sentence in its predicative form.
    In the evaluation process, some intere
