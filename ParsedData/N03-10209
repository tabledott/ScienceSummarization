t each vertical line with ranking given by different Ngram(1,4)n scores.
    The straight line (AvgC) is the human ranking and n marks summaries of different sizes.
    Ngram(1,4)all combines results from all sizes. instead of a precision one as pn.
    Since the denominator of equation 5 is the total sum of the number of n-grams occurring at the model summary side instead of the peer side and only one model summary is used for each evaluation; while there could be multiple references used in BLEU and Count&#65533;lip(n-gram) could come from matching different reference translations.
    Furthermore, instead of a brevity penalty that punishes overly short translations, a brevity bonus, BB, should be awarded to shorter summaries that contain equivalent content.
    In fact, a length adjusted average coverage score was used as an alternative performance metric in DUC 2002.
    However, we set the brevity bonus (or penalty) to 1 for all our experiments in this paper.
    In summary, the ngram co-occurrence stati
