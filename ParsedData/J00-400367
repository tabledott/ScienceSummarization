    As expected, the heuristics for recognizing unfamiliar uses (many of which are licensed by linguistic knowledge) achieve better precision than those for larger situation uses, which depend more on commonsense knowledge.
    Tables 14 and 15 summarize the results of the heuristics for discourse-new descriptions on the test data (Corpus 2).
    Again, the best results were obtained by the heuristics for recognizing unfamiliar uses.
    The biggest difference in performance was shown by the heuristic checking the presence of the definite in a copula construction, which performed very well on the training data, but poorly on the test data.
    The actual performance of that heuristic is difficult to evaluate, however, as a very low recall was reported for both training and test data.
    In the following sections, we analyze some of the problems encountered by the version of the system using these heuristics.
