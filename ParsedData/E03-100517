free parameter.
    A straightforward alternative would be to select the most probable tree from among the n simplest trees.
    We will refer to the first combination (which selects the simplest among the n likeliest trees) as Simplicity-Likelihood-DOP or SL-DOP, and to the second combination (which selects the likeliest among the n simplest trees) as Likelihood-Simplicity-DOP or LS-DOP.
    Note that for n=1, SL-DOP is equal to Likelihood-DOP, since there is only one most probable tree to select from, and LS-DOP is equal to Simplicity-DOP, since there is only one simplest tree to select from.
    Moreover, if n gets large, SL-DOP converges to Simplicity-DOP while LS-DOP converges to Likelihood-DOP.
    By varying the parameter n, we will be able to compare Likelihood-DOP, Simplicity-DOP and several instantiations of SL-DOP and LS-DOP.
    Note that Goodman's PCFG-reduction method summarized in Section 2 applies not only to Likelihood-DOP but also to Simplicity-DOP.
    The only thing that needs to be change
