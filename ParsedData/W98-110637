 development texts to generate the extraction patterns and the semantic lexicon.
    AutoSlog-TS generated 44,013 extraction patterns in its first pass.
    After discarding the patterns that occurred only once, the remaining 11,517 patterns were applied to the corpus for the second pass and ranked for manual review.
    We reviewed the top 2168 patterns5 and kept 306 extraction patterns for the final dictionary.
