lly, this article describes all the as-yet-unpublished details and features of Collins&#8217; model and some analysis of the effect of these features with respect to parsing performance, as well as some comparative analysis of the effects of published features.3 In particular, implementing Collins&#8217; model using only the published details causes an 11% increase in relative error over Collins&#8217; own published results.
    That is, taken together, all the unpublished details have a significant effect on overall parsing performance.
    In addition to the effects of the unpublished details, we also have new evidence to show that the discriminative power of Collins&#8217; model does not lie where once thought: Bilexical dependencies play an extremely small role in Collins&#8217; models (Gildea 2001), and head choice is not nearly as critical as once thought.
    This article also discusses the rationale for various parameter choices.
    In general, we will limit our discussion to Collins&#8217; Model 2,
