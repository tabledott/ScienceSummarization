th the combinatorial (sim) and the MI-based (simmt) models.
    Results for Lin's MI-based measure (simun) and the a-skew divergence measure (simasd) are also given and results are divided into those for high frequency nouns and those for low frequency nouns.
    Standard errors in the optimal mean similarities are not given but were of the order of 0.1.
    Our first observation is that the general framework using the MI-based model for precision and recall outperforms all of the other distributional similarity measures.
    We also observe that lower values of -y produce better results, particularly for low frequency nouns.
    For example, when -y = 1, similarity for low frequency nouns drops to 0.147 using the combinatorial model and 0.177 using the MI-based model.
    Third, from Figure 3, it appears that this WordNet prediction task favours measures which select high recall neighbours.
    Although optimum similarity for the combinatorial model occurs at ,8=0.5, similarity is always higher for lower val
