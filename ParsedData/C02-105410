			in the figure in dicates F-measures of our system trained by Kudo?s TinySVM-0.073 with S?*?Q?# . It attained 85.04% when we used only CRL data.

			According to this graph, ?SVM?
			is better than the other sys tems.However, SVM classifiers are too slow.
			Fa mous SVM-Light 3.50 (Joachims, 1999) took 1.2 days to classify 569,994 vectors derived from 2 MB documents.
			That is, it runs at only 19 bytes/sec.
			TinySVM?s classifier seems best optimized among publicly available SVM toolkits, but it still works at only 92 bytes/sec.
	
	
			In this section, we investigate the cause of this in efficiency and propose a solution.
