sing ten-fold cross-validation over sections 2-22.
    The results are shown in Table 3.
    Using the string of the connective as the only feature sets a reasonably high baseline, with an f-score of 75.33% and an accuracy of 85.86%.
    Interestingly, using only the syntactic features, ignoring the identity of the connective, is even better, resulting in an f-score of 88.19% and accuracy of 92.25%.
    Using both the connective and syntactic features is better than either individually, with an f-score of 92.28% and accuracy of 95.04%.
    We also experimented with combinations of features.
    It is possible that different connectives have different syntactic contexts for discourse usage.
    Including pair-wise interaction features between the connective and each syntactic feature (features like connective=alsoRightSibling=SBAR) raised the f-score about 1.5%, to 93.63%.
    Adding interaction terms between pairs of syntactic features raises the f-score slightly more, to 94.19%.
    These results amount to a
