uffixes. that have strong semantic correlations as being Due to the existence of morphological ambiguity (such as with the word &#8220;caring&#8221; whose stem is &#8220;care&#8221; rather than &#8220;car&#8221;), finding affixes alone does not constitute a complete morphological analysis.
    Hence, the last category of research is also knowledge-free but attempts to induce, for each morphological variants of each other.
    With the exception of word segmentation, we provided no human information to our system.
    We applied our system to an English corpus and evaluated by comparing each word&#8217;s conflation set as produced by our algorithm to those derivable from CELEX. word of a corpus, a complete analysis.
    Since our Most of the existing algorithms described focus on approach falls into this category (expanding upon suffixing in inflectional languages (though our earlier approach (Schone and Jurafsky, 2000)), Jacquemin and D&#233;Jean describe work on prefixes). we describe work in this area in mo
