ross all lecture datasets.
    We note, however, that after some point increasing the threshold degrades performance, because it introduces too many spurious dependencies (see the last column of Table 4).
    The speaker will occasionally return to a topic described at the beginning of the lecture, and this will bias the algorithm to put the segment boundary closer to the end of the lecture.
    Long-range dependencies do not improve the performance on the synthetic dataset.
    This is expected since the segments in the synthetic dataset are randomly selected from widely-varying documents in the Brown corpus, even spanning different genres of written language.
    So, effectively, there are no genuine long-range dependencies that can be exploited by the algorithm.
    Comparison with local dependency models We compare our system with the state-of-the-art similarity-based segmentation system developed by Choi (2000).
    We use the publicly available implementation of the system and optimize the system on a r
