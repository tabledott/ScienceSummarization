n TAGs, and that if that is done the head can be freely chosen.
  3 TAGs  and  lexical izat ion TAGs are naturally lexicalized because they used an ex- tended domain of locality.
  TAGs were first introduced by Joshi, Levy and Takabashi (1975) and Joshi (1985).
  For more details on the original definition of TAGs, we refer the reader to Joshi (1985), Kroch and Joshi (1985) or Vijay-Shanker (1987).
  It is known that Tree Adjoin- ing Languages (TALs) are mildly context-sensitive.
  TALs properly contain context-free languages.
  It is also possi- ble to encode a context-free grammar with auxiliary trees using adjunction only.
  However, although the languages correspond, the possible ncoding does not directly reflect the original context-free grammar since this encoding uses adjunction.
  Although adjunction is more powerful than substitution and could be used to simulate it, in recent linguistic work in TAG (Abeill~ 1988) substitution has been used in ad- dition to adjunction in order to obtain appropriate s
