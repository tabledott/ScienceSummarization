 a controlled language or any other presentational convention.
    This avoids the expense of initial training; it also means that presentational conventions need not be relearned when a knowledge base is re-examined after a delay of months or years.
    &#8226; Since the knowledge base is presented through a document in natural language, it becomes immediately accessible to anyone peripherally concerned with the project (e.g. management, public relations, domain experts from related projects).
    Documentation of the knowledge base, often a tedious and time-consuming task, becomes automatic.
    &#8226; The model can be viewed and edited in any natural language that is supported by the generator; further languages can be added as needed.
    When supported by a multilingual natural language generation system, as in DRAFTER-II, WYSIWYM editing obviates the need for traditional language localisation of the human-computer interface.
    New linguistic styles can also be added (e.g. a terminology suitable for n
