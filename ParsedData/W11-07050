  Sentiment Analysis of Twitter Data
  
    We examine sentiment analysis on Twitter data.
    The contributions of this paper are: (1) We introduce POS-specific prior polarity features.
    (2) We explore the use of a tree kernel to obviate the need for tedious feature engineering.
    The new features (in conjunction with previously proposed features) and the tree kernel perform approximately at the same level, both outperforming the state-of-the-art baseline.
  
  
    Microblogging websites have evolved to become a source of varied kind of information.
    This is due to nature of microblogs on which people post real time messages about their opinions on a variety of topics, discuss current issues, complain, and express positive sentiment for products they use in daily life.
    In fact, companies manufacturing such products have started to poll these microblogs to get a sense of general sentiment for their product.
    Many times these companies study user reactions and reply to users on microblogs.
