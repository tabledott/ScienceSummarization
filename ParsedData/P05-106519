s on the development set and test set, respectively.
    The grade 2 and 5 classifiers have the best performance, probably because grade 3 and 4 must be distinguished from other classes at both higher and lower levels.
    Using threshold values selected based on minimum cost on the development set, indicated by large dots on the plot, we calculated precision and recall on the test set.
    Results are presented in Table 4.
    The grade 3 classifier has high recall but relatively low precision; the grade 4 classifier does better on precision and reasonably well on recall.
    Since the minimum cost operating points do not correspond to the equal error rate (i.e. equal percentage of misses and false alarms) there is variation in the precision-recall tradeoff for the different grade level classifiers.
    For example, for class 3, the operating point corresponds to a high probability of false alarms and a lower probability of misses, which results in low precision and high recall.
    For operating points chos
