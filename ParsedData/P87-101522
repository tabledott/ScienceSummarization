t depends on the structural property that sentences can be built from a finite set of clauses of bounded structure as noted by Joshi (1983/85).
    The property of semilinearity is concerned only with the occurrence of symbols in strings and not their order.
    Thus, any language that is letter equivalent to a semilinear language is also semilinear.
    Two strings are letter equivalent if they contain equal number of occurrences of each terminal symbol, and two languages are letter equivalent if every string in one language is letter equivalent to a string in the other language and vice-versa.
    Since every CFL is known to be semilinear (Parikh, 1966), in order to show semilinearity of some language, we need only show the existence of a letter equivalent CFL Our definition of LCFRS's insists that the composition operations are linear and nonerasing.
    Hence, the terminal symbols appearing in the structures that are composed are not lost (though a constant number of new symbols may be introduced).
