    The alternative of randomized decisions offers increased paraphrasing power but also the risk of producing some non-fluent expressions; we could generate sentences like The dog chased a cat and A dog will chase the cat, but also An earth circles a sun.
    To sum up, defaults can help against knowledge gaps, but they take time to construct, limit paraphrasing power, and only return a mediocre level of quality.
    We seek methods that can do better.
  
  
    Another approach to the problem of incomplete knowledge is the following.
    Suppose that according to our knowledge bases, input I may be rendered as sentence A or sentence B.
    If we had a device that could invoke new, easily obtainable knowledge to score the input/output pair (I, A) against (I
