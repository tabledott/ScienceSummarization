 the features used.
    While lexical statistics are quite accurate on the data covered by observations in the training set, the sparsity of the data when conditioned on lexical items meant that combining features was the key to high overall performance.
    While the combined system was far more accurate than any feature obtained using P(fejpath) with threshold at .5.
    A total of 7681 constituents were identified as FEs, 8167 FEs were present in hand annotations, of which matching parse constituents were present for 7053 (86%). taken alone, the specific method of combination used was less important.
    We plan to continue this work by integrating semantic role identification with parsing, by bootstrapping the system on larger, and more representative, amounts of data, and by attempting to generalize from the set of predicates chosen by FrameNet for annotation to general text.
