			This differs from traditional WSD tasks, wherethe WSD target is a single content word.
			Sense val for instance has either lexical sample or all wordtasks.
			The target words for both categories of Sen seval WSD tasks are typically only content words?
			primarily nouns, verbs, and adjectives?while in thecontext of SMT, we need to translate entire sen tences, and therefore have a WSD model not only for every word in the input sentences, regardless of their POS tag, but for every phrase, including tokens such as articles, prepositions and even punctuation.Further empirical studies have suggested that includ ing WSD predictions for those longer phrases is akey factor to help the decoder produce better trans lations (Carpuat and Wu, 2007).
			4.2 WSD uses the same sense definitions as the.
			SMT system Instead of using pre-defined sense inventories, theWSD models disambiguate between the SMT trans lation candidates.
			In order to closely integrate WSDpredictions into the SMT system, we need to form
