  Enriching The Knowledge Sources Used In A Maximum Entropy Part-Of-Speech Tagger
  
    This paper presents results for a maximumentropy-based part of speech tagger, which achieves superior performance principally by enriching the information sources used for tagging.
    In particular, we get improved results by incorporating these features: (i) more extensive treatment of capitalization for unknown words; (ii) features for the disambiguation of the tense forms of verbs; (iii) features for disambiguating particles from prepositions and adverbs.
    The best resulting accuracy for the tagger on the Penn Treebank is 96.86% overall, and 86.91% on previously unseen words.
  
  
    There are now numerous systems for automatic assignment of parts of speech (&amp;quot;tagging&amp;quot;), employing many different machine learning methods.
    Among recent top performing methods are Hidden Markov Models (Brants 2000), maximum entropy approaches (Ratnaparkhi 1996), and transformation-based learning (Brill 1994).
