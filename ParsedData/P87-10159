de of a production can inherit the stack from the left-hand-side.
    Unbounded dependencies between branches are not possible in such a system.
    TAG's can be shown to be equivalent to this restricted system.
    Thus, TAG's can not give analyses in which dependencies between arbitrarily large branches exist.
    Steedman (1986) considers Categorial Grammars in which both the operations of function application and composition may be used, and in which function can specify whether they take their arguments from their right or left.
    While the generative power of CG's is greater that of CFG's, it appears to be highly constrained.
    Hence, their relationship to formalisms such as HG's and TAG's is of interest.
    On the one hand, the definition of composition in Steedman (1985), which technically permits composition of functions with unbounded number of arguments, generates tree sets with dependent paths such as those shown in Figure 6.
    This kind of dependency arises from the use of the composition
