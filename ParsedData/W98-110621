 set of texts that are irrelevant.
    The texts do not need to be annotated in any way.
    AutoSlog-TS generates the same simple extraction patterns that AutoSlog generates.
    Each pattern is activated by a keyword in a specific linguistic context.
    For example, one extraction pattern may be triggered by the word &amp;quot;murdered&amp;quot; in passive verb constructions, while a different extraction pattern may be triggered by &amp;quot;murdered&amp;quot; in active verb constructions.
    Each pattern extracts information from a syntactic constituent in the current clause: the subject, the direct object, or a prepositional phrase.
    AutoSlog-TS generates extraction patterns by making two passes over the corpus.
    In the first pass, AutoSlog-TS uses AutoSlog's heuristics in an exhaustive fashion to generate a set of patterns that collectively extract every noun phrase in the corpus.
    In the second pass, AutoSlog-TS computes statistics to determine which extraction patterns are most strongly corr
