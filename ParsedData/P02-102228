    The gazetteer lists are compiled into finite state machines, which can match text tokens.
    The semantic tagger consists of handcrafted rules written in the JAPE (Java Annotations Pattern Engine) language (Cunningham et al., 2002), which describe patterns to match and annotations to be created as a result.
    JAPE is a version of CPSL (Common Pattern Specification Language) (Appelt, 1996), which provides finite state transduction over annotations based on regular expressions.
    A JAPE grammar consists of a set of phases, each of which consists of a set of pattern/action rules, and which run sequentially.
    Patterns can be specified by describing a specific text string, or annotations previously created by modules such as the tokeniser, gazetteer, or document format analysis.
    Rule prioritisation (if activated) prevents multiple assignment of annotations to the same text string.
    The orthomatcher is another optional module for the IE system.
