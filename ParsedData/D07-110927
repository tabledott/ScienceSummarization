			LDAWN is different in that the categories are notan a priori concept that must be painstakingly annotated within WORDNET and require no augmenta tion of WORDNET.
			This technique could indeed be used with any hierarchy.
			Our concepts are the ones that best partition the space of documents and do the best job of describing the distinctions of diction that separate documents from different domains.
			6.2 Similarity Measures.
			Our approach gives a probabilistic method of using information content (Resnik, 1995) as a start ing point that can be adjusted to cluster words ina given topic together; this is similar to the Jiang Conrath similarity measure (1997), which has beenused in many applications in addition to disambigua tion.
			Patwardhan (2003) offers a broad evaluation of similarity measures for WSD.
			Our technique for combining the cues of topicsand distance in WORDNET is adjusted in a way sim ilar in spirit to Buitelaar and Sacaleanu (2001), but we consider the appearance of a single term t
