ger than |D|.
			In our implementation we sim ply check for the condition ?|Q| log |D| &lt; |D| to decide whether we should use double binary search or the merge algorithm.
			This check is applied in the recursive cases as well as for the initial inputs.
			Thevariable ? can be adjusted for performance.
			We de termined experimentally that a good value for this parameter is 0.3.
			5.3 Obtaining Sorted Sets.
			Double binary search requires that its input sets be in sorted order.
			However, the suffix array returnsmatchings in lexicographical order, not numeric or der.
			The algorithm of Rahman et al (2006) deals with this problem by inserting the unordered items into a stratified tree.
			This requires O(n log log |T |) time for n items.
			If we used the same strategy, our algorithm would no longer be sublinear.An alternative is to precompute all n-gram occur rences in order and store them in an inverted index.
			This can be done in one pass over the data.
