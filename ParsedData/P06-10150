  Espresso: Leveraging Generic Patterns For Automatically Harvesting Semantic Relations
  
    this paper, we present a weakly-supervised, general-purpose, and accurate algorithm for harvesting semantic relations.
    The main contributions are: i) a method for exploiting generic patterns by filtering incorrect instances using the Web; and ii) a principled measure of pattern and instance reliability enabling the filtering algorithm.
    We present an empirical comof various state of the art systems, on different size and genre corpora, on extracting various general and specific relations.
    Experimental results show that our exploitation of generic patterns substantially increases system recall with small effect on overall precision.
  
  
    Recent attention to knowledge-rich problems such as question answering (Pasca and Harabagiu 2001) and textual entailment (Geffet and Dagan 2005) has encouraged natural language processing researchers to develop algorithms for automatically harvesting shallow semantic
