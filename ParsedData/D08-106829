taset are 71.6 (precision), 68.4 (recall) and 70.0 (F1) for BNEWS, and 75.7 (precision), 69.2 (recall) and 72.3 (F1) for NWIRE.
    (Haghighi &amp; Klein (2007) did not report B3.)
    Due to license restrictions, we could not compare directly to Culotta et al. (2007), who reported overall B3-F1 of 79.3 on the formal test set.
    Tables 3 and 4 compare our system to two recent supervised systems, Ng (2005) and Denis &amp; Baldridge (2007).
    Our approach significantly outperformed Ng (2005).
    It tied with Denis &amp; Baldridge (2007) on NWIRE, and was somewhat less accurate on BNEWS and NPAPER.
    Luo et al. (2004) pointed out that one can obtain a very high MUC score simply by lumping all mentions together.
    B3 suffers less from this problem but is not perfect.
    Thus we also report pairwise resolution scores (Table 5), the gold number of clusters, and our mean absolute error in the number of clusters (Table 6).
    Systems that simply merge all mentions will have exceedingly low pairwise precisi
