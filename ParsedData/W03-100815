ining; Section 23 was the test set.
    Both parsers were trained on Sections 2 through 21.
  
  
    Because of the mismatch between the constituent structures of CCG and the Treebank, we score both systems according to how well they identify the head words of PropBank&#8217;s arguments.
    Table 2 gives the performance of the system on both PropBank&#8217;s core, or numbered, arguments, and on all PropBank roles including the adjunct-like ArgM roles.
    In order to analyze the impact of errors in the syntactic parses, we present results using features extracted from both automatic parser output and the gold standard parses in the Penn Treebank (without functional tags) and in CCGbank.
    Using the gold standard parses provides an upper bound on the performance of the system based on automatic parses.
    Since the Collins parser does not provide trace information, its upper bound is given by the system tested on the gold-standard Treebank representation with traces removed.
