ate this point we show in Table 4 five examples of consecutively generated sentences.
    Since these were not selectively drawn from a larger set, they accurately reflect the current performance level.
    We also used generation mode to construct a word-pair grammar automatically for the recognizer component of our VOYAGER system.
    To do this, over 100,000 sentences were generated, and word-pair links were established for all words sharing the same terminal category (such as [restaurant-namel, for all category-pairs appearing in the generated sentences.
    We could test completion by continuing until no new pairs were found.
    The resulting word pair grammar has a perplexity of over 70, in contrast to a perplexity of less than nine for the grammar used to construct it.
    This difference reflects the additional constraint of both the probabilities and the long-distance dependencies.
    At present, we have available at MIT two systems, VOYAGER and ATIS, involving specific application domains in which
