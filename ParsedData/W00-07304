appear in training data. known that there are mainly two approaches to extend from a binary classification task to those with K classes.
    First approach is often used and typical one &amp;quot;one class vs. all others&amp;quot;.
    The idea is to build K classifiers that separate one class among from all others.
    Second approach is pairwise classification.
    The idea is to build K x (K &#8212; 1)/2 classifiers considering all pairs of classes, and final class decision is given by their majority voting.
    We decided to construct pairwise classifiers for all the pairs of chunk labels, so that the total number of classifiers becomes 2221 2 = 231.
    The reasons that we use pairwise classifiers are as follows: For the features, we decided to use all the information available in the surrounding contexts, such as the words, their POS tags as well as the chunk labels.
    More precisely, we give the following for the features to identify chunk label ci at i-th word: (j = i-2, i-1, i, i+1, i+ 2) cj (j = i
