s (i,j) such that Suppose that the word &amp;quot;dog&amp;quot; occurs in sentences 50, 52, 75, and 200 of the English text, and &amp;quot;Hund&amp;quot; in sentences 40 and 180 of the German, and that the AST contains the pairs (50, 40), (52, 40), and (200, 180), among others, but not (75, 40).
    There are two sets that meet the requirements, namely {(1,1),(42)} and {(2, 1), (4, 2)}.
    The set 1(1,1), (2,1), (4, 2)} is excluded on the grounds that (1,1 ) and (2,1) overlap in the above sense&#8212;the first occurrence of &amp;quot;Hund&amp;quot; is represented twice.
    In the example, the similarity would be computed as 4+_2= 12, regardless of the ambiguity between (1,1) and (2,1).
    The result of the comparisons of the words in all of the sentences of one text with those in the other text is that the word pairs with the highest similarity are located.
    Comparing the words in a sentence of one text with those in a sentence of the other text carries with it an amortized cost of constant computationa
