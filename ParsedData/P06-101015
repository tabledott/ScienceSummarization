    The reciprocal rank is the reciprocal of the rank of the correct answer.
    For example, if the correct answer is ranked as the first, the reciprocal rank would be 1.0, whereas if it is ranked the second, it would be 0.5, and so forth.
    To evaluate the results for a set of English names, we take the mean of the reciprocal rank of each English name.
    We attempted to create a complete set of answers for all the English names in our test set, but a small number of English names do not seem to have any standard transliteration according to the resources that we consulted.
    We ended up with a list of about 490 out of the 600 English names judged.
    We further notice that some answers (about 20%) are not in our Chinese candidate set.
    This could be due to two reasons: (1) The answer does not occur in the Chinese news articles we lo
