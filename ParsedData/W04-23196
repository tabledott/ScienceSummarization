n Figure 2 as an illustration of some of the types of interactions we observe in the corpus.
    Audio files and additional sample excerpts are available from [16].
    In addition to the obvious high degree of overlap&#8212;roughly one third of all words are overlapped&#8212;note the explicit struggle for the floor indicated by the two failed floor grabbers (fg) by speakers c5 and c6.
    Furthermore, 6 of the 19 total utterances express some form of agreement or disagreement (arp, aa, and nd) with previous utterances.
    Also, of the 19 utterances within the excerpt, 9 are incomplete due to interruption by another talker, as is typical of many regions in the corpus showing high speaker overlap.
    We find in related work that regions of high overlap correlate with high speaker involvement, or &#8220;hot spots&#8221; [15].
    The example also provides a taste of the frequency and complexity of adjacency pair information.
    For example, within only half a minute, speaker c5 has interacted with speakers c
