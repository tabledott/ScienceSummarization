rpus-harvested adjective vectors play no role for us (their values would be constant across the training input vectors).
    A few considerations are in order.
    First, although we use a supervised learning method (least squares regression), we do not need hand-annotated data, since the target AN vectors are automatically collected from the corpus just like vectors for single words are.
    Thus, there is no extra &#8220;external knowledge&#8221; cost with respect to unsupervised approaches.
    Second, our approach rests on the assumption that the corpus-derived AN vectors are interesting objects that should constitute the target of what a composition process tries to approximate.
    We provide preliminary empirical support for this assumption in Section 5 below.
    Third, we have some reasonable hope that our functions can capture to a certain extent the polysemous nature of adjectives: we could learn, for example, a green matrix with large positive weights mapping from noun features that pertain to con
