omly permuted, with each permutation corre- sponding to one trial.
  For each trial, the first 200 con- texts of each sense were selected as training contexts.
  The next 149 contexts were selected as test contexts.
  The remaining contexts were not used in that trial.
  The 200 training contexts for each sense were combined to form a final training set (called the 200 training set) of size 1200.
  The final test set contained the 149 test con- texts from each sense, for a total of 894 contexts.
  To test the effect that the number of training examples has on classifier performance, smaller training sets were extracted from the 200 training set.
  The first 50 and 100 contexts for each sense were used to build the new training sets.
  The same set of 894 test contexts were used with each of the training sets in a given trial.
  Each of the classifiers used the same training and test contexts within the same trial, but processed the text differently according to the needs of the method.
