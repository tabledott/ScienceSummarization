			decoding (recall the example in Section 4, where we carried out the expansion for one input phrase).
			This means that the fundamental search algorithm does not change.However, we need to be careful about combina torial explosion of the number of translation options given a sequence of mapping steps.
			In other words,the expansion may create too many translation op tions to handle.
			If one or many mapping steps result in a vast increase of (intermediate) expansions, thismay be become unmanageable.
			We currently ad dress this problem by early pruning of expansions, and limiting the number of translation options per input phrase to a maximum n
