    Z&amp;C cannot be used directly either, because it requires NL-specific templates for building CCG grammars.
  
  
    We have presented A-WASP, a semantic parsing algorithm based on a A-SCFG that generates logical forms using A-calculus.
    A semantic parser is learned given a set of training sentences and their correct logical forms using standard SMT techniques.
    The result is a robust semantic parser for predicate logic, and it is the best-performing system so far in the GEOQUERY domain.
    This work shows that it is possible to use standard SMT methods in tasks where logical forms are involved.
    For example, it should be straightforward to adapt A-WASP to the NL generation task&#8212;all one needs is a decoder that can handle input logical forms.
    Other tasks that can potentially benefit from this include question answering and interlingual MT.
    In future work, we plan to further generalize the synchronous parsing framework to allow different combi
