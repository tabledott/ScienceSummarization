    Hobbs gets this correct as long as one is willing to accept that Everybody is really the antecedent of his.
    It seems to me that this might be an idiomatic use.
    ERROR CHAINING refers to the fact that once an algorithm makes an error, other errors can result.
    Consider: Sorry no luck.
    Expi: I bet IT's the stupid red thing.
    Exp2: Take IT out.
    Cli2: Ok.
    IT is stuck.
    In this example once an algorithm fails at Expi it will fail on Exp2 and Cli2 as well since the choices of a cospecifier in the following examples are dependent on the choice in Expi.
    It isn't possible to measure the effect of false positives, since in some sense they are subjective judgements.
    However one can and should measure the effects of error chaining, since reporting numbers that correct for error chaining is misleading, but if the error that produced the error chain can be corrected t
