Ministry, Airline, etc.).
    In MUC-7, the best combined precision score, 93.39%, was achieved by the system from LTG in Edinburgh (Mikheev, IVIoens, and Grover 1999), which doesn't use such knowledge sources.
    We used this system in a version of our prototype that only attempts to resolve bridging descriptions (Ishikawa 1998).
    3.
    If the NP is a definite description, the system applies to it the following tests.
    The first test passed by the definite (if any) determines its classification, and after that, the next NP is processed. compound nouns WordNet look-up If one of the three tests above succeeds the description is classified as bridging and the association between description and anchor indexes is asserted.
    The decision tree encoded by this algorithm is shown in Figure 3.
    Note that before trying to find an antecedent, the system executes a few tests for identifying discourse-new descriptions; in other words, the strategy adopted is: addition, definite descriptions that matched the
