plementary to Fox (2002), who wrote that her results &#8220;should be looked on as more of an upper bound.&#8221; (p. 307) As explained in Section 3, we modified all unreliable alignments so that they cannot increase the complexity measure.
    Thus, we arrived at complexity measurements that were underestimates, but reliably so.
    It is almost certain that the true complexity of translational equivalence is higher than what we report.
  
  
    Any translation model can memorize a training sentence pair as a unit.
    For example, given a sentence pair like (he left slowly /slowly he left) with the correct word alignment, a phrase-based translation model can add a single 3-word biphrase to its phrase table.
    However, this biphrase would not help the model predict translations of the individual words in it.
    That&#8217;s why phrase-based models typically decompose such training examples into their sub-biphrases and remember them too.
    Decomposing the translational equivalence relations in the train
