 (e.g.
    K) such as the ACE RDC task.
    For efficiency, we apply the one vs. others strategy, which builds K classifiers so as to separate one class from all others, instead of the pairwise strategy, which builds K*(K-1)/2 classifiers considering all pairs of classes.
    The final decision of an instance in the multiple binary classification is determined by the class which has the maximal SVM output.
    Moreover, we only apply the simple linear kernel, although other kernels can peform better.
    The reason why we choose SVMs for this purpose is that SVMs represent the state-of&#8211;the-art in the machine learning research community, and there are good implementations of the algorithm available.
    In this paper, we use the binary-class SVMLight2 deleveloped by Joachims (1998).
  
  
    The semantic relation is determined between two mentions.
    In addition, we distinguish the argument order of the two mentions (M1 for the first mention and M2 for the second mention), e.g.
    M1-ParentOf-M2 vs.
