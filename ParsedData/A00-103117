e tagger can emit multiple tags if the best tag is classified as unreliable.
    We use the Wall Street Journal as contained in the Penn Treebank for our experiments.
    The annotation consists of four parts: 1) a context-free structure augmented with traces to mark movement and discontinuous constituents, 2) phrasal categories that are annotated as node labels, 3) a small set of grammatical functions that are annotated as extensions to the node labels, and 4) part-of-speech tags (Marcus et al., 1993).
    This evaluation only uses the part-ofspeech annotation.
    The Wall Street Journal part of the Penn Treebank consists of approx.
    50,000 sentences (1.2 million tokens).
    Tagging accuracies for the Penn Treebank are shown in table 5.
    Figure 6 shows the learning curve of the tagger, i.e., the accuracy depending on the amount of training data.
    Training length is the number of tokens used for training.
    Each training length was tested ten times.
    Training and test sets were disjoint, resul
