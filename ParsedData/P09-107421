 handled by coreference resolution systems exhibit different properties.
    In linguistic theory, binding mechanisms vary for different kinds of syntactic constituents and structures.
    And in practice, empirical results have confirmed intuitions that different types of anaphora benefit from different classifier features and exhibit varying degrees of difficulty (Kameyama, 1997).
    However, performance 6Also, the first element of a coreference chain is usually non-anaphoric, but we do not consider that issue here. evaluations rarely include analysis of where stateof-the-art coreference resolvers perform best and worst, aside from general conclusions.
    In this section, we analyze the behavior of our coreference resolver on different types of anaphoric expressions with two goals in mind.
    First, we want to deduce the strengths and weaknesses of state-of-the-art systems to help direct future research.
    Second, we aim to understand why current coreference resolvers behave so inconsistently across da
