rases such as these almost al ways occur after the head verb.
			Conveniently, the Chinese Treebank uses the part of speech (POS) tag NT for temporal nouns.
			Thus, we use a rule whichstates that a preverbal NP will be repositioned af ter the sibling VP if there is at least one NT in the NP subtree.
			A similar rule might apply to locative NPS; however, there is no special POS tag in the Treebank marking locations,1 so we do not have a syntax-based reordering rule to handle locative NPs.QPs QP modifiers in verb phrases often corre spond to time-related concepts such as duration and frequency.
			Figure 4 shows an example verb phrase with a QP modifier, literally translating into ?many time injured.?
			Since temporal phrases almost alwaysoccur after the verb in English verb phrases, we han 1One can argue that NR (proper nouns) in that context are likely to be places.
			However, there also exist many exceptions, and so we decided not to exploit the NR tag.
