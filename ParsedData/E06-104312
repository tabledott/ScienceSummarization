he semantic properties of the noun.
    Pluralization While the verb constituent of a VNIC is morphologically flexible, the morphological flexibility of the noun relates to its referential status.
    A non-referential noun constituent is expected to mainly appear in just one of the singular or plural forms.
    The pluralization of the noun is of course also affected by its semantic properties.
    Merging the three variation types results in a pattern set, , of distinct syntactic patterns, given in Table 1.2 The second step is to devise a statistical measure that quantifies the degree of syntactic fixedness of a verb&#8211;noun pair, with respect to the selected set of patterns, .
    We propose a measure that compares the &#8220;syntactic behaviour&#8221; of the target pair with that of a &#8220;typical&#8221; verb&#8211;noun pair.
    Syntactic behaviour of a typical pair is defined as the prior probability distribution over the patterns in .
    The prior probability of an individual pattern is estimated
