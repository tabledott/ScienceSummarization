y related to the verb.
    This roughly parallels the argument/adjunct dichotomy but the distinction may not be drawn along the same lines as in the theoretic linguistics literature.
    These adjunct-like elements are labeled AR GM, followed by a secondary tag indicating the type of adjunct.
    For example, yesterday in those abovementioned sentences is not specific to the verb break and instead it applies to a wide variety of verbs.
    Therefore it will be marked as AR GM, followed by a secondary tag - TMP, indicating the temporal nature of this constituent.
    The secondary tags are effectively a global classification of adjunct-like elements.
    There are 12 secondary tags for ARCMs in the Proposition Bank: DIR, LOC, MNR, TMP, EXT, REC, PRD, PRP, DIS, ADV, MOD, NE.
    Some verbs require different sets of arguments for different senses, and accurately characterizing the semantic roles of their arguments necessitates first distinguishing these senses.
    For example, the verb &amp;quot;pass&amp;quot;
