ory or the Stack Editors (as in 7a).
    However, the string that is expunged by the Surface Copy Editor need not be dominated by a single node; it can be a sequence of unrelated constituents.
    For example, in (7b) the parser will not analyze the first if they as an SBAR node since there is no AUX node to trigger the start of a sentence, and therefore, the words will not be expunged by either the Category or the Stack editor.
    Such cases where the Surface Copy Editor must apply are rare, and it may therefore be that there exists an optimal parser grammar that would make the Surface Copy Editor redundant; all strings would be edited by the syntactically based Category and Stack Copy rules.
    However, it seems that the Surface Copy Editor must exist at some stage in the process of syntactic acquisition.
    The overlap between it and the other rules may be essential in learning.
    CATEGORY COPY EDITOR.
    This copy editor matches syntactic constituents in the first two positions in the parser's buffe
