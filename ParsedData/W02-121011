s essential, because they are the most frequently occurring words and have various central functions in the grammar.
    It is difficult, because one particle can fulfill more than one function and they can co-occur, but not arbitrarily.
    The Japanese grammar thus contains a type hierarchy of 44 types for particles.
    See Siegel (1999) for a more detailed description of relevant phenomena and solutions.
    Number names, such as sen kyuu hyaku juu '1910' constitute a notable exception to the general head-final pattern of Japanese phrases.
    We found Smith's (1999) head-medial analysis of English number names to be directly applicable to the Japanese system as well (Bender 2002).
    This analysis was easily incorporated into the grammar, despite the oddity of head positioning, because the type hierarchy of HPSG is well suited to express the partial generalizations that permeate natural language.
    On the other hand, number names in Japanese contrast sharply with number names in English in that they a
