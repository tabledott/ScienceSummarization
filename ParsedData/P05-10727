grammar should generate shorter paths from the predicate to dependent words in the sentence, and could be a more robust complement to the phrase structure grammar paths extracted from the Charniak parse tree.
    Gildea and Hockenmaier (2003) report that using features extracted from a Combinatory Categorial Grammar (CCG) representation improves semantic labeling performance on core arguments.
    We evaluated features from a CCG parser combined with our baseline feature set.
    We used three features that were introduced by Gildea and Hockenmaier (2003): Parallel to the hand-corrected TreeBank parses, we also had access to correct CCG parses derived from the TreeBank (Hockenmaier and Steedman, 2002a).
    We performed two sets of experiments.
    One using the correct CCG parses, and the other using parses obtained using StatCCG4 parser (Hockenmaier and Steedman, 2002).
    We incorporated these features in the systems based on hand-corrected TreeBank parses and Charniak parses respectively.
