 dropped out, an improvement of approximately 2% is obtained.
  That is to say, the mean for all substantive words increases fxom 66.9% to 69.0% (a = 3.8%), and the mean for polysemous words alone increases from 56.4% to 58.2% (o = 4.5%).
  We take these values to be our current best estimates of the perfor- manca of a most-frequent heuristic when a large database is avail- able.
  Stated differently: any sense identification system that does no better than 69% (or 58% for polysemous words) is no improve- ment over a most-frequent heuristic.
  THE CO-OCCURRENCE HEURIST IC  1 The criterion of correcmess in these studies is agreement with the judgment of a human reader, so it should be insu-uctive toconsider how readers do it.
  A readers judgments are made on the basis of whole phrases or sentences; enses of co-occurring words are allowed to determine one another and are identified together.
  The general rule is that only senses that suit all of the words in a sen- tence can co-oeeur; not only does word W. co
