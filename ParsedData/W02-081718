ng sense tagging.
    These initial set of tagged examples will then be used to train the two classifiers described in Section 3.2, and annotate an additional set of examples.
    From these, the users will be presented only with those examples where there is a disagreement between the labels assigned by the two classifiers.
    The final corpus for each ambiguous word will be created with (1) the original set of tagged examples, plus (2) the examples selected by the active learning component, sense tagged by users.
    Words will be selected based on their frequencies, as computed on SemCor.
    Once the tagging process of the initial set of 100 words is completed, additional nouns will be incrementally added to the Open Mind Word Expert interface.
    As we go along, words with other parts of speech will be considered as well.
    To enable comparison with Senseval-2, the set of words will also include the 29 nouns used in the Senseval-2 lexical sample tasks.
    This would allow us to assess how much the c
