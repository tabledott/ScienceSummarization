			We will need a small amount of termi nology from graph theory (Bolloba?s, 1998).
			Definition 2 (Bolloba?s, 1998, Ch 1 ?1) Let G = (V,E) be a graph, where V is the set of vertices (nodes) of G and E ? V ? V is the set of edges of G. ? Two nodes v1, vn are said to be connected if there exists a path {v1, v2, . . .
			, vn?1, vn} such that (vj , vj+1) ? E for 1 ? j &lt; n. ? Connectedness is an equivalence relation.?
			The equivalence classes of the graph G un der this relation are called the components of G. We are now in a position to define the senses of a word as represented by a particular graph.
			Definition 3 Let G be a graph of words closely related to a seed-word w, and let G \ w be the subgraph which results from the removal of the seed-node w. The connected components of the subgraph G \ w are the senses of the word w with respect to the graph G. As an illustrative example, consider the localgraph generated for the word apple (6).
