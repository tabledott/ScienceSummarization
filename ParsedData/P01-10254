man law texts.3 Due to the extraction strategy, the data are homogeneous and grammatically correct, i.e., there is (almost) always a grammatical dependency between adjacent adjectives and nouns in running text.
    Two human annotators independently marked candidate pairs perceived as &#8220;typical&#8221; combinations, including idioms ((die) hohe See, &#8216;the high seas&#8217;), legal terms (&#252;ble Nachrede, &#8216;slander&#8217;), and proper names (Rotes Kreuz, &#8216;Red Cross&#8217;).
