ze this bias, we also testedthe various methods only on event mentions an notated with two or more arguments and obtained similar results to those presented for all mentions.
			This further emphasizes the general advantage of using unary rules over binary rules.
			854 5.2 Analysis.
			Binary-DIRT We analyzed incorrect rules both for binary-DIRT and BInc by randomly sampling,for each algorithm, 200 rules that extracted incor rect mentions.
			We manually classified each rule ?l ? r? as either: (a) Correct - the rule is valid insome contexts of the event but extracted some in correct mentions; (b) Partial Template - l is only apart of a correct template that entails r. For exam ple, learning ?X decide?
			X meet?
			instead of ?X decide to meet ? X meet?; (e) Incorrect - other incorrect rules, e.g. ?charge X ? convict X?.Table 1 summarizes the analysis and demonstrates two problems of binary-DIRT.
			First, rela tive to BInc, it tends to learn incorrect rules for high frequency templates, and therefore extrac
