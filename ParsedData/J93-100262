 have developed such a heuristic technique for best-first search of the parse forest which, in practice, makes the recovery of the most probable analyses much more efficient (allowing analysis of sentences containing over 30 words).
    We noticed during preliminary experiments with our unification LR parser that it was often the case that the same unifications were being performed repeatedly, even during the course of a single reduce action.
    The duplication was happening in cases where two or more pairs of states in the graph-structured stack had identical complex categories between them (for example due to backbone grammar ambiguity).
    During a reduction with a given rule, the categories between each pair of states in a backwards traversal of the stack are collected and unified with the appropriate daughters of the rule.
    Identical categories appearing here between traversed pairs of states leads to duplication of unifications.
    By caching unification results we eliminated this wasted effort an
