In TBL, rules with different context information are used successively for solving different problems.
    We will use the same context information for all data.
    The optimal context size will be determined by comparing the results of different context sizes on the training data.
    Here we will perform four steps.
    We will start with testing different context sizes of words with their part-ofspeech tag.
    After this, we will use the classification results of the best context size for determining the optimal context size for the classification tags.
    As a third step, we will evaluate combinations of classification results and find the best combination.
    Finally we will examine the influence of an MBL algorithm parameter: the number of examined nearest neighbors.
  
  
    We have used the baseNP data presented in (Ramshaw and Marcus, 1995)2.
    This data was divided in two parts.
    The first part was training data and consisted of 211727 words taken from sections 15, 16, 17 and 18 from the W
