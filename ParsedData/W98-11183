    Given a tokenization of a test corpus and a set of n (for MUC-7, n = 7) tags which define the name categories of the task at hand, the problem of named entity recognition can be reduced to the problem of assigning one of 4n + 1 tags to each token.
    For any particular tag x from the set of n tags, we could be in one of 4 states: x_start, x_continue, x_end, and x_unique.
    In addition, a token could be tagged as &amp;quot;other&amp;quot; to indicate that it is not part of a named entity.
    For instance, we would tag the phrase [Jerry Lee Lewis flew to Paris] as [person_start, person_continue, person_end, other, other, location_unique].
    This approach is essentially the same as (Sekine et al., 1998).
    The 29 tags of MUC-7 form the space of &amp;quot;futures&amp;quot; for a maximum entropy formulation of our N.E. problem.
