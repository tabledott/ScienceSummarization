			A novel statistical language model and fundamental - gorithms for this model have been presented.
			SLTAGs provide a stochastic model both hierarchi- cal and sensitive to lexical information.
			They combiae the advantages of purely |exical models such ms N-gram distributions or Ilidden Markov Models and the one of ifierarchical modes as stochastic ontext-free gram- mars without their inhercnt limitations.
			The parame- ters of a SLTAG correspond to the probability of com- bining two structures each one associated with a word and therefore capture linguistically relevant distribu- tions over words.
			An algorithm for computing the probability of a sen- tence generated by a SLTAG was presented as well as an iterative algorithm for estimating the parameters of a SLTAG given a training corpus of raw text.
			Simi- larly to its context-free counterpart, he reestimation algorithm can be extended to handle partially parsed corpora (Pereira and Schabes, 1992).
