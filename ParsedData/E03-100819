to be had from the output of the LTAG parser.
    However, the results are not as dramatic as those reported in other co-training papers, such as Blum and Mitchell (1998) for web-page classification and Collins and Singer (1999) for namedentity recognition.
    A possible reason is that parsing is a much harder task than these problems.
    An open question is whether co-training can produce results that improve upon the state-of-theart in statistical parsing.
    Investigation of the convergence curves (Figures 3 and 4) as the parsers are trained upon more and more manually-created treebank material suggests that, with the Penn Treebank, the Collins-CFG parser has nearly converged already.
    Given 40,000 sentences of labelled data, we can obtain a projected value of how much performance can be improved with additional reliably labelled data.
    This projected value was obtained by fitting a curve to the observed convergence results using a least-squares method from MAT LAB.
    When training data is proje
