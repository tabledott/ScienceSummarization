r example, do signal CONTRAST relations.
    (In the RST corpus built by Carlson et al. (2001), 89 out of the 106 occurrences of &#8220;but&#8221; that occur at the beginning of a sentence signal a CONTRAST relation that holds between the sentence that contains the word &#8220;but&#8221; and the sentence that precedes it.)
    Our hope is that simple extraction methods are sufficient for collecting low-noise training corpora.
    In order to collect training cases, we mined in an unsupervised manner two corpora.
    The first corpus, which we call Raw, is a corpus of 1 billion words of unannotated English (41,147,805 sentences) that we created by catenating various corpora made available over the years by the Linguistic Data Consortium.
    The second, called BLIPP, is a corpus of only 1,796,386 sentences that were parsed automatically by Charniak (2000).
    We extracted from both corpora all adjacent sentence pairs that contained the cue phrase &#8220;But&#8221; at the beginning of the second sentence and w
