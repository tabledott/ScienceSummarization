   In particular, they have not leveraged advances in discourse-based anaphora resolution research in the 70s and 80s.
    Our work bridges this gap by realizing in a new machine learning framework ideas rooted in Lappin and Leass&#8217;s (1994) heuristic-based pronoun resolver, which in turn was motivated by classic salience-based approaches to anaphora resolution.
    Revealing the importance of adopting the right model.
    While entity-mention models have previously been shown to be worse or at best marginally better than their mention-pair counterparts (Luo et al., 2004; Yang et al., 2008), our cluster-ranking models, which are a natural extension of entity-mention models, significantly outperformed all competing approaches.
    This suggests that the use of an appropriate learning framework can bring us a long way towards highperformance coreference resolution.
    The rest of the paper is structured as follows.
