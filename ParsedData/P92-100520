 collection of 'resolution rules' in Alshawi 1990.)
    An important question is what to allow as possible expressions in the range of S. One observation is that as the range is widened, more NL resolution phenomena are covered.
    A rough summary is as follows:
  
  
    Viewed from a slightly different perspective, monotonic interpretation has a number of points of contact with Pereira's categorial semantics (Pereira 1990).
    Put briefly, in categorial semantics, semantic evaluation is represented as deduction in a functional calculus that derives the meanings of sentences from the meanings of their parts.
    Considerable emphasis is placed on the nature of these semantic derivations, as well as on the final results of the derivations (the 'logical forms' of sentences).
    One significant advantage of this approach is that constraints on legitimate scoping emerge naturally from a consideration of permissible derivations of sentence meaning, rather than arising artificially from syntactic constraints im
