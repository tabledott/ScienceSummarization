 using approximation with the F-distribution (Blyth, 1986).
    These criteria solve the problems in minimum frequency and scope of the polar atoms simultaneously.
    In the example of Table 6, the simple atom chiisai (ID=1) is discarded because it does not meet (18), while the complex atom chiisai +&#8212; bodii-ga (ID=3) is adopted as a positive atom. shikkari-suru (ID=2) is adopted as a positive simple atom, even though 10 cases out of 64 were observed in the negative context.
    On the other hand, todoku +&#8212; mokuyou-ni (ID=4) is discarded because it does not meet (17), even though n(a) i.e. always observed in negative contexts.
  
  
    First we propose a method of evaluation of the lexical learning. ments of 200 polar atoms.
    K=0.83.
    It is costly to make consistent and large &#8216;gold standards&#8217; in multiple domains, especially in identification tasks such as clauselevel SA (cf. classification tasks).
    Therefore we evaluated the learning results by asking human annotators to clas
