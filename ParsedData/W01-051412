to M. Topic boundaries are identified by the divisive clustering procedure in C99.
    A topic segment tk is defined by its start and end sentences, sz and si, or its range tk = [i, j].
    The number of intersentence similarity values in tk is O(tk) = Itk12, i.e.
    (j &#8212; j &#177; 1)2.
    The sum of the values in tk is /3(tk) = EzEt.1 k E.Ebk X Thus, the average inter-sentence similarity value for a segmentation T = {t,, ...,t} is defined as, The divisive clustering algorithm begins by considering the entire input document S as a coherent topic segment.
    This is partitioned into two segments T = ftl, t21 at a sentence boundary that maximises [IT, i.e. the most prominent topic boundary.
    The recursive procedure proceeds until S can no longer be subdivided.
    The optimal segmentation is signalled by a sharp change in [IT.
    For implementation details and optimisations, see (Choi, 2000a).
