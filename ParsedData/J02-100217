form distribution of false positives, the average penalty is k2, as described earlier.
    In general, in large enough segments, the penalty when the false positive is a distance d &lt; k from a boundary is d, and the penalty when the false positive is a distance d &gt; k from a boundary is k. Thus, for larger segments, the average penalty assuming a uniform distribution becomes larger, because there are more places in the segment that are at least k positions away from a boundary.
    The behavior at the edges of the segments remains the same, though, so the average penalty never reaches k. Now, consider what happens with smaller segments.
    Suppose we have a false positive in Segment A.
    As Size(A) decreases from 2k to k, the average false positive penalty decreases linearly with it, because when Size(A) decreases below 2k, the maximum distance any sentence can be from a boundary becomes less than k. Therefore, the A reference segmentation and five different hypothesized segmentations with different pr
