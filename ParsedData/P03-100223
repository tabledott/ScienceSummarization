ropBank/TreeBank, while the other (death) uses relatively unknown verbs, so we can also evaluate how well the system scales to verbs unseen in training.
    Table 3 lists the F-scores for the two domains.
    The first line of the Table lists the results obtained by the IE architecture illustrated in Figure 7(a) when the predicate argument structures were identified by the statistical model.
    The next line shows the same results for the inductive learning model.
    The last line shows the results for the IE architecture in Figure 7(b).
    The results obtained by the FSA-based IE were the best, but they were made possible by handcrafted patterns requiring an effort of 10 person days per domain.
    The only human effort necessary in the new IE paradigm was imposed by the generation of mappings between arguments and templette slots, accomplished in less than 2 hours per domain, given that the training templettes are known.
    Additionally, it is easier to automatically learn these mappings than to acquire
