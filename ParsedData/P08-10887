(tj) are maximally correlated.4 US and UT can be found by solving an eigenvalue problem (see Hardoon et al. (2003) for details).
    Then the maximum likelihood estimates are as follows: WS = CSSUSP1/2, WT = CTTUTP1/2, q'S =CSS &#8722; WSWS&gt; , and 'PT = CTT &#8722; WTWT&gt; , where P is a d x d diagonal matrix of the canonical correlations, CSS = |m |E(i,j)&#8712;m fS(si)fS(si)&gt; is the empirical covariance matrix in the source domain, and CTT is defined analogously.
    E-step To perform a conventional E-step, we would need to compute the posterior over all matchings, which is #P-complete (Valiant, 1979).
    On the other hand, hard EM only requires us to compute the best matching under the current model:5 We cast this optimization as a maximum weighted bipartite matching problem as follows.
    Define the edge weight between source word type i and target word type j to be are presented for other languages in section 6.
    In this section, we describe the data and experimental methodology used througho
