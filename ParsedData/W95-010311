h high overall counts.
    Another obvious method of combination, a simple average2, gives equal weight to the three tuples regardless of their total counts and does not perform as well.
    The cut-off frequencies must then be chosen.
    A surprising difference from language modeling is that a cut-off frequency of 0 is found to be optimum at all stages.
    This effectively means however low a count is, still use it rather than backing off a level.
    2eg.
    A simple average for triples would be defined as
  
  
    The figure below shows the results for the method on the 3097 test sentences, also giving the total count and accuracy at each of the backed-off stages.
    In an effort to reduce sparse data problems the following processing was run over both test and training data: These modifications are similar to those performed on the corpus used by [BR94].
    The result using this modified corpus was 84.5%, an improvement of 0.4% on the previous result.
