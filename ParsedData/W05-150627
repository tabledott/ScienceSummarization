and Discussion of Algorithms.
			The four algorithms, along with the 1-best Viterbi algo rithm and the generalized Jime?nez and Marzal algorithm, are compared in Table 1.
			The key difference between our Algorithm 3 and Jime?nez and Marzal?s algorithm is the restriction of top k candidates before making heaps (line 11 in Figure 6, see also Sec.
			4.3).
			Without this line Algorithm 3 could be considered as a generalization of the Jime?nez andMarzal algorithm to the case of acyclic monotonic hy pergraphs.
			This line is also responsible for improving the time complexity from O(|E| + |Dmax|k log(d + k)) (generalized Jime?nez and Marzal algorithm) to O(|E| + |Dmax|k log k), where d = maxv |BS (v)| is the maximumin-degree among all vertices.
			So in case k &lt; d, our algo rithm outperforms Jime?nez and Marzal?s.
	
	
			We report results from two sets of experiments.
			For prob abilistic parsing, we implemented Algorithms 0, 1, and3 on top of a widely-used parser (Bikel, 2004) and conducted experiments on p
