cratically decomposable) items of variable syntactic type in monolingual corpora.
    One interesting exception is Lin (1999), whose approach is explained as follows: The intuitive idea behind the method is that the metaphorical usage of a noncompositional expression causes it to have a different distributional characteristic than expressions that are similar to its literal meaning.
    The expressions he uses are taken from a collocation database (Lin, 1998b).
    These &#8220;expressions that are similar to [their] literal meaning&#8221; are found by substituting each of the words in the expression with the 10 most similar words according to a corpus derived thesaurus (Lin, 1998a).
    Lin models the distributional difference as a significant difference in mutual information.
    Significance here is defined as the absence of overlap between the 95% confidence interval of the mutual information scores.
    Lin provides some examples that suggest he has identified a successful measure of &#8220;compositional
