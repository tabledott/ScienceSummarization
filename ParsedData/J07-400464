ed over the chart.
    Two possible extensions, which we have not investigated, include defining dependency features which account for all three elements of the triple in a PP-attachment (Collins and Brooks 1995), and defining a rule feature which includes the grandparent node (Johnson 1998).
    Another alternative for future work is to compare the dynamic programming approach taken here with the beam-search approach of Collins and Roark (2004), which allows more &#8220;global&#8221; features.
    For estimating both the normal-form model and the dependency model, the following expectation of each feature fi, with respect to some model A, is required: where &#961;(S) is the set of all parses for sentence S, and &#955; is the vector of weights for A.
    This is essentially the same calculation for both models, even though for the dependency model, features can be defined in terms of dependencies as well as the derivations.
    Dependencies can be stored as part of the individual entries (conjunctive nodes) a
