    Fortunately, in case of PCFGs, the domain &#916;m can be described compactly with a polynomial number of linear constraints.
    Essentially, we need to enforce the condition that the expected proportions of parses having particular parts should be consistent with each other.
    Our marginals track constituent parts hA, s, e, ii and CF-rule-tuple parts hA &#8594; B C, s, m, e, ii The consistency constraints are precisely the insideoutside probability relations: where ni is the length of the sentence.
    In addition, we must ensure non-negativity and normalization to 1: &#181;i,r &#8805; 0; X &#181;i,A,0,ni = 1.
    A The number of variables in our factored dual for CFGs is cubic in the length of the sentence, while the number of constraints is quadratic.
    This polynomial size formulation should be contrasted with the earlier formulation in Collins (2004), which has an exponential number of constraints.
  
  
    We have reduced the problem to a polynomial size QP, which
