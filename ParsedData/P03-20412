ntics (Shieber and Schabes, 1990).
    Systems for summarization or paraphrase could also be trained on tree pairs (Knight and Marcu, 2000).
    Non-NLP applications might include comparing studentwritten programs to one another or to the correct solution.
    Our methods can naturally extend to train on pairs of forests (including packed forests obtained by chart parsing).
    The correct tree is presumed to be an element of the forest.
    This makes it possible to train even when the correct parse is not fully known, or not known at all.
  
  
    We make the quite natural proposal of using a synchronous tree substitution grammar (STSG).
    An STSG is a collection of (ordered) pairs of aligned elementary trees.
    These may be combined into a derived pair of trees.
    Both the elementary tree pairs and the operation to combine them will be formalized in later sections.
    As an example, the tree pair shown in the introduction might have been derived by &#8220;vertically&#8221; assembling the 6 elementa
