respondence between simple rewriting rules and transducers.
    Section 3 summarizes the mathematical tools that we use to analyze both rewriting and two-level systems.
    Section 4 describes the properties of the rewriting rule formalisms we are concerned with, and their mathematical characterization is presented in Sections 5 and 6.
    A similar characterization of two-level rule systems is provided in Section 7.
    By way of introduction, we consider some of the computational issues presented by simple morphophonemic rewriting rules such as these: According to these rules an underspecified, abstract nasal phoneme N appearing in the lexical forms iNpractical and iNtractable will be realized as the m in impractical and as the n in intractable.
    To ensure that these and only these results are obtained, the rules must be treated as obligatory and taken in the order given.
    As obligatory rules, they must be applied to every substring meeting their conditions.
    Otherwise, the abstract string iNpracti
