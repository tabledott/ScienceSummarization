  Machine Learning For Coreference Resolution: From Local Classification To Global Ranking
  
    In this paper, we view coreference resolution as a problem of ranking candidate partitions generated by different coreference systems.
    We propose a set of partition-based features to learn a ranking model for distinguishing good and bad partitions.
    Our approach compares favorably to two state-of-the-art coreference systems when evaluated on three standard coreference data sets.
  
  
    Recent research in coreference resolution &#8212; the problem of determining which noun phrases (NPs) in a text or dialogue refer to which real-world entity &#8212; has exhibited a shift from knowledgebased approaches to data-driven approaches, yielding learning-based coreference systems that rival their hand-crafted counterparts in performance (e.g., Soon et al. (2001), Ng and Cardie (2002b), Strube et al.
    (2002), Yang et al. (2003), Luo et al.
    (2004)).
