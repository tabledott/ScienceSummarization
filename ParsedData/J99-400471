s in CNF, avoiding the need to compute infinite summations.
    Jelinek and Lafferty (1991) showed how to compute some of the infinite summations in the inside semiring, those needed to compute the prefix probabilities of PCFGs in CNF.
    Stolcke (1993) showed how to use the same techniques to compute inside probabilities for Earley parsing, dealing with the difficult problems of unary transitions, and the more difficult problems of epsilon transitions.
    He thus solved all of the important problems encountered in using an item-based parser to compute the inside and outside values (forward and reverse inside values); he also showed how to compute the forward Viterbi values.
    The final area of work is in formal language theory and algebra.
    Although it is not widely known, there has been quite a bit of work showing how to use formal power series to elegantly derive results in formal language theory, dating back to Chomsky and Schiitzenberger (1963).
    The major classic results can be derived in this
