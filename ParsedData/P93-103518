ear in the transformation list more than once.
    One possible extension to the set of transformation types would be to allow for transformations of the form: add/delete a paren as many times as is possible in a particular environment.
    We also plan to experiment with other scoring functions and control strategies for finding transformations and to use this system as a postprocessor to other grammar induction systems, learning transformations to improve their performance.
    We hope these future paths will lead to a trainable and very accurate parser for free text.
