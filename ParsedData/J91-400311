proposition containing it (cf.
    Partee [1985] for discussion).
    A similar difficulty arises with the interpretation of scalar predicates such as fast in Example 9.
    Both the scale and the relative interpretation being selected for depends on the noun that the predicate is modifying. a. a fast typist: one who types quickly b. a fast car: one which can move quickly c. a fast waltz: one with a fast tempo Such data raise serious questions about the principles of compositionality and how ambiguity should be accounted for by a theory of semantics.
    This just briefly characterizes some of the techniques that have been useful for arriving at pre-theoretic notions of word meaning.
    What has changed over the years are not so much the methods themselves as the descriptive details provided by each test.
    One thing that has changed, however &#8212; and this is significant &#8212; is the way computational lexicography has provided stronger techniques and even new tools for lexical semantics research: see
