    We use relations and relation instances from Freebase, a freely available online database of structured semantic data.
    Data in Freebase is collected from a variety of sources.
    One major source is text boxes and other tabular data from Wikipedia.
    Data is also taken from NNDB (biographical information), MusicBrainz (music), the SEC (financial and corporate data), as well as direct, wiki-style user editing.
    After some basic processing of the July 2008 link export to convert Freebase&#8217;s data representation into binary relations, we have 116 million instances of 7,300 relations between 9 million entities.
    We next filter out nameless and uninteresting entities such as user profiles and music tracks.
    Freebase also contains the reverses of many of its relations (bookauthor v. author-book), and these are merged.
    Filtering and removing all but the largest relations leaves us with 1.8 million instances of 102 relations connecting 940,000 entities.
