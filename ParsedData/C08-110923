			For each case that the human rater judges to.
			be an error, check to see which sub-corpus itcame from.
			If it came from the ?OK? sub corpus, then the case is a Miss (an error that the system failed to detect).
			If it came from the ?Error?
			sub-corpus, then the case is a Hit (an error that the system detected).
			If the rater judges a case to be a correct usage and it came from the ?Error?
			sub-corpus, then it is a False Positive (FP).

			Forthe hypothetical data in Figure 1, these val ues are 600/750 = 0.80 for Hits, and 150/750 = 0.20 for FPs.
			Calculate the proportion ofMisses in the sample from the ?OK? sub corpus.
			For the hypothetical data, this is 450/1500 = 0.30 for Misses.
