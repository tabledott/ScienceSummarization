nd possibly capturing useful information that may not have been noticed by the human engineer.
    However, stochastic taggers have the disadvantage that linguistic information is captured only indirectly, in large tables of statistics.
    Almost all recent work in developing automatically trained part-of-speech taggers has been on further exploring Markovmodel based tagging (Jelinek 1985; Church 1988; Derose 1988; DeMarcken 1990; Merialdo 1994; Cutting et al. 1992; Kupiec 1992; Charniak et al.
    1993; Weischedel et al. 1993; Schutze and Singer 1994).
    Transformation-based part of speech tagging works as follows.'
    The initial-state annotator assigns each word its most likely tag as indicated in the training corpus.
    The method used for initially tagging unknown words will be described in a later section.
    An ordered list of transformations is then learned, to improve tagging accuracy based on contextual cues.
    These transformations alter the tagging of a word from X to Y iff In taggers base
