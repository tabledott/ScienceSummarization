pus only, as this corpus gave best translation scores.
			Figure-5 shows the results for all three structured query models, built from the first-best hypothesis (?1-Best?), the 100 best hypotheses list (?100 Best?), and translation lattice (?TM-Lattice?).
			Using these query models, different numbers of most similar sentences, ranging from 100 to 4000, where retrieved from the AFE corpus.
			The given baseline results are the best results achieved from the corresponding bag-of-words query models.
			Consistent improvements were observed on NIST and Bleu scores.
			Again, optimal interpolation factors to interpolate the specific language models with the background language model were used, which typically were in the range of [0.6, 0.7].
			Structured query models give most improvements when using more sentences for language model adaptation.
			The effect is more pronounced for Bleu then for NIST score.
