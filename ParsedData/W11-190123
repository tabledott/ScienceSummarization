ed by Bergsma and Lin (2006), for use during both training and testing.
    Following the recent CoNLL tradition, participants were allowed to use both the training and the development data for training the final model.
    In addition to resources available in the closed track, the open track, systems were allowed to use external resources such as Wikipedia, gazetteers etc.
    This track is mainly to get an idea of a performance ceiling on the task at the cost of not getting a comparison across all systems.
    Another advantage of the open track is that it might reduce the barriers to participation by allowing participants to field existing research systems that already depend on external resources &#8211; especially if there were hard dependencies on these resources.
    They can participate in the task with minimal or no modification to their existing system.
    Since there are no previously reported numbers on the full version of OntoNotes, we had to create a train/development/test partition.
