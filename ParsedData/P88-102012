    The enterprise was completely descriptive; no formal definition of the relations or justification for their completeness were given.
    However, the relations do include most of Hobbs's relations and support McKeown's schemas.
    A number of similar descriptions exist.
    The description of how parts of purposive text can relate goes back at least to Aristotle ((Aristotle Both Grimes and Shepherd categorize typical intersentential relations ([Grimes 75] and [Shepherd 26]).
