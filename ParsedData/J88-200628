 tensed clause Cb, its ET/RT configuration, and an existing event or situation entity Ea&#8212;that is, p(Cb,Ea,RTb) = Eb; and 3. there are (at least) three 13 functions&#8212;one, po, linking RTb to Ea itself, the other two (Pprep and .Bconseq) embodying parts of a tripartite ontology of events.
    In the next section, I will discuss constraints on the second argument to p(Cb,Ea,RTb)&#8212;that is, constraints on which entities in the evolving E/S structure the specification of a tensed clause can depend on.
    Recall from Section 2.2 that Sidner introduced the notion of a dynamically changing discourse focus (DF) to capture the intuition that at any point in the discourse, there is one discourse entity that is the prime focus of attention and that is the most likely (although not the only possible) specificand of a definite pronoun.
    In parallel, I propose a dynamically changing temporal focus (TF), to capture a similar intuition that at any point in the discourse, there is one entity in E/S structure
