    Next we present experimental results in &#167;4, followed by related work in &#167;5.
  
  
    This section describes a set of heuristic-based methods for determining the polarity of a sentimentbearing expression.
    Each assesses the polarity of the words or constituents using a polarity lexicon that indicates whether a word has positive or negative polarity, and finds negators in the given expression using a negator lexicon.
    The methods then infer the expression-level polarity using voting-based heuristics (&#167; 2.1) or heuristics that incorporate compositional semantics (&#167;2.2).
    The lexicons are described in &#167;2.3.
    We first explore five simple heuristics based on voting.
    VOTE is defined as the majority polarity vote by words in a given expression.
    That is, we count the number of positive polarity words and negative polarity words in a given expression, and assign the majority polarity to the expression.
    In the case of a tie, we default to the p
