 to build the specific language models, and on what granularity should this be done, i.e. what is a document in the information retrieval process.
			The paper is structured as follows: section 2 outlines the sentence retrieval approach, and three bag-of-words query models are designed and explored; structured query models are introduced in section 3.
			In section 4 we present translation experiments are presented for the different query.
			Finally, summary is given in section 5.
	
	
			Our language model adaptation is an unsupervised data augmentation approach guided by query models.
			Given a baseline statistical machine translation system, the language model adaptation is done in several steps shown as follows: ? Generate a set of initial translation hypotheses H = {h1 ?hn} for source sentences s, using either the baseline MT system with the background language model or only the translation model ? Use H to build query ? Use query to retrieve relevant sentences from the large corpus ? Build specific lan
