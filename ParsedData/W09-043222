tive examples from the negative ones.
    In addition to it, system tuning is much more complex because the number of features increases from 14 to 26.
    Finally, TMs and RMs estimated from synthetic data show to provide smaller, but consistent, contributions than the corresponding LMs.
    When English in-domain data is provided, BLEU% score increases from 22.60 to 28.10; TM and RM contribute by about 5% relative, by covering the gap from 27.83 to 28.10.
    When Spanish in-domain data is provided BLEU% score increases from 22.60 to 23.68; TM and RM contribute by about 15% relative, by covering the gap from 23.52 to 23.68 .
    Summarizing, the most important role in the domain adaptation is played by the LM; nevertheless the adaptation of the TM and RM gives a small further improvement.. Another set of experiments relates to the adaptation of the TM and the RM.
    In-domain TMs and RMs were estimated on three different versions of the full parallel EP corpus, namely EP, S&#175;E-EP, and &#175;SE-EP.
