y distributed points on the surface of an M-dimensional hypersphere with the hypersphere&#8217;s center.
    The center of the hypersphere is defined as the initial parameter set.
  
  
    As suggested in (Och, 2003), an alternative method for the optimization of the unsmoothed error count is Powell&#8217;s algorithm combined with a grid-based line optimization (Press et al., 2007, p. 509).
    In (Zens et al., 2007), the MERT criterion is optimized on N-best lists using the Downhill Simplex algorithm (Press et al., 2007, p. 503).
    The optimization procedure allows for optimizing other objective function as, e.g., the expected BLEU score.
    A weakness of the Downhill Simplex algorithm is, however, its decreasing robustness for optimization problems in more than 10 dimensions.
    A different approach to minimize the expected BLEU score is suggested in (Smith and Eisner, 2006) who use deterministic annealing to gradually turn the objective function from a convex entropy surface into the more complex risk
