e hierarchical Pitman-Yor language model in Section 3.
    In Sections 4 and 5 we give a high level description of our sampling based inference scheme, leaving the details to a technical report (Teh, 2006).
    We also show how interpolated Kneser-Ney can be interpreted as approximate inference in the model.
    We show experimental comparisons to interpolated and modified Kneser-Ney, and the hierarchical Dirichlet language model in Section 6 and conclude in Section 7.
  
  
    Pitman-Yor processes are examples of nonparametric Bayesian models.
    Here we give a quick description of the Pitman-Yor process in the context of a unigram language model; good tutorials on such models are provided in (Ghahramani, 2005; Jordan, 2005).
    Let W be a fixed and finite vocabulary of V words.
    For each word w E W let G(w) be the (to be estimated) probability of w, and let where the three parameters are: a discount parameter 0 &lt; d &lt; 1, a strength parameter &#952; &gt; &#8212;d and a mean vector G0 = [G0(w)]wEW.
