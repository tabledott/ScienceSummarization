 the human judges is .76, and the average agreement between ST and the humans is .75, or about 99% of the interhuman agreement!'
    One can better visualize the precision-recall similarity matrix by producing from that matrix a distance matrix, computing a classical metric multidimensional scaling (Torgerson 1958; Becker, Chambers, Wilks 1988) on that distance matrix, and plotting the first two most significant dimensions.
    The result of this is shown in Figure 7.
    The horizontal axis in this plot represents the most significant dimension, which explains 62% of the variation.
    In addition to the automatic methods, AG, GR, and ST, just discussed, we also added to the plot the values for the current algorithm using only dictionary entries (i.e., no productively derived words or names).
    This is to allow for fair comparison between the statistical method and GR, which is also purely dictionary-based.
    As can be seen, GR and this &amp;quot;pared-down&amp;quot; statistical method perform quite simi
