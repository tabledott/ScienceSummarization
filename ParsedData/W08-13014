graph representations (with labeled edges and nodes).
    Unlike many linguistic formalisms, excessive detail is viewed as a defect: information that users do not understand or wish to process detracts from uptake and usability.
    The user-centered design process saw the key goal as representing semantically contentful relations suitable for relation extraction and more general information extraction uses.
    The design supports this use by favoring relations between content words, by maintaining semantically useful closed class word information while ignoring linguistic decisions less relevant to users, and by not representing less used material about linguistic features such as tense and agreement.
    The SD scheme thus provides a semantic representation simple and natural enough for people who are not (computational) linguists but can benefit from NLP tools.
  
  
    The style of the SD representation bears a strong intellectual debt to the framework of LexicalFunctional Grammar (Bresnan, 2001), and,
