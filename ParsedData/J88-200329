the event only appears to be accidental: 39.
    In fifteen minutes, Harry accidentally spilled his coffee.
    A similar problem arises in connection with the following example: 40.
    John ran in a few minutes.
    The process expression John ran has to be changed into a culminated-process expression before combination with the in-adverbial is possible.
    One way in which the network in Figure 2 will permit the change from a process to a culminated process is if the context allows a culmination point to be associated with the process itself.
    General world knowledge makes this rather hard for a sentence like John ran, except in the case where John habitually runs a particular distance, such as a measured mile.
    If the in-adverbial had conveyed a specific duration, such as in four minutes, then the analysis would make sense, as Dowty has pointed out.
    However, the unspecific in a few minutes continues to resist this interpretation.
    However, another route is also possible for (40): the process
