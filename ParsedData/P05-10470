  A Semantic Approach To IE Pattern Induction
  
    This paper presents a novel algorithm for the acquisition of Information Extraction patterns.
    The approach makes the assumption that useful patterns will have similar meanings to those already identified as relevant.
    Patterns are compared using a variation of the standard vector space model in which information from an ontology is used to capture semantic similarity.
    Evaluation shows this algorithm performs well when compared with a previously reported document-centric approach.
  
  
    Developing systems which can be easily adapted to new domains with the minimum of human intervention is a major challenge in Information Extraction (IE).
    Early IE systems were based on knowledge engineering approaches but suffered from a knowledge acquisition bottleneck.
    For example, Lehnert et al. (1992) reported that their system required around 1,500 person-hours of expert labour to modify for a new extraction task.
    One approach to this problem
