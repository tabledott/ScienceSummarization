nts noise-robust tagger, bracketer and lemma- tizer training procedures capable of accurate system bootstrapping from noisy and incomplete initial projections.
  Performance of the induced stand-alone part-of-speech tagger applied to French achieves 96% core part-of-speech (POS) tag ac- curacy, and the corresponding induced noun-phrase bracketer ex- ceeds 91% F-measure.
  The induced morphological analyzer achie- ves over 99% lemmatization accuracy on the complete French ver- bal system.
  This achievement is particularly noteworthy in that it required absolutely no hand-annotated training data in the given language, and virtually no language-specific knowledge or resources beyond raw text.
  Performance also significantly exceeds that obtained by direct annotation projection.
