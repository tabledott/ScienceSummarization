han co-occurrences (bigram&gt;co-occur), less effective (bigram&lt;co-occur), and had no effect (bigram=cooccur).
    Table 2 shows that there is no clear advantage to using either bigrams or co&#8211;occurrence features in first order context vectors (PB).
    However, bigram features show clear improvement in the results of second order context vectors (SC).
    Our hypothesis is that first order context vectors (PB) represent a small set of bigram features since they are selected from the relatively small SENSEVAL-2 words.
    These features are very sparse, and as such most instances do not share many common features with other instances, making first order clustering difficult.
    However, second order context vectors indirectly represent bigram features, and do not require an exact match between vectors in order to establish similarity.
    Thus, the poor performance of bigrams in the case of first order context vectors suggests that when dealing with small amounts of data, we need to boost or enrich o
