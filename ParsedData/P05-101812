oherence assessment as a ranking learning problem.
    The ranker takes as input a set of alternative renderings of the same document and ranks them based on their degree of local coherence.
    Examples of such renderings include a set of different sentence orderings of the same text and a set of summaries produced by different systems for the same document.
    Ranking is more suitable than classification for our purposes since in text generation, a system needs a scoring function to compare among alternative renderings.
    Furthermore, it is clear that coherence assessment is not a categorical decision but a graded one: there is often no single coherent rendering of a given text but many different possibilities that can be partially ordered.
    As explained previously, coherence constraints are modeled in the grid representation implicitly by entity transition sequences.
    To employ a machine learning algorithm to our problem, we encode transition sequences explicitly using a standard feature vector no
