syntactic machine translation, we want to condition on crossing constituent boundaries, even if no constituents are skipped in the process.
  
  
    To understand the behavior of this model, we computed the standard alignment error rate (AER) performance metric.2 We also investigated extractionspecific metrics: the frequency of interior nodes &#8211; a measure of how often the alignments violate the constituent structure of English parses &#8211; and a variant of the CPER metric of Ayan and Dorr (2006).
    We evaluated the performance of our model on both French-English and Chinese-English manually aligned data sets.
    For Chinese, we trained on the FBIS corpus and the LDC bilingual dictionary, then tested on 491 hand-aligned sentences from the 2002 Hansards data from the NAACL 2003 Shared Task.3 We trained on 100k sentences for each language.
    We compared our model to the original HMM model, identical in implementation to our syntactic HMM model save the distortion component.
    Both models were init
