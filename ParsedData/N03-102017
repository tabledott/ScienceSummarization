weighted average of n-gram matches, Ngram(1,4), in the previous section.
    To examine how well the statistical significance in the automatic Ngram(i,&#65533;) metrics translates to real significance when human assessments are involved, we set up the following test procedures: A good automatic metric should have high recall and precision.
    This implies that if a statistical test indicates a significant difference between two runs using the automatic metric then very probably there is also a significant difference in the manual evaluation.
    This would be very useful during the system development cycle to gauge if an improvement is really significant or not.
