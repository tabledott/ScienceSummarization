s &amp;quot;similar enough&amp;quot; to the sense tag S key in SemCor.
    We experimented with three interpretations of &amp;quot;similar enough&amp;quot;.

    A compromise between these two is SiM(Sanswer, Skey) &gt; 0.27, where 0.27 is the average similarity of 50,000 randomly generated pairs (w, w') in which w and w' belong to the same Roget's category.
    We use three words &amp;quot;duty&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;interest&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;line&amp;quot; as examples to provide a rough idea about what sim(sanswer, skey) &gt; 0.27 means.
    The word &amp;quot;duty&amp;quot; has three senses in WordNet 1.5.
    The similarity between the three senses are all below 0.27, although the similarity between Senses 1 (
