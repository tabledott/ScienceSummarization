ressed in terminal symbols alone, with no references to non-terminals.
    This is very useful for processing because it is much easier for the parser to determine the presence or absence of terminals than of nonterminals.
    That is, it is easier for the parser to determine, for example, whether a word is an adj, than it is to decide whether a substring is an ADJS phrase.
    The simplification moves all references to ADJS to the left hand side, by subtracting from both sides, Grammars like ADJS will sometimes be referred to as a step, by analogy to a unit step function in electrical engineering.

    Computing the Power Series from the ATN This section will re-derive the power series for the unit step grammar directly from the ATN representation by treating the networks as flow graphs (Oppenheim 1975).
    The graph transformations presented here are directly analogous to the algebraic simplifications employed in the previous section.
    First we translate the grammar into an ATN in the usual way (W
