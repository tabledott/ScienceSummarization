 the game's purpose; in this case, the purpose is identified simply by the name of the game's initiating move.
    The second is some explanation of how games are related to each other.
    The simplest, paradigmatic relationships are implemented in computer-computer dialogue simulations, such as those of Power (1979) and Houghton (1986).
    In these simulations, once a game has been opened, the participants work on the goal of the game until they both believe that it has been achieved or that it should be abandoned.
    This may involve embedding new games with subservient purposes to the top-level one being played (for instance, clarification subdialogues about some crucial missing information), but the embedding structure is always clear and mutually understood.
    Although some natural dialogue is this orderly, much of it is not; participants are free to initiate new games at any time (even while the partner is speaking), and these new games can introduce new purposes rather than serving some purpose al
