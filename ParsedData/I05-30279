			Our system performed reasonably well on morphologically complex new words, such as ???
			(CABLE in AS) and ???
			(MUR DER CASE in PK), where ?
			(LINE) and ?(CASE) are suffixes.
			However, it over generalized to words with frequent suffixes such as ??
			(it should be ? ?
			?to burn some one?
			in PK) and ??
			(it should be?
			?to look backward?
			in PK).
			For the corpora that considered 4 character idioms as a word, our system combined most of new idioms together.

			One short coming of our system is that it is not robust enough to distinguish the difference between ordinal numbers and numbers with measure nouns.
			For example, ??
			(3rd year) and ??
			(three years) are not distinguishable to our system.
			In order to avoid this problem, it might require havin
