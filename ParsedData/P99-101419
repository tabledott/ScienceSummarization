n entailment represented by a common conjunct.
    This indexing method works as long as the labeling process produces different latent class labels for the different senses.
    The last tree in Fig.
    11 is the learned representation for the scalar motion sense of the intransitive verb increase.
    In our approach, learning the argument alternation (diathesis) relating the transitive increase (in its scalar motion sense) to the intransitive increase (in its scalar motion sense) amounts to learning representations with a common component Ri7 A increaser,.
    In this case, this is achieved.
  
  
    We have proposed a procedure which maps observations of subcategorization frames with their complement fillers to structured lexical entries.
    We believe the method is scientifically interesting, practically useful, and flexible because: 1.
    The algorithms and implementation are efficient enough to map a corpus of a hundred million words to a lexicon.
    2.
    The model and induction algorithm have fo
