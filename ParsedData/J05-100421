  For the WSJ text, there are frames for over 3,300 verbs, with a total of just over 4,500 framesets described, implying an average polysemy of 1.36.
  Of these verb frames, only 21.6% (721/3342) have more than one frameset, while less than 100 verbs have four or more.
  Each instance of a polysemous verb is marked as to which frameset it belongs to, with interannotator (ITA) agreement of 94%.
  The framesets can be viewed as extremely coarse-grained sense distinctions, with each frameset corresponding to one or more of the Senseval 2 WordNet 1.7 verb groupings.
  Each grouping in turn corresponds to several WordNet 1.7 senses (Palmer, Babko-Malaya, and Dang 2004).
