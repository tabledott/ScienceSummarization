efined as follows: ? If e ? BS (v) with |e| = 0, then D = ?e, ??
			is a derivation of v, its size |D| = 1, and its weight w(D) = f (e)().
			If e ? BS (v) where |e| &gt; 0 and Di is a derivation of Ti(e) for 1 ? i ? |e|, then D = ?e,D1 ? ?
			?D|e|?
			is a derivation of v, its size |D| = 1 + ?|e|i=1 |Di| and itsweight w(D) = f (e)(w(D1), . . .
			,w(D|e|)).
			The ordering on weights in R induces an ordering on derivations: D ? D? iff w(D) ? w(D?).
			Definition 6.
			Define Di(v) to be the ith-best derivation of v. We can think of D1(v), . . .
			,Dk(v) as the components of a vector we shall denote by D(v).
			The k-best derivationsproblem for hypergraphs, then, is to find D(t) given a hy pergraph ?V, E, t,R?.
			With the derivations thus ranked, we can introduce anonrecursive representation for derivations that is analogous to the use of back-pointers in parser implementa tion.
			Definition 7.
			A derivation with back-pointers (dbp) D?
			of v is a tuple ?e, j?
			such that e ? BS(v), and j ? {1, 2, . .
