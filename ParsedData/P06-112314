    After modifying the alignments and obtaining monolingual parse trees, we measured the alignment complexity of each bitext using a hierarchical alignment algorithm, as described in Section 2.
    Separate measurements were taken with zero, one, and two constraining parse trees.
    The synchronous parser in the GenPar toolkit4 can be configured for all of these cases (Burbank et al., 2005).
    Unlike Fox (2002) and Galley et al. (2004), we measured failure rates per corpus rather than per sentence pair or per node in a constraining tree.
    This design was motivated by the observation that if a translation model cannot correctly model a certain word alignment, then it is liable to make incorrect inferences about arbitrary parts of that alignment, not just the particular word links involved in a complex pattern.
    The failure rates we report represent lower bounds on the fraction of training data that is susceptible to misinterpretation by overconstrained translation models.
