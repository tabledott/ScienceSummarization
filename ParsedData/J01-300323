    We therefore expect that it will be less common for the same noun to occur in subject and object position across instances of the same object-drop verb.
    Thus, we hypothesize that this pattern of thematic role assignments will be reflected in a differential amount of usage across the classes of the same nouns as subjects and objects for a given verb.
    Generally, we would expect that causative verbs (in our case, the unergative and unaccusative verbs) would have a greater degree of overlap of nouns in subject and object position than non-causative transitive verbs (in our case, the object-drop verbs).
    However, since the causative is a transitive use, and the transitive use of unergatives is expected to be rare (see above), we do not expect unergatives to exhibit a high degree of detectable overlap in a corpus.
    Thus, this overlap of subjects and objects should primarily distinguish unaccusatives (predicted to have high overlap of subjects and objects) from the other two classes (each of w
