ies, and the solution is systematically stated in terms of a uniform translation mapping  and a handful of simple lexical-semantic parameters.
  In addition, the for- malization allows one to make an evaluation of the status of the system.
  For example, given the formal description of the interlingua nd target-language root words, one is able to judge whether a particular target-language s ntence fully covers the concept that underlies the corresponding source-language s ntence.
  Finally, the formalization of the divergence types and the associated solution allows one to prove certain proper- ties about the system.
  For example, one might want to determine whether the system is able to handle two or more simultaneous divergences that interact in some way.
  With the mechanism of the current approach, one is able to prove formally that such cases are handled in a uniform fashion.
  This paper will focus on the problem of lexical-semantic divergences and will provide support for the view that it is possible
