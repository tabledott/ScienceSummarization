he Shared Task (Haji&#711;c et al., 2009), but for better comparison with previous work we also report results for the standard benchmark data sets for Chinese and English.
    For Chinese, this is the Penn Chinese Treebank 5.1 (CTB5), converted with the head-finding rules and conversion tools of Zhang and Clark (2008), and with the same split as in Zhang and Clark (2008) and Li et al. (2011).3 For English, this is the WSJ section of the Penn Treebank, converted with the head-finding rules of Yamada and Matsumoto (2003) and the labeling rules of Nivre (2006).4 In order to assign k-best part-of-speech tags and scores to words in the training set, we used a perceptron tagger with 10-fold jack-knifing.
    The same type of tagger was trained on the entire training set in order to supply tags for the development and test sets.
    The feature set of the tagger was optimized for English and German and provides state-of-theart accuracy for these two languages.
    The 1-best tagging accuracy for section 23 of the P
