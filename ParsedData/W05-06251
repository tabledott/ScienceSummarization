, the goal of pruning and argument identification is to identify argument candidates for a given verb predicate.
    The system only classifies the argument candidates into their types during the argument classification stage.
    Linguistic and structural constraints are incorporated in the inference stage to resolve inconsistent global predictions.
    The inference stage can take as its input the output of the argument classification of a single system or of multiple systems.
    We explain the inference for multiple systems in Sec.
    2.
    Only the constituents in the parse tree are considered as argument candidates.
    In addition, our system exploits the heuristic introduced by (Xue and Palmer, 2004) to filter out very unlikely constituents.
    The heuristic is a recursive process starting from the verb whose arguments are to be identified.
    It first returns the siblings of the verb; then it moves to the parent of the verb, and collects the siblings again.
    The process goes on until it reache
