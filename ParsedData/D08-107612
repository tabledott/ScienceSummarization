r changes the number of line segments nor their relative order in the envelope, and therefore it preserves the structure of the convex hull.
    As a consequence, we can propagate the resulting envelope over an outgoing arc E to a successor node v1~' = headp(E).
    Other incoming arcs for v1may be associated with different upper envelopes, and all that remains is to merge these envelopes into a single combined envelope.
    This is, however, easy to accomplish since the combined envelope is simply the convex hull of the union over the line sets which constitute the individual envelopes.
    Thus, by merging the arrays that store the line segments for the incoming arcs and applying Algorithm 1 to the resulting array we obtain the combined upper envelope for all partial translation candidates that are associated with paths starting at the source node s and ending in v1.
    The correctness of this procedure is based on the following two observations: again.
    Proof: Suppose that such a continuation exists, t
