nces of the same Cb cohere even better when there is a certain degree of grammatical parallelism.
    Analogous constraints account for at least two other kinds of parallelism effects on pronoun interpretation in English.
    They are in the context of what I call the Cb-establishment, that is, the process in which a previous non-Cb becomes the Cb.
    The case of Cb-shift is a subcase of Cb-establishment.15 Ambiguous multi-pronouns.
    The first is the interpretation of a multi-pronominal utterance that establishes a Cb.
    An example follows: (17) shows that when two pronouns are potentially ambiguous in reference, the preferred interpretation conforms to a property-sharing constraint.
    That is, there is a higher tendency that the SUBJECT pronoun corefers with the SUBJECT of the previous utterance.
    It is crucial here that (a) there is more than one pronoun and (b) two (or more) of them are potentially ambiguous (i.e., of the same grammatical features).
    Otherwise, the process of Cb-establishment
