onstituent if and are part of a phrasal translation in alignment otherwise phrasal translation filtering has a much larger effect (reducing head average to 2.772 and modifier average to 0.516).
    Phrasal translations account for almost half of all crossings, on average.
    This effect is even more pronounced in the case where we use P alignments only.
    This reinforces the importance of phrasal translation in the development of any translation system.
    Even after filtering, the number of crossings in the S P case is quite large.
    This is discouraging, however there are reasons why this result should be looked on as more of an upper bound than anything precise.
    For one thing, there are cases of phrasal translation which our heuristic fails to recognize, an example of which is shown in Figure 3.
    The alignment of &#8220;explorer&#8221; with &#8220;this&#8221; and &#8220;matter&#8221; seems to indicate that the intention of the annotator was to align the phrase &#8220;work this matter out&#8221
