nfinite) number of SUBGs that can be constructed from it, differing only in the features that each SUBG uses.
    In addition to production features, the stochastic LFG models evaluated below used the following kinds of features, guided by the principles proposed by Hobbs and Bear (1995).
    Adjunct and argument features indicate adjunct and argument attachment respectively, and permit the model to capture a general argument attachment preference.
    In addition, there are specialized adjunct and argument features corresponding to each grammatical function used in LFG (e.g., SUBJ, OBJ, COMP, XCOMP, ADJUNCT, etc.).
    There are features indicating both high and low attachment (determined by the complexity of the phrase being attached to).
    Another feature indicates nonright-branching nonterminal nodes.
    There is a feature for non-parallel coordinate structures (where parallelism is measured in constituent structure terms).
    Each f-structure attributeatomic value pair which appears in any feature st
