ing, we performed up to 30 iterations and chose the iteration which optimized accuracy on the development set.
    Our feature mappings are quite high-dimensional, so we eliminated all features which occur only once in the training data.
    The resulting models still had very high dimensionality, ranging from tens of millions to as many as a billion features.12 All results presented in this section are given in terms of parent-prediction accuracy, which measures the percentage of tokens that are attached to the correct head token.
    For labeled dependency structures, both the head token and dependency label must be correctly predicted.
    In addition, in English parsing we ignore the parent-predictions of punctuation tokens,13 and in Czech parsing we retain the punctuation tokens; this matches previous work (Yamada and Matsumoto, 2003; McDonald et al., 2005a; McDonald and Pereira, 2006).
    In our English experiments, we tested eight different parsing configurations, representing all possible choices bet
