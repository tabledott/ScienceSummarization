t set of 1.5-2 x 108 words.
    Accuracy is consistent across these corpora and tag sets.
    In addition to obtaining high rates of accuracy and representing relevant linguistic information in a small set of rules, the part-of-speech tagger can also be made to run extremely fast.
    Roche and Schabes (1995) show a method for converting a list of tagging transformations into a deterministic finite state transducer with one state transition taken per word of input; the result is a transformation-based tagger whose tagging speed is about ten times that of the fastest Markov-model tagger.
    There are certain circumstances where one is willing to relax the one-tag-per-word requirement in order to increase the probability that the correct tag will be assigned to each word.
    In DeMarcken (1990) and Weischedel et al. (1993), k-best tags are assigned within a stochastic tagger by returning all tags within some threshold of probability of being correct for a particular word.
    We can modify the transformation-
