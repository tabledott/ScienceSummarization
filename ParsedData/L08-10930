		This paper deals with the relationship between weblog content and time.
		With the proposed temporal mutual information, we analyze the collocations in time dimension, and the interesting collocations related to special events.
		The temporal mutual information is employed to observe the strength of term-to-term associations over time.
		An event detection algorithm identifies the collocations that may cause an event in a specific timestamp.
		An event summarization algorithm retrieves a set of collocations which describe an event.
		We compare our approach with the approach without considering the time interval.
		The experimental results demonstrate that the temporal collocations capture the real world semantics and real world events over time.

			Compared with traditional media such as online news and enterprise websites, weblogs have several unique characteristics, e.g., containing abundant life experiences and public opinions toward different topics, hig
