    The segmentation task reported here is not properly a classification task, in that we do not presume that there is a given set of segment boundaries that subjects are likely to identify.
    Given the freedom of the task and the use of untrained subjects, a reliability test would be relatively uninformative: it can be expected to range from very low to very high.
    In fact, sorting the 140 subjects into comparable pairs (i.e., subjects assigning a similar number of boundaries), a reliability metric that ranges between 1 for perfect reliability and &#8212;1 for perfect unreliability (Krippendorff's a, discussed below) gives a wide spread of reliability values (from &#8212;.3 to .9; average = .34).
    Our method aims at abstracting away from the absolute differences across multiple subjects per narrative (N = 7) to derive a statistically significant set of segment boundaries.
    Thus, an appropriate test of whether our method is statistically reliable would be to compare two repetitions of the
