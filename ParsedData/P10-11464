 Figure 2 does not reflect a very deep fact about syntax or crosslingual divergences, but rather choices in annotation style that interact badly with the exact treeto-tree extraction heuristic.
    On the Chinese side, the IP is too flat (because &#21488;&#28286;/T&#225;iw&#257;n has been analyzed as a topic), whereas the more articulated structure would also be quite reasonable.
    On the English side, the high attachment of the PP disagrees with the corresponding Chinese structure, but low attachment also seems reasonable: Thus even in the gold-standard parse trees, phrase structure can be underspecified (like the flat IP above) or uncertain (like the PP attachment above).
    For this reason, some approaches work with a more flexible notion of constituency.
    Synchronous tree-sequence&#8211;substitution grammar (STSSG) allows either side of a rule to comprise a sequence of trees instead of a single tree (Zhang et al., 2008).
    In the substitution operation, a sequence of sister substitution nodes is r
