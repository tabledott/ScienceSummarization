 instances of nonliteral language and because knowing that an expression can be used nonliterally does not mean that you can tell when it is being used nonliterally.
    The target verbs may not, and typically do not, appear in the feedback sets.
    In addition, the feedback sets are noisy and not annotated by any human, which is why we call TroFi unsupervised.
    When we use WordNet as a source of example sentences, or of seed words for pulling sentences out of the WSJ, for building the literal feedback set, we cannot tell if the WordNet synsets, or the collected feature sets, are actually literal.
    We provide some automatic methods in Section 3.3 to ensure that the feedback set feature sets that will harm us in the clustering phase are removed.
    As a sideeffect, we may fill out sparse nonliteral sets.
    In the next section we look at the Core TroFi algorithm and its use of the above data sources.
    Since we are attempting to reduce the problem of literal/nonliteral recognition to one of word-sen
