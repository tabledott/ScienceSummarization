ally flexible.
    For example, the idiom shoot the breeze undergoes verbal inflection (shot the breeze), but not internal modification or passivization (?shoot the fun breeze, ?the breeze was shot).
    In contrast, the idiom spill the beans undergoes verbal inflection, internal modification, and even passivization.
    Clearly, a words-withspaces approach does not capture the full range of behaviour of such idiomatic expressions.
    Another barrier to the appropriate handling of idioms in a computational system is their semantic idiosyncrasy.
    This is a particular issue for those idioms that conform to the grammar rules of the language.
    Such idiomatic expressions are indistinguishable on the surface from compositional (nonidiomatic) phrases, but a computational system must be capable of distinguishing the two.
    For example, a machine translation system should translate the idiom shoot the breeze as a single unit of meaning (&#8220;to chat&#8221;), whereas this is not the case for the literal phra
