  This would make the statistical data concerning trigrams of head&#8212;preposition&#8212;head less sparse (cf.
    Gale and Church 1990) and easier to gather from a corpus.
    Nevertheless, it will only be possible to gather such data from determinately syntactically analyzed material.
    The third problem of dealing usefully with examples outside the coverage of the grammar even after training is not addressed by the system we have developed.
    Nevertheless, the results of the preliminary experiment for unseen examples indicate that it is a significant problem, at least with respect to lexical entries.
    A large part of the problem with such examples is identifying them automatically.
    Some such examples will not receive any parse and will, therefore, be easy to spot.
    Many, though, will receive incorrect parses (one of which will be automatically ranked as the most probable) and can, therefore, only be identified manually (or perhaps on the basis of relative improbability).
