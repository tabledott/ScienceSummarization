    These features and their computation are described below.
    Our paraphrase features include lexical and syntactic descriptions of the paraphrase pair.
    The lexical feature set consists of the sequence of tokens for each phrase in the paraphrase pair; the syntactic feature set consists of a sequence of part-of-speech tags where equal words and words with the same root are marked.
    For example, the value of the syntactic feature for the pair (&#8220;the vast chimney&#8221;, &#8220;the chimney&#8221;) is (&#8220;DT JJ NN &#8221;, &#8220;DT NN &#8221;), where indices indicate word equalities.
    We believe that this feature can be useful for two reasons: first, we expect that some syntactic categories can not be paraphrased in another syntactic category.
    For example, a determiner is unlikely to be a paraphrase of a verb.
    Second, this description is able to capture regularities in phrase level paraphrasing.
    In fact, a similar representation was used by (Jacquemin et al., 1997) to des
