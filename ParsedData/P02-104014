deration remains: if we computed the brevity penalty sentence by sentence and averaged the penalties, then length deviations on short sentences would be punished harshly.
    Instead, we compute the brevity penalty over the entire corpus to allow some freedom at the sentence level.
    We first compute the test corpus&#8217; effective reference length, r, by summing the best match lengths for each candidate sentence in the corpus.
    We choose the brevity penalty to be a decaying exponential in r/c, where c is the total length of the candidate translation corpus.
    We take the geometric mean of the test corpus&#8217; modified precision scores and then multiply the result by an exponential brevity penalty factor.
    Currently, case folding is the only text normalization performed before computing the precision.
    We first compute the geometric average of the modified n-gram precisions, pn, using n-grams up to length N and positive weights wn summing to one.
    Next, let c be the length of the candidate
