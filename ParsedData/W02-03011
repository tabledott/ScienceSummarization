wledge provided in the form of natural language, e.g., journal papers, there is a strong demand for biomedical information extraction (IE), which extracts knowledge automatically from biomedical papers using NLP techniques (Ohta et al., 1997; Proux et al., 2000; Yakushiji et al., 2001).
    The process called named entity recognition, which finds entities that fill the information slots, e.g., proteins, DNAs, RNAs, cells etc., in the biomedical context, is an important building block in such biomedical IE systems.
    Conceptually, named entity recognition consists of two tasks: identification, which finds the region of a named entity in a text, and classification, which determines the semantic class of that named entity.
    The following illustrates biomedical named entity recognition.
