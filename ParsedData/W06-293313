ts and different kinds of adjuncts, with a score in the range 60&#8211;80% and a distance of 1.8&#8211;5.2 IGs to their head.
    In this group, information about case and possessive features of nominals is important, which is found in the FEATS field in the data representation.
    We believe that one important explanation for our relatively good results for Turkish is that we break down the FEATS information into its atomic components, independently of POS and CPOS tags, and let the classifier decide which one to use in a given situation.
    The third group contains distant dependencies, such as sentence modifiers, vocatives and appositions, which have a much lower accuracy.
  
  
    The evaluation shows that labeled pseudo-projective dependency parsing, using a deterministic parsing algorithm and SVM classifiers, gives competitive parsing accuracy for all languages involved in the 7Given that the average IG count of a word is 1.26 in the treebank, this means that they are normally adjacent to the head wo
