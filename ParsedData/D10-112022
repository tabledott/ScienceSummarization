ns of variational updates; for each iteration we perform five steps of gradient search to compute the update for the variational distribution q(z) over dependency structures.
  
  
    In the following section we present our primary cross-lingual results using universal rules (Section 7.1) before performing a more in-depth analysis of model properties such as sensitivity to ruleset selection and inference stability (Section 7.2). with universal dependency rules (No-Split and HDPDEP), compared to DMV (Klein and Manning, 2004) and PGI (Berg-Kirkpatrick and Klein, 2010).
    The DMV results are taken from Berg-Kirkpatrick and Klein (2010).
    Bold numbers indicate the best result for each language.
    For the full model, the standard deviation in performance over five runs is indicated in parentheses.
    Table 4 shows the performance of both our full model (HDP-DEP) and its No-Split version using universal dependency rules across six languages.
    We also provide the performance of two baselines &#8212; the
