over, the pruning stage there was very strict?only chunks were considered as argument candidates.
  This results in over 60% of the actual arguments being ignored.
  Consequently, the overall recall in their approach was very low.
  The use of only shallow parsing information in an SRL system has largely been ignored until the recent CoNLL-2004 shared task competition (Carreras and Ma`rquez 2004).
  In that competition, participants were restricted to using only shallow parsing information, which included part-of-speech tags, chunks, and clauses (the definitions of chunks and clauses can be found in Tjong Kim Sang and Buchholz [2000] and Carreras et al.
  [2002], respectively).
  As a result, the performance of the best shallow parsing?
  based system (Hacioglu et al.
  2004) in the competition is about 10 points in F1 below the best system that uses full parsing information (Koomen et al.
  However, this is not the outcome of a true and fair quantitative comparison.
  The CoNLL-2004 shared task used only a s
