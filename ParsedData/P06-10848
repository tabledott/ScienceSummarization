ules, in order to select the analysis which causes the parsing to be more accurate.
    Segal reports an accuracy of 95%.
    Testing his system over a larger test corpus, gives poorer results: Lembersky (2001) reports an accuracy of about 85%.
    Bar-Haim et al. (2005) developed a word segmenter and PoS tagger for Hebrew.
    In their architecture, words are first segmented into morphemes, and then, as a second stage, these morphemes are tagged with PoS.
    The method proceeds in two sequential steps: segmentation into morphemes, then tagging over morphemes.
    The segmentation is based on an HMM and trained over a set of 30K annotated words.
    The segmentation step reaches an accuracy of 96.74%.
    PoS tagging, based on unsupervised estimation which combines a small annotated corpus with an untagged corpus of 340K words by using smoothing technique, gives an accuracy of 90.51%.
    As noted earlier, there is as yet no large scale Hebrew annotated corpus.
    We are in the process of developing such a
