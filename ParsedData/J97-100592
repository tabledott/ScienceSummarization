dy attempt to convey discourse structure (e.g., systems such as Moore and Paris [19931, and Hirschberg [19901).
    For example, given the algorithm shown in Figure 14, a generation system could better convey its discourse boundaries by constructing associated utterances where the values of coref, infer, and global.pro are as shown in the first line of the figure, or, for a spoken language system, where the value of cue-prosody is complex.
    In related work, we have tested the hypothesis that the use of a discourse focus structure based on the Pear segmentation data improves performance of a generation algorithm, thus providing a quantitative measure of the utility of the segmentation data (Passonneau 1996).
    There we present results of an evaluation of an NP generation algorithm under various conditions.
    The input to the algorithm consisted of semantic information about utterances in a Pear narrative, such as the referents mentioned in the utterance.
    Output was evaluated against what the human n
