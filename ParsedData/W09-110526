 results of the clinical corpus, where no is the most frequent negation signal.
    We have also shown that the metalearner performs better than the three first classifiers, except for the negation signal no in clinical reports, for which the SVM classifier produces the highest scores.
    Future research will deal with a more detailed analysis of the errors by each of the three initial classifiers compared to the errors of the metalearner in order to better understand why the results of the metalearner are higher.
    We also would like to perform feature analysis, and test the system on general domain corpora.
