ow?s Normalized Path Length.
  Leacock and Chodorow (1998) proposed the following formula for computing the scaled semantic similarity between concepts c1 and c2 in WordNet: simLC(c1, c2) = ?
  log len(c1, c2) 2 ?
  max c?WordNet depth(c) (7) Here, the denominator includes the maximum depth of the hierarchy.
  4 Sussna?s experiments proved the precise details of the weighting scheme to be material only in fine-tuning the performance.
  19 Computational Linguistics Volume 32, Number 1 2.6 Information-based and Integrated Approaches Like the methods in the preceding subsection, the final group of approaches that we present attempt to counter problems inherent in a general ontology by incorporating an additional, and qualitatively different, knowledge source, namely information from a corpus.
  2.6.1 Resnik?s Information-based Approach.
  The key idea underlying Resnik?s (1995) approach is the intuition that one criterion of similarity between two concepts is ?the extent to which they share information in common
