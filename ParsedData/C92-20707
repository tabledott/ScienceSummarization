ify ,salient words in the col lect ive cmttext ,  and  we ight  appropr ia te ly Intuitively, a salient word 2 is one which appears siguificantly more often in the context of a category than at other txfints in the corpus, and hence is a better than average indicator for the category.
  We formalize this wifl] a nmtual-in formation-like estimate: Pr(wlRCat) / Pr(w), tile probability of a word (w) appearing in the context of a Roget category divided by its overall probability in rile corpus.
  It is imlmrtant to exerci~ some care in estimating Pr(wlRCat).
  In principle, one could situply count tile number of times that w appears in the collective contexL However, this estimate, which is known as the tuaximnnt likelih(x,d estimate (MLE), can be unreliable, especially when w does not apl~-~ar vely often in the collective coutexl.
  We have smoothed file local estimates of Pr(wlRCat) with global estinmtes of Pr(w) to obtain a more reliable estimate.
  Estimates obtained from the local context are subject to meas
