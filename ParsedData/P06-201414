olate the margin at a penalty.
    The magnitude of this penalty to determined by a hand-tuned parameter C. After a few transformations (Tsochantaridis et al., 2004), the soft-margin learning objective can be formulated as a quadratic program: Note how the slack variables &#65533;i allow some incorrect structures to be built.
    Also note that the loss A(yi, y) determines the size of the margin between structures.
    Unfortunately, (4) provides one constraint for every possible structure for every training example.
    Enumerating these constraints explicitly is infeasible, but in reality, only a subset of these constraints are necessary to achieve the same objective.
    Re-organizing (4) produces: where costi is defined as: Provided that the max cost structure can be found in polynomial time, we have all the components needed for a constraint generation approach to this optimization problem.
    Constraint generation places an outer loop around an optimizer that minimizes (3) repeatedly for a growing set
