;not&#8221;, for example, is often translated into two French words, &#8220;ne&#8221; and &#8220;pas&#8221;.
    But &#8220;ne&#8221; and &#8220;pas&#8221; almost never occur in adjacent positions in French texts.
    At the outset of this work, we attempted to develop a translation model that enables concepts to be mapped into non-contiguous phrases.
    But we were not able to scale and train it on large amounts of data.
    The model described in this paper cannot learn that the English word &#8220;not&#8221; corresponds to the French words &#8220;ne&#8221; and &#8220;pas&#8221;.
    However, our model learns to deal with negation by memorizing longer phrase translation equivalents, such as (&#8220;ne est pas&#8221;, &#8220;is not&#8221;); (&#8220;est inadmissible&#8221;, &#8220;is not good enough&#8221;); and (&#8220;ne est pas ici&#8221;, &#8220;is not here&#8221;).
    6.2 Comparison with other work A number of researchers have already gone beyond word-level translations in various MT settings.
