e rules give rise to derivations like the following:4 This derivation is isomorphic to a traditional context-free derivation tree like the following (the semantics is omitted): CCG additionally introduces a set of rule schemata based on the combinators of combinatory logic (Curry and Feys 1958), which enable succinct analyses of extraction and coordination constructions.
    It is a distinctive property of CCG that all syntactic rules are purely type-driven, unlike traditional structure-dependent transformations.
    Composition and substitution allow two functors to combine into another functor, whereas type-raising is a unary rule that exchanges the roles of functor and argument: For example, the following is the derivation of a relative clause related to (4): We will see further examples of their use later.
    Such rules induce additional derivational ambiguity, even in canonical sentences like (4).
    However, our translation algorithm yields normal form derivations (Hepple and Morrill 1989; Wittenburg
