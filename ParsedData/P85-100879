of &#8226; mismatch between the way we view the world and the way the world really is.
    At the left end, one can assume a theory of the world that is isomorphic to the way we talk about it.
    What I have been doing in this paper, in fact, is an effort to work out the details in such a theory.
    In this case, semantics becomes very nearly trivial.
    Most activity in semantics today is slightly to the right of the extreme left end of this spectrum.
    One makes certain assumptions about the nature of the world that closely redeet language, and doesn't make certain other sesumptiosui.
    Where one has failed to make the necessary assumptions, puzzles appear, and semantics becomes au effort to solve those puzzles.
    Nevertheless, it rails to move far enough away from language to represent significant progress toward the right end of the spectrum.
    The position I advocate is that there is no reason to make our tisk more difficult.
    We will have puzzles enough to solve when we get to discourse.
