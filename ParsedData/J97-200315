nstruction is not sequential, since it contains c-transitions on the input side.
    There exists, however, an algorithm to construct the union of p-subsequential and q-subsequential transducers directly as a p + q-subsequential transducer.
    The direct construction consists of considering pairs of states (qi, q), qi being a state of Ti or an additional state that we denote by an underscore, q2 a state of 7-2 or an additional state that we denote by an underscore.
    The transitions leaving (qi, q2) are obtained by taking the union of the transitions leaving qi and q2, or by keeping only those of qi if q2 is the underscore state, similarly by keeping only those of q2 if qi is the underscore state.
    The union of the transitions is performed in such a way that if qi and q2 both have transitions labeled with the same input label a, then only one transition labeled with a is associated to (qi, q2).
    The output label of that transition is the longest common prefix of the output transitions labeled with a
