mmars for English, German, Japanese, and Spanish reveals a high degree of language-specificity for several of these phenomena, but also suggests promise of reusable abstractions.
    Several kinds of sociolinguistic variation require extensions to the matrix, including grammaticized aspects of pragmatics such as politeness and empathy, as well as dialect and register alternations.
    The grammar of Japanese provides a starting point for representations of both empathy and politeness.
    Implementations of familiar vs. formal verb forms in German and Spanish provide further instances of politeness to help build the cross-linguistic abstractions.
    Extensions for dialect variation will build on some exploratory work in adapting the English grammar to support American, British, and Australian regionalisms, both lexical and syntactic, while restricting dialect mixture in generation and associated spurious ambiguity in parsing.
    While the development of the matrix will be built largely on the LKB platform,
