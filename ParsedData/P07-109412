    Wt components, where Wt is the number of word In Bayesian statistical inference, multiple samples types that are permissible outputs for tag t. We will from the posterior are often used in order to obtain use &#964; and &#969; to refer to the entire transition and out- statistics such as the expected values of model variput parameter sets.
    This model assumes that the ables.
    For POS tagging, estimates based on multiprior over state transitions is the same for all his- ple samples might be useful if we were interested in, tories, and the prior over output distributions is the for example, the probability that two words have the same for all states.
    We relax the latter assumption in same tag.
    However, computing such probabilities Section 4. across all pairs of words does not necessarily lead to Under this model, Equation 5 gives us a consistent clustering, and the result would be diffin(ti&#8722;2,ti&#8722;1,ti) + &#945; cult to evaluate.
