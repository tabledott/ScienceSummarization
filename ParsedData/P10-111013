b states.
    To decide the ordering of states in each beam we borrow the concept of prefix cost from Stolcke (1995), originally developed for weighted Earley parsing.
    As shown in Fig.
    3, the prefix cost c is the total cost of the best action sequence from the initial state to the end of state p, i.e., it includes both the inside cost v (for Viterbi inside derivation), and the cost of the (best) path leading towards the beginning of state p. We say that a state p with prefix cost c is better than a state p&#8242; with prefix cost c&#8242;, notated p &#65533; p&#8242; in Fig.
    3, if c &lt; c&#8242;.
    We can also prove (by contradiction) that optimizing for prefix cost implies optimal inside cost (Nederhof, 2003, Sec.
    4).
    5 As shown in Fig.
    3, when a state q with costs (c, v) is combined with a predictor state p with costs (c&#8242;, v&#8242;), the resulting state r will have costs where the inside cost is intuitively the combined inside costs plus an additional combo cost &#948; from
