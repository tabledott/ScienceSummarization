  log p(lso(c, c)) = ?
  log p(c) (see equation (8)), and hence the similarity of a concept to itself varies from one concept to another.
  Second, these ?lines?
  are not continuous, as one might expect from the graphs of the human judgments: For the Miller?Charles set, for instance, the line includes pairs 1, 2, 7, and 8, but omits pairs 3?6.
