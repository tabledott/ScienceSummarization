ant feature for assessing readabil ity (Schwarm and Ostendorf, 2005).
			We train a trigram LM using the simple sentences in PWKP and calculate the PPL with SRILM.
			TSM gets the best PPL score.
			From this table, we can conclude that TSM achieves better overall readability than the baseline systems.
			PPL(text) = P (w1w2...wN )?
			1 N (6)There are still some important issues to be con sidered in future.
			Based on our observations, the current model performs well for word substitution and segmentation.
			But the completion of the new sentences is still problematic.
			For example, we copy the dependent NP to the new sentences.
			This may break the coherence between sentences.
			Abetter solution would be to use a pronoun to replace the NP.
			Sometimes, excessive droppings oc cur, e.g., ?older?
			and ?twin?
			are dropped in ?She has an older brother and a twin brother...?.
			This results in a problematic sentence: ?She has anbrother and a brother...?.
			There are also some er rors which stem from
