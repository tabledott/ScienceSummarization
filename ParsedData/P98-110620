LM (whose dot must be at its beginning, or seperated from the beginning by optional or categories only); the lifting condition is then removed from L. 3.
    If, after the above repositioning of the dot and the linking up of all linear dependents to lifting conditions, there are still lifting conditions in LM such that the dot is at the beginning of the lifting condition, then no new entry is made in the parse matrix for n. 4.
    For every syntactic dependent of rh we determine if it is a linear dependent of n which has not yet been identified as lifted.
    For each syntactic dependents which is not also a linear dependent, we check whether there is an applicable lifting rule.
    If not, no entry is made in the parse matrix for 77.
    If yes, we add the lifting rule to LM.
    This procedure determines a new multiset LM so we can add entry (in, q, LM) in the parse matrix.
    (In fact, it may determine several possible new multisets, resulting in multiple new entries.)
    The parse is complete if there i
