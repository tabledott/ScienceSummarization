Mitchell and Lapata.
    Observed ANs are nearer, in the space of observed and predicted test set ANs, to the ANs generated by his model than to those from the alternative approaches.
    The additive model, on the other hand, is best in terms of shared neighbor count between observed and predicted ANs.
    In our empirical tests, we compare our approach to the simplified additive and multiplicative models of Mitchell and Lapata (the former with normalization constants as scalar weights) as well as to Guevara&#8217;s approach.
  
  
    As discussed in the introduction, we will take adjectives in attributive position to be functions from one noun meaning to another.
    To start simple, we assume here that adjectives in the attributive position (AN) are linear functions from n-dimensional (noun) vectors onto n-dimensional vectors, an operation that can be expressed as multiplication of the input noun column vector by a n x n matrix, that is our representation for the adjective (in the language of linear algeb
