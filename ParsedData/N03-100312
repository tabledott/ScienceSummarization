ntences in the cluster represent the same type of event, such as a bombing, but generally refer to different instances of said event (e.g. a bombing in Jerusalem versus in Gaza), areas of large variability in the lattice should correspond to arguments.
    To quantify this notion of variability, we first formalize its opposite: commonality.
    We define backbone nodes as those shared by more than 50% of the cluster&#8217;s sentences.
    The choice of 50% is not arbitrary &#8212; it can be proved using the pigeonhole principle that our strictmajority criterion imposes a unique linear ordering of the backbone nodes that respects the word ordering within the sentences, thus guaranteeing at least a degree of wellformedness and avoiding the problem of how to order backbone nodes occurring on parallel &#8220;branches&#8221; of the lattice.
    Once we have identified the backbone nodes as points of strong commonality, the next step is to identify the regions of variability (or, in lattice terms, many parallel dis
