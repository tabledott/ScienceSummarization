ining set consisting of 10,000 sentences, each with parses for partially labeled and unlabeled versions.
    Altogether there were 150,000 parses for partially labeled input and 500,000 for unlabeled input.
    For estimation, a simple property selection procedure was applied to the full set of around 1000 properties.
    This procedure is based on a frequency cutoff on instantiations of properties for the parses in the labeled training set.
    The result of this procedure is a reduction of the property vector to about half its size.
    Furthermore, a held-out data set was created from section 24 of the WSJ treebank for experimental selection of the variance parameter of the prior distribution.
    This set consists of 120 sentences which received only full parses, out of which the most plausible one was selected manually.
    Two different sets of test data were used: (i) 700 sentences randomly extracted from section 23 of the WSJ treebank and given gold-standard f-structure annotations according to our LF
