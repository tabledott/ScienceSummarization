ally, the annotation is performed by two human annotators, producing sets S1, P1, S2, P2.
    To increase the quality of the resulting reference alignment, the annotators are presented with the mutual errors and asked to improve their alignments where possible.
    (Mutual errors of the two annotators A and B are the errors in the alignment of annotator A if we assume the alignment of annotator B as reference and the errors in the alignment of annotator B if we assume the alignment of annotator A as reference.)
    From these alignments, we finally generate a reference alignment that contains only those S connections on which both annotators agree and all P connections from both annotators.
    This can be accomplished by forming the intersection of the sure alignments (S = S1&#8745;S2) and the union of the possible alignments (P = P1&#8746;P2), respectively.
    By generating the reference alignment in this way, we obtain an alignment error rate of 0 percent when we compare the S alignments of every single a
