Finally, both Shieber, Schabes, and Pereira (1995) and Sikkel (1993) have shown how to specify parsers in a simple, interpretable, item-based format.
    This format is roughly the format we have used here, although there are differences due to the fact that their work was strictly in the Boolean semiring.
    Work in statistical parsing has also greatly influenced this work.
    We can trace this work back to research in HMMs by Baum and his colleagues (Baum and Eagon 1967; Baum 1972).
    In particular, the work of Baum developed the concept of backward probabilities (in the inside semiring), as well as many of the techniques for computing in the inside semiring.
    Viterbi (1967) developed corresponding algorithms for computing in the Viterbi semiring.
    Baker (1979) extended the work of Baum and his colleagues to PCFGs, including to computation of the outside values (or reverse inside values in our terminology).
    Baker's work is described by Lan i and Young (1990).
    Baker's work was only for PCFG
