from a rhetoric text (Holmes and Gallagher 19176).
    It is an example used by Cohen (1983) in her work on the structure of arguments.
    Figure 2 shows the dialogue and the eight discourse segments of which it is composed.
    The division of the argument into separate (numbered) clauses is Cohen's, but our analysis of the discourse structure is different, since in Cohen's analysis, every utterance is directly subordinated to another utterance, and there is only one structure to encode linguistic segmentation and the purposes of utterances.
    Although both analyses segment utterance (4) separately from utterances (1-3), some readers place this utterance in DS1 with utterances (1) through (3); this is an example of the kind of disagreement about boundary utterances found in Mann's data (as discussed in Section 2.1).
    The two placements lead to slightly different DSPs, but not to radically different intentional structures.
    Because the differences do not affect the major thrust of the argument, we wi
