 Sometimes it is sufficient to know a given span has a modifier role, without knowledge of the specific role label.
    In addition, deciding exact modifier argument labels was one of the decisions with highest disagreement among annotators (Palmer, Gildea, and Kingsbury 2005).
    To estimate performance under this setting, we relabel all ARGM-X arguments to ARGM in the proposed and correct labeling.
    Such a performance measure was also used by Xue and Palmer (2004).
    Note that these measures do not exclude the core arguments but instead consider the core plus a coarse version of the modifier arguments.
    Thus for COARSEARGM ALL we count {0} as a true positive span, {1,2} , {3,4}, and {7,8,9} as false positive, and {1, 2, 3, 4} and {7, 8, 9} as false negative.
    Identification Measures (ID).
    These measure how well we do on the ARG vs. NONE distinction.
    For the purposes of this evaluation, all spans labeled with a non-NONE label are considered to have the generic label ARG.
    For example,
