doubt&#8221;.
    In the last example, there are effectively two negators &#8211; &#8220;not&#8221; and &#8220;eliminated&#8221; &#8211; which reverse the polarity of &#8220;doubt&#8221; twice, resulting in the negative polarity for the overall sentence.
    These examples demonstrate that words or constituents interact with each other to yield the expression-level polarity.
    And a system that simply takes the majority vote of the polarity of individual words will not work well on the above examples.
    Indeed, much of the previous learning-based research on this topic tries to incorporate salient interactions by encoding them as features.
    One approach includes features based on contextual valence shifters1 (Polanyi and Zaenen, 2004), which are words that affect the polarity or intensity of sentiment over neighboring text spans (e.g., Kennedy and Inkpen (2005), Wilson et al. (2005), Shaikh et al.
    (2007)).
    Another approach encodes frequent subsentential patterns (e.g., McDonald et al. (2007)) a
