 problem, one that should be familiar from our study of rewriting rules: the iteration causes the different rule instances to match on separate, successive substrings.
    It does not allow for the possibility that the context substring of one application might overlap with the center and context portions of a preceding one.
    This problem can be solved with the auxiliary-symbol techniques we developed for rewriting rule overlaps.
    We introduce left and right context brackets &lt;k and &gt;k for each context pair Ak-pk.
    These are distinct from all other symbols, and since their identity pairs are now feasible pairs, they are added to 7.
    These pairs take the place of the actual context relations in the iterative union This eliminates the overlap problem.
    We then must ensure that these bracket pairs appear only if appropriately followed or preceded by the proper context relation.
    With m being the set of all bracket pairs and subscripting now indicating that identity pairs of the specified s
