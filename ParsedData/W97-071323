 the program to take advantage of the paragraph structure of the texts that it analyzes Currently, the rank assignment for each textual unit in an RS-tree is done entirely on the basis of the maximal depth in the tree where that unit is salient (Marcu, 1996) Our data seem to support the fact that there exists a correlation also between the types of relations that are used to connect various textual units and the importance of those units in a text We plan to design other experiments that can provide clearcut evidence on the nature of this correlation
  
  
    Our summarization program relies on a rhetorical parser that builds RS-trees for unrestricted texts The mathematical foundations of the rhetorical parsing algonthm rely on a firse-Order formalization of valid text structures (Marcu, 1997b) The assumptions of the formalization are the following 1 The elementary units of complex text structures are non-overlapping spans of text 2 Rhetorical, coherence, and cohesive relations hold between textual units of
