    We investigate the performance of the polarity features under two conditions: (1) perfect neutral&#8211;polar recognition and (2) automatic neutral&#8211;polar recognition.
    For condition 1, we identify the polar instances according to the gold-standard, manual contextual-polarity annotations.
    In the test data, 9,835 instances of the clues from the lexicon are polar in context according to the manual annotations.
    Experiments under condition 1 classify these instances as having positive, negative, or both (positive and negative) polarity.
    For condition 2, we take the best performing neutral&#8211;polar classifier for each algorithm and use the output from those algorithms to identify the polar instances.
    Because polar instances now are being identified automatically, there will be noise in the form of misclassified neutral instances.
    Therefore, for experiments under condition 2 we include the neutral class and perform four-way classification instead of three-w
