    This paper describes a general scheme for segmenting text by inferring the position of word boundaries, thus supplying a necessary preprocessing step for applications like those mentioned above.
    Unlike other approaches, which involve a dictionary of legal words and are therefore language-specific, it works by using a corpus of alreadysegmented text for training and thus can easily be retargeted for any language for which a suitable corpus of segmented material is available.
    To infer word boundaries, a general adaptive text compression technique is used that predicts upcoming characters on the basis of their preceding context.
    Spaces are inserted into positions where their presence enables the text to be compressed more effectively.
    This approach means that we can capitalize on existing research in text compression to create good models for word segmentation.
