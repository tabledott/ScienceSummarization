ation of symbols is encountered that satisfies the application conditions of the rule instantiated to one selection of values for all of its variables.
    The segments matching the input are then replaced by the output segments determined by that same selection, and scanning resumes until another configuration is located that matches under possibly a different selection of variables values.
    This behavior is modeled as the batch-mode application of a set of rules each of which corresponds to one variable instantiation of the original rule.
    Consider a center-expanded rule of the general form 0 &#8212;&gt; '0/A p, and let I be the set of possible value instantiations for the feature-variables it contains.
    Then the collection of instantiated rules is simply The components of the rules in this set are regular languages over unanalyzable segment symbols, all feature matrices and variables having been resolved.
    Since each instantiated rule is formed by applying the same substitution to each of the o
