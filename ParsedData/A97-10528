aluation 3.1 Lexicon Evaluation &#8212; Method In order to test the accuracy of our system (as developed so far) and to provide empirical feedback for further development, we took the Susanne, SEC (Taylor &amp; Knowles, 1988) and LOB corpora (Garat., total of 1.2 million words&#8212;and extracted all sentences containing an occurrence of one of fourteen verbs, up to a maximum of 1000 citations of each.
    These verbs, listed in Figure 2, were chosen at random, subject to the constraint that they exhibited multiple complementation patterns.
    The sentences containing these verbs were tagged and parsed automatically, and the extractor, classifier and evaluator were applied to the resulting lanit_verbs1 'patterns' The binomial distribution gives the probability of an with probability exactly m times out of n attempts: 359 successful analyses.
    The citations from which entries were derived totaled approximately 70K words.
    The results were evaluated against a merged entry for these verbs from the ANLT an
