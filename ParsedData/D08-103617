frequently, and use this mapping to map each HMM state sequence t to a sequence of part-of-speech tags.
    But as Clark (2003) observes, this approach has several defects.
    If a system is permitted to posit an unbounded number of states (which is not the case here) it can achieve a perfect score on by assigning each word token its own unique state.
    We can partially address this by cross-validation.
    We divide the corpus into two equal parts, and from the first part we extract a mapping from HMM states to the parts-of-speech they co-occur with most frequently, and use that mapping to map the states of the second part of the corpus to parts-of-speech.
    We call the accuracy of the resulting tagging the crossvalidation accuracy.
    Finally, following Haghighi and Klein (2006) and Johnson (2007) we can instead insist that at most one HMM state can be mapped to any part-of-speech tag.
    Following these authors, we used a greedy algorithm to associate states with POS tags; the accuracy of the result
