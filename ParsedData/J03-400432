he probability estimate for the highest-scoring class.
    We show alongside this the random baseline and the first-sense heuristic for these items.
    Selectional preferences appear to do better on items for which the probability predicted by our model is higher, but the first-sense heuristic does even better on these.
    The first sense heuristic, with respect to SemCor, outperforms the selectional preferences when it is averaged over a given text.
    That seems to be the case overall, but there will be some words and texts for which the first sense from SemCor is not relevant, and use of a threshold on probability, and perhaps a differential between probability of the top-ranked senses suggested by the model, should increase precision.
    Thresholding the probability estimate for the highest-scoring class.
    In these experiments we applied the OSPD heuristic to increase coverage.
    One problem in doing this when using a fine-grained classification like WordNet is that although the OSPD heuristic wo
