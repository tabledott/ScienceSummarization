ose identified by at least four subjects, shows roughly comparable performance.
    The &amp;quot;Learning 1&amp;quot; algorithm performs better on the set defined by T = 3 (Table 9); Error Analysis (Table 7) and &amp;quot;Learning 2&amp;quot; (Table 9) perform better on the T = 4 set.
    We have not yet determined what causes these differences, although in an early paper on our pilot study, we reported that there is a strong tendency for recall to increase and precision to decrease as boundary strength increases (Passonneau and Litman 1993).
    On the one hand, performance was consistently improved by enriching the linguistic input.
    On the other hand, there is wide performance variation around the mean.
    Despite this variation, as we pointed out in Litman and Passonneau (1995a), there are certain narratives that the NP, EA, and both machine learning algorithms perform similarly well, or poorly, on.
    These observations indicate a need for further research regarding the interaction among variation
