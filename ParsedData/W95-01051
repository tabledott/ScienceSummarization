    However, for many tasks, one is interested in relationships among word senses, not words.
    Consider, for example, the cluster containing attorney, counsel, trial, court, and judge, used by Brown et al. (1992) to illustrate a &amp;quot;semantically sticky&amp;quot; group of words.
    As is often the case where sense ambiguity is involved, we as readers impose the most coherent interpretation on the words within the group without being aware that we are doing so.

    This would be a mistake for many applications, such as query expansion in information retrieval, where a su
