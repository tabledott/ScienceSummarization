introduce the detail of the approach.
    We assign the score &#8220;1&#8221; for any pair of paraphrase collocations.
    PT-5 contains 238,882 pairs of paraphrase collocations.
    To estimate parameters &#955;k(1 &lt; k &lt; K), &#955;lm, and &#955;um, we adopt the approach of minimum error rate training (MERT) that is popular in SMT (Och, 2003).
    In SMT, however, the optimization objective function in MERT is the MT evaluation criteria, such as BLEU.
    As we analyzed above, the BLEU-style criteria cannot be adapted in SPG.
    We therefore introduce a new optimization objective function in this paper.
    The basic assumption is that a paraphrase should contain as many correct unit replacements as possible.
    Accordingly, we design the following criteria: Replacement precision (rp): rp assesses the precision of the unit replacements, which is defined as rp = cdev(+r)/cdev(r), where cdev(r) is the total number of unit replacements in the generated paraphrases on the development set. cdev(+r) is the
