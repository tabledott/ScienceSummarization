 a simple scaffolding framework that deploys strong features through tiers of models performs significantly better than a single-pass model.
    Additionally, we propose several simple, yet powerful, new features.
  
  
    This work builds upon the recent observation that strong features outweigh complex models for coreference resolution, in both supervised and unsupervised learning setups (Bengston and Roth, 2008; Haghighi and Klein, 2009).
    Our work reinforces this observation, and extends it by proposing a novel architecture that: (a) allows easy deployment of such features, and (b) infuses global information that can be readily exploited by these features or constraints.
    Most coreference resolution approaches perform the task by aggregating local decisions about pairs of mentions (Bengston and Roth, 2008; Finkel and Manning, 2008; Haghighi and Klein, 2009; Stoyanov, 2010).
    Two recent works that diverge from this pattern are Culotta et al. (2007) and Poon and Domingos (2008).
