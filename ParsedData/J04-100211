    There are three constraints on CorMet&#8217;s selectional-preference-learning algorithm.
    First, it must tolerate noise, because complex sentences are often misparsed, and the case frame extractor is error prone.
    Second, it should be able to work around WordNet&#8217;s lacunae.
    Finally, there should be a reasonable metric for comparing the similarity between selectional preferences.
    CorMet first uses the selectional-preference-learning algorithm described in Resnik (1993), then clustering over the results.
    Resnik&#8217;s algorithm takes a set of words observed in a case slot (e.g., the subject of pour or the indirect object of give) and finds the WordNet nodes that best characterize the selectional preferences of that slot.
    (Note that WordNet nodes are treated as categories subcategorizing their descendants.)
    A case slot has a preference for a WordNet node to th
