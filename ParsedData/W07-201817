res in Table 3 with those in Table 2.
			The difficulty of the task is reflected in the F-scores of around 35% for the most difficult text in the most difficult condition, but participants still managed to reach F-scores as high as 75% for the more limited task of Frame Identification (Table 2), which more closely matches traditional Senseval tasks, despite the lack of a full sense inventory.
			The difficulty posed by having such an unconstrained task led to understandably low recall scores in all participants (between 25 and 50%).
			The systems submitted by the teams differed in their sensitivity to differences in the texts: UTD-SRL?s system varied by around 10% across texts, while LTH?s varied by 15%.
			There are some rather encouraging results also.The participants rather consistently performed bet ter with our more complex, but also more useful andrealistic scoring, including partial credit and grad ing on semantic dependency rather than exact span match (compare the top and bottom halves of Table 3).
