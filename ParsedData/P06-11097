proach captures both contiguous and non-contiguous lexical dependencies.
    As with most other unsupervised parsing models, U-DOP induces trees for p-o-s strings rather than for word strings.
    The extension to word strings is straightforward as there exist highly accurate unsupervised part-of-speech taggers (e.g.
    Sch&#252;tze 1995) which can be directly combined with unsupervised parsers.
    To give an illustration of U-DOP, consider the WSJ p-o-s string NNS VBD JJ NNS which may correspond for instance to the sentence Investors suffered heavy losses.
    U-DOP starts by While we can efficiently represent the set of all binary trees of a string by means of a chart, we need to unpack the chart if we want to extract subtrees from this set of binary trees.
    And since the total number of binary trees for the small WSJ10 is almost 12 million, it is doubtful whether we can apply the unrestricted U-DOP model to such a corpus.
    U-DOP therefore randomly samples a large subset from the total number of par
