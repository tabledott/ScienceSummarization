    The open source Moses (Koehn et al., 2007) MT system was originally developed at the University of Edinburgh and received a major boost through a 2007 Johns Hopkins workshop.
    It is now used at several academic institutions as the basic infrastructure for statistical machine translation research.
    The Moses system is an implementation of the phrase-based machine translation approach (Koehn et al., 2003).
    In this approach, an input sentence is first split into text chunks (so-called phrases), which are then mapped one-to-one to target phrases using a large phrase translation table.
    Phrases may be reordered, but typically a reordering limit (in our experiments a maximum movement over 6 words) is used.
    See Figure 1 for an illustration.
    Phrase translation probabilities, reordering probabilities and language model probabilities are combined to give each possible sentence translation a score.
