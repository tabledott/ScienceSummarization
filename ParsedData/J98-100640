ical and local open-class cues were used, since preliminary tests showed that performance declined when using local closed-class and part-of-speech cues obtained from the monosemous relatives.
    This is not surprising, as many of the relatives are collocations whose local syntax is quite different from that of the polysemous word in its typical usage.
    For example, the 'formation' sense of line is often followed by an of-phrase as in a line of children, but its relative, picket line, is not.
    Prior probabilities for the sense were taken from the manually tagged materials.
    Table 5 shows the results when TLC was trained on monosemous relatives and on manually tagged training materials.
    Baseline performance is when the classifier always chooses the most frequent sense.
    Eight additional words had a sufficient number of manually tagged examples for testing but not for training TLC.
    These are shown in Table 6.
    For four of the examples in Table 5, training with relatives produced results
