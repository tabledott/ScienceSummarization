    The following conventions are used to simplify the figure: The definite clause program corresponding to the grammar for this example is listed in Appendix II.
    The example shows clearly how the bracketing constraint works.
    Symbols are placed in the extraposition list by rules with more than one symbol in the left-hand side, and removed by calls to 'virtual', on a first-in-last-out basis; that is, the extraposition list is a stack.
    But this property of the extraposition list is exactly what is needed to balance &amp;quot;on the fly&amp;quot; the auxiliary brackets in the intermediate steps of a derivation.
    Being no more than a logic program, an XG can be used for analysis and for synthesis in the same way as a DCG.
    For instance, to determine whether a string s with initial point initial and final point final is in the language defined by the XG of Figure 8.1, one tries to prove the goal statement As for DCGs, the string s can be represented in several ways.
