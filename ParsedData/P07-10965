r book is VB.
    At the second step, assume the most favorable action is the assignment of label JJ to interesting in the context of NN for book.
    Then we maintain the top two hypotheses for span book interesting as shown below.
    The second most favorable label for interesting is still JJ, but in the context of VB for book.
    Then, suppose we are most confident for assigning labels VBD and VBN to found, in that order.
    We get two separated tagged spans as shown below.
    In the next step, suppose we are most confident for assigning label DT to that under the context of VBD on the left and NN-JJ on the right side, as shown below (second most favorable action, not discussed here, is also displayed).
    After tagging w3, two separated spans merge into one, starting from found to interesting.
  
  
    Agatha found that book interesting w1 w2 w3 w4 w5 (Step 4) For the last step, we assign label NNP to Agatha, which could be an out-of-vocabulary word, under the context of VBD-DT on the right.
