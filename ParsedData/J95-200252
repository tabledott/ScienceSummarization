Y can occur if it can be derived through cyclic productions.
    Note that the computation of 0' is unchanged, since ry&amp;quot; already includes an infinity of cyclically generated subtrees for Y, where appropriate.
    The estimation procedure described above (and EM-based estimators in general) are only guaranteed to find locally optimal parameter estimates.
    Unfortunately, it seems that in the case of unconstrained SCFG estimation local maxima present a very real problem, and make success dependent on chance and initial conditions (Lan i and Young 1990).
    Pereira and Schabes (1992) showed that partially bracketed input samples can alleviate the problem in certain cases.
    The bracketing information constrains the parse of the inputs, and therefore the parameter estimates, steering it clear from some of the suboptimal solutions that could otherwise be found.
    An Earley parser can be minimally modified to take advantage of bracketed strings by invoking itself recursively when a left parenthesis
