his simple approach seems to break down when we encounter the more difficult phenomena of natural language, like tense, intensional contexts, and adverbials, as in the sentence A boy wanted to build a boat quickly.
    These phenomena have led students of language to introduce significant complications in their logical notations for representing sentences.
    My approach will be to maintain the syntactic simplicity of the logical notation and expand the theory of the world implicit in the semantics to accommodate this simplicity.
    The representation of the above sentence, as is justified below, is es, es, y)Paagel z, es)Aquickqes, es) y) occurred in the past, where is es, is the quickness of es, which is z's building of a boy and a boat.
    In brief, the logical form of natural language sentences will be a conjunction of atomic predications in which all variables are existentially quantified with the widest possible scope.
    Predicates will be identical or nearly identical to natural language morphemes
