em like Moses can extract &#8220;phrases&#8221; (sequences of tokens) from a word alignment and the system can construct the words that are useful.
    These observations suggest the first hypothesis.
    Observation In the experiments we conducted, we found that the phrase table cannot capture everything a Chinese word segmenter can do, and therefore having word segmentation helps phrase-based MT systems.
    2 To show that having word segmentation helps MT, we compare a lexicon-based maximummatching segmenter with character-based segmentation (treating each Chinese character as a word).
    The lexicon-based segmenter finds words by greedily matching the longest words in the lexicon in a left-to-right fashion.
    We will later refer to this segmenter as MaxMatch.
    The MaxMatch segmenter is a simple and common baseline for the Chinese word segmentation task.
    The segmentation performance of MaxMatch is not very satisfying because it cannot generalize to capture words it has never seen before.
