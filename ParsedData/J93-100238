tegoried CF rules) from the unification grammar to constrain the application of the latter's rules at parse time.
    The nearly one-to-one mapping of unification grammar rules to backbone grammar rules described above works quite well for the ANLT grammar, with only a couple of exceptions that create spurious shift-reduce conflicts during parsing, resulting in an unacceptable degradation in performance.
    The phenomena concerned are coordination and unbounded dependency constructions.
    In the ANLT grammar three very general rules are used to form nominal, adjectival, and prepositional phrases following a conjunction; the categories in these rules lead to otherwise disjoint categories for conjuncts being merged, giving rise to a set of overly general backbone grammar rules.
    For example, the rule in the ANLT grammar for forming a noun phrase conjunct introduced by a conjunction is N2 [CONJ @con] --&gt; [SUBCAT @con , CONJN +3, H2.
    The variable value for the CONJ feature in the mother means that al
