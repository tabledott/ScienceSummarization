			3.2 First Phase: Find Argument Candidates.
			The first phase is to predict the argument candidates of a given sentence that correspond to the active verb.
			Unfortunately, it turns out that it is difficult to predict the exact arguments accurately.
			Therefore, the goal here is to output a superset of the correct arguments by filtering out unlikely candidates.Specifically, we learn two classifiers, one to de tect beginning argument locations and the otherto detect end argument locations.
			Each multi class classifier makes predictions over forty-three classes?thirty-two argument types, ten continuousargument types, and one class to detect not begin ning/not end.
			Features used for these classifiers are: ? Word feature includes the current word, two words before and two words after.
			Part-of-speech tag (POS) feature includes the POS tags of all words in a window of size two.
			Chunk feature includes the BIO tags for chunks of all words in a window of size two.
