n (61) by 0(w) and using Equation (60) and Definition (54) of R, we obtain the parameter reestimation formulae We interpret E o(w ;f , e) as the expected number of times, as computed by the model PO, that the event w occurs in the translation of e to f. Thus 0(w) is the (normalized) expected number of times, as computed by model PO, that w occurs in the translations of the training sample.
    We can easily generalize these formulae to allow models of the form (58) for which the single equality constraint in Equation (59) is replaced by multiple constraints where the subsets Sti, p --= 1, 2, ... form a partition of Q.
    We need only modify Equation E(m I 1) string length probabilities t(f I e) translation probabilities Here f E ,F; e E E or e = eo; 1 =- ...; and m = 1,2, .... Pe(f, a I e) = Po(m I e)Po(a I m, e)Po(f I a, m, e) (67) Assumptions.
    This model is not deficient.
