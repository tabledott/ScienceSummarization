			Kernel for Relation Extraction In this section, we first propose an algorithm to dy namically determine a proper context-sensitive tree span and then a context-sensitive convolution tree kernel for relation extraction.
			3.1 Dynamic Context-Sensitive Tree Span in.
			Relation Extraction A relation instance between two entities is encaps u lated by a parse tree.
			Thus, it is critical to understand which portion of a parse tree is important in the tree kernel calculation.
			Zhang et al(2006) systematically explored seven different tree spans, including the Shortest Path-enclosed Tree (SPT) and a Context Sensitive Path-enclosed Tree1 (CSPT), and found that SPT per formed best.
			That is, SPT even outperforms CSPT.
			This is contrary to our intuition.
			For example, ?got married?
			is critical to determine the relationship between ?John?
			and ?Mary?
			in the sentence ?John and Mary got married?
			as shown in Figure 1(e), and the information contained in SPT (?John an
