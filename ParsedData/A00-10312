gger, TnT, not only yielded the highest accuracy, it also was the fastest both in training and tagging.
    The tagger comparison was organized as a &amp;quot;blackbox test&amp;quot;: set the same task to every tagger and compare the outcomes.
    This paper describes the models and techniques used by TnT together with the implementation.
    The reader will be surprised how simple the underlying model is.
    The result of the tagger comparison seems to support the maxime &amp;quot;the simplest is the best&amp;quot;.
    However, in this paper we clarify a number of details that are omitted in major previous publications concerning tagging with Markov models.
    As two examples, (Rabiner, 1989) and (Charniak et al., 1993) give good overviews of the techniques and equations used for Markov models and part-ofspeech tagging, but they are not very explicit in the details that are needed for their application.
    We argue that it is not only the choice of the general model that determines the result of the tagg
