e prominent classes are spread much faster in early iterations.
  
  
    The analysis of the CW process is difficult due to its nonlinear nature.
    Its run-time complexity indicates that it cannot directly optimize most global graph cluster measures because of their NPcompleteness (&#352;&#237;ma and Schaeffer, 2005).
    Therefore we perform experiments on synthetic graphs to empirically arrive at an impression of our algorithm's abilities.
    All experiments were conducted with an implementation following figure 1.
    For experiments with synthetic graphs, we restrict ourselves to unweighted graphs, if not stated explicitly.
    A cluster algorithm should keep dense regions together while cutting apart regions that are sparsely connected.
    The highest density is reached in fully connected sub-graphs of n nodes, a.k.a. ncliques.
    We define an n-bipartite-clique as a graph of two n-cliques, which are connected such that each node has exactly one edge going to the clique it, does not belong to.
