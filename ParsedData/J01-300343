med the manual counts on the first 100 occurrences.
    Table 7 shows the results of the manual counts, reported as proportions to facilitate comparison to the normalized automatic counts, shown in adjoining columns.
    We observe first that, overall, most errors in the automatic counts occur in the unaccusative and object-drop verbs.
    While tagging errors affect the VBN feature for all of the verbs somewhat, we note that TRANS and PASS are consistently underestimated for unaccusative and object-drop verbs.
    These errors make the unaccusative and objectdrop feature values more similar to each other, and therefore potentially harder to distinguish.
    Furthermore, because the TRANS and PASS values are underestimated by the automatic counts, and therefore lower in value, they are also closer to the values for the unergative verbs.
    For the CAUS feature, we predict the highest values for the unaccusative verbs, and while that prediction is confirmed, the automatic counts for that class also show the m
