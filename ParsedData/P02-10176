particular linguistic phenomenon that the system exploits is that long constituents often have short, common equivalents, or proforms, which appear in similar contexts and whose constituency is easily discovered (or guaranteed).
    Our model is designed to transfer the constituency of a sequence directly to its containing context, which is intended to then pressure new sequences that occur in that context into being parsed as constituents in the next round.
    The model is also designed to exploit the successes of distributional clustering, and can equally well be viewed as doing distributional clustering in the presence of no-overlap constraints.
    Unlike a PCFG, our model describes all contiguous subsequences of a sentence (spans), including empty spans, whether they are constituents or nonconstituents (distituents).
    A span encloses a sequence of terminals, or yield, &#945;, such as DT JJ NN.
    A span occurs in a context x, such as o&#8211;VBZ, where x is the ordered pair of preceding and followin
