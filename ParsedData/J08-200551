iolate the constraints among argument labels.
  In this section, we first present the overall system performance when most constraints are not used.
  We then demonstrate how the inference procedure can be used to combine the output of several systems to yield better performance.
  5.1 Inference with Limited Constraints The inference stage in our system architecture provides a principled way to resolve conflicting local predictions.
  It is interesting to see whether this procedure improves the performance differently for the full parsing?
  vs. the shallow parsing?based system, as well as gold-standard vs. automatic parsing input.
  Table 10 shows the results of using only constraints 1, 2, 3, and 4.
  As mentioned previously, the first three constraints are handled before the argument classification stage.
  Constraint 4, which forbids overlapping or embedding arguments, is required in order to use the official CoNLL-2005 evaluation script and is therefore kept.
  By comparing Table 9 with Table 10, we can
