e augmented representations as before.
    Note that this is a particularly stringent evaluation measure for a system including a parser, since it is necessary for the parser to produce a non-empty node of the correct category in the correct location to serve as an antecedent for the empty node.
    Table 4 provides these measures for the same two corpora described earlier.
    In an attempt to devise an evaluation measure for empty node co-indexation that depends less on syntactic structure we experimented with a modified augmented empty node representation in which each antecedent is represented by its head&#8217;s category and location.
    (The intuition behind this is that we do not want to penalize the empty node antecedentfinding algorithm if the parser misattaches modifiers to the antecedent).
    In fact this head-based antecedent representation yields scores very similiar to those obtained using the phrase-based representation.
    It seems that in the cases where the parser does not construct a phr
