 and selection, and Carroll et al. (1998) present a sentence simplification system based on linguistic parsing.
    However, these approaches do not employ statistical learning techniques to disambiguate simplification decisions, but iteratively apply symbolic reduction rules, producing a single output for each sentence.
    The goal of our approach is to apply the fine-grained tools for stochastic Lexical-Functional Grammar (LFG) parsing to the task of sentence condensation.
    The system presented in this paper is conceptualized as a tool that can be used as a standalone system for sentence condensation or simplification, or in combination with sentence extraction for text-summarization beyond the sentence-level.
    In our system, to produce a condensed version of a sentence, the sentence is first parsed using a broad-coverage LFG grammar for English.
    The parser produces a set of functional (f)-structures for an ambiguous sentence in a packed format.
    It presents these to the transfer component in
