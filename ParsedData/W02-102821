t does not actively steer the bootstrapping in a more promising direction.
    A more intelligent way to handle multiple categories is to incorporate knowledge about other categories directly into the scoring function.
    We modified Basilisk&#8217;s scoring function to prefer words that have strong evidence for one category but little or no evidence for competing categories.
    Each word wi in the candidate word pool receives a score for category ca based on the following formula: where AvgLog is the candidate scoring function used previously by Basilisk (see Equation 3) and the max function returns the maximum AvgLog value over all competing categories.
    For example, the score for each candidate LOCATION word will be its AvgLog score for the LOCATION category minus its maximum AvgLog score for all other categories.
    A word is ranked highly only if it has a high score for the targeted category and there is little evidence that it belongs to a different category.
    This has the effect of steering th
