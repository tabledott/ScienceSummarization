icularly strong portions with special implications for structure.

    3.2.3 Notation and Data Structures.
    In the computation of lexical chains, the following information is kept for each word in a chain: * T stands for transitively related * q is the word number through which the transitive relation is formed.
    A full example of this notation is shown in Figure 4.
    Figure 5 shows the generalized algorithm for computing lexical chains.
    The parameter values that we used are shown for the following: The only parameter not addressed in this work is which (if any) chains should be eliminated from the chain-finding process.
    This section is a discussion of problems encountered during the computation of the lexical chains contained in our corpus of texts.
    The text example used in this paper is in Section 4.2, and the chains found in the example are in Appendix A. well over 90% of the intuitive lexical relations in the five examples we studied.
