al dependencies makes it possible to compute the transderivational support for a particular relation and thus compute a weighting which takes account both of the probability of derivations yielding a specific relation and of the proportion of such derivations in the forest produced by the parser.
    A weighted set of GRs from the parse forest is now computed efficiently using a variant of the inside-outside algorithm (Watson et al., 2005).
  
  
    The new system has been evaluated using our reannotation of the PARC dependency bank (DepBank; King et al., 2003)&#8212;consisting of 560 sentences chosen randomly from section 23 of the Wall Street Journal&#8212;with grammatical relations compatible with our system.
    Briscoe and Carroll (2006) discuss issues raised by this reannotation.
    Relations take the following form: (relation subtype head dependent initial) where relation specifies the type of relationship between the head and dependent.
    The remaining subtype and initial slots encode additional s
