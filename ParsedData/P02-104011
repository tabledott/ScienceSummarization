the modified n-gram precisions.5,6 Experimentally, we obtain the best correlation with monolingual human judgments using a maximum n-gram order of 4, although 3-grams and 5-grams give comparable results.
    A candidate translation should be neither too long nor too short, and an evaluation metric should enforce this.
    To some extent, the n-gram precision already accomplishes this.
    N-gram precision penalizes spurious words in the candidate that do not appear in any of the reference translations.
    Additionally, modified precision is penalized if a word occurs more frequently in a candidate translation than its maximum reference count.
    This rewards using a word as many times as warranted and penalizes using a word more times than it occurs in any of the references.
    However, modified n-gram precision alone fails to enforce the proper translation length, as is illustrated in the short, absurd example below.
    Because this candidate is so short compared to the proper length, one expects to find
