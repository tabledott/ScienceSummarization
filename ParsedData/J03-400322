    From here on we will identify complements9 by attaching a -C suffix to nonterminals.
    Figure 5 shows the tree in Figure 2 with added complement markings.
    A postprocessing stage could add this detail to the parser output, but there are a couple of reasons for making the distinction while parsing.
    First, identifying complements is complex enough to warrant a probabilistic treatment.
    Lexical information is needed (for example, knowledge that week is likely to be a temporal modifier).
    Knowledge about subcategorization preferences (for example, that a verb takes exactly one subject) is also required.
    For example, week can sometimes be a subject, as in Last week was a good one, so the model must balance the preference for having a subject against the relative improbability of week&#8217;s being the headword of a subject.
