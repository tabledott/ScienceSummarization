  uk ABSTRACT This paper describes the referring expression generation mechanisms used in EPICURE, a com- puter program which produces natural language descriptions of cookery recipes.
  Major features of the system include: an underlying ontology which permits the representation f non-singular entities; a notion of diacriminatory power, to determine what properties hould be used in a description; and a PATR-like unification grammar to produce surface linguistic strings.
  INTRODUCTION EPICURE (Dale 1989a, 1989b) is a natural lan- guage generation system whose principal concern is the generation of referring expressions which pick out complex entities in connected iscourse.
  In particular, the system generates natural lan- guage descriptions of cookery recipes.
  Given a top level goal, the program first decompos
