 Web, using the Google search engine.
    Specifically, for each instance {x, y}E I, the system creates a set of queries, using each pattern in P instantiated with y.
    For example, given the instance &#8220;Italy, country&#8221; and the pattern &#8220;Y such as X&#8221;, the resulting Google query will be &#8220;country such as *&#8221;.
    New instances are then created from the retrieved Web results (e.g.
    &#8220;Canada, country&#8221;) and added to I.
    The noise generated from this expansion is attenuated by the filtering algorithm described in Section 3.3.
    Syntactic expansion: New instances are created from each instance {x, y}E I by extracting sub-terminological expressions from x corresponding to the syntactic head of terms.
    For example, the relation &#8220;new record of a criminal conviction part-of FBI report&#8221; expands to: &#8220;new record part-of FBI report&#8221;, and &#8220;record part-of FBI report&#8221;.
    Intuitively, a reliable pattern is one that is both highly preci
