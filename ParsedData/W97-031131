ing for speech recognition (Ries et at., 1996).
    To the extent that different applications have different objective functions, optimizing these functions can benefit from an understanding of how they differ.
    The present work was a step towards such understanding, because &amp;quot;an explication of a monolingual idiom might best be given after bilingual idioms have been properly understood&amp;quot; (Bar-Hillel, 1964, p. 48).
    The NCC discovery method makes few assumptions about the data sets from which the statistical translation models are induced.
    As demonstrated in Section 8, the method can find NCCs in English letter strings that are aligned with their phonetic representations.
    We hope to use this method to discover NCCs in other kinds of parallel data.
    A natural next target is bitexts involving Asian languages.
    Perhaps the method presented here, combined with an appropriate translation model, can make some progress on the word identification problem for languages like Chinese a
