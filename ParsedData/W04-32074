nglish).
    The primary rationale for this is that we are dealing with only a small quantity of labeled data in language L and therefore do not expect to be able to accurately estimate its lexical affinities.
    Further, synchronous parsing is in practice computationally expensive, and eliminating lexicalization on one side reduces the run-time of the parser from O(n8) to O(n7).
    Our parsing algorithm is a simple transformation of Melamed&#8217;s R2D parser that eliminates head information in all Korean parser items.
    The model event space for our stochastic &#8220;halfbilexicalized&#8221; 2-MTG consists of rewrite rules of the following two forms, with English above and L below: where upper-case symbols are nonterminals and lowercase symbols are words (potentially &#8709;).
    One approach to assigning a probability to such a rule is to make an independence assumption, for example: There are two powerful reasons to model the bilingual grammar in this factored way.
    First, we know of no treealigne
