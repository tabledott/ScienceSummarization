complex to accomplish the goal, which is admittedly greater than sense disambiguation.'
    Dahlgren's (1988) language understanding system includes a sense disambiguation component that uses a variety of types of information: fixed phrases, syntactic information (primarily, selectional restrictions), and commonsense reasoning.
    The reasoning module, because it is computationally intensive, is invoked only in cases where the other two methods fail to yield a result.
    Although her original assumption was that much disambiguation could be accomplished based on paragraph topic, she found that half of the disambiguation was actually accomplished using fixed phrase and syntactic information, while the other half was accomplished using commonsense reasoning.
    Reasoning often involves traversing an ontology to find common ancestors for words in context; her work anticipates Resnik's (1993a, 1993b, 1995a) results by determining that ontological similarity, involving a common ancestor in the ontology, is a po
