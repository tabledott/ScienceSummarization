 in a corpus may have empty bracketings, in which case the new algorithm behaves like the original one.
    To present the notion of compatibility between a derivation and a bracketed string, we need first to define the span of a symbol occurrence in a context-free derivation.
    Let (w,B) be a bracketed string, and ao = al &#8226; &#8226; &#8226; an, = w be a derivation of w for (S)CFG G. The span of a symbol occurrence in aj is defined inductively as follows: where for each 1 &lt; 1 &lt; k, j,) is the span of Xi in a3+1.
    The spans in aj of the symbol occurrences in /3 and 7 are the same as those of the corresponding symbols in aj+1.
    A derivation of w is then compatible with a bracketing B of ID if the span of every symbol occurrence in the derivation is valid in B.
  
  
    The inside-outside algorithm (Baker, 1979) is a reestimation procedure for the rule probabilities of a Chomsky normal-form (CNF) SCFG.
    It takes as inputs an initial CNF SCFG and a training corpus of sentences and it iterati
