stion answering sys tem.
			As the results below show, although questionclasses are still ambiguous, few mistakes are intro duced by our classifier in this step.
			4.3 Experimental Results.
			Performance of the hierarchical classifier Table 2 shows the P 5precision of the hierarchi cal classifier when trained on 5,500 examples andtested on the 500 TREC 10 questions.
			The re sults are quite encouraging; question classification is shown to be solved effectively using machine learning techniques.
			It also shows the contribution of the feature sets we defined.
			Overall, we get a98.80% precision for coarse classes with all the fea tures and 95% for the fine classes.
