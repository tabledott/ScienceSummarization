rds whose tags depend on their use.
    Further, we also need to be able to tag previously unseen words.
    Lexical resources have to offer the possible tags, and our mechanism has to choose the appropriate tag based on the context.
    Given a sufficient amount of manually tagged text, several approaches have demonstrated the ability to learn the instance of a tagging mechanism from manually labelled data and apply it successfully to unseen data.
    Those highquality resources are typically unavailable for many languages and their creation is labourintensive.
    We will describe an alternative needing much less human intervention.
    In this work, steps are undertaken to derive a lexicon of syntactic categories from unstructured text without prior linguistic knowledge.
    We employ two different techniques, one for highand medium frequency terms, one for mediumand low frequency terms.
    The categories will be used for the tagging of the same text where the categories were derived from.
    In this way
