 and head for m should satisfy wm,c, + wm,c,,t, &gt; log(u).
    We extended SampleSAT so that when it considers flipping any variable involved in such constraints (e.g., c or t above), it ensures that their new values still satisfy these constraints.
    The final clustering is found using the MaxWalkSAT weighted satisfiability solver (Kautz et al., 1997), with the appropriate extensions.
    We first ran a MaxWalkSAT pass with only finite-weight formulas, then ran another pass with all formulas.
    We found that this significantly improved the quality of the results that MaxWalkSAT returned.
  
  
    We implemented our method as an extension to the Alchemy system (Kok et al., 2007).
    Since our learning uses sampling, all results are the average of five runs using different random seeds.
    Our optimization problem is not convex, so initialization is important.
    The core of our model (head mixture) tends to cluster non-pronouns with the same head.
    Therefore, we initialized by setting all weights
