X3, an extension of the ACE (2004) (tern.mitre.org) TIMEX2 annotation scheme.
    For temporal relations, TimeML defines a TLINK tag that links tagged events to other events and/or times.
    For example, given (3a), a TLINK tag orders an instance of the event of entering to an instance of the drinking with the relation type AFTER.
    Likewise, given the sentence (3c), a TLINK tag will anchor the event instance of announcing to the time expression Tuesday (whose normalized value will be inferred from context), with the relation IS_INCLUDED.
    These inferences are shown (in slightly abbreviated form) in the annotations in (4) and (5).
    The anchor relation is an Event-Time TLINK, and the order relation is an Event-Event TLINK.
    TimeML uses 14 temporal relations in the TLINK RelTypes, which reduce to a disjunctive classification of 6 temporal relations RelTypes = {SIMULTANEOUS, IBEFORE, BEFORE, BEGINS, ENDS, INCLUDES}.
    An event or time is SIMULTANEOUS with another event or time if they occupy the sa
