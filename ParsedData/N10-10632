 nonparallel corpora.)
    In most previous work on extraction of parallel sentences from comparable corpora, some coarse document-level similarity is used to determine which document pairs contain parallel sentences.
    For identifying similar web pages, Resnik and Smith (2003) compare the HTML structure.
    Munteanu and Marcu (2005) use publication date and vector-based similarity (after projecting words through a bilingual dictionary) to identify similar news articles.
    Once promising document pairs are identified, the next step is to extract parallel sentences.
    Usually, some seed parallel data is assumed to be available.
    This data is used to train a word alignment model, such as IBM Model 1 (Brown et al., 1993) or HMM-based word alignment (Vogel et al., 1996).
    Statistics from this word alignment model are used to train a classifier which identifies bilingual sentence pairs as parallel or not parallel.
    This classifier is applied to all sentence pairs in documents which were found to be
