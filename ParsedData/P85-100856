t maps the predicate man into the predicate &amp;quot;almost a man', which is then applied to John.
    This representation is undesirable for our purposes since it is not first-order.
    It would be preferable to treat opaque operators as we do transparent ones, as properties of events or conditions.
    The sentence would be represented But does this get us into difficulty?
    First note that this representation does not imply that John is a man, for we have not asserted E's existence in the real world, and almost is opaque and does not imply its argument's existence.
    But is there enough information in E to allow one to determine the truth value of almost(E) in isolation; without appeal to other facts?
    The answer is that there could be.
    We can construct a model in which for every functional F there is a corresponding equivalent predicate q, such that (VP. ii(F(P)(x) (3e)q(e) A Plc, z)) The existence of the model shows that this condition is not necessarily contradictory.
