sed representation with more fine-grained lexico-semantic knowledge.
    One way to achieve this goal is to cluster entities based on their semantic relatedness, thereby creating a grid representation over lexical chains (Morris and Hirst 1991).
    An entirely different approach is to develop fully lexicalized models, akin to traditional language models.
    Cache language models (Kuhn and De Mori 1990) seem particularly promising in this context.
    The granularity of syntactic information is another topic that warrants further investigation.
    So far we have only considered the contribution of &#8220;core&#8221; grammatical relations to the grid construction.
    Expanding our grammatical categories to modifiers and adjuncts may provide additional information, in particular when considering machine generated texts.
    We also plan to investigate whether the proposed discourse representation and modeling approaches generalize across different languages.
    For instance the identification and extraction
