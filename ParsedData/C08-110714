nal rules inwhich the entailing template is infrequent.
			If an in frequent template has common instantiations with another template, the coverage of its features istypically high, whether or not an entailment relation exists between the two templates.
			This behav ior generates high-score incorrect rules.
			Based on this analysis, we propose a new measure that balances the two behaviors, termed 1We applied the best performing parameter values pre sented in (Bhagat et al, 2007) and (Weeds and Weir, 2003).Balanced-Inclusion (BInc).
			BInc identifies entail ing templates based on a directional measure but penalizes infrequent templates using a symmetric measure: BInc(l, r) = ? Lin(l, r) ? Precision(l, r) 3.4 Deriving Unary Rules From Binary Rules.
			An alternative way to learn unary rules is to first learn binary entailment rules and then derive unary rules from them.
			We derive unary rules from a given binary rule-base in two steps.
			First, for each binary rule, we generate all possible unary rules th
