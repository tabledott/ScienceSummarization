 effect in which popular trees are generated with increasingly high probabilities.
    Pitman-Yor Processes can control the strength of this effect somewhat by moving mass from existing tables to the base distribution.
    The PYP predictive distribution is: where a E [0, 1] and b &gt; 0 are adjustable parameters.
    It&#8217;s easy to see that the CRP is a special case of the PRP where a = 0 and b = &#945;.
    Each adaptor in an adaptor grammar can be viewed as estimating the probability of each adapted subtree t; this probability can differ substantially from t&#8217;s probability HX(t) under the base distribution.
    Because Words are adapted in the unigram adaptor grammar it effectively estimates the probability of each Word tree separately; the sampling estimators described in section 4 only instantiate those Words actually used in the analysis of Sentences in the corpus.
    While the Word adaptor will generally prefer to reuse Words that have been used elsewhere in the corpus, it is always possible
