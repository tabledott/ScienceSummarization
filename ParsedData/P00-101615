ntages and Disadvantages In the previous sections, we investigated the performance differences and resource costs involved for using humans to write rules vs. using them for annotations.
    In this section, we will further compare these system development paradigms.
    Annotation-based human participation has a number of significant practical advantages relative to developing a system by manual rule-writing: interdependencies when adding or revising rules, ultimately bounding continued rulesystem growth by cognitive load factors.
    &#8226; Annotation-based learning can more effectively combine the efforts of multiple individuals.
    The tagged sentences from different data sets can be simply concatenated to form a larger data set with broader coverage.
    In contrast, it is much more difficult, if not impossible, for a rule writer to resume where another one left off.
    Furthermore, combining rule lists is very difficult because of the tight and complex interaction between successive rules.
