on tree was compared with that of the algorithm we arrived at by trial and error as follows: The first 14 texts of Corpus 1 (845 descriptions) were used as training data to generate the decision tree.
    We then tested the learned algorithm over the other 6 texts of that corpus (195 instances of definite descriptions).
    Two different tests were undertaken: and discourse-new descriptions (639 descriptions); all cases classified as bridging, idiom, or doubt in the standard annotation were not given as input in the learning process.
    This algorithm was then only able to classify descriptions as one of those two classes.
    The resulting decision tree classifies descriptions with a same-head antecedent as anaphoric; all the rest as discourse-new.
    Here we present the results evaluated all together, considering the system as a classifier only, i.e., without considering the tasks of anaphora resolution and of identification of discourse-new descriptions separately.
    The output produced by the learned
