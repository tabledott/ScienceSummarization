2003), Named Entity recognition (Cumby and Roth, 2003; Culotta and Sorensen, 2004) and Semantic Parsing (Moschitti, 2004).
    The main tree kernel advantage is the possibility to generate a high number of syntactic features and let the learning algorithm to select those most relevant for a specific application.
    In contrast, their major drawback are (a) the computational time complexity which is superlinear in the number of tree nodes and (b) the accuracy that they produce is often lower than the one provided by linear models on manually designed features.
    To solve problem (a), a linear complexity algorithm for the subtree (ST) kernel computation, was designed in (Vishwanathan and Smola, 2002).
    Unfortunately, the ST set is rather poorer than the one generated by the subset tree (SST) kernel designed in (Collins and Duffy, 2002).
    Intuitively, an ST rooted in a node n of the target tree always contains all n&#8217;s descendants until the leaves.
    This does not hold for the SSTs whose leaves c
