trument: explosives We focus on these four string-based slots1 from the MUC-4 corpus, as is standard in this task.
    The corpus consists of 1300 documents, 733 of which are labeled with at least one template.
    There are six types of templates, but only four are modestly frequent: bombing (208 docs), kidnap (83 docs), attack (479 docs), and arson (40 docs).
    567 documents do not have any templates.
    Our learning algorithm does not know which documents contain (or do not contain) which templates.
    After learning event words that represent templates, we induce their slots, not knowing a priori how many there are, and then fill them in by extracting entities as in the standard task.
    In our example above, the three bold verbs (use, attack, wound) indicate the Bombing template, and their syntactic arguments fill its slots.
  
  
    Our goal is to learn templates that characterize a domain as described in unclustered, unlabeled documents.
    This presents a two-fold problem to the learner: it doe
