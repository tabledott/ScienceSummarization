s of parses.
    We have implemented a unification version of Schabes' (1991a) chart-based LR-like parser (which is polynomial in sentence length for CF grammars), but experiments with the ANLT grammar suggest that it offers no practical advantages over our Tomita-style parser, and Schabes' table construction algorithm yields less fine-grained and, therefore, less predictive parse tables.
    Nevertheless, searching the parse forest exhaustively to recover each distinct analysis proved computationally intractable for sentences over about 22 words in length.
    Wright, Wrigley, and Sharman (1991) describe a Viterbi-like algorithm for unpacking parse forests containing probabilities of (sub-)analyses to find the n-best analyses, but this approach does not generalize (except in a heuristic way) to our approach in which unification failure on the different extensions of packed nodes (resulting from differing super- or subanalyses) cannot be computed 'locally.'
    In subsequent work (Carroll and Briscoe 1992) we
