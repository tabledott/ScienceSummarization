    Learning the rule sequences can be achieved in a few hours and requires no language-specific knowledge.
    As discussed in Section 1, this simple algorithm could be used to adapt the output of an existing segmentation algorithm to different segmentation schemes as well as compensating for incomplete segmenter lexica, without requiring modifications to segmenters themselves.
    The rule-based algorithm we developed to improve word segmentation is very effective for segmenting Chinese; in fact, the rule sequences combined with a very simple initial segmentation, such as that from a maximum matching algorithm, produce performance comparable to manually-developed segmenters.
    As demonstrated by the experiment with the NMSU segmenter, the rule sequence algorithm can also be used to improve the output of an already highly-accurate segmenter, thus producing one of the best segmentation results reported in the literature.
    In addition to the excellent overall results in Chinese segmentatio
