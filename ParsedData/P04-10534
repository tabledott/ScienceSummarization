was introduced as a task in 2002.
    Most of approaches to the ACE RDC task involved supervised learning such as kernel methods (Zelenko et al., 2002) and need richly annotated corpora which are tagged with relation instances.
    The biggest problem with this approach is that it takes a great deal of time and effort to prepare annotated corpora large enough to apply supervised learning.
    In addition, the varieties of relations were limited to those defined by the ACE RDC task.
    In order to discover knowledge from diverse corpora, a broader range of relations would be necessary.
    Some previous work adopted a weakly supervised learning approach.
    This approach has the advantage of not needing large tagged corpora.
    Brin proposed the bootstrapping method for relation discovery (Brin, 1998).
    Brin&#8217;s method acquired patterns and examples by bootstrapping from a small initial set of seeds for a particular relation.
    Brin used a few samples of book titles and authors, collected common pa
