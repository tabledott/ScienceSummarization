s required to provide a fair conversion of the Collins trees: we did not want to penalize configurations in the Collins trees that encoded alternative but equally legitimate representations of the same linguistic properties (e.g. whether auxiliaries are encoded as main verbs or aspect features), but we also did not want to build into the conversion program transformations that compensate for information that Collins cannot provide without appealing to additional linguistic resources (such as identifying the subjects of infinitival complements).
    We did not include the time for dependency conversion in our measures of performance.
    The experimental results show that stochastic parsing with the Core LFG grammar achieves a better F-score than the Collins parser at a roughly comparable parsing speed.
    The XLE system achieves 12% reduction in error rate over the Collins parser, that is 77.6% F-score for the XLE system versus 74.6% for the Collins parser, at a cost in parsing time of a factor of 1.49.
