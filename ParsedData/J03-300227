nnotation from untrained speakers of both languages to obtain the small labeled sample.
    Several other systems for discovering parallel text, developed independently, can be described as operating within the same three-stage framework as STRAND.
    Parallel Text Miner (PTMiner) (Chen and Nie 2000) exploits already-existing Web search engines to locate pages by querying for pages in a given language that contain links to pages that are likely to be in the other language of interest.
    Once bilingual sites are located, they are crawled exhaustively.
    In order to generate candidate pairs, PTMiner uses a URL-matching process similar to the one described above; for example, the French translation of a URL like (http://www.foo.ca/english-index.html) might be (http://www.foo.ca/french-index.html).
    PTMiner&#8217;s matching process uses a mapping of language-specific prefixes and suffixes and does not handle cases in which URL matching requires multiple substitutions.
    PTMiner also applies a length fil
