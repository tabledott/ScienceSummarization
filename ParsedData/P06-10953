ightful baselines.
    Our work is, accordingly, evaluated in comparison against four baselines: (i) the usual majority class statistical baseline, shown along with each result, (ii) a more sophisticated baseline that uses hand-coded rules (Section 4.1), (iii) a hybrid baseline based on hand-coded rules expanded with Google-induced rules (Section 4.2), and (iv) a machine learning version that learns from imperfect annotation produced by (ii) (Section 4.3).
    TimeML (Pustejovsky et al. 2005) (www.timeml.org) is an annotation scheme for markup of events, times, and their temporal relations in news articles.
    The TimeML scheme flags tensed verbs, adjectives, and nominals with EVENT tags with various attributes, including the class of event, tense, grammatical aspect, polarity (negative or positive), any modal operators which govern the event being tagged, and cardinality of the event if it&#8217;s mentioned more than once.
    Likewise, time expressions are flagged and their values normalized, based on TIME
