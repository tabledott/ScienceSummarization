Burch 2007).
    In fact, examination of some RTE data sets in an attempt to quantitatively determine the presence of paraphrases has shown that a large percentage of the set consists of paraphrases rather than typical entailments (Bayer et al. 2005; Garoufi 2007).
    It has also been observed that, in the entailment challenges, it is relatively easy for submitted systems to recognize constructions that partially overlap in meaning (approximately paraphrastic) from those that are actually bound by an entailment relation.
    On the flip side, work has also been done to extend entailment recognition techniques for the purpose of paraphrase recognition (Rus, McCarthy, and Lintean 2008).
    Detection of semantic similarity and, to some extent, that of bidirectional entailment is usually an implicit part of paraphrase generation.
    However, given the interesting and diverse work that has been done in both these areas, we feel that any significant discussion beyond the treatment above merits a separate, detail
