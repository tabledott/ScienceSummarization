    (157K words) The goal of our work is to minimize the human annotation effort to learn a named entity recognizer with the same performance level as supervised learning.
    The performance of our model is evaluated using &#8220;precision/recall/F-measure&#8221;.
    In this section, we evaluate our selection strategies by comparing them with a random selection method, in which a batch of examples is randomly selected iteratively, on GENIA and MUC-6 corpus.
    Table 2 shows the amount of training data needed to achieve the performance of supervised learning usi
