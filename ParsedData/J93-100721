ttachment ambiguities (Hindle and Rooth 1990).
    They use the notion of mutual information as defined in information theory (Shannon 1948; Fano 1961) in a manner similar to what has been used in speech recognition (e.g., Ephraim and Rabiner 1990), or text compression (e.g., Bell, Witten, and Cleary 1989), to evaluate the correlation of common appearances of pairs of words.
    Their work, however, has some limitations too.
    First, by definition, it can only retrieve collocations of length two.
    This limitation is intrinsic to the technique used since mutual information scores are defined for two items.
    The second limitation is that many collocations identified in Church and Hanks (1989) do not really identify true collocations, but simply pairs of words that frequently appear together such as the pairs &amp;quot;doctor-nurse,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;doctor-bill,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;doctor-honorary,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;doctors-dentists,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;doctors-hospitals,&amp;quot; etc.
