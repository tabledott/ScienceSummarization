 how rules can correct errors generated by prior rules, note that applying the first transformation will result in the mistagging of the word actress.
    The 18th learned rule fixes this problem.
    This rule states: suffix ss.
    Keep in mind that no specific affixes are prespecified.
    A transformation can make reference to any string of characters up to a bounded length.
    So while the first rule specifies the English suffix &amp;quot;s&amp;quot;, the rule learner was not constrained from considering such nonsensical rules as: Also, absolutely no English-specific information (such as an affix list) need be prespecified in the learner.&amp;quot; We then ran the following experiment using 1.1 million words of the Penn Treebank Tagged Wall Street Journal Corpus.
    Of these, 950,000 words were used for training and 150,000 words were used for testing.
    Annotations of the test corpus were not used in any way to train the system.
    From the 950,000 word training corpus, 350,000 words were used to l
