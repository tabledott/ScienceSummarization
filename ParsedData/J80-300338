t of A's plan.
    Of interest here is the evaluation of the plausibility of step (3).
    Two heuristics are applicable.
    The proposition &amp;quot;Ws(ACT(S))&amp;quot; is 6 To improve readability of inference chains in the examples, we drop the prefix BsWA from all propositions.
    The formula on line (n) follows from the one on line (n-1) by the rule at the beginning of line (n).
    Applications of EI.1 will be labelled &amp;quot;rule&amp;quot;/EI.1, where &amp;quot;rule&amp;quot; is a PI rule embedded by EI.1.
    Similarly, applications of EI.2 and EI.3 will be labelled &amp;quot;rule&amp;quot;/EI.2 and &amp;quot;rule&amp;quot;/EI.3, where &amp;quot;rule&amp;quot; is a PC rule name. evaluated with respect to what S believes A believes.
    (Remember that BsWA should appear as a prefix to all propositions in inference chains.)
    If BsBAWs(ACT(S)) is true, the request interpretation is considered unlikely, by the effect-based heuristic.
    In addition, the preconditions of ACT(S) are considered wit
