 translation immigra&#184;c&#732;ao, as many words ending in -tion have translations with the same spelling except for the ending changed to -&#184;c&#732;ao.
    We examined the German words in our lexicon and tried to find English words that have the exact same spelling.
    Surprisingly, we could count a total of 976 such words.
    When checking them against a benchmark lexicon, we found these mappings to be 88% correct.
    The correctness of word mappings acquired in this fashion depends highly on word length.
    This is illustrated in Table 1: While identical 3letter words are only translations of each other 60% of the time, this is true for 98% of 10-letter words.
    Clearly, for shorter words, the accidental existence of an identically spelled word in the other language word is much higher.
    This includes words such as fee, ton, art, and tag. spelled words are in fact translations of each other: The accuracy of this assumption depends highly on the length of the words (see Section 2.1) Knowing t
