 whether or not a formalism can generate only structural descriptions with independent paths.
    This property reflects an important aspect of the underlying linguistic theory associated with the formalism.
    In a grammar which generates independent paths the derivations of sibling constituents can not share an unbounded amount of information.
    The importance of this property becomes clear in contrasting theories underlying GPSG (Gazdar, Klein, Pulluna, and Sag, 1985), and GB (as described by Berwick, 1984) with those underlying LFG and FUG.
    It is interesting to note, however, that the ability to produce a bounded number of dependent paths (where two dependent paths can share an unbounded amount of information) does not require machinery as powerful as that used in LFG, FUG and IG's.
    As illustrated by MCTAG's, it is possible for a formalism to give tree sets with bounded dependent paths while still sharing the constrained rewriting properties of CFG's, HG's, and TAG's.
