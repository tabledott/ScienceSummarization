 joint probability model performs consistently worse than the conditional probability model: It achieves an overall accuracy of 72.7%, which is significantly lower than the accuracy of the Rooth et al. (1999) model (x2(1) = 19.50, p &lt; .01).
    A similar picture emerges with regard to Prescher, Riezler, and Rooth&#8217;s (2000) data set (see Table 14).
    The conditional probability model achieves an accuracy of 66.7% for subjects and 70.5% for objects.
    The combined performance of 68.5% is significantly lower than the performance of both the VA model (x2(1) = 7.78, p &lt; .01) and the VO model (x2(1) = 33.28, p &lt; .01) reported by Prescher, Riezler, and Rooth (2000).
    Again, the joint probability model performs worse than the conditional probability model, achieving an overall accuracy of 62.4%.
    We also applied our Web-based method to the pseudodisambiguation data set of Clark and Weir (2002).
    Here, the conditional probability model reached a performance of 83.9% correct on the low-freque
