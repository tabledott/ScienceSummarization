ion or a multi-relation.
    A single relation consists of one literal, metaphorical, or anomalous relation.
    A multi-relation contains one literal, metaphorical, or anomalous relation plus either a single metonymy or a chain of metonymies.
    All these combinations, but only these, are derivable from Figure 1.
    Note that in the met* method as presented in Figure 1, semantic relations are tried in a certain order: literal, metonymic, metaphorical, and finally anomalous.
    This ordering implies that a literal interpretation is sought before a nonliteral one (cf.
    Harris 1976).
    The ordering results from thinking about discriminating the semantic relations in serial processing terms rather than parallel processing terms, particularly the serial order in which selection restrictions are evaluated and metonymic inference rules are tried: satisfied selection restrictions (indicating literalness) then metonymic inference (metonymy) then violated selection restrictions (metaphor or anomaly).
