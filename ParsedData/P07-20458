eit being less accurate, has only minimal impact on translation performance (Federico and Bertoldi 2006).
    6 Conclusion and Future Work This paper has presented a suite of open-source tools which we believe will be of value to the MT research community.
    We have also described a new SMT decoder which can incorporate some linguistic features in a consistent and flexible framework.
    This new direction in research opens up many possibilities and issues that require further research and experimentation.
    Initial results show the potential benefit of factors for statistical machine translation, (Koehn et al. 2006) and (Koehn and Hoang 2007).
  
  
    Phrase-based statistical machine translation (Koehn et al. 2003) has emerged as the dominant paradigm in machine translation research.
    However, until now, most work in this field has been carried out on proprietary and in-house research systems.
    This lack of openness has created a high barrier to entry for researchers as many of the components req
