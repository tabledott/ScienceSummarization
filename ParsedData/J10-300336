ain, on the paradigm of distributional similarity: one by positing a bootstrapping distributional similarity algorithm and the other by simply adapting the previously described dependency path similarity algorithm to work with a parallel corpus.
    The next two techniques rely on more direct, non-distributional methods to compute the required correspondences.
    Barzilay and McKeown (2001) align phrasal correspondences by attempting to move beyond a single-pass distributional similarity method.
    They propose a bootstrapping algorithm that allows for the gradual refinement of the features used to determine similarity and yields improved paraphrase pairs.
    As their input corpus, they use multiple human-written English translations of literary texts such as Madame Bovary and Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea that are expected to be rich in paraphrastic expressions because different translators would use their own words while still preserving the meaning of the original text.
