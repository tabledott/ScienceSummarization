th the error rate compared to using unweighted edits.
  
  
    Previous error models have all been based on Damerau-Levenshtein distance measures (Damerau 1964; Levenshtein 1966), where the distance between two strings is the minimum number of single character insertions, substitutions and deletions (and in some cases, character pair transpositions) necessary to derive one string from another.
    Improvements have been made by associating probabilities with individual edit operations.
    We propose a much more generic error model.
    Let be an alphabet.
    Our model allows all edit operations of the form 4 , where , E E * .
    P( 4 ) is the probability that when users intends to type the string they type instead.
    Note that the edit operations allowed in Church and Gale (1991), Mayes, Damerau et al. (1991) and Ristad and Yianilos (1997), are properly subsumed by our generic string to string substitutions.
    In addition, we condition on the position in the string that the edit occurs in, P( 4 1 PSN)
