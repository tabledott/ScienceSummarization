    Finally, [it performs the enhancement.ho As stated above, the structurer is a simplified top-down hierarchical expansion planner (see Figure 2).
    It operates as follows: given one or more communicative goals, it finds RST relations whose intended effects match (some of) these goals; it then inspects which of the input elements match the nucleus and subgoal constraints for each relation.
    Unmatched constraints become subgoals which are posted on an agenda for the next level of planning.
    The tree can be expanded in either depth-first or breadth-first fashion.
    Eventually, the structuring process bottoms out when either: (a) all input elements have been used and unsatisfied subgoals remain (in which case the structurer could request more input with desired properties from the encapsulating system); or (b) all goals are satisfied.
    If more than one plan (i.e., paragraph tree struc
