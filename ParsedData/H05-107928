			We used model building as an innovative technique to surmount this problem toa certain extent.
			Still, it will be unavoidable to incor porate automatic methods for knowledge acquisition to increase the performance of our approach.
			Future work will be directed to the acquisition of targeted paraphrases that can be converted into background knowledge in the form of axioms.
			Our hybrid approach combines shallow analysis with both theorem proving and model building and achieves high accuracy scores on the RTE dataset compared to other systems that we are aware of.
			The results for this approach also indicate that (a) the choice of entailment recognition methods might have to vary according to the dataset design and/or application and (b) that a method that wants to achieve robust performance across different datasetsmight n
