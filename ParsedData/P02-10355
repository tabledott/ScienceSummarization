l on LFG parses and the discriminative statistical estimation technique.
    Experimental results are reported in section 4.
    A discussion of results is in section 5.
  
  
    The grammar used for this project was developed in the ParGram project (Butt et al., 1999).
    It uses LFG as a formalism, producing c(onstituent)-structures (trees) and f(unctional)-structures (attribute value matrices) as output.
    The c-structures encode constituency.
    F-structures encode predicate-argument relations and other grammatical information, e.g., number, tense.
    The XLE parser (Maxwell and Kaplan, 1993) was used to produce packed representations, specifying all possible grammar analyses of the input.
    The grammar has 314 rules with regular expression right-hand sides which compile into a collection of finite-state machines with a total of 8,759 states and 19,695 arcs.
    The grammar uses several lexicons and two guessers: one guesser for words recognized by the morphological analyzer but not in the lexicon
