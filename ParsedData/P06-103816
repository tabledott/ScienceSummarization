 in each window separately.
    We now have a set of categories for each window.
    For the final set, we select only those categories that appear in at least two of the windows.
    This technique reduces noise at the potential cost of lowering coverage.
    However, the numbers of categories discovered and words they contain is still very large (see Section 5), so windowing achieves higher precision without hurting coverage in practice.
    The complexity of the merge stage is O(|V |) times the average number of categories per word times the average number of words per category.
    The latter two are small in practice, so complexity amounts to O(|V |).
  
  
    Lexical acquisition algorithms are notoriously hard to evaluate.
    We have attempted to be as thorough as possible, using several languages and both automatic and human evaluation.
    In the automatic part, we followed as closely as possible the methodology and data used in previous work, so that meaningful comparisons could be made.
    We per
