irs, OPINE.
			finds a SO label for each (w, f , s) input tuple.Each of these subtasks is cast as an unsupervised col lective classification problem and solved using the samemechanism.
			In each case, OPINE is given a set of objects (words, pairs or tuples) and a set of labels (SO labels); OPINE then searches for a global assignment of la bels to objects.
			In each case, OPINE makes use of local constraints on label assignments (e.g., conjunctions and disjunctions constraining the assignment of SO labels to words (Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown, 1997)).
			A key insight in OPINE is that the problem of searching for a global SO label assignment to words, pairs or tupleswhile trying to satisfy as many local constraints on as signments as possible is analogous to labeling problems in computer vision (e.g., model-based matching).
			OPINE uses a well-known computer vision technique, relaxation labeling (Hummel and Zucker, 1983), in order to solve the three subtasks described above.
