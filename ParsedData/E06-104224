ities results &#8211; a 9.4% improvement over the high similarity results (36.9%) and a 16.9% improvement over the baseline (29.4%).
    In comparing the individual results of all our learners, we found that the results for Learners A and D (46.7% and 46.3%) eclipsed Learners B and C by just over 2.5%.
    Using majority-rules voting with Learners A and D doubled, we were able to obtain an average f-score of 48.4%, showing that voting does to an extent balance out the learners&#8217; varying results on different words.
    The addition of SuperTags caused improvements in some words like &#8220;drag&#8221; and &#8220;stick&#8221;.
    The overall gain was only 0.5%, likely due to an overgeneration of similarities.
    Future work may identify ways to use SuperTags more effectively.
    The use of additional context was responsible for our second largest leap in performance after sum of similarities.
    We gained 4.9%, bringing us to an average f-score of 53.8%.
    Worth noting is that the target words exhibi
