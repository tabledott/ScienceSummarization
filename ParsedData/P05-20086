    In Figure 2, we see a clear indication that models trained on one domain do not perform as well on another domain.
    All differences are significant at a confidence interval of 99.9%.
    To investigate the effect of time on sentiment classification, we constructed a new set of movie reviews, following the same approach used by Pang et al. (2002) when they created the Polarity 1.0 dataset.
    The data source was the Internet Movie Review Database archive1 of movie reviews.
    The reviews were categorised as positive or negative using automatically extracted ratings.
    A review was ignored if it was not written in 2003 or 2004 (ensuring that the review was written after any in the Polarity 1.0 dataset).
    This procedure yielded a corpus of 716 negative and 2,669 positive reviews.
    To create the Polarity 20042 dataset we randomly selected 700 negative reviews and 700 positive reviews, matching the size and distribution of the Polarity 1.0 dataset.
    The next experiment evaluated the perform
