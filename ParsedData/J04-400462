    As Collins notes, removing both the distance metric and subcat features results in a gigantic drop in performance, since without both of these features, the model has no way to encode the fact that flatter structures should be avoided in several crucial cases, such as for PPs, which tend to prefer one argument to the right of their head-children.
    34 As a reviewer pointed out, the use of the comma constraint is a &#8220;published&#8221; detail.
    However, the specifics of how certain commas do not apply to the constraint is an &#8220;unpublished detail,&#8221; as mentioned in Section 7.2.
    Number of times our parsing engine was able to deliver a probability for the various levels of back-off of the modifier-word generation model, PMw, when testing on Section 00, having trained on Sections 02&#8211;21.
    In other words, this table reports how often a context in the back-off chain of PMw that was needed during decoding was observed in training. modeled primarily b
