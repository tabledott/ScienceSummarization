			6.2 Extraction Pattern Experiment.
			We evaluated the performance of the learned extrac tion patterns on the source identification task.
			The learned patterns were applied to the test data and the extracted sources were scored against the manualannotations.6 Table 1 shows that the extraction pat terns produced lower recall than the baselines, but with considerably higher precision.
			These results show that the extraction patterns alone can identify 6These results were obtained using the patterns that had a probability &gt; .50 and frequency &gt; 1.nearly half of the opinion sources with good accu racy.
			6.3 CRF Experiments.
			We developed our CRF model using the MALLET code from McCallum (2002).
			For training, we useda Gaussian prior of 0.25, selected based on the tuning data.
			We evaluate the CRF using the basic fea tures from Section 3, both with and without the IE pattern features from Section 5.
			Table 1 shows that the CRF with basic features outperforms all of thebaselines as well a
