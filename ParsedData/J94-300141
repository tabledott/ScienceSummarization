 for all L. Intersections and relative differences of arbitrary regular relations are not necessarily regular, however.
    We emphasize that all these set-theoretic, algebraic operations are also constructive and computational in nature: fsms or fsts that accept the languages and relations that these operations specify can be constructed directly from machines that accept their operands.
    Our rule translation procedures makes use of regular relations and languages created with five special operators.
    The first operator produces a relation that freely introduces symbols from a designated set S. This relation, Intro(S), is defined by the expression [Id(E) U Re} x ST.
    If the characters a and b are in E and S is {$}, for example, then Intro(S) contains an infinite set of string pairs including (a, a), (a, $a), (a, a$$$), (ab,$$a$b$$), and so on.
    Note that Intro(S)-1 removes all elements of S from a string if S is disjoint from E. The second is the Ignore operator.
    Given a regular language L an
