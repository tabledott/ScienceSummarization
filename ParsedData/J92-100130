    To recognize collocations during preprocessing, TRUMP uses a set of patterns, each of which lists the root words or syntactic categories that make up the collocation.
    For example, the pattern (TAKE (A) (ADJ) BATH) matches the clauses take a hot bath and takes hot baths.
    In a pattern, parentheses indicate optionality; the system encodes the repeatability of a category, such as adjectives, procedurally.
    Currently, there are patterns for verb-particle, verb-preposition, and verb-object collocations, as well as compound nouns.
    Initially, we acquired patterns for verb-object collocations by analyzing lists of root word pairs that were weighted for relative co-occurrence in a corpus of articles from the Dow Jones News Service (cf.
