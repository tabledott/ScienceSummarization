lity over LDA (Section 4).
    We show that L-LDA&#8217;s credit attribution ability enables it to greatly outperform supFigure 1: Graphical model of Labeled LDA: unlike standard LDA, both the label set &#923; as well as the topic prior &#945; influence the topic mixture e. port vector machines on a tag-driven snippet extraction task on web pages from del.icio.us (Section 6).
    And despite its generative semantics, we show that Labeled LDA is competitive with a strong baseline discriminative classifier on two multi-label text classification tasks (Section 7).
  
  
    Labeled LDA is a probabilistic graphical model that describes a process for generating a labeled document collection.
    Like Latent Dirichlet Allocation, Labeled LDA models each document as a mixture of underlying topics and generates each word from one topic.
    Unlike LDA, L-LDA incorporates supervision by simply constraining the topic model to use only those topics that correspond to a document&#8217;s (observed) label set.
