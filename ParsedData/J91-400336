    For discussion see Pustejovsky (in press). and provide a formal treatment for how the nominal semantics is expressed in these examples.
    Similar principles seem to be operating in the resultative constructions in Examples 23 and 24; namely, a systematic ambiguity is the result of principles of semantic composition rather than lexical ambiguity of the verbs.
    For example, the resultative interpretations for the verbs hammer in 23(b) and wipe in 24(b) arise from a similar operation, where both verbs are underlyingly specified with an event type of process.
    The adjectival phrases flat and clean, although clearly stative in nature, can also be interpreted as stage-level event predicates (cf.
    Dowty 1979).
    Notice, then, how the resultative construction requires no additional word sense for the verb, nor any special semantic machinery for the resultative interpretation to be available.
    Schematically, this is shown in Exa
