undary gaps of Figure 5 above. this one location (in the spirit of a Grosz and Sidner [1986] &amp;quot;pop&amp;quot; operation).
    Thus it displays low similarity both to itself and to its neighbors.
    This is an example of a breakdown caused by the assumptions about the subtopic structure.
    Because of the depth score cutoff, not all valleys are chosen as boundaries.
    Although there is a dip around paragraph gaps 5 and 6, no boundary is marked there.
    From the summary of the text's contents in Section 1, we know that paragraphs 4 and 5 discuss the moon's chemical composition while 6 to 8 discuss how it got its shape; these two subtopic discussions are more similar to one another in content than they are to the subtopics on either side of them, thus accounting for the small change in similarity.
    Five out of seven readers indicated a break between paragraphs 18 and 19.
    The algorithm registers a slight, but not significant valley at this point.
    Upon inspection it turns out that paragraph
