ur existing system with new sieves that model shallow discourse (i.e., speaker identification) and semantics (lexical chains and alias detection).
    Our results demonstrate that, despite their simplicity, deterministic models for coreference resolution obtain competitive results, e.g., we obtained the highest scores in both the closed and open tracks (57.8 and 58.3 respectively).
    The code used for this shared task is publicly released.5
