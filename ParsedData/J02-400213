 in a wider range of disciplines and subdisciplines other than those named.
    Our model relies on the following dimensions of document structure in scientific articles.
    Problem structure.
    Research is often described as a problem-solving activity (Jordan 1984; Trawinski 1989; Zappen 1983).
    Three information types can be expected to occur in any research article: problems (research goals), solutions (methods), and results.
    In many disciplines, particularly the experimental sciences, this problem-solution structure has been crystallized in a fixed presentation of the scientific material as introduction, method, result and discussion (van Dijk 1980).
    But many texts in computational linguistics do not adhere to this presentation, and our analysis therefore has to be based on the underlying logical (rhetorical) organization, using textual representation only as an indication.
    Intellectual attribution.
    Scientific texts should make clear what the new contribution is, as opposed to previo
