    English translation will be mostly parallel.
    This idea of translation alignment was central to the machine translation method pioneered at IBM [Bro93].
    The Word Alignment Filter exploits this observation, as illustrated in Figure 3.
    If word T in a target sentence is the translation of word S in the corresponding source sentence, then words occurring before S in the source sentence will likely correspond to words occurring before T in the target sentence.
    Likewise, words occurring after S in the source sentence will likely translate to words occurring after T in the target sentence.
    So S and T can be used as loci for partitioning the source and target sentences into two shorter pairs of corresponding word strings.
    Each such partition reduces the number of candidate translations from each sentence pair by approximately a factor of two &#8212; an ex
