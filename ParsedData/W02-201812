gorithms for parameter estimation in logistic regression, a problem similar to the one considered here, but it is difficult to transfer Minka&#8217;s results to ME models.
    For one, he evaluates the algorithms with randomly generated training data.
    However, the performance and accuracy of optimization algorithms can be sensitive to the specific numerical properties of the function being optimized; results based on random data may or may not carry over to more realistic problems.
    And, the test problems Minka considers are relatively small (100&#8211;500 dimensions).
    As we have seen, though, algorithms which perform well for small and medium scale problems may not always be applicable to problems with many thousands of dimensions.
    As a basis for the implementation, we have used PETSc (the &#8220;Portable, Extensible Toolkit for Scientific Computation&#8221;), a software library designed to ease development of programs which solve large systems of partial differential equations (Balay et al.,
