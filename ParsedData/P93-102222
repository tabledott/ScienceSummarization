ies using the other pairs of the corpus.
    The second set, of pairs with low probability, was obtained by constructing pairs that do not occur in the corpus.
    The two sets, each of them containing 150 pairs, were constructed randomly and were restricted to words with individual frequencies between 500 and 2500.
    We term these two sets as the occurring and non-occurring sets.
    The task of distinguishing between members of the two sets, without access to the deleted frequency information, is by no means trivial.
    Trying to use the individual word frequencies will result in performance close to that of using random selection.
    This is because the individual frequencies of all participating words are within the same range of values.
    To address the task, we used the following procedure: The frequency of each cooccurrence pair was estimated using the similarity-based estimation method.
    If the estimated frequency was above 2.5 (which was set arbitrarily as the average of 5 and 0), the pair w
