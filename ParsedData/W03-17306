open track is similar to closed one.
    The only difference is the size of training data set.
    In Peking University open track, ICTCLAS is trained on sixmonth news corpus that is 5 months more than closed track.
    The entire corpus is also from Peking University.
    Except for the additional corpus, we have not employed any other special libraries or other resources.
    As for CTB open track, we find that it cannot benefit from that 5 month PKU corpus.
    Actually, PKU standard is very different from CTB one though they seemed similar.
    Core lexicon extracted from Peking corpus degraded the performance on CTB testing data.
    Except for some named entity corpus, we could not get any more sources related to CTB standard.
    Therefore, CTB open track is operated in the similar way as closed track.
