sired function f will assign the correct output y the highest score among all the possible outputs.
    The global scoring function is often decomposed as a weighted sum of feature functions, This decomposition applies both to discriminative linear models and to generative models such as HMMs and CRFs, in which case the linear sum corresponds to log likelihood assigned to the input/output pair by the model (for details see (Roth, 1999) for the classification case and (Collins, 2002) for the structured case).
    Even when not dictated by the model, the feature functions fi(x, y) used are local to allow inference tractability.
    Local feature function can capture some context for each input or output variable, yet it is very limited to allow dynamic programming decoding during inference.
    Now, consider a scenario where we have a set of constraints C1, ... , CK.
    We define a constraint C : X &#215; Y &#57738; {0, 1} as a function that indicates whether the input/output sequence violates some desired pro
