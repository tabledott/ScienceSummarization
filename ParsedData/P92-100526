 implemented as procedures that search for properties, objects or indices in context.
    Scoping proceeds simply by the non-deterministic instantiation of scoping constraints, subject to the restrictions imposed on evaluable QLFs (Section 5), plus techniques for ignoring logically equivalent scopings, as for example described by Moran (1988).
    Preference and Disambiguation: A resolved QLF preserves all the information in the original unresolved QLF, and also records the correspondence between resolved and unresolved expressions.
    This makes it possible to define preference metrics that can be used for ranking alternative interpretations independently of the search strategies used to derive them.
    For example, in the case of scoping, these metrics can combine information about how far a quantifier was 'raised' with information about the surface form of its determiner.
    Preference ranking over alternative resolutions facilitates automatic disambiguation of input.
    Interactive disambiguation can
