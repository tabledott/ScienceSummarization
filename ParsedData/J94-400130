ed into a tree whose root node is the last bunsetsu in the sentence.
    This left-to-right head-dependent relation is characteristic of the sentential structure of Japanese, and the dependency analysis fits this very well.
    First, each conjunct of the CSs is analyzed.
    If there are two or more CSs in a nested structure in a sentence (i.e., having parent&#8212;child relations), each CS is analyzed from the innermost CS in the order of nesting level.
    Then finally, the main sentential component is analyzed.
    Because the pre- and post-conjuncts have their own consistent structures and meanings, they are parsed independently into dependency trees.
    The root nodes of these trees are the KB and the EB (the last bunsetsu of each conjunct).4 After analyzing a CS, a new node, called the CS node, is created that has two child nodes, KB and EB.
    The CS node inherits the property of the EB when it depends on a bunsetsu to the right of it, and it inherits the property of the KB and the EB when it govern
