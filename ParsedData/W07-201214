annotation, was to assign each document to as many clusters as entities were referred to on it with the ambiguous name.
			2.2 Evaluation measures.
			Evaluation was performed in each document set (web pages mentioning an ambiguous person name) of the data distributed as test.
			The human annotation was used as the gold standard for the evaluation.Each system was evaluated using the standard pu rity and inverse purity clustering measures Purity isrelated to the precision measure, well known in In formation Retrieval.
			This measure focuses on the frequency of the most common category in eachcluster, and rewards the clustering solutions that in troduce less noise in each cluster.
			Being C the set of clusters to be evaluated, L the set of categories (manually annotated) and n the number of clustered elements, purity is computed by taking the weighted average of maximal precision values: Purity = ? i |Ci| n max Precision(Ci, Lj)where the precision of a cluster Ci for a given cat egory Lj is defined as: Preci
