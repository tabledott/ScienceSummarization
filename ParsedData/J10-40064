 straightforward phenomenon tackled by DSMs is what Turney (2006b) calls attributional similarity, which encompasses standard taxonomic semantic relations such as synonymy, co-hyponymy, and hypernymy.
    Words like dog and puppy, for example, are attributionally similar in the sense that their meanings share a large number of attributes: They are animals, they bark, and so on.
    Attributional similarity is typically addressed by DSMs based on word collocates (Grefenstette 1994; Lund and Burgess 1996; Sch&#168;utze 1997; Bullinaria and Levy 2007; Pad&#180;o and Lapata 2007).
    These collocates are seen as proxies for various attributes of the concepts that the words denote.
    Words that share many collocates denote concepts that share many attributes.
    Both dog and puppy may occur near owner, leash, and bark, because these words denote properties that are shared by dogs and puppies.
    The attributional similarity between dog and puppy, as approximated by their contextual similarity, will be very hi
