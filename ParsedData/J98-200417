n the sentence through the end of the constituent under consideration.
    This allows us to take advantage of information already obtained in a left-right parse.
    We calculate this quantity as follows: 1VaL(1\li,k)0(Nli,k).
    We are again taking the geometric mean to avoid thrashing by compensating for the aL13 quantity's preference for shorter constituents, as explained in the previous section.
    We refer to this figure of merit as normalized at.13.
    We also derived an estimate of the ideal figure of merit that takes advantage of statistics on the first j &#8212; 1 tags of the sentence as well as ti,k.
    This estimate represents the probability of the constituent in the context of the preceding tags.
    We again make the independence assumption that p(t),k I NjA, to,i, ti) 13(NJ,k)* Additionally, we assume that p(Mk,to,i) and p(to,k) are independent of p(tk,n), giving: The denominator, p(to,k), is once again calculated from a tritag model.
    The p(Nihk,to,i) term is just au defined above in t
