igher weight to terms that occur in answers that receive a higher similarity score to the original query.
    In our experiments, expansion terms are ranked according to this modified tfidf calculation over the top 20 answers retrieved by the baseline retrieval run, and matched a second time with the field weight vector (0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.5, 0.2, 0.5, 0.3) that prefers answer fields over question fields.
    After stopword removal, the average number of expansion terms produced by the local expansion technique was 9.25.
    The test queries we used for retrieval are taken from query logs of the MetaCrawler search engine4 and were provided to us by Valentin Jijkoun.
    In order to maximize recall for the comparative evaluation of systems, we selected 60 queries that were well-formed natural language questions without metacharacters and spelling errors.
    However, for one third of these well-formed queries none of the five compared systems could retrieve an answer.
