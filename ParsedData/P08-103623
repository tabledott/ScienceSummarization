c split criterion based on the accuracy of the sentiment predictor in the MAS model.
    We found that both service and location did not benefit by the assignment of additional topics to their sentiment rating models.
    The experimental results suggest that the MAS model is reliable in the discovery of topics corresponding to the rated aspects.
    In the next section we will show that the induced topics can be used to accurately extract fragments for each aspect.
    A primary advantage of MAS over unsupervised models, such as MG-LDA or clustering, is that topics are linked to a rated aspect, i.e., we know exactly which topics model which aspects.
    As a result, these topics can be directly used to extract textual mentions that are relevant for an aspect.
    To test this, we hand labeled 779 random sentences from the dataset considered in the previous set of experiments.
    The sentences were labeled with one or more aspects.
    Among them, 164, 176 and 263 sentences were labeled as related to aspects
