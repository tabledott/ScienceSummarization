 1027 As mentioned in Section 2.1, we paramaterize the prior for synset i as a vector ?i, which sums to one, and a scale parameter S. The next step, once we?ve selected a topic, is to select a path within that topic.
			This requires the computation of the path probabilities as specified in Equation 4 for all of the paths wu can take in thesampled topic and then sampling from the path prob abilities.
			The Gibbs sampler is essentially a randomized hill climbing algorithm on the posterior likelihood as a function of the configuration of hidden variables.
			The numerator of Equation 1 is proportional to that posterior and thus allows us to track the sampler?s progress.
			We assess convergence to a local mode of the posterior by monitoring this quantity.
	
	
			In this section, we describe the properties of the topics induced by running the previously described Gibbs sampling method on corpora and how these topics improve WSD accuracy.
			Of the two data sets used during the course of our evaluation, the prim
