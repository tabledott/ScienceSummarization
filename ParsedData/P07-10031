dels of word alignment.
    This dependence runs deep; for example, Galley et al. (2006) requires word alignments to project trees from the target language to the source, while Chiang (2005) requires alignments to induce grammar rules.
    Word alignment models have not stood still in recent years.
    Unsupervised methods have seen substantial reductions in alignment error (Liang et al., 2006) as measured by the now much-maligned AER metric.
    A host of discriminative methods have been introduced (Taskar et al., 2005; Moore, 2005; Ayan 17 and Dorr, 2006).
    However, few of these methods have explicitly addressed the tension between word alignments and the syntactic processes that employ them (Cherry and Lin, 2006; Daum&#180;e III and Marcu, 2005; Lopez and Resnik, 2005).
    We are particularly motivated by systems like the one described in Galley et al. (2006), which constructs translations using tree-to-string transducer rules.
    These rules are extracted from a bitext annotated with both English (ta
