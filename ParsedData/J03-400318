make the assumption that the modifiers are generated independently of each other: In summary, the generation of the RHS of a rule such as (2), given the LHS, has been decomposed into three steps:5 For example, the probability of the rule S(bought) &#8594; NP(week) NP(IBM) VP(bought) would be estimated as In this example, and in the examples in the rest of the article, for brevity we omit the part-of-speech tags associated with words, writing, for example S(bought) rather than S(bought,VBD).
    We emphasize that throughout the models in this article, each word is always paired with its part of speech, either when the word is generated or when the word is being conditioned upon.
    3.1.1 Adding Distance to the Model.
    In this section we first describe how the model can be extended to be &#8220;history-based.&#8221; We then show how this extension can be utilized in incorporating &#8220;distance&#8221; features into the model.
    Black et al. (1992) originally introduced history-based models for parsing.
