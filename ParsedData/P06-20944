ery component is responsible for discovering salient patterns for the topic.
    The patterns will be extracted from the documents relevant to the topic which are gathered by an IR system.
    Several unsupervised pattern discovery techniques have been proposed, e.g.
    (Riloff 96), (Agichtein and Gravano 00) and (Yangarber et al. 00).
    Most recently we (Sudo et al. 03) proposed a method which is triggered by a user query to discover important patterns fully automatically.
    In this work, three different representation models for IE patterns were compared, and the sub-tree model was found more effective compared to the predicate-argument model and the chain model.
    In the sub-tree model, any connected part of a dependency tree for a sentence can be considered as a pattern.
    As it counts all possible sub-trees from all sentences in the retrieved documents, the computation is very expensive.
    This problem was solved by requiring that the sub-trees contain a predicate (verb) and restricting the nu
