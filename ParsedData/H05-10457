			For our sequence tagging problem, we create a linear-chain CRF based on an undirected graph G = (V,E), where V is the set of random variables Y = {Yi|1 ? i ? n}, one for each of n tokens in an input sentence; and E = {(Yi?1, Yi)|1 &lt; i ? n} is the set of n ? 1 edges forming a linear chain.
			For eachsentence x, we define a non-negative clique poten tial exp( ?K k=1 ?kfk(yi?1, yi, x)) for each edge, and exp(?K?k=1 ??kf ?k(yi, x)) for each node, where fk(...)
			is a binary feature indicator function, ?k is a weight assigned for each feature function, and K and K ? are the number of features defined for edges and nodes respectively.
