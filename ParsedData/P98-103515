rses by using a rule-based approach again.
    The headword of a phrase is the word that best represents the phrase, all the other words in the phrase being modifiers of the headword.
    Statistically speaking, we were satisfied with the output of an enhanced version of the procedure described in (Collins, 1996) &#8212; also known under the name &amp;quot;Magerman Sz Black Headword Percolation Rules&amp;quot;.
    Once the position of the headword within a constituent &#8212; equivalent with a CF production of the type Z -4 Y1... Y,2 , where Z, Yr, are nonterminal labels or POStags (only for Yi) &#8212; is identified to be k, we binarize the constituent as follows: depending on the Z identity, a fixed rule is used to decide which of the two binarization schemes in Figure 8 to apply.
    The intermediate nodes created by the above binarization schemes receive the nonterminal label Z'.
