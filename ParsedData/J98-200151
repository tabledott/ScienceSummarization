ed as either larger situation or unfamiliar as members of the same class.
    And indeed, the agreement figures went up from K = 0.63 to K = 0.68 (ignoring doubts) when we did so, i.e., within the &amp;quot;tentative&amp;quot; margins of agreement according to Carletta (1996) (0.68 &lt; x &lt; 0.8).
    The remaining difference between the level of agreement obtained in this experiment and that obtained in the first one (K = 0.73, ignoring doubts) might have to do with the annotators, with the difficulty of the texts, or with using a syntactic (same head) as opposed to a semantic notion of what counts as coreferential; we are inclined to think that the last two explanations are more likely.
    For one thing, we found very few examples of true mistakes in the annotation, as discussed below.
    Secondly, we observed that the coefficient of agreement changes dramatically from text to text: in this second experiment, it varies from K = 0.42 to K = 0.92 depending on the text, and if we do not count the three wor
