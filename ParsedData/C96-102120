on 3 makes use of the observation that a dis- course referent contains every object o its right with a non-nil EMBED value.
			The algorithm identifies as dis- joint a discourse referent and every pronoun which fol- lows it and has a non-nil EMBED value, until a discourse referent with EMBED value NIL is located (marking the end of the containment domain).
			Condiditon 3 also rules out coreference between a genitive pronoun and the NP it modifies.
			After the morphological nd syntactic filters have been applied, the set of discourse referents that remain constitute the set of candidate antecedents for the pro- noun.
			The candidate set is subjected to a final evalu- ation procedure which performs two functions: it de- creases the salience of candidates which the pronoun precedes (cataphora is penalized), and it increases the sa li ence of candida tes which satisfy either a locality or a parallelism condition (described below), both of which apply to intrasentential c ndidates.
