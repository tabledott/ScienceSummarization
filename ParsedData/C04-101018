Table 2 shows the dependency accuracy, root accuracy and complete match scores for our best parser (Model 2 with label set B) in comparison with Collins (1997) (Model 3), Charniak (2000), and Yamada and Matsumoto (2003).5 It is clear that, with respect to unlabeled accuracy, our parser does not quite reach state-of-the-art performance, evenif we limit the competition to deterministic meth ods such as that of Yamada and Matsumoto (2003).
			We believe that there are mainly three reasons for this.
			First of all, the part-of-speech tagger used for preprocessing in our experiments has a loweraccuracy than the one used by Yamada and Mat sumoto (2003) (96.1% vs. 97.1%).
			Although this is not a very interesting explanation, it undoubtedly accounts for part of the difference.
			Secondly, since 5The information in the first three rows is taken directly from Yamada and Matsumoto (2003).our parser makes crucial use of dependency type in formation in predicting the next action of the parser, it is very likely that i
