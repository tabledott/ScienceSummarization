 to be a promising direction with state-of-the-art translation results and reasonable decoding speed.
    This work can thus be viewed as a compromise between string-based and tree-based paradigms, with a good trade-off between speed and accuarcy.
    For future work, we would like to use packed forests not only in decoding, but also for translation rule extraction during training.

    We would also like to thank Chris Quirk for inspirations, Yang Liu for help with rule extraction, Mark Johnson for posing the question of virtual &#8734;-best list, and the anonymous reviewers for suggestions.
