er&#8217;s option to analyse words assigned multiple tags when the posterior probability of the highest ranked tag is less than 0.9, and the next n tags have probability greater than 150 of it.
    Based on the most likely parse for each identified sentence, we extract the rule names from the phrase structure (PS) tree.
    RASP&#8217;s rule names are semiautomatically generated and encode detailed information about the grammatical constructions found (e.g.
    V1/modal bse/+-, &#8216;a VP consisting of a modal auxiliary head followed by an (optional) adverbial phrase, followed by a VP headed by a verb with base inflection&#8217;).
    Moreover, rule names explicitly represent information about peripheral or rare constructions (e.g.
    S/pp-ap s-r, &#8216;a S with preposed PP with adjectival complement, e.g. for better or worse, he left&#8217;), as well as about fragmentary and likely extragrammatical sequences (e.g.
    T/txt-frag, &#8216;a text unit consisting of 2 or more subanalyses that cannot be combin
