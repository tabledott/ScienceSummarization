			Here, coverage is defined as the percentage of phrases which have translations selected, while top n accuracy is defined as the percentage of phrases whose selected top n translations include correct translations.
			For EM-NBC-Ensemble, we set the ? !in (4) to be 5 on the basis of our preliminary experimental results.
			For EM-TF-IDF, we used the non-web data described in Section 4.4 to estimate idf values of words.
			We used contexts with window sizes of ?1, ?3, ?5, ?7, ?9, ?11.
