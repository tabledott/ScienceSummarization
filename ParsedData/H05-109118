ters : NP seized : (S\NP )/NP several : NP/NP stations : NP The transitive verb ?seized?
			expects two arguments: a noun phrase to the right (the object) and another noun phrase to the left (the subject).
			Similarly, the adjective ?several?
			expects a noun phrase to its right.
			Depending on whether its valency is greater than zero or not, a syntactic category is called a functor or an argument.
			In the example above, ?seized?
			and?several?
			are functors, while ?protesters?
			and ?sta tions?
			are arguments.
			Syntactic categories are combined using a smallset of typed combinatory rules such as functional ap plication, composition and type raising.
			In Table 3we show a sample derivation based on three func tional applications.
