n object is described through its relations with other objects (Dale and Haddock 1991; Horacek 1997; Krahmer, van Erk, and Verleg 2001).
    More crucially, we follow Dale and Reiter (1995) in focusing on the semantic content of a description (i.e., the problem of content determination, for short), assuming that any combination of properties can be expressed by the NLG module responsible for linguistic realization.
    This modular approach allows us to separate logical aspects of generation (which are largely language independent) from purely linguistic aspects, and it allows the realization module to base its decisions on complete information about which combination of properties is to be realized.
    Accordingly, when we write Generation of Referring Expressions or GRE, we will refer specifically to determination of the semantic content of a description.
    Analogously, the word description will refer to the semantic content of a linguistic expression only.
    Note that our modular approach makes it unn
