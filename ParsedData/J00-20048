    My goal here is only to demonstrate the value of some previously unused kinds of information that are always available for translation modeling, and to show how these information sources can be integrated with others.
    A review of some previously published translation models follows an introduction to translation model taxonomy The core of the article is a presentation of the model estimation biases described above.
    The last section reports the results of experiments designed to evaluate these innovations.
    Throughout this article, I shall use CAGEIg'RAPHIC letters to denote entire text corpora and other sets of sets, CAPITAL letters to denote collections, including sequences and bags, and italics for scalar variables.
    I shall also distinguish between types and tokens by using bold font for the former and plain font for the latter.
  
  
    There are two kinds of applications of translation models: those where word order plays a crucial role and those where it doesn't.
