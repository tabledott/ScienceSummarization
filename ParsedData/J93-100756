    This section presents an evaluation of the retrieval performance of the third stage of Xtract.
    Deciding whether a given word combination is a valid or invalid collocation is actually a difficult task that is best done by a lexicographer.
    Jeffery Triggs is a lexicographer working for the Oxford English Dictionary (OED) coordinating the North American Readers program of OED at Bell Communication Research.
    Jeffery Triggs agreed to go over manually several thousands of collocations.'
    In order to have an unbiased experiment we had to be able to evaluate the performance of Xtract against a human expert.
    We had to have the lexicographer and Xtract perform the same task.
    To do this in an unbiased way we randomly selected a subset of about 4,000 collocations after the first two stages of Xtract.
    This set of collocations thus contained some good collocations and some bad ones.
    This data set was then evaluated by the lexicographer and the third stage of Xtract.
