 leaves, Alternatively, we can write this equation recursively as R(D) if D is a rule V(D)= {oki 1 V(D) if v _ (b: D1, Dk) Continuing our example, the value of the item derivation tree of Figure 6 is the same as the value of the first grammar derivation.
    Let inner(x) represent the set of all item derivation trees headed by an item x.
    Then the value of x is the sum of all the values of all item derivation trees headed by x.
    Formally, The value of a sentence is just the value of the goal item, V(goal).
    2.4.4 Iso-valued Derivations.
    In certain cases, a particular grammar derivation and a particular item derivation will have the same value for any semiring and any rule value function R. In this case, we say that the two derivations are iso-valued.
    In particular, if and only if the same rules occur in the same order in both derivations, then their values will always be the same, and they are iso-valued.
    In Figure 6, the grammar derivation and item derivation meet this condition.
    In
