    Starred examples are correct in corpus; alternates are parse errors. string speculator Richard Denthese structures are typically bracketed flat in the ETB, underspecifying the semantic relations relative to the CTB.
    In CTB parsing, this type of ambiguity is difficult to resolve; different compound NP parses differ in dependency structure, so the dependency model resolves errors when word frequencies are large enough to be reliable, but this is often not possible.
    We found that the internal distributions of (i) NP modifiers of NPs and (ii) left-modified NPs both differ from the internal distribution of NPs in general; we take advantage of this in the PCFG model by marking both types (i) and (ii), which reduces the bias against NP-NP modification in compound NPs.
    Prenominal modification errors, illustrated in PNM of Figure 4, are rather infrequ
