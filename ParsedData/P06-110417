tors.
    2) More importantly, the ACE 2004 data defines 43 entity subtypes while there are only 3 subtypes in the 2003 data.
    The detailed classification in the 2004 data leads to significant performance improvement of 6.2 (54.4-48.2) in Fmeasure over that on the 2003 data.
    Our composite kernel can achieve 77.3/65.6/70.9 and 76.1/68.4/72.1 in P/R/F over the ACE 2003/2004 major types, respectively. compare our method with previous work on the ACE 2002/2003/2004 data, respectively.
    They show that our method outperforms the previous methods and significantly outperforms the previous two dependency kernels4.
    This may be due to two reasons: 1) the dependency tree (Culotta and Sorensen, 2004) and the shortest path (Bunescu and Mooney, 2005) lack the internal hierarchical phrase structure information, so their corresponding kernels can only carry out node-matching directly over the nodes with word tokens; 2) the parse tree kernel has less constraints.
    That is, it is 4 Bunescu and Mooney (2005) us
