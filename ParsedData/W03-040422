 region).
    We concluded that the appropriate way to benefit from the subjective nouns is to use them in tandem with other subjectivity clues.
    Table 8 shows the results of Naive Bayes classifiers trained with different combinations of features.
    The accuracy differences between all pairs of experiments in Table 8 are statistically significant.
    Row (3) uses only the WBO features (also shown in Table 7 as a baseline).
    Row (2) uses the WBO features as well as the SubjNoun features.
    There is a synergy between these feature sets: using both types of features achieves better performance than either one alone.
    The difference is mainly precision, presumably because the classifier found more and better combinations of features.
    In Row (1), we also added the manual and discourse features.
    The discourse features explicitly identify contexts in which multiple clues are found.
    This classifier produced even better performance, achieving 81.3% precision with 77.4% recall.
    The 76.1% a
