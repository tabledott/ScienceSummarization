atures to distinguish them.
    We have made some preliminary investigations into selecting pages according to the number of mentions, as opposed to by random.
    The results have not been conclusive, and continuing work is investigating the cause.
    The above results have utilized pseudoname test sets where high accuracy ground truth is automatically available in large quantities [O(1000) examples per name] to better distinguish model performance.
    Table 6 shows the performance on the four O(60) example hand-labeled test sets for naturally occurring polysemous person names.
    Given that this is an n-ary classification task, for consistency with the above experiments the data were assigned to one of 3 clusters, corresponding to the 2 automatically derived first-pass majority seed sets and the residual &#8220;other-use&#8221; classification, but evaluated strictly on performance for the two major senses.
    While additional analyses could be accomplished on the residual sets, this is difficult given t
