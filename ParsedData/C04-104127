			Kaplan et al (2004) report high parsing speedsfor a deep parsing system which uses an LFG gram mar: 1.9 sentences per second for 560 sentencesfrom section 23 of the Penn Treebank.
			They also re port speeds for the publicly available Collins parser (Collins, 1999): 2.8 sentences per second for the same set.
			The best speeds we have reported for the CCG parser are an order of magnitude faster.
	
	
			This paper has shown that by tightly integrating a supertagger with a CCG parser, very fast parse times can be achieved for Penn Treebank WSJ text.
			As far as we are aware, the times reported here are an orderof magnitude faster than any reported for compara ble systems using linguistically motivated grammar formalisms.
			The techniques we have presented inthis paper increase the speed of the parser by a factor of 77.
			This makes this parser suitable for large scale NLP tasks.The results also suggest that further improvements can be obtained by improving the supertagger, which should be po
