  A Semantic-Head-Driven Generation Algorithm For Unification-Based Formalisms
  
    We present an algorithm for generating strings from logical form encodings that improves upon previous algorithms in that it places fewer restrictions on the class of grammars to which it is applicable.
    In particular, unlike an Earley deduction generator (Shieber, 1988), it allows use of semantically nonmonotonic grammars, yet unlike topdown methods, it also permits left-recursion.
    The enabling design feature of the algorithm is its implicit traversal of the analysis tree for the string being generated in a semantic-head-driven fashion.
  
  
    The problem of generating a well-formed naturallanguage expression from an encoding of its meaning possesses certain properties which distinguish it from the converse problem of recovering a meaning encoding from a given natural-language expression.
    In previous work (Shieber, 1988), however, one of us attempted to characterize these differing properties in such a way th
