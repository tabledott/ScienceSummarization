ose other distributions that do not factor in L34&#8217;s reciprocal influence on them.
    This prevents (e.g.)
    L34 and T3 from mutually reinforcing each other&#8217;s existing beliefs. an HMM, for example, BP reduces to the forwardbackward algorithm.
    BP&#8217;s estimates of these distributions are called beliefs about the variables.
    BP also computes beliefs about the factors, which are useful in learning &#952; (see &#167;7).
    E.g., if the model includes the factor TAGLINKij, which is connected to variables Lij, Ti, Tj, then BP will estimate the marginal joint distribution p(Lij, Ti, Tj) over (boolean, tag, tag) triples.
    When the factor graph has loops, BP&#8217;s beliefs are usually not the true marginals of equation (1) (which are in general intractable to compute).
    Indeed, BP&#8217;s beliefs may not be the true marginals of any distribution p(A) over assignments, i.e., they may be globally inconsistent.
    All BP does is to incrementally adjust the beliefs till they are at least l
