 were automatically extracted from the parsed version of the Treebank, guided by the tree structure, the syntactic constituent labels, the part-of-speech tags and by knowledge about which tags can be heads of which constituents.
    However, some trees are very complex and some annotations are inconsistent.
    What to think about a VP in which the main verb is tagged as NN (common noun)?
    Either we allow NNs as heads of VPs (not very elegant but which is what we did) or we have a VP without a head.
    The first solution might also introduce errors elsewhere... As Ramshaw and Marcus (1995) already noted: &amp;quot;While this automatic derivation process introduced a small percentage of errors on its own, it was the only practical way both to provide the amount of training data required and to allow for fully-automatic testing.&amp;quot;
  
  
    For the CoNLL shared task, we have chosen to work with the same sections of the Penn Treebank as the widely used data set for base noun phrase recognition (Ramsh
