 nonterminals, so we would not expect table label resampling to have any effect on its analyses.
    On the other hand, the collocation-syllable adaptor grammar involves a rich hierarchical structure, and in fact without table label resampling our sampler did not burn in or mix within 2,000 iterations.
    As Figure 1 shows, table label resampling produces parses with higher posterior probability, and Table 1 shows that table label resampling makes a significant difference in the word segmentation f-score of the collocation and collocation-syllable adaptor grammars.
  
  
    This paper has examined adaptor grammar inference procedures and their effect on the word segmentation problem.
    Some of the techniques investigated here, such as batch versus incremental initialization, are quite general and may be applicable to a wide range of other algorithms, but some of the other techniques, such as table label resampling, are specialized to nonparametric hierarchical Bayesian inference.
