ly deterministic parser; 3) the way we incorporate posterior constraints outperforms the generalized expectation constraint framework; and 4) our model exhibits low variance when seeded with different initializations.
    These results are summarized in Table 6 and discussed in detail below; line numbers refer to entries in Table 6.
    Each run of HDP-DEP below is with syntactic refinement enabled.
    Impact of Rules Selection We compare the performance of HDP-DEP using the universal rules versus a set of rules designed for deterministically parsing the Penn Treebank (see Section 5 for details).
    As lines 1 and 5 of Table 6 show, language-specific rules yield better performance.
    For sentences of length 10 or less, the difference between the two rulesets is a relatively small 1.9%; for longer sentences, however, the difference is a substantially larger 15.7%.
    This is likely because longer sentences tend to be more complex and thus exhibit more language-idiosyncratic dependencies.
    Such dependen
