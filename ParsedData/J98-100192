cations will therefore hopefully inform and enhance future work.
    Finally, if a lesson is to be learned from a review of the history of WSD, it is that research can be very myopic and, as a result, tends to revisit many of the same issues over time.
    This is especially true when work on a problem has been cross-disciplinary.
    There is some movement toward more merging of research from various areas, at least as far as language processing is con cerned, spurred by the practical problems of information access that we are facing as a result of rapid technological development.
    Hopefully, this will contribute to further progress on WSD.
