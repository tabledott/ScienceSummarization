tance than the classification success of frequent-category items.
    When looking at the numerical values, however, one should keep in mind that macroaveraging results are in general numerically lower (Yang and Liu 1999).
    This is because there are fewer training cases for the rare categories, which therefore perform worse with most classifiers.
    In the case of kappa, classifications that incorrectly favor frequent categories are punished because of a high random agreement.
    This effect can be shown most easily when the baselines are considered.
    The most ambitious baseline we use is the output of a text categorization system, as described in section 4.
    Other possible baselines, which are all easier to beat, include classification by the most frequent category.
    This baseline turns out to be trivial, as it does not extract any of the rare rhetorical categories in which we are particularly interested, and therefore receives a low kappa value at K = &#8722;.12.
