 the lack of concise consistency checks on what MWEs should and should not be incorporated into dictionaries.
    While recognising the dangers associated with dictionarybased evaluation, we commit ourselves to this paradigm and focus on searching for appropriate means of demonstrating the correlation between dictionary- and corpus-based similarities.
    The remainder of this paper is structured as follows.
    Section 2 describes past research on MWE compositionality of relevance to this effort.
    Section 3 provides a basic outline of the resources used in this research, LSA, the MWE extraction methods, and measures used to evaluate our method.
    Section 4 then provides evaluation of the proposed method, and the paper is concluded with a brief discussion in Section 5.
  
  
    Although there has been some useful work on compositionality in statistical machine translation (e.g.
    Melamed (1997)), there has been little work on detecting &#8220;non-compositional&#8221; (i.e. non-decomposable and idiosyn
