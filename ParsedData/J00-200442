distributions, under the usual independence assumptions: Table 3 summarizes the variables involved in this auxiliary estimation process.
    The factors on the right-hand side of Equation 29 can be written explicitly with the help of a mixture coefficient.
    Let T be the probability that an arbitrary co-occurring pair of word types are mutual translations.
    Let B (kIn , p) denote the probability that k links are observed out of n co-occurrences, where k has a binomial distribution with parameters n and p. Then the probability that word types u and v will be linked links(u, v) times out of cooc(u, v) co-occurrences is a mixture of two binomials: One more variable allows us to express T in terms of A+ and A- : Let A be the probability that an arbitrary co-occuring pair of word tokens will be linked, regardless of whether they are mutual translations.
    Since T is constant over all word types, it also represents the probability that an arbitrary co-occurring pair of word tokens are mutual translations.
