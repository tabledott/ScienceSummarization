at Traum and Hinkelman called the &#8220;core speech act&#8221; level&#8212;and confirming that the question has been understood, a dialogue act operating at the &#8220;grounding&#8221; level and usually known as Acknowledgment (Ack).
    In older dialogue act tagsets, acknowledgments and statements were treated as alternative labels at the same &#8220;level&#8221;, forcing coders to choose one or the other when an utterance performed a dual function, according to a well-specified set of instructions.
    By contrast, in the annotation schemes inspired from these newer theories such as DAMSL (Allen and Core 1997), coders are allowed to assign tags along distinct &#8220;dimensions&#8221; or &#8220;levels&#8221;.
    Two annotation experiments testing this solution to the &#8220;multi-tag&#8221; problem with the DAMSL scheme were reported in Core and Allen (1997) and Di Eugenio et al. (1998).
    In both studies, coders were allowed to mark each communicative function independently: That is, they were allowed t
