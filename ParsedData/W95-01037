pending on up to 3 elements of the (v, nl, p, n2) quadruple.
    (Typical examples would be 'If P=of then choose noun attachment' or 'If V= buy and P=for choose verb attachment').
    A further experiment incorporated word-class information from WordNet into the model, by allowing the transformations to look at classes as well as the words.
    (An example would be 'If N2 is in the time semantic class, choose verb attachment').
    The method gave 80.8% accuracy with words only, 81.8% with words and semantic classes, and they also report an accuracy of 75.8% for the metric of [HR93] on this data.
    Transformations (using words only) score 81.9%1 on the IBM data used in this paper.
    'Personal communication from Brill.
    [RRR94] use the data described in section 2.1 of this paper - 20801 training and 3097 test examples from Wall Street Journal.
    They use a maximum entropy model which also considers subsets of the quadruple.
    Each sub-tuple predicts noun or verb attachment with a weight indicating i
