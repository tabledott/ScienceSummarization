ignment levels: a phrase-level alignment between phrases and a wordlevel alignment between single words.
    As a result the context of words has a greater influence, and the changes in word order from source to target language can be learned explicitly.
    An advantage of this method is that machine translation is learned fully automatically through the use of a bilingual training corpus.
    We have shown that the presented approach is capable of achieving better translation results on various tasks compared to other statistical, example-based, or rule-based translation systems.
    This is especially interesting, as our system is structured simpler than many competing systems.
    We expect that better translation can be achieved by using models that go beyond the flat phrase segmentation that we perform in our model.
    A promising avenue is to gradually extend the model to take into account to some extent the recursive structure of natural languages using ideas from Wu and Wong (1998) or Alshawi, Banga
