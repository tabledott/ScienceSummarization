999) which reduces the probability of a subtree by a factor of two for each non-root nonterminal it contains.
    It easy to see that this is equivalent to reducing the probability of a tree by a factor of four for each pair of nonterminals it contains, resulting in the PCFG reduction in figure 4.
    Tested on the OVIS corpus, Bonnema et al. 's proposal obtains results that are comparable to Sima'an (1999) -- see Bonnema et al.
    (1999).
    This paper presents the first published results with this estimator on the WSJ.
    By using these PCFG-reductions we can thus parse with all subtrees in polynomial time.
    However, as mentioned above, efficient parsing does not necessarily mean efficient disambiguation: the exact computation of the most probable parse remains exponential.
    In this paper, we will estimate the most probable parse by computing the 10,000 most probable derivations by means of Viterbi n-best, from which the most likely parse is estimated by summing up the probabilities of the derivati
