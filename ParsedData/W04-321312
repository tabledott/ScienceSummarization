 class.
    Thus, differs from by dropping the noun, and by treating all prepositional slots as the same slot.
    This formula allows us to generalize over a slot regardless of the particular noun, and preposition if there is one, used in the instance.
    Classes of nouns in the model are given by the WordNet hierarchy.
    Determining the appropriate level of generalization for a noun is an open problem (e.g., Clark and Weir, 2002).
    Currently, we use a cut through WordNet including all the top categories, except for the category &#8220;entity&#8221;; the latter, because of its generality, is replaced in the cut by its immediate children (Schulte im Walde, 2003).
    Given a noun argument, all of its ancestors that appear in this cut are used as the class(es) for the noun.
    (Credit for a noun is apportioned equally across multiple classes.)
    Unknown words placed in a separate category.
    This yields a noun classification system that is very coarse and that does not distinguish between senses, bu
