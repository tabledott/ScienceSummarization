ypes of opinion expressions, direct subjective expressions and expressive subjective elements.
  
  
    In this paper, we described our work on mining opinions from unstructured documents.
    We focused on extracting relations between product features and opinion expressions.
    The novelties of our work included: 1) we defined the phrase dependency parsing and proposed an approach to construct the phrase dependency trees; 2) we proposed a new tree kernel function to model the phrase dependency trees.
    Experimental results show that our approach improved the performances of the mining task.
