n we justify either of these probability distributions?
    Each seems to be making rather bold assumptions, with no empirical justification.
    Put another way, these two models assume more than we actually know about the expert's decision-making process.
    All we know is that the expert chose exclusively from among these five French phrases; given this, the most intuitively appealing model is the following: This model, which allocates the total probability evenly among the five possible phrases, is the most uniform model subject to our knowledge.
    It is not, however, the most uniform overall; that model would grant an equal probability to every possible French phrase.
    We might hope to glean more clues about the expert's decisions from our sample.
    Suppose we notice that the expert chose either dims or en 30% of the time.
    We could apply this knowledge to update our model of the translation process by requiring that p satisfy two constraints: Once again there are many probability distribution
