rd vectors, that is, vectors obtained via the respective corpus for words that are not on our stoplist: And do the same with point-wise multiplication: The multiplication model in (13) can be seen as an instantiation of the categorical compositional framework put forward by Clark et al. (2008).
    In fact, a variety of multiplication-based models can be derived from this framework; and comparisons against component-wise multiplication on phrase similarity tasks yield comparable results (Grefenstette and Sadrzadeh, 2011a; Grefenstette and Sadrzadeh, 2011b).
    We thus opt for the model (13) as an example of compositional models based on multiplication due to its good performance across a variety of tasks, including language modeling and prediction of reading difficulty (Mitchell, 2011).
    Our third method, for creating phrase and sentence vectors alike, is the application of Socher et al. (2011a)&#8217;s model.
    They use the Stanford parser (Klein and Manning, 2003) to create a binary parse tree for eac
