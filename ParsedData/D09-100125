e same according to the model.
    The second operator is to create a new cluster by composing two existing ones, denoted by COMPOSE(CR, CA), which does the following: COMPOSE creates clusters of large lambda-forms if they tend to be composed of the same subforms (e.g., the lambda form for &#8220;is next to&#8221;).
    These lambda-forms may later be merged with other clusters (e.g., borders).
    At learning time, USP maintains an agenda that contains operations that have been evaluated and are pending execution.
    During initialization, USP forms a part and creates a new cluster for each unary atom u(n).
    It also assigns binary atoms of the form b(n, n&#8242;) to the part as argument forms and creates a new argument type for each.
    This forms the initial clustering and semantic parses.
    USP then merges clusters with the same core form (i.e., the same unary predicate) using MERGE.8 At each step, USP evaluates the candidate operations and adds them to the agenda if the improvement is 8Word-sense d
