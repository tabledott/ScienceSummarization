redundancy.
			However, the lexical approach to syntax is built on the assumption that the lexicon is structured.
			To create a lexicon that is structured according to linguistic generalizations, weintroduced lexical templates early on in the development of PATR.
			Templates are graphs that contain structure shared by a class of lexical entries.
			Lexical graphs can be partially or fully defined in terms of templates, which themselves can be defined in terms of templates.
			If a template name appeam in the definition of some graph, the graph is simply unified with the graph denoted by the template.
			The next augmentation is already built into the formalism.
			Categorial grammarians have recognized the limitations of fimctional application as the sole mode of combining constituents for a long time.
			One of the obvious extensions to classical categorial grammar was the utilization of functional composition as a further combination mode.
			A good example of a categorial grammar that employs both functi
