cause we use tree sequences as the basic translation units.
    Thereby, our model can capture all phrases.
    In this sense, our model behaves like a phrasebased model, less sensitive to discontinuous phrases (Wellington et al., 2006).
    Our additional experiments also verify that discontinuous phrase rules are complementary to syntactic phrase rules (Bod, 2007) while non-syntactic phrase rules may compromise the contribution of discontinuous phrase rules.
    Table 4 reports the numbers of these two kinds of rules.
    It shows that around 30% rules are shared by the two kinds of rule sets.
    These overlapped rules contain at least two non-terminal leaf nodes plus two terminal leaf nodes, which implies that longer rules do not affect performance too much.
    Fig.
    5 studies the impact when setting different maximal tree depth ( h ) in a rule on the performance.
    It demonstrates that: 1) Significant performance improvement is achieved when the value of h is increased from 1 to 2.
    This can be
