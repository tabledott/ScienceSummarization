as being correct as well.We note that each argument was considered sep arately.
			For example, we marked a mention of a divorced person as entailing the marriage of that person, but did not consider the place and time of the divorce act to be those of the marriage .
	
	
			We implemented the unary rule learning algo rithms described in Section 3 and the binary DIRT algorithm (Lin and Pantel, 2001).
			We executed each method over the Reuters RCV1 corpus 3 , learning for each template r in the corpus the top100 rules in which r is entailed by another tem plate l, ?l? r?.
			All rules were learned in canonical form (Szpektor and Dagan, 2007).
			The rule-base learned by binary DIRT was taken as the input for deriving unary rules from binary rules.
			The performance of each acquired rule-base was measured for each ACE event.
			We measured the percentage of correct argument mentions extracted out of all correct argument mentions annotated for the event (recall) and out of all argument mentionsextracted for the
