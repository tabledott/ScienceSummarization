    Each word list Lr is generated by first drawing a list length from fr and then independently populating that list from the property&#8217;s word distribution Br.1 Past work has employed broadly similar distributional models for unsupervised NER of proper men1There is one exception: the sizes of the proper and nominal head property lists are jointly generated, but their word lists are still independently populated. tions (Collins and Singer, 1999; Elsner et al., 2009).
    However, to our knowledge, this is the first work to incorporate such a model into an entity reference process.
    The discourse module is responsible for choosing an entity to evoke at each of the n mention positions.
    Formally, this module generates an entity assignment vector Z = (Zl, ... , Zn), where Zi indicates the entity index for the ith mention position.
