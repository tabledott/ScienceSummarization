			In the upper part of Table 9 we see the degradation inperformance by leaving out one feature or a feature fam ily at a time.
			After the addition of all the new features, it is the case that removal of no individual feature exceptpredicate degrades the classification performance significantly, as there are some other features that provide com plimentary information.
			However, removal of predicate information hurts performance significantly, so does the removal of a family of features, eg., all phr
