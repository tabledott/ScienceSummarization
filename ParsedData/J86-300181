 DSP satisfaction-precedes the interrupted segment and is dominated by some other segment's DSP.
    Hence, it is a specialization of the weak definition of interruptions.
    This type of interruption differs from true interruptions both intentionally and linguistically: the DSP for the flashback bears some relationship to the DP for the whole discourse.
    The linguistic indicator of the flashback typically includes a comment about something going wrong.
    In addition the audience always remains the same, whereas it may change for a true interruption (as in the example of the previous section).
    In the example below, taken from Sidner (1982), the 1CP is instructing a mock-up system (mimicked by a person) about how to define and display certain information in a particular knowledge-representation language.
    Again the interruption is indicated by italics.
