on divergence between the topic distributions for each pair of individual documents in S that were originally part of the same tuple prior to separation.
    The lower the divergence, the more similar the distributions are to each other.
    From the results in figure 4, we know that leaving all document tuples intact should result in a mean JS divergence of less than 0.1.
    Table 3 shows mean JS divergences for each value of p. As expected, JS divergence is greater than that obtained when all tuples are left intact.
    Divergence drops significantly when the proportion of &#8220;glue&#8221; tuples increases from 0.01 to 0.25.
    Example topics for p = 0.01 and p = 0.25 are shown in table 4.
    At p = 0.01 (1% &#8220;glue&#8221; documents), German and French both include words relating to Russia, while the English and Italian word distributions appear locally consistent but unrelated to Russia.
    At p = 0.25, the top words for all four languages are related to Russia.
    These results demonstrate that
