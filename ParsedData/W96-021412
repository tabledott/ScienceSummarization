obability.
    If every subtree in the training corpus occurred exactly once, this would be trivial to prove.
    For every STSG subderivation, there would be an isomorphic PCFG subderivation, with equal probability.
    Thus for every STSG derivation, there would be an isomorphic PCFG derivation, with equal probability.
    Thus every STSG tree would be produced by the PCFG with equal probability.
    However, it is extremely likely that some subtrees, especially trivial ones like If the STSG formalism were modified slightly, so that trees could occur multiple times, then our relationship could be made one to one.
    Consider a modified form of the DOP model, in which when subtrees occurred multiple times in the training corpus, their counts were not merged: both identical trees are added to the grammar.
    Each of these trees will have a lower probability than if their counts were merged.
    This would change the probabilities of the derivations; however the probabilities of parse trees would not change,
