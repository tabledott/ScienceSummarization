n.
			We chose this statistic because it has previously beenfound to be effective for automatically construct ing translation lexicons (e.g., Melamed, 2000).
			We compute LLR scores using the following formula presented by Moore (2004): LLR(f, e) = ? f??{f,?f} ? e??{e,?e} C(f?, e?)
			log p(f?|e?)p(f?) In this formula f and e mean that the words whose degree of association is being measured occur in the respective target and source sentences of an alignedsentence pair, ?f and ?e mean that the correspond ing words do not occur in the respective sentences, f?
			and e?
			are variables ranging over these values,and C(f?, e?)
			is the observed joint count for the values of f?
			and e?.
			All the probabilities in the for mula refer to maximum likelihood estimates.
			The LLR score for a pair of words is high if the words have either a strong positive association or a strong negative association.
			Since we expect translation pairs to be positively associated, we discard any negatively associated word pairs b
