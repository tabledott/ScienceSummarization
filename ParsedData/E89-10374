combined into a single structure.
    Yet that diverse information is still accessible to determine the set of target strings that adequately translate a source string.
    We also achieve modularity of a more basic sort: our correspondence mechanism permits contrastive transfer rules that depend on but do not duplicate the specifications of independently motivated grammars of the source and target languages (Isabelle and Macklovitch, 1986; Netter and Wedekind, 1986).
  
  
    Our approach uses the equality- and description-based mechanisms of Lexical-Functional Grammar.
    As introduced by Kaplan and Bresnan (1982), lexical-functional grammar assigns to every sentence two levels of syntactic representation, a constituent structure (c-structure) and a functional structure (f-structure).
    These structures are of different formal types&#8212;the c-structure is a phrase-structure tree while the f-structure is a hierarchical finite function&#8212;and they characterize different aspects of the information car
