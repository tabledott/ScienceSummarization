To accomplish this goal, we have chosen to remove descriptions of many open research questions posed in Grosz, Joshi, and Weinstein (1986) as well as solutions that were only partially developed.
    We have also greatly shortened the discussion of criteria for and constraints on a possible semantic theory as a foundation for this work.
  
  
    This paper presents an initial attempt to develop a theory that relates focus of attention, choice of referring expression, and perceived coherence of utterances within a discourse segment.
    The research described here is a further development of several strands of previous research.
    It fits within a larger effort to provide an overall theory of discourse structure and meaning.
    In this section we describe the larger research context of this work and then briefly discuss the previous work that led to it.
    Centering fits within the theory of discourse structure developed by Grosz and Sidner (1986).
    Grosz and Sidner distinguish among three components o
