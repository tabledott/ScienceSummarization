			The baseline is 69.9% (choosing the most frequent class label none).
			The overall accuracy of this module is state-of-the-art compared with results reported in the literature (Knight and Chander 1994, Minnen et al 2000, Lee 2004, Turner and Charniak 2007).
			Turner and Charniak 2007 obtained the best reported accuracy to date of 86.74%, using a Charniak language model (Charniak 2001) based on a full statistical parser on the Penn Tree Bank.
			These numbers are, of course, not directly comparable, given the different corpora.
