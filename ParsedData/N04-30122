    In addition, each concept is defined by a short gloss that may include an example usage.
    All of this information can be brought to bear in creating measures of relatedness.
    As a result these measures tend to be more flexible, and allow for relatedness values to be assigned across parts of speech (e.g., the verb murder and the noun gun).
    This paper continues with an overview of the measures supported in WordNet::Similarity, and then provides a brief description of how the package can be used.
    We close with a summary of research that has employed WordNet::Similarity.
  
  
    Three of the six measures of similarity are based on the information content of the least common subsumer (LCS) of concepts A and B.
    Information content is a measure of the specificity of a concept, and the LCS of concepts A and B is the most specific concept that is an ancestor of both A and B.
    These measures include res (Resnik, 1995), lin (
