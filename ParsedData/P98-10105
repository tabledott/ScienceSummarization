 the pattern enables us to generalize over the exact structures that are present in the corpus.
    Similarly, we also consider the negative evidence for such sub-parts by noting where they occur in the corpus without being a corresponding part of a target instance.
    The proposed method, as described in detail in the next section, formalizes this type of reasoning.
    It searches specialized data structures for both positive and negative evidence for sub-parts of the candidate structure, and considers additional factors such as context and evidence overlap.
    Section 3 presents experimental results for three target syntactic patterns in English, and Section 4 describes related work.
  
  
    The input to the Memory-Based Sequence Learning (MBSL) algorithm is a sentence represented as a sequence of POS tags, and its output is a bracketed sentence, indicating which subsequences of the sentence are to be considered instances of the target pattern (target instances).
    MBSL determines the bracketing by f
