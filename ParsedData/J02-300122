rse tree.
    During testing, the parser is run on the test sentences and the same features are extracted.
    Probabilities for each possible semantic role r are then computed from the features.
    The probability computation is described in the next section; here we discuss the features used.
    The features used represent various aspects of the syntactic structure of the sentence as well as lexical information.
    The relationship between such surface manifestations and semantic roles is the subject of linking theory (see Levin and Rappaport Hovav [1996] for a synthesis of work in this area).
    In general, linking theory argues that the syntactic realization of arguments of a predicate is predictable from semantics; exactly how this relationship works, however, is the subject of much debate.
    Regardless of the underlying mechanisms used to generate syntax from semantics, the relationship between the two suggests that it may be possible to learn to recognize semantic relationships from syntactic cue
