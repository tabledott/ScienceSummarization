    When there is such evidence, we propose using the latent class model to correct the disagreements; this model posits an unobserved (latent) variable to explain the correlations among the judges' observations.
    The remainder of this section describes these models in more detail.
    All models can be evaluated using the freeware package CoCo, which was developed by Badsberg (1995) and is available at: http: / /web.math.auc.dkr jhb/CoCo.
    A probability model enforces constraints on the counts in the data.
    The degree to which the counts in the data conform to the constraints is called the fit of the model.
    In this work, model fit is reported in terms of the likelihood ratio statistic, G2, and its significance (Read and Cressie, 1988; Dunning, 1993).
    The higher the G2 value, the poorer the fit.
    We will consider model fit to be acceptable if its reference significance level is greater than 0.01 (i.e., if there is greater than a 0.01 probability that the data sample was randomly select
