    Given RB, a simple algorithm reconstructs the bracketing 13: for each word x and depth 0 &lt; d, some &#65533; Some of the links in the common cover link set are redundant.
    The first redundancy is the result of brackets having more than one generator.
    The bracketing reconstruction algorithm outlined above can construct a bracket from the links based at any of its generators.
    The bracketing 13 can therefore be reconstructed from a subset R if, for every bracket B E 13, R contains the links based at least at one generator) of B.
    Such a set R is a representative subset of (see figure 1(b)).
    A second redundancy in the set follows from the linear transitivity of where if there is a This property implies that longer links can be deduced from shorter links.
    It is, therefore, sufficient to leave only the shortest necessary links in the set.
    Given a representative subset R of a shortest common cover link set of is constructed by removing any link which can be deduced from shorter
