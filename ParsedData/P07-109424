    With MLHMM, different tokens of the same word type are usually assigned to the same cluster, but types are assigned to clusters more or less at random, and all clusters have approximately the same number of types (542 on average, with a standard deviation of 174).
    The clusters found by BHMM2 tend to be more coherent and more variable in size: in the 5 runs of BHMM2, the average number of types per cluster ranged from 436 to 465 (i.e., tokens of the same word are spread over fewer clusters than in MLHMM), with a standard deviation between 460 and 674.
    Determiners, prepositions, the possessive marker, and various kinds of punctuation are mostly clustered coherently.
    Nouns are spread over a few clusters, partly due to a distinction found between common and proper nouns.
    Likewise, modal verbs and the copula are mostly separated from other verbs.
    Errors are often sensible: adjectives and nouns are frequently confused, as are verbs and adverbs.
