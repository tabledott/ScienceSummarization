    This score measures the precision of unigrams, bigrams, trigrams and fourgrams with respect to a whole set of reference translations with a penalty for too short sentences (Papineni et al., 2001).
    BLEU measures accuracy, i.e. large BLEU scores are better.
    For a more detailed analysis, subjective judgments by test persons are necessary.
    Each translated sentence was judged by a human examiner according to an error scale from 0.0 to 1.0 (Nie&#223;en et al., 2000).
    In this section, we will present the translation results for both the IBM constraints and the baseline ITG constraints.
    We used a single-word based search with IBM Model 4.
    The initialization for the ITG constraints was done with monotone IBM Model 4 translations.
    So, the only difference between the two systems are the reordering constraints.
    In Tab.
    5 the results for the Verbmobil task are shown.
    We see that the results on this task are similar.
