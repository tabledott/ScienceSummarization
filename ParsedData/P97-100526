llows us to define the relationships between different genres instead of regarding them as atomic entities.
    We also have a framework for accommodating new genres as yet unseen bundles of facets.
    Finally, by decomposing genres into facets, we can concentrate on whatever generic aspect is important in a particular application (e.g., narrativity for one looking for accounts of the storming of the Bastille).
    Further practical tests of our theory will come in applications of genre classification to tagging, summarization, and other tasks in computational linguistics.
    We are particularly interested in applications to information retrieval where users are often looking for texts with particular, quite narrow generic properties: authoritatively written documents, opinion pieces. scientific articles, and so on.
    Sorting search results according to genre will gain importance as the typical data base becomes increasingly heterogeneous.
    We hope to show that the usefulness of retrieval tools can be
