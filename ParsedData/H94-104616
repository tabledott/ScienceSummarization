ed twice in the same sentence with man/n2 and four times with man/n6, but neither horse/n or man/n co-occurred in the same sentence with save/v.
  If we then take the most frequent of the two co-occurring senses of manht, we select man/n2.
  But no co-occurrence information isprovided as to which one of the 7 senses of save/v should be chosen; for save/v it is necessary toresort o the most frequent sense, as described above.
  The co-occurrence h uristic was defined as follows.
  First, compile a semantic o-occurrence matrix.
  That is to say, for every word- sense in the semantic oncordance, compile a list of all the other word-senses that co-occur with h in any sentence.
  Then, on encountering a noun, verb, adjective, or adverb in the test material, look it up in WordNet.
  If the word is monosemous, assign that sense to it.
  If the word has more than one sense in WordNet, con- suit the semantic co-occurrence matrix to determine what senses of the word co-occur in the training material with other words in
