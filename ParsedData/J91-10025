hains do not stop at sentence boundaries.
    They can connect a pair of adjacent words or range over an entire text.
    Lexical chains tend to delineate portions of text that have a strong unity of meaning.
    Consider this example (sentences 31-33 from the long example given in Section 4.2): Example 6 In front of me lay a virgin crescent cut out of pine bush.
    A dozen houses were going up, in various stages of construction, surrounded by hummocks of dry earth and stands of precariously tall trees nude halfway up their trunks.
    They were the kind of trees you might see in the mountains.
    A lexical chain spanning these three sentences is {virgin, pine, bush, trees, trunks, trees}.
    Section 3 will explain how such chains are formed.
    Section 4 is an analysis of the correspondence between lexical chains and the structure of the text.
    There are two major reasons why lexical cohesion is important for computational text understanding systems: 1.2.1 Word Interpretation in Context.
