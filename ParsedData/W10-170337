    In fact, the relationship between the amount of data and the correlation values is very strong, and it is reasonable to expect the correlation numbers for English-to-* to catch up had more data been collected.
    We also measure rank correlations when applying some simple methods of cleaning/weighting MTurk data.

    The numbers 300 and 62 were chosen since those are the points at which the MTurk data reaches the level of expert data in the inter-annotator agreement and RPR of the experts.
    The fourth and fifth methods (&#8220;Weighted by Ke,,p&#8221; and &#8220;
