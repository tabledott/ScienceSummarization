ince the &#8220;truth&#8221; in this task is a matter for human judgment, we rely on bilingual speakers to judge independently whether page pairs are actually translations of each other for any given test set.
    In our experience no bilingual speaker is completely comfortable saying that another person&#8217;s translation is a good translation, so in creating the gold standard, we instead ask, &#8220;Was this pair of pages intended to provide the same content in the two different languages?&#8221; Asking the question in this way leads to high rates of interjudge agreement, as measured using Cohen&#8217;s &#954; measure.
    2.2.1 Using Manually Set Parameters.
    Using the manually set thresholds for dp and n, we have obtained 100% precision and 68.6% recall in an experiment using STRAND to find English-French Web pages (Resnik 1999).
    In that experiment, 326 candidate pairs, randomly selected from a larger set of 16,763 candidates, were judged by two human annotators.
    The humans agreed (i.e., both
