 handled with Binding Theory constitutes only a small portion of the total performance gain using path coreference.
    In any case, Binding Theory remains a challenge with a noisy parser.
    Consider: &#8220;Alex gave her money.&#8221; Minipar parses her as a possessive, when it is more likely an object, &#8220;Alex gave money to her.&#8221; Without a correct parse, we cannot rule out the link between her and Alex through Binding Theory.
    Our algorithm, however, learns that the path &#8220;Noun gave pronoun&#8217;s money,&#8221; is noncoreferent.
    In a sense, it corrects for parser errors by learning when coreference should be blocked, given any consistent parse of the sentence.
    We obtain path coreference for millions of paths from our parsed news corpus (Section 4).
    While Tables 1 and 2 give test set examples, many other interesting paths are obtained.
    We learn coreference is unlikely between the nouns in &#8220;Bob married his mother,&#8221; or &#8220;Sue wrote her obituary.&#8221; The f
