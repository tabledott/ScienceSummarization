inishing a first installment of semantically tagged text consisting of 100 passages from the Brown Corpus; as soon as that much has been completed and satisfactorily cleaned up, we plan to make it, and the corresponding WordNet database, available to other labora- tories that also have permission to use the Brown Corpus.
  We expect hat such distribution will stimulate further uses for semantic oncordances, uses that we have not yet ima- gined.
  CONCLUSION The fact that we have control of the lexical component of our semantic oncordance enables us to shape the lexicon to fit the corpus.
  It would be possible, of course, to create a specific semantic oncordance with a lexicon limited strictly to the words occurring in the accompanying corpus.
  That constraint would have certain size advantages, but would miss the opportunity to build a single general exicon onto which a wide variety of corpora could be mapped.
  The universal semantic concordance described here has enabled us to improve WordNet and has give
