    There is not yet a well-established methodology for evaluating automatically acquired lexical knowledge.
    One possibility is to compare the automatically identified relationships with relationships listed in a manually compiled dictionary.
    For example, (Lin, 1998) compared automatically created thesaurus with the WordNet (Miller et a).., 1990) and Roget's Thesaurus.
