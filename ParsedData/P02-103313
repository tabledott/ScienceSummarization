s, equally weighted, if there is a tie.
    (The SENSEVAL evaluation measures allow for partial credit.)
    This criterion is fairly sensitive to noise in target sets; for example, in a real corpus the French catastrophe is aligned with English {catastrophe, disaster, shocker, tragedy}.
    Shocker is art outlier in this set and its presence affects the overall confidence score assignment for all the words in the set.
    We observed that this is similar to what happens when the French word underlying the target set is homonymous; such cases are part of our discussion in Section 4.
    We evaluated the algorithm's performance using the standard SENSEVAL-2 evaluation software, obtaining figures for precision and recall for sense tagging the nouns in our gold standard.
    In this evaluation, partial credit is given in cases where a system assigns multiple sense tags.5 We report results using the &amp;quot;fine-grained&amp;quot; scoring variant; this is the strictest variant, which sometimes requires systems t
