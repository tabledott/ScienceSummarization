 be the null word), and accordingly the number of connections in an alignment is equal to the length of the French sentence.
    However, an English word may be connected to several words in the French sentence, or not connected at all.
    Using alignments, the translation probability for a pair of sentences is expressed as where A is the set of all combinatorially possible alignments for the sentences f and e (calligraphic font will be used to denote sets).
    In their paper, Brown et al. present a series of 5 models of Pr(f le).
    The first two of these 5 models are summarized here.
    Model 1 Model 1 assumes that Pr(f, ale) depends primarily on t( f le), the probability that an occurrence of the English word e is translated as the French word f. That is, (2) where Cf e, an irrelevant constant, accounts for certain dependencies on sentence lengths, which are not important for our purposes here.
    Except for Cf e' most of the notation is borrowed from Brown et al..
    The variable, j, is used to refe
