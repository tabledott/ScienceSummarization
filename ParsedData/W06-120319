 for humorous effect) particularly frequently in contexts in which elements of the literal meaning were also present.11 is clear then that the technique described is, prima facie, capable of detecting idiomatic MWEs.
    To evaluate the method, we used the careful manual annotation of the PNV database described by Krenn (2000) as our gold standard.
    By adopting different threshholds for the classification decision, we obtained a range of results (trading off precision and recall).
    Table 4 illustrates this range.
    The F-score measure is maximized in our experiments by adopting a similarity threshold of 0.2.
    This means that MWEs which have a meaning vector whose cosine is under this value when compared with with the combined vector should be classified as having a non-literal meaning.
    To compare our method with that proposed by Baldwin et al. (2003), we applied their method to our materials, generating LSA vectors for the component content words in our candidate MWEs and comparing their semant
