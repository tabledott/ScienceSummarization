    However, our parallel corpus is far from the clean parallel corpora used in MT.
    The rendition of a literary text into another language not only includes the translation, but also restructuring of the translation to fit the appropriate literary style.
    This process introduces differences in the translations which are an intrinsic part of the creative process.
    This results in greater differences across translations than the differences in typical MT parallel corpora, such as the Canadian Hansards.
    We will return to this point later in Section 3.
    Based on the specifics of our corpus, we developed an unsupervised learning algorithm for paraphrase extraction.
    During the preprocessing stage, the corresponding sentences are aligned.
    We base our method for paraphrasing extraction on the assumption that phrases in aligned sentences which appear in similar contexts are paraphrases.
    To automatically infer which contexts are good predictors of paraphrases, contexts surrounding identic
