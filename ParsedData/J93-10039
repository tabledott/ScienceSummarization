    Indeed it is the mild failure of this assumption that makes shallow information retrieval techniques possible.
    To the extent that these assumptions of independence and stationarity are valid, we can switch to an abstract discourse concerning Bernoulli trials instead of words in text, and a number of standard results can be used.
    A Bernoulli trial is the statistical idealization of a coin flip in which there is a fixed probability of a successful outcome that does not vary from flip to flip.
    In particular, if the actual probability that the next word matches a prototype is p, then the number of matches generated in the next n words is a random variable (K) with binomial distribution n )k whose mean is np and whose variance is np(1 &#8212;p).
    If np(1 &#8212;p) &gt; 5, then the distribution of this variable will be approximately normal, and as np(1 &#8212; p) increases beyond that point, the distribution becomes more and more like a normal
