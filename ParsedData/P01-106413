es that the difference in between the two systems is statistically significant at the 1% level, based on &#8220;number is the probability that a randomly chosen pair of words a distance of words apart is inconsistently classified; that is, for one of the segmentations the pair lies in the same segment, while for the other the pair spans a segment boundary&#8221; (Beeferman et al., 1999), where is chosen to be half the average reference segment length (in words). ments were given beforehand. a one-sided -test of the null hypothesis of equal means.
    The probability of the null hypothesis being true is displayed in the row indicated by &#8220;prob&#8221;.
    The column labels, such as &#8220; &#8221;, indicate that the numbers in the column are the averages of over the corresponding sample texts.
    &#8220;Total&#8221; indicates the averages of over all the text samples.
    These tables show statistically that our system is more accurate than or at least as accurate as .
    This means that our system is m
