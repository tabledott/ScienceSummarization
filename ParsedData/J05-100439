 which has a much longer learning curve (Marcus, personal communication), and indicates one of the advantages of using a corpus already syntactically parsed as the basis of semantic annotation.
  Over 30 annotators contributed to the project, some for just a few weeks, some for up to three years.
  The framesets were created and annotation disagreements were adju- dicated by a small team of highly trained linguists: Paul Kingsbury created the frames files and managed the annotators, and Olga Babko-Malaya checked the frames files for consistency and did the bulk of the adjudication.
  We measured agreement between the two annotations before the adjudication step using the kappa statistic (Siegel and Castellan 1988), which is defined with respect to Palmer, Gildea, and Kingsbury The Proposition Bank the probability of interannotator agreement, P?A?, and the agreement expected by chance, P?E?
  Measuring interannotator agreement for PropBank is complicated by the large num- ber of possible annotations for each v
