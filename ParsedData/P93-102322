imal solution.
    To alleviate this problem, the partitioning algorithm is called repeatedly with different random starting partitions and the best solution in these runs is kept.
    As with many practical optimization problems, computing the optimal solution is NP-complete (Brucker, 1978).
    Note that if the problem's search space had been relatively small, then we could have computed the optimal partition by enumerating all possible solutions and keeping the best one.
    However, again as with many other practical optimization problems, the search space turns out to be intractably large.
    The number of possible partitions of n objects to m nonempty subsets with mtt is equal to the corresponding Stirling number of the second kind (Knuth, 1973), and this number grows exponentially with n for all but trivial values of m. For example, for our test set of adjectives presented in the next section, we have n=21 and m=9; the corresponding number of possible partitions is roughly 1.23 x 1014.
