node.
    Furthermore, two or more EDITED nodes with no separating non-edited material between them are merged into a single EDITED node.
    We call this version a &#8220;simplified gold standard parse.&#8221; All precision recall measurements are taken with respected to the simplified gold standard.
    Second, we replace -r with a new equivalence relation -e which we define as the smallest equivalence relation containing -r and satisfying begin(c) -e end(c) for each EDITED node c in the gold standard parse.6 We give a concrete example in Figure 1.
    The first row indicates string position (as usual in parsing work, position indicators are between words).
    The second row gives the words of the sentence.
    Words that are edited out have an &#8220;E&#8221; above them.
    The third row indicates the equivalence relation by labeling each string position with the smallest such position with which it is equivalent.
    There are two basic ideas behind this definition.
    First, we do not care where the E
