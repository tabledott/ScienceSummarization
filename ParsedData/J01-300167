ults of each tagger, computed at both sense and homograph levels over the evaluation corpus and four subcorpora, are shown in Table 7.
    We can see that the partial taggers that are most effective are those based on the simulated annealing algorithm and Yarowsky's subject code approach.
    The success of these modules supports our decision to use existing disambiguation algorithms that have already been developed rather than creating new ones.
    The most successful of the partial taggers is the one based on Yarowsky's algorithm for modelling thesaural categories by wide contexts.
    This consistently achieves over 70% correct disambiguation and seems particularly successful when disambiguating adverbs (over 85% correct).
    It is quite surprising that this algorithm is so successful for adverbs, since it would seem quite reasonable to expect an algorithm based on subject codes to be more successful on nouns and less so on modifiers such as adjectives and adverbs.
    Yarowsky (1992) reports that his al
