tages of units selected randomly 1000 times from the same five texts were both 25 7%, a = 0 059 In summarizing text, it is often useful to consider not only clauses, but full sentences To account for this, we considered to be important all the textual units that pertained to a sentence that was characterized by at least one important textual unit For example, we labeled as important textual units 1 to 4 in text (I), because they make up a full sentence and because unit 4 was labeled as Important For the adjusted data, we determined again the percentages of important units for the five texts and we re-calculated the mall and precision for both analysts the recall was 69% and 66% and the precision 82% and 75% respectively In contrast, the average recall and precision for the same percentages of units selected randomly 1000 times from the same five texts were 38 4%, a = 0 048 These results confirm that there exists a strong correlation between the nuclei of the RS-trees that pertain to a text and what readers pe
