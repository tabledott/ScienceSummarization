Introductory texts are full of ambiguous sentences such as where no amount of syntactic parsing will help.
    These examples are generally taken to indicate that the parser must allow for multiple possibilities and that grammar formalisms such as LR(k) are inadequate for natural language since these formalisms cannot cope with ambiguity.
    This argument was behind a large set of objections to Marcus' &amp;quot;LR(k)-like&amp;quot; Deterministic Parser.
    Although it is clear that an expert in computational linguistics can dream up arbitrarily hard sentences, it may be, as Marcus suggested, that most texts are not very hard in practice.
    Recall that Marcus hypothesized most decisions can be resolved by the parser within a small window (i.e., three buffer cells), and there are only a few problematic cases where the parser becomes confused.
    He called these confusing cases &amp;quot;garden paths,&amp;quot; by analogy with the famous example: &#8226; The horse raced past the barn fell.
