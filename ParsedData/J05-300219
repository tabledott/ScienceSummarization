 fact, we have developed a rule-based component that transforms the phrase structure output of Collins&#8217;s (2003) parser into a representation in which a node has a direct link to its dependents.
    We also mark verb&#8211; subject and verb&#8211;node dependencies in the tree.
    The process of comparing trees can be further facilitated if the dependency tree is abstracted to a canonical form which eliminates features irrelevant to the comparison.
    We hypothesize that the difference in grammatical features such as auxiliaries, number, and tense has a secondary effect when the meaning of sentences is being compared.
    Therefore, we represent in the dependency tree only nonauxiliary words with their associated grammatical features.
    For nouns, we record their number, articles, and class (common or proper).
    For verbs, we record tense, mood (indicative, conditional, or infinitive), voice, polarity, aspect (simple or continuous), and taxis (perfect or none).
    The eliminated auxiliary words can
