ignment model of the empty word is nondeficient.
    As we will see in Section 3.2, this creates problems for Models 3 and 4.
    Therefore, we modify Models 3 and 4 slightly by replacing 00! in equation (27) with J&#966;0: As a result of this modification, the alignment models for both nonempty words and the empty word are deficient.
    2.3.1 Model 6.
    As we shall see, the alignment models with a first-order dependence (HMM, Models 4 and 5) produce significantly better results than the other alignment models.
    The HMM predicts the distance between subsequent source language positions, whereas Model 4 predicts the distance between subsequent target language positions.
    This implies that the HMM makes use of locality in the source language, whereas Model 4 makes use of locality in the target language.
    We expect to achieve better alignment quality by using a model that takes into account both types of dependencies.
    Therefore, we combine HMM and Model 4 in a log-linear way and call the resultin
