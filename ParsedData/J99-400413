ify specification of parsers: the item-based description is simpler than a procedural description.
    Second, it will make it easier to generalize parsers across tasks: a single item-based description can be used to compute values for a variety of applications, simply by changing semirings.
    This will be especially advantageous for parsers that can handle loops resulting from rules like A A and computations resulting from &#8364; productions, both of which typically lead to infinite sums.
    In these cases, the procedure for computing an infinite sum differs from semiring to semiring, and the fact that we can specify that a parser computes an infinite sum separately from its method of computing that sum will be very helpful.
    The third use of these techniques is for computing outside probabilities, values related to the inside probabilities that we will define later.
    Unlike the other quantities we wish to compute, outside probabilities cannot be computed by simply substituting a different semiring
