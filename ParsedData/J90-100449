  First, Martin Kay (1990) has developed a parsing algorithm that seems to be the parsing correlate to the generation algorithm presented here.
    Its existence might point the way toward a uniform architecture.
    Second, one of us (van Noord 1989b) has developed a general proof procedure for Horn clauses that can serve as a skeleton for both a semantic-head-driven generator and a left-corner parser.
    However, the parameterization is much more broad than for the uniform Earley architecture (Shieber 1988).
    Further enhancements to the algorithm are envisioned.
    First, any system making use of a tabular link predicate over complex nonterminals (like the chained_nodes predicate used by the generation algorithm and including the link predicate used in the BUP parser; Matsumoto et al. 1983) is subject to a problem of spurious redundancy in processing if the elements in the link table are not mutually exclusive.
    For instance, a single chain rule might be considered to be applicable twice because of
