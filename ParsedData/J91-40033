icology as well as an appreciation of the computational complexity of large lexical databases.
    Likewise, computational research can profit from an awareness of the grammatical and syntactic distinctions of lexical items; natural language processing systems must account for these differences in their lexicons and grammars.
    The wedding of these disciplines is so important, in fact, that I believe it will soon be difficult to carry out serious computational research in the fields of linguistics and NLP without the help of electronic dictionaries and computational lexicographic resources (cf.
    Walker et al. [forthcoming] and Boguraev and Briscoe [1988]).
    Positioned at the center of this synthesis is the study of word meaning, lexical semantics, which is currently witnessing a revival.
    In order to achieve a synthesis of lexical semantics and NLP, I believe that the lexical semantics community should address the following questions: Before addressing these questions, I would like to establish two
