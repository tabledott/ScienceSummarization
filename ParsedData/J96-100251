re 10 illustrates the change in log-likelihood of training data 11-&#8222; (p) and withheld data Lph(p).
    Had the algorithm terminated when the log-likelihood of the withheld data stopped increasing, the final model p would contain slightly less than 40 features.
    We have employed this segmenting model as a component in a French-English machine translation system in the following manner: The model assigns to each position in the French sentence a score, p(rif t I x), which is a measure of how appropriate a split would be at that location.
    A dynamic programming algorithm then selects, given the &amp;quot;appropriateness&amp;quot; score at each position and the requirement that no segment may contain more than 10 words, an optimal (or, at least, reasonable) splitting of the sentence.
    Figure 11 shows the system's segmentation of four sentences selected at random from the Hansard data.
    We remind the reader to keep in mind when evaluating Figure 11 that the segmenter's task is not to produce logi
