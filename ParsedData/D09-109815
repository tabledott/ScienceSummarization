 candidates for set expansion from amongst the terms most similar to the seeds (Sarmento et al. 2007).
    Formally, we define our expansion task as: Task Definition: Given a set of seed entities S = {s1, s2, ..., sk} of a class C = {s1, s2, ..., sk, ...,, sn} and an unlabeled textual corpus T, find all members of the class C. For example, consider the class of Bottled Water Brands.
    Given the set of seeds S = {Volvic, San Pellegrino, Gerolsteiner Brunnen, Bling H2O}, our task is to find all other members of this class, such as {Agua Vida, Apenta, Culligan, Dasani, Ethos Water, Iceland Pure Spring Water, Imsdal, ...} Our goal is not to propose a new set expansion algorithm, but instead to test the effect of using our Web-scale term similarity matrix (enabled by the algorithm proposed in Section 3) on a state-of-theart distributional set expansion algorithm, namely (Sarmento et al. 2007).
    We consider S as a set of prototypical examples of the underlying entity set.
