05; McDonald and Pereira 2006) and is now known as spanning tree parsing, because the problem of finding the most probable tree under this type of model is equivalent to finding an optimum spanning tree in a dense graph containing all possible dependency arcs.
    If we assume that the score of an individual arc is independent of all other arcs, this problem can be solved efficiently for arbitrary non-projective dependency trees using the Chu-Liu-Edmonds algorithm, as shown by McDonald et al. (2005).
    Spanning tree algorithms have so far primarily been combined with online learning methods such as MIRA (McDonald, Crammer, and Pereira 2005).
    The approach of deterministic classifier-based parsing was first proposed for Japanese by Kudo and Matsumoto (2002) and for English by Yamada and Matsumoto (2003).
    In contrast to spanning tree parsing, this can be characterized as a greedy inference strategy, trying to construct a globally optimal dependency graph by making a sequence of locally optimal decision
