			A packed chart is used to efficiently represent all of the possible analyses for a sentence, and the CKY chart parsing algorithm described in Steedman (2000) is used to build the chart.
			Clark and Curran (2004) evaluate a number of log-linear parsing models for CCG.
			In this paper weuse the normal-form model, which defines proba bilities with the conditional log-linear form in (1), where y is a derivation and x is a sentence.
			Featuresare defined in terms of the local trees in the derivation, including lexical head information and word word dependencies.
			The normal-form derivations in CCGbank provide the gold standard training data.
			The feature set we use is from the best performing normal-form model in Clark and Curran (2004).
			For a given sentence the output of the parser is a dependency structure corresponding to the most probable derivation, which can be found using theViterbi algorithm.
			The dependency relations are de fined in terms of the argument slots of CCG lexi
