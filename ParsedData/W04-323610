raining data of that corpus.
    Training was conducted with feature cutoff of 2 and 100 iterations (these parameters were obtained by cross validation on the training set), except for the AS corpus where we used cutoff 3 since the AS training corpus was too big to train with cutoff 2.
    Figure 2 shows our word segmenter&#8217;s Fmeasure (based on the official word segmentation scorer of 2003 SIGHAN bakeoff) compared to those reported by all the 2003 SIGHAN participants in the four closed tracks (ASc, HKc, PKc, CTBc).
    Our word segmenter achieved higher F-measure than the best reported F-measure in the SIGHAN bakeoff on the ASc, HKc, and PKc corpus.
    For CTBc, due to the exceptionally high out-of-vocabulary (OOV) rate of the test data (18.1%), our word segmenter&#8217;s Fmeasure ranked in the third position.
    (Note that the top participant of CTBc (Zhang et al., 2003) used additional named entity knowledge/data in their word segmenter).
    We also compared the F-measure of our word segmenter on CT
