, we first compare the different models with their performance on the validation set.
    Standard measures of accuracy are shown in table 1.8 The largest accuracy difference is between the parser with the discriminative probability model (DSSN-Freq&gt;5) and those with the generative probability model, despite the larger vocabulary of the former.
    This demonstrates the difficulty of estimating the parameters of a discriminative probability model.
    There is also a clear effect of vocabulary size, but there is a slightly larger effect of training method.
    When tested in the same way as they were trained (for reranking), the parsers which were trained with a discriminative criteria achieve a 7% and 8% reduction in error rate over their respective parsers with the same generative probability model.
    When tested alone, these DGSSN parsers perform only slightly better than their respective GSSN parsers.
    Initial experiments on giving these networks exposure to parses outside the top 20 parses of the
