    In particular, we want to choose between two structures: For the verb_attach case, we require not only that the preposition attach to the verb send but also that the noun soldier have no following prepositional phrase attached: since into directly follows the head of the object noun phrase, there is no room for any post-modifier of the noun soldier.
    We use the notation NULL to emphasize that in order for a preposition licensed by the verb to be in the immediately postnominal position, the noun must have no following complements (or adjuncts).
    For the case of noun attachment, the verb may or may not have additional prepositional complements following the prepositional phrase associated with the noun.
    Since we have a forced choice between two outcomes, it is appropriate to use a likelihood ratio to compare the attachment probabilities (cf.
    Mosteller and Wallace 1964).3 In particular, we look at the log of the ratio of the probability of verb_attach to the probability of noun_attach
