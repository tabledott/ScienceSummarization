dicating the corresponding target sentence to which it is aligned (or null).
    The model is similar to the discriminative CRF-based word alignment model of (Blunsom and Cohn, 2006).
    Our features can be grouped into four categories.
    Features derived from word alignments We use a feature set inspired by (Munteanu and Marcu, 2005), who defined features primarily based on IBM Model 1 alignments (Brown et al., 1993).
    We also use HMM word alignments (Vogel et al., 1996) in both directions (source to target and target to source), and extract the following features based on these four alignments:1 We also define two more features which are independent of word alignment models.
    One is a sentence length feature taken from (Moore, 2002), which models the length ratio between the source and target sentences with a Poisson distribution.
    The other feature is the difference in relative document position of the two sentences, capturing the idea that the aligned articles have a similar topic progression.
