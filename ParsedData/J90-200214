 the following entries: The search ends when there is a complete alignment on the list that is significantly more promising than any of the incomplete alignments.
    Sometimes, the sentence S' that is found in this way is not the same as the sentence S that a translator might The proposal will not now be implemented Computational Linguistics Volume 16, Number 2, June 1990 81 Peter F. Brown et at.
    A Statistical Approach to Machine Translation have been working on.
    When S' itself is not an acceptable translation, then there is clearly a problem.
    If Pr(S')Pr( TIS') is greater than Pr(S)Pr( TIS), then the problem lies in our modeling of the language or of the translation process.
    If, however, Pr(S)Pr(T1 S') is less than Pr(S)Pr( TIS), then our search has failed to find the most likely sentence.
    We call this latter type of failure a search error.
    In the case of a search error, we can be sure that our search procedure has failed to find the most probable source sentence, but we cannot be su
