algorithm is judged to have made an error even though this sectioning decision is reasonable.
    This illustrates the inherent fallibility of testing against reader judgments, although in part this is because the judges were given loose constraints.
    Following the advice of Gale et al. (1992a), I compare the algorithm against both upper and lower bounds.
    The upper bound in this case is the reader judgment data.
    The lower bound is a baseline algorithm that is a simple, reasonable approach to the problem that can be automated.
    A simple way to segment the texts is to place boundaries randomly in the document, constraining the number of boundaries to equal that of the average number of paragraph gaps assigned by judges.
    In the test data, boundaries are placed in about 41% of the paragraph gaps.
    A program was written that places a boundary at each potential gap 41% of the time (using a random number generator), and run 10,000 times for each text, and the average of the scores of these runs
