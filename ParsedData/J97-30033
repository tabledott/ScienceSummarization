implicity.
    Not surprisingly, their performance is quite poor: if a word is assigned all possible tags, the search space for the disambiguation of a single POS-tag increases and makes it fragile; if every unknown word is classified as a noun, there will be no difficulties for disambiguation but accuracy will suffer&#8212;such a guess is not reliable enough.
    To assign capitalized unknown words the category proper noun seems a good heuristic, but may not always work.
    As argued in Church (1988), who proposes a more elaborated heuristic, Dermatas and Kokkinakis (1995) proposed a simple probabilistic approach to unknown-word guessing: verb present, 3d person verb, present, non-3d Example take took taking taken takes take Meaning Example Tag the probability that an unknown word has a particular POS-tag is estimated from the probability distribution of hapax words (words that occur only once) in the previously seen texts.'
    Whereas such a guesser is more accurate than the naive assignments and easily t
