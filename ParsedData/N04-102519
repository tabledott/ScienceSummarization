tio (Reading A-Z.com, 2003), so it is not surprising that the correlation is high.
    The Smoothed Unigram measure achieved consistently good correlation (0.63 &#8211; 0.67) on both DRS and Reading A-Z test sets.
    Flesch-Kincaid performs much more poorly for the Reading A-Z data, probably because of the noisy sentence structure.
    In general, mean log frequency (MLF) performed worse than expected &#8211; the reasons for this require further study but may be due to the fact the BNC corpus may not be representative enough of vocabulary found at earlier grades.
    For Web data, we examined two subsets of the corpus: grades 1&#8211; 6 and grades 1&#8211; 12.
    The correlation of all variables with difficulty dropped substantially for Web grades 1&#8211;6, except for Smoothed Unigram, which stayed at roughly the same level (0.64) and was the best performer.
    The next best variable was UNK (0.38).
    For the entire Web grades 1&#8211; 12 data set, the Smoothed Unigram measure again achieved the best co
