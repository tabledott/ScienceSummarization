son et al. (2007b) repeatedly resamples parses for the sentences of the training data.
    However, the adaptor grammar sampler itself maintains of a hierarchy of Chinese Restaurant Processes or Pitman-Yor Processes, one per adapted nonterminal X E A, that cache subtrees from TX.
    In general each of these subtrees will occur many times in the parses for the training data sentences.
    Table label resampling resamples the trees in these adaptors (i.e., the table labels, to use the restaurant metaphor), potentially changing the analysis of many sentences at once.
    For example, each Collocation in the collocation adaptor grammar can occur in many Sentences, and each Word can occur in many Collocations.
    Resampling a single Collocation can change the way it is analysed into Words, thus changing the analysis of all of the Sentences containing that Collocation.
    Table label resampling is an additional resampling step performed after each Gibbs sweep through the training data in which we resample the pa
