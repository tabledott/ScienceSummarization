 is nevertheless rich in part-of-speech ambiguities.
    In this paper, we present a transition-based model for joint part-of-speech tagging and labeled dependency parsing with non-projective trees.
    Experiments show that joint modeling improves both tagging and parsing accuracy, leading to state-of-the-art accuracy for richly inflected languages like Czech and German as well as more configurational languages like Chinese and English.
    To our knowledge, this is the first joint system that performs labeled dependency parsing.
    It is also the first joint system that achieves state-of-the-art accuracy for non-projective dependency parsing.
  
  
    Transition-based dependency parsing was pioneered by Yamada and Matsumoto (2003) and Nivre et al. (2004), who used classifiers trained to predict individual actions of a deterministic shift-reduce parser.
    Recent research has shown that better accuracy can be achieved by using beam search and optimizing models on the entire sequence of decisions needed to
