ut sentence.
    The key features of this approach are: Focus on paraphrase generation.
    In contrast to earlier work, we not only extract paraphrasing rules, but also automatically determine which of the potentially relevant rules to apply to an input sentence and produce a revised form using them.
    Flexible paraphrase types.
    Previous approaches to paraphrase acquisition focused on certain rigid types of paraphrases, for instance, limiting the number of arguments.
    In contrast, our method is not limited to a set of a priori-specified paraphrase types.
    Use of comparable corpora and minimal use of knowledge resources.
    In addition to the advantages mentioned above, comparable corpora can be easily obtained for many domains, whereas previous approaches to paraphrase acquisition (and the related problem of phrasebased machine translation (Wang, 1998; Och et al., 1999; Vogel and Ney, 2000)) required parallel corpora.
    We point out that one such approach, recently proposed by Pang et al. (200
