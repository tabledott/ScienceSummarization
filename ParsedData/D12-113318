enn Treebank is 97.28, which is on a par with Toutanova et al. (2003).
    For German, we obtain a tagging accuracy of 97.24, which is close to the 97.39 achieved by the RF-Tagger (Schmid and Laws, 2008), which to our knowledge is the best tagger for German.5 The results are not directly comparable to the RF-Tagger as it was evaluated on a different part of the Tiger Treebank and trained on a larger part of the Treebank.
    We could not use the larger training set as it contains the test set of the CoNLL 2009 data that we use to evaluate the joint model.
    For Czech, the 1best tagging accuracy is 99.11 and for Chinese 92.65 on the CoNLL 2009 test set.
    We trained parsers with 25 iterations and report results for the model obtained after the last iteration.
    For cluster features, available only for English and German, we used standard Brown clusters based on the English and German Gigaword Corpus.
    We restricted the vocabulary to words that occur at least 10 times, used 800 clusters, and took clust
