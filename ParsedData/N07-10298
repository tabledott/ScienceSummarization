 recognition (Siu and Gish, 1999).
    The logit model, which models the log odds of an event as a linear function of the features, can be used in confidence estimation.
    The confidence for a system generating a hypothesis may be modeled as (3) where each system has weights , and is the th feature for system and hypothesis .
    The features used in this work were: If the system did not generate the hypothesis , the confidence is set to zero.
    To prevent overflow in exponentiating the summation in Equation 3, the features have to be scaled.
    In the experiments, feature scaling factors were estimated from the tuning data to limit the feature values between .
    The same scaling factors have to be applied to the features obtained from the test data.
    The total confidence score of hypothesis is obtained from the system confidences as where is the number of systems generating the hypothesis (i.e., the number of non-zero for ) and is the number of systems.
    The weights through are constrained to su
