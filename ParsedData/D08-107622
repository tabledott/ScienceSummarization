[ryz s1, ryz s) of its left-adjacent translation hypothesis if the corresponding change in the error count DEzs = 0.
    The resulting intervalr 1ry41s1, ryZs1q ) has a larger range, and the choice of ryopt may be more reliable. iteration will result in the update of a single feature function only.
    While this update scheme provides a ranking of the feature functions according to their discriminative power (each iteration picks the feature function for which changing the corresponding weight yields the highest gain), it does not take possible correlations between the feature functions into account.
    As a consequence, the optimization procedure may stop in a poor local optimum.
    On the other hand, it is difficult to compute a direction that decorrelates two or more correlated feature functions.
    This problem can be alleviated by exploring a large number of random directions which update many feature weights simultaneously.
    The random directions are chosen as the lines which connect some randoml
