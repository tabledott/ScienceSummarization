at the correlation between Web counts and BNC is generally slightly higher than the correlation between Web counts and NANTC counts.
    We carried out one-tailed t-tests to determine whether the differences in the correlation coefficients were significant.
    We found that both AltaVista counts (t(87) = 3.11, p &lt; .01) and Google counts (t(87) = 3.21, p &lt; .01) were significantly better correlated with BNC counts than with NANTC counts for adjective-noun bigrams.
    The difference in correlation coefficients was not significant for noun-noun and verb-object bigrams, for either search engine.
    Table 9 also shows the correlations between BNC counts and NANTC counts.
    The intercorpus correlation can be regarded as an upper limit for the correlations we can expect between counts from two corpora that differ in size and genre and that have been obtained using different extraction methods.
    The correlation between AltaVista and Google counts and NANTC counts reached the upper limit for all three big
