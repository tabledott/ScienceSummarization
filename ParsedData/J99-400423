tentially infinite.
    In other words, the value of the sentence according to the grammar is the sum of the values of all derivations.
    We will assume that in each grammar formalism there is some way to define derivations uniquely; for instance, in CFGs, one way would be using left-most derivations.
    For simplicity, we will simply refer to derivations, rather than, for example, left-most derivations, since we are never interested in nonunique derivations.
    A short example will help clarify.
    We consider the following grammar: tion is S &#8226; aAA AGIA aaa, which has value R(S AA) 0 R(A a) 0 R(A AA) 0 R(A a) 0 R(A ---+ a).
    The value of the sentence is the sum of the values of the two derivations, 2.4.2 Item Derivations.
    Next, we define item derivations, i.e., derivations using the item-based description of the parser.
    We define item derivation in such a way that for a correct parser description, there is exactly one item derivation for each grammar derivation.
