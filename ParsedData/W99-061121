8) present a supervised probabilistic algorithm that assumes a full parse of the input text.
    Dagan and Itai (1991) present a hybrid full-parse/unsupervised learning approach that focuses on resolving &amp;quot;it&amp;quot;.
    Despite a large corpus (150 million words), their approach suffers from sparse data problems, but works well when enough relevant data is available.
    Lastly, Cardie (1992a; 1992b) presents a case-based learning approach for relative pronoun disambiguation.
    Our clustering approach differs from this previous work in several ways.
    First, because we only require the noun phrases in any input text, we do not require a full syntactic parse.
    Although we would expect increases in performance if complex noun phrases were used, our restriction to base NPs does not reflect a limitation of the clustering algorithm (or the distance metric), but rather a self-imposed limitation on the preprocessing requirements of the approach.
    Second, our approach is unsupervised and requires
