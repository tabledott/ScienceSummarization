 models the correlations which are most useful for semi-supervised learning.
    We demonstrate how to adapt it for transfer learning, and consequently the structural part of structural correspondence learning is borrowed from it.1 SCL is a general technique, which one can apply to feature based classifiers for any task.
    Here, 'Structural learning is different from learning with structured outputs, a common paradigm for discriminative natural language processing models.
    To avoid terminological confusion, we refer throughout the paper to a specific structural learning method, alternating structural optimization (ASO) (Ando and Zhang, 2005a). we investigate its use in part of speech (PoS) tagging (Ratnaparkhi, 1996; Toutanova et al., 2003).
    While PoS tagging has been heavily studied, many domains lack appropriate training corpora for PoS tagging.
    Nevertheless, PoS tagging is an important stage in pipelined language processing systems, from information extractors to speech synthesizers.
    We sh
