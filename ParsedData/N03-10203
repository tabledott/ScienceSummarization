30 sets of approximately 10 documents, each provided with their 50, 100, 200, and 400-word human written summaries.
    The test set comprised 30 unseen sets.
    A total of 11 systems participated in the singledocument summarization task and 12 systems participated in the multi-document task.
    For each document or document set, one human summary was created as the `ideal' model summary at each specified length.
    Two other human summaries were also created at each length.
    In addition, baseline summaries were created automatically for each length as reference points.
    For the multi-document summarization task, one baseline, lead baseline, took the first 50, 100, 200, and 400 words in the last document in the collection.
    A second baseline, coverage baseline, took the first sentence in the first document, the first sentence in the second document and so on until it had a summary of 50, 100, 200, or 400 words.
    Only one baseline (baseline1) was created for the single document summarization tas
