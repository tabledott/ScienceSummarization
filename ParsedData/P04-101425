in section 23 takes 1.6 minutes using the normal-form model, and 10.5 minutes using the dependency model.
    The difference is due largely to the normal-form constraints used by the normal-form parser.
    Clark and Curran (2004) shows that the normal-form constraints significantly increase parsing speed and, in combination with adaptive supertagging, result in a highly efficient wide-coverage parser.
    As a final oracle experiment we parsed the sentences in section 00 using the correct lexical categories from CCGbank.
    Since the parser uses only a subset of the lexical categories in CCGbank, 7% of the sentences could not be parsed; however, the labelled F-score for the parsed sentences was almost 98%.
    This very high score demonstrates the large amount of information in lexical categories.
  
  
    A major contribution of this paper has been the development of a parsing model for CCG which uses all derivations, including non-standard derivations.
    Non-standard derivations are an integral part of
