ld false beliefs.
    As Quine [1956] pointed out, belief creates a context where substitution of coreferential expressions need not preserve truth-value.
    We add to a first-order language with equality the operator B, and B(A,P) (usually written BA(P)) is to be read &amp;quot;A believes that P&amp;quot;, for any formula P. The B operator is assumed to satisfy the following axiom schemas (inspired by Hintikka [1962]), where P and Q are schema variables ranging over propositions, and A ranges over agents: The rules of inference are Modus Ponens and: If T is a theorem, then BA(T) is a theorem, for every agent A. i.e. every agent believes every valid consequence of the logical axioms.
    The partial deduction system used in the implementation of Allen [1979] is based on Cohen [1978].
    The foundations for a more elaborate system can be found in Moore [1979].
    The word &amp;quot;know&amp;quot; is used in at least three different senses in English.
    One may know that a proposition P is true, know wheth
