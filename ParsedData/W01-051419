 LSA.
    However, the same method is not applicable to the ranked LSA values (see column 2).
    The results in column 3 highlights the relationship between LSA space and error rate.
    On average, a LSA space that was trained on paragraphs ([2(p) = 11.8%) out-performed one that was trained on sentences (p(s) = 15.6%).
    This shows similarity is well modelled by word co-occurrence in paragraphs.
    It also suggests that although sentences are good for identifying words about the same topic, paragraphs are better for finding dissimilar words.
    Intuitively speaking, large feature vectors are expected to generate more accurate similarity values.
    Thus, segmentation accuracy should improve with dimensionality.
    The figures in column 3 show high dimensionality increases error rate.
    However, the figures in column 4 suggest the contrary.
    This implies high dimensionality improves the ranking of LSA values but is detrimental to value accuracy.
