apturing both the inheritance relations between concepts and, just as importantly, how the concepts are integrated into a coherent expression in a given sentence.
    I will assume that there are two inheritance mechanisms at work for representing the conceptual relations in the lexicon: fixed inheritance and projective inheritance.
    The first includes the methods of inheritance traditionally assumed in Al and lexical research (e.g.
    Roberts and Goldstein 1977; Brachman and Schmolze 1985; Bobrow and Winograd 1977); that is, a fixed network of relations, which is traversed to discover existing related and associated concepts (e.g. hyponyms and hypernyms).
    In order to arrive at a comprehensive theory of the lexicon, we need to address the issue of global organization, and this involves looking at the various modes of inheritance that exist in language and conceptualization.
    Some of the best work addressing the issue of how the lexical semantics of a word ties into its deeper conceptual structure i
