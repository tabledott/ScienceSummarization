the subject of break, including that of &#8216;Y&#8217;, similarly the matrix of the transitive &#8216;break&#8217; uses information about its subject and object, including that of &#8216;X&#8217; and &#8216;Y&#8217;.
    We leave a thorough study of these phenomena, which fall under providing a modular representation of passiveactive similarities, to future work.
    We evaluated our model in two ways: first against the word disambiguation task of Mitchell and Lapata (2008) for intransitive verbs, and then against a similar new experiment for transitive verbs, which we developed.
    Our findings in the first experiment show that the categorical method performs on par with the leading existing approaches.
    This should not surprise us given that the context is so small and our method becomes similar to the multiplicative model of Mitchell and Lapata (2008).
    However, our approach is sensitive to grammatical structure, leading us to develop a second experiment taking this into account and differentiating
