 many of the top systems rely on hand-crafted resources such as large name gazetteers or even rulebased post-processing.
  
  
    This work uses a linear formulation of structural learning.
    We first briefly review a standard linear prediction model and then extend it for structural learning.
    We sketch an optimization algorithm using SVD and compare it to related methods.
    In the standard formulation of supervised learning, we seek a predictor that maps an input vector x E X to the corresponding output y E Y.
    Linear prediction models are based on real-valued predictors of the form f (x) = wTx, where w is called a weight vector.
    For binary problems, the sign of the linear prediction gives the class label.
    For k-way classification (withk&gt;2), a typical method is winner takes all, where we train one predictor per class and choose the class with the highest output value.
