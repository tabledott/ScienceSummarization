class 5 can be interpreted as clustering agents, denoted by proper names, &amp;quot;man&amp;quot;, and &amp;quot;woman&amp;quot;, together with verbs denoting communicative action.

    1 shows a cluster involving verbs of scalar change and things which can move along scales.

    We evaluated our clustering models on a pseudodisambiguation task similar to that performed in Pereira et al. (1993), but differing in detail.
    The task is to judge which of two verbs v and v' is more likely to take a given noun n as its argument where the pair (v, n) has been cut out of the original corpus and the pair (v', n) is constructed by pairing 71 with a randomly chosen verb v' such that the combination (v', n) is completely unseen.
    Thus this test evaluates how well the models generalize over unseen verbs.
    The data for this test were built as follows.
