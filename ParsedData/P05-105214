    In this relation example R, arg-, is ((&#8220;areas&#8221;, &#8220;NNS&#8221;, &#8220;area&#8221;, dseq), &#8220;LOC&#8221;, &#8220;Region&#8221;, &#8220;NOM&#8221;), and arg-,.dseq is ((OBJ, areas, in, 1), (OBJ, areas, controlled, 1)). arg2 is ((&#8220;troops&#8221;, &#8220;NNS&#8221;, &#8220;troop&#8221;, dseq), &#8220;ORG&#8221;, &#8220;Government&#8221;, &#8220;NOM&#8221;) and arg2.dseq = ((A-POS, troops, Syrian, 0), (SBJ, troops, controlled, 1)). path is ((OBJ, areas, controlled, 1), (SBJ, controlled, troops, 0)).
    The value 0 in a dependency arc indicates forward direction from w to dw, and 1 indicates backward direction.
    The seq and link sequences of R are shown in Figure 2.
    Some relations occur only between very restricted types of entities, but this is not true for every type of relation.
    For example, PER-SOC is a relation mainly between two person entities, while PHYS can happen between any
