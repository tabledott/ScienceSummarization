; each mention is a phrase in the document (typically an NP) and we are asked to cluster mentions according to the underlying referent entity.
    There are three basic mention types: proper (Barack Obama), nominal (president), and pronominal (he).1 For comparison to previous work, we evaluate in the setting where mention boundaries are given at test time; however our system can easily annotate reference on all noun phrase nodes in a parse tree (see Section 3.1.1).
    In this work we use the following data sets: Development: (see Section 3) We will present evaluations on multiple coreference resolution metrics, as no single one is clearly superior:
  
  
    In this section we develop our system and report developmental results on ACE2004-ROTHDEV (see Section 2.1); we report pairwise F1 figures here, but report on many more evaluation metrics in Section 4.
    At a high level, our system resembles a pairwise coreference model (Soon et al., 1999; Ng and Cardie, 2002; Bengston and Roth, 2008); for each mention
