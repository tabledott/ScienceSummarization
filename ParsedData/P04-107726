verage of the N best scores using N different sets of N-1 references.
    The Jackknifing procedure is adopted since we often need to compare system and human performance and the reference translations are usually the only human translations available.
    Using this procedure, we are able to estimate average human performance by averaging N best scores of one reference vs. the rest N-1 references.
    We then computed average BLEU1-124, GTM with exponents of 1.0, 2.0, and 3.0, NIST, WER, and PER scores over these three sets.
    Finally we applied ROUGE-L, ROUGE-W with weighting function k1.2, and ROUGE-S without skip distance 4 BLEUN computes BLEU over n-grams up to length N. Only BLEU1, BLEU4, and BLEU12 are shown in Table 1. and fluency: BLEU1, 4, and 12 are BLEU with maximum of 1, 4, and 12 grams, NIST is the NIST score, ROUGE-L is LCS-based F-measure (0 = 1), ROUGE-W is weighted LCS-based F-measure (0 = 1).
    ROUGE-S* is skip-bigram-based co-occurrence statistics with any skip distance limit, ROUGESN
