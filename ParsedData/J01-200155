ulated way than this particular approach does.
    I will turn now to two alternative heuristics that succeed in producing an initial morphological analysis (and refer to a third in a note).
    It seems likely that one could construct a number of additional heuristics of this sort.
    The point to emphasize is that the primary responsibility of the overall morphology is not that of the initial heuristic, but rather of the MDL model described in the previous section.
    The heuristics described in this section create an initial morphology that can serve as a starting point in a search for the shortest overall description of the morphology.
    We deal with that process in Section 5.
    A heuristic that I will call the take-all-splits heuristic, and which considers all cuts of a word of length 1 into stem+suffix wi, + w,&#177;1,/, where 1 &lt; i &lt; 1, much like the EM approach mentioned immediately above, works much more effectively if the probability is assigned on the basis of a Boltzmann distribution;
