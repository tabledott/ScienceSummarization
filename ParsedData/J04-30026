document-level annotations, in addition to our manual annotations, to identify and evaluate clues of subjectivity.
    The document-level annotations were not produced according to our annotation scheme and were not produced for the purpose of training and evaluating an NLP system.
    Thus, they are an external influence from outside the laboratory.
    In addition, there are a great number of these data, enabling us to evaluate the results on a larger scale, using multiple large test sets.
    This and cross-training between the two types of annotations allows us to assess consistency in performance of the various identification procedures.
    Good performance in cross-validation experiments between different types of annotations is evidence that the results are not brittle.
    We focus on three types of subjectivity clues.
    The first are hapax legomena, the set of words that appear just once in the corpus.
    We refer to them here as unique words.
    The set of all unique words is a feature with hig
