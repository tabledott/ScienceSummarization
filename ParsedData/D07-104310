r completeness criterion is not measured at all.
			That is, they do not address the question of whether all members of a given class are in cluded in a single cluster.
			Therefore the Purity and Entropy measures are likely to improve (increased Purity, decreased Entropy) monotonically withthe number of clusters in the result, up to a degen erate maximum where there are as many clusters as data points.
			However, clustering solutions rated high by either measure may still be far from ideal.Another frequently used external clustering evaluation measure is commonly refered to as ?cluster ing accuracy?.
			The calculation of this accuracy isinspired by the information retrieval metric of F Measure (Van Rijsbergen, 1979).
			The formula for this clustering F-measure as described in (Fung et al., 2003) is shown in Figure 3.
			Let N be the number of data points, C the set of classes, K the set of clusters and nij be the number of members of class ci ? C that are elements of cluster kj ? K. F (C, K) = X ci?C |ci|
