ce. we are forced toward analyses putting more and more information in an atomic category feature.
    An example of this phenomenon can be seen in the author's paper on LR syntactic preference parsing 1141.
    Because the LALR table building algorithm does not in general terminate for complex-featurebased grammar formalisms, the grammar used in that paper was a simple context-free grammar with subcategorization and gap information placed in the atomic nonterminal symbol.
    On the other hand, the grammar formalism can be left unchanged, but particular grammars developed that happen not to succumb to the problems inherent in the general parsing problem for the formalism.
    The solution mentioned above of placing more information in the category symbol falls into this class.
    Unpublished work by Kent Wit tenburg and by Robin Cooper has attempted to solve the gap proliferation problem using special grammars.
    In building a general tool for grammar testing and debugging, however, we would like to commi
