riginal sentence and correspond to the constituent in a constituent tree.
    We formulate the semantic labeling problem in the same way as in a constituent structure parse, except we classify the nodes that represent head words of constituents.
    A similar formulation using dependency trees derived from TreeBank was reported in Hacioglu (Hacioglu, 2004).
    In that experiment, the dependency trees were derived from hand-corrected TreeBank trees using head word rules.
    Here, an SVM is trained to assign PropBank argument labels to nodes in Minipar dependency trees using the following features: Table 8 shows the performance of the Miniparbased semantic parser.
    Minipar performance on the PropBank corpus is substantially worse than the Charniak based system.
    This is understandable from the fact that Minipar is not designed to produce constituents that would exactly match the constituent segmentation used in TreeBank.
    In the test set, about 37% of the arguments do not have corresponding constitue
