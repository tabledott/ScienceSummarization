 whose posterior distribution Oe assigns highest probability to selected types.
    Results: Table 8 presents the classification results of T-CLASS compared against a majority baseline which simply picks the most frequent class (PERSON), in addition to the Freebase baseline, which only makes predictions if an entity appears in exactly one dictionary (i.e., appears unambiguous).
    T-CLASS also outperforms a simple supervised baseline which applies a MaxEnt classifier using 4-fold cross validation over the 1,450 entities which were annotated for testing.
    Additionally we compare against the co-training algorithm of Collins and Singer (1999) which also leverages unlabeled data and uses our Freebase type lists; for seed rules we use the &#8220;unambiguous&#8221; Freebase entities.
    Our results demonstrate that T-CLASS outperforms the baselines and achieves a 25% increase in F1 score over co-training.
    Tables 9 and 10 present a breakdown of F1 scores by type, both collapsing types into the standard clas
