e of how such a feature can be useful, in the sentence &#8220;He drove the car over the cliff,&#8221; the subject NP is more likely to fill the AGENT role than the other two NPs.
    We will discuss various grammatical-function features that attempt to indicate a constituent&#8217;s syntactic relation to the rest of the sentence, for example, as a subject or object of a verb.
    The first such feature, which we call &#8220;governing category,&#8221; or gov, has only two values, S and VP, corresponding to subjects and objects of verbs, respectively.
    This feature is restricted to apply only to NPs, as it was found to have little effect on other phrase types.
    As with phrase type, the feature was read from parse trees returned by the parser.
    We follow links from child to parent up the parse tree from the constituent corresponding to a frame element until either an S or VP node is found and assign the value of the feature according to whether this node is an S or a VP.
