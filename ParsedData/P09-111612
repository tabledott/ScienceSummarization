nt belongs to at most one cluster), it can produce soft clustering simply by assigning an element to all clusters whose similarity to the element is greater than a threshold.
    For natural language words and phrases, the soft cluster assignments often reveal different senses of a word.
    For example, the word Whistler may refer to a town in British Columbia, Canada, which is also a ski resort, or to a painter.
    These meanings are reflected in the top clusters assignments for Whistler in Table 2 (window size = 3).
    We experimented with two corpora (Table 3).
    One contains web documents with 700 billion tokens.
    The second consists of various news texts from LDC: English Gigaword, the Tipster corpus and Reuters RCV1.
    The last column lists the numbers of phrases we used when running the clustering with that corpus.
    Even though our cloud computing infrastructure made phrase clustering possible, there is no question that it is still very time consuming.
    To create 3000 clusters among 20
