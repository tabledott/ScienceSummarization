    The texts are a mixture of news, interviews, and speeches.
    The University of Pennsylvania TREEBANK project tagged 400 MUC messages (approximately 100,000 words), which we divided into 90% training and 10% testing.
    For our first test, we used the original probability tables trained from the Wall Street Journal articles, but tested on MUC messages.
    We then retrained the probabilities on the MUC messages and ran a second test on MUC messages, with an average improvement of three percentage points in both bi- and tri- tags.
    The full results are shown in Figure 4; 8.5% of the words in the test were unknown: While the results using the new tables are an improvement in these first-best tests, we saw the best results using K-best mode, which obtained a .7% error rate.
    We ran several tests using our K-best algorithm with various thresholds.
    As described in Section 2.4, the threshold limits how many tags are returned based on their probabilities.
    While this reduces the ambi
