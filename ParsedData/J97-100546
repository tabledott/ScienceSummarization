ch by at least i of the seven subjects in our empirical study, where we use two values of i.
    Otherwise it is classified as nonboundary.
    In our experiments, we investigate the correlation of linguistic cues with boundaries identified by both i = 3 and i =-- 4 subjects.
    Figure 5 is a modified version of Figure 2, showing the classification of the statistically validated boundaries in the same narrative excerpt.
    (The bracketed numbers represent pauses, as explained below.)
    The boxes in the figure show the subjects' responses at each potential boundary site; if no box is shown, none of the seven subjects place a boundary at the site.
    The italicized parentheticals at each potential boundary site show the resulting boundary classification.
    Only 3 of the 18 possible boundary sites are classified as boundary, for both i = 3 and i=--- 4.
    4.1.2 Coding of Linguistic Features.
    Given a narrative of n prosodic phrases, there are n &#8212; 1 potential boundary sites between each pair of p
