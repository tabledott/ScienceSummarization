bilingual lexicons.
    While some researchers are attempting machine translation through purely statistical techniques, the more common approach is to use some hybrid of interlingual and transfer techniques.
    These symbolic machine translation systems must have access to a bilingual lexicon and the ability to construct one semi-automatically would ease the development of such systems.
    Champollion is particularly promising for this purpose for two reasons.
    First, it constructs translations for multiword collocations.
    Collocations are known to be opaque; that is, their meaning often derives from the combination of the words and not from the meaning of the individual words themselves.
    As a result, translation of collocations cannot be done on a word-by-word basis, and some representation of collocations in both languages is needed if the system is to translate fluently.
    Second, collocations are domain dependent.
    Particularly in technical domains, the collocations differ from those in
