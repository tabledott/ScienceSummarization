 `He' is ambiguous--a distinction that existed before is now gone.
    The Naive Algorithm would still maintain a salience distinction between 'Earl' and `Ted', where CogNIAC has no rule that makes a salience distinction between subject and object of a sentence which has two intervening sentences.
    The closest rule would be Unique in Discourse, rule 1, which does not yield a unique antecedent.
    CogNIAC has been evaluated in two different contexts.
    The goal of the first experiment was to establish relative performance of CogNIAC to Hobbs' Naive Algorithm--a convenient benchmark that allows indirect comparison to other algorithms.
    The second experiment reports results on Wall Street Journal data.
    The chosen domain for comparison with Hobbs' Naive Algorithm was narrative texts about two persons of the same gender told from a third person perspective.
    The motivation for this data was that we wanted to maximize the ambiguity of resolving pronouns.
    Only singular third person pronouns were
