  In our data, the closest analogs to Merlo and Stevenson?s three roles of Causal Agent, Agent, and Theme are ArgA, Arg0, and Arg1, respectively.
  We hypothesize that PropBank data will confirm 1. that the subject can take one of two roles (Arg0 or Arg1) for unaccusative and unergative verbs but only one role (Arg0) for object-drop verbs; 2. that Arg1s appear more frequently as subjects for intransitive unaccusatives than they do for intransitive unergatives.
  In Table 8 we show counts for the semantic roles of the subjects of the Merlo and Stevenson verbs which appear in PropBank (80
