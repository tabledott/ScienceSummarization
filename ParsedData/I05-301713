			This was done by generating word listsbased only on the vocabulary in each truth (top line) and training (bottom-line) corpus and segmenting the respective test corpora.
			These results are presented in Tables!3 and 4.
			All of the results comprise the following data: test recall (R), test precision (P), balancedF score (where F = 2PR/(P + R)), the out-of vocabulary (OOV) rate on the test corpus, the recall on OOV words (Roov), and the recall on in-vocabulary words (Riv).
			We use the usual definition of out-of-vocabulary words as the set of words occurring in the test corpus that are not in the training corpus.
