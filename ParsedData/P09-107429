    While other researchers have evaluated NP coreference resolvers with respect to pronouns vs. proper nouns vs. common nouns (Ng and Cardie, 2002b), our analysis focuses on measuring the complexity of data sets, predicting the performance of coreference systems on new data sets, and quantifying the effect of coreference system subcomponents on overall performance.
    In the related area of anaphora resolution, researchers have studied the influence of subsystems on the overall performance (Mitkov, 2002) as well as defined and evaluated performance on different classes of pronouns (e.g.
    Mitkov (2002) and Byron (2001)).
    However, due to the significant differences in task definition, available datasets, and evaluation metrics, their conclusions are not directly applicable to the full coreference task.
    Previous work has developed methods to predict system performance on NLP tasks given data set characteristics, e.g.
