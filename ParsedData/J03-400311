as been trained, we have a model that defines P(T, S) for any sentence-tree pair in the grammar.
    The output on a new test sentence S is the most likely tree under this model, The parser itself is an algorithm that searches for the tree, Tbest, that maximizes P(T, S).
    In the case of PCFGs, this can be accomplished using a variant of the CKY algorithm applied to weighted grammars (providing that the PCFG can be converted to an equivalent PCFG in Chomsky normal form); see, for example, Manning and Sch&#168;utze (1999).
    If the model probabilities P(T, S) are the same as the true distribution generating training and test examples, returning the most likely tree under P(T, S) will be optimal in terms of minimizing the expected error rate (number of incorrect trees) on newly drawn test examples.
    Hence if the data are generated by a PCFG, and there are enough training examples for the maximum-likelihood estimates to converge to the true values, then this parsing method will be optimal.
    In practice
