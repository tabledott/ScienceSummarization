 iterations&#8212;in the dual decomposition algorithms.
    As before, if we do not find y(k) = z(k) for some value of k G K, we choose the y(k) with optimal value for f(y(k)) as the final solution.
    Figure 4 shows three graphs: 1) the accuracy of the parser on PTB validation data versus the value for K; 2) the percentage of examples where y(k) = z(k) at some point during the algorithm, hence the algorithm returns a certificate of optimality; 3) the percentage of examples where the solution for the English (PTB) and Czech (PDT) validation sets.
    Sib/G+S: as in Table 1.
    P-Sib/P-G+S: Projective versions of Sib/G+S, where the MST component has been replaced with the Eisner (2000) first-order projective parser. returned is the same as the solution for the algorithm with K = 5000 (our original setting).
    It can be seen for K as small as 250 we get very similar accuracy to K = 5000 (see Table 2).
    In fact, for this setting the algorithm returns the same solution as for K = 5000 on 99.59% of the exam
