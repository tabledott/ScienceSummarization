pectively.
    Here, we are using the optimal combination of layers for each system (which we discuss in the following section in detail).
    For the model trained on WSJ, performance peaks at four senses, which is similar to the average ambiguity in the test data.
    For the model trained on the BNC, however, the best results are obtained using twice as many senses.
    Using fewer senses with the BNC-trained system can result in a drop in accuracy of almost 2%.
    This is due to the shift in domain.
    As the sense-divisions of the learning domain do not match those of the target domain, finer granularity is required in order to encompass all the relevant distinctions.
    Table 1 illustrates the senses inferred for the word drug when using the in-domain and out-ofdomain corpora, respectively.
    The most probable words for each sense are also shown.
    Firstly, note that the model infers some plausible senses for drug on the WSJ corpus (top half of Table 1).
    Sense 1 corresponds to the &#8220;enfo
