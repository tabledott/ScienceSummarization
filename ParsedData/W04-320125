llows limited lexicalization in cubic time, unlike other lexicalized models (including the Collins model which it outperforms in the present limited experiments).
  
  
    We have presented a maximum-margin approach to parsing, which allows a discriminative SVM-like objective to be applied to the parsing problem.
    Our framework permits the use of a rich variety of input features, while still decomposing in a way that exploits the shared substructure of parse trees in the standard way.
    On a test set of &#8804; 15 word sentences, the featurerich model outperforms both its own natural generative baseline and the Collins parser on Fl.
    While like most discriminative models it is compute-intensive to train, it allows fast parsing, remaining cubic despite the incorporation of lexical features.
    This trade-off between the complexity, accuracy and efficiency of a parsing model is an important area of future research.
