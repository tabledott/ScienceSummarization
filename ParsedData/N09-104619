 a lowercased and tokenized (but not segmented) version of the test data is translated using the grammar derived from a nonsegmented training data.
    In the 1BEST condition, the single best segmentation &#710;sN1 that maximizes Pr(sN1 Iw) is chosen for each word using the MERTtrained model (the German model for German, and the language-neutral model for Hungarian and Turkish).
    This variant is translated using a grammar induced from a parallel corpus that has also been segmented according to the same decision rule.
    In the LATTICE condition, we constructed segmentation lattices using the technique described in Section 3.1.
    For all languages pairs, we used d = 2 as the pruning density parameter (which corresponds to the highest F-score on the held out test set).
    Additionally, if the unsegmented form of the word was removed from the lattice during pruning, it was restored to the lattice with zero weight.
    Table 4 summarizes the results of the translation experiments comparing the three input
