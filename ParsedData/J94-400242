 free, we expect that there will be greater divergence in the predictions of the two algorithms.
    The salience measures used by RAP have application to a wider class of languages than Hobbs' order-based search procedure.
    This procedure relies on a correspondence of grammatical roles and linear precedence relations that holds for a comparatively small class of languages.
    Most of the work in this area seeks to formulate general principles of discourse structure and interpretation and to integrate methods of anaphora resolution into a computational model of discourse interpretation (and sometimes of generation as well).
    Sidner (1981, 1983), Grosz, Joshi, and Weinstein (1983, 1986), Grosz and Sidner (1986), 21 The difficulty that RAP encounters with such cases was discussed in Section 4.1.
    We are experimenting with refinements in RAP's scoring mechanism to improve its performance in these and other cases.
    Brennan, Friedman, and Pollard (1987), and Webber (1988) present different versions of
