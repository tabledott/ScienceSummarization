However, the effect of Koskenniemi's literal-matching transition function is achieved by treating 0 as an ordinary tape symbol, so that the individual transducers are &amp;free.
    The intersection of their same-length relations is therefore regular.
    The length-changing effect of the whole-grammar transducer is then provided by mapping 0 onto e. Thus we embed the same-length intersection n,R(Ti) as a regular inner component of a larger regular relation that characterizes the complete lexical-to-surface mapping: This relation expands its lexical string by freely introducing 0 symbols.
    These are constrained along with all other symbols by the inner intersection, and then the surface side of the inner relation is contracted by the removal of all O's.
    The entire outer relation gives an algebraic model of Koskenniemi's operational method for combining individual transducers and for interpreting the null symbol.
    With this analysis of the two-level system in terms of regularly-closed operations and
