sistent with the annotations done for the same task during SENSEVAL-2.
    Verbs are instead annotated with senses from Wordsmyth (http://www.wordsmyth.net/).
    The main reason motivating selection of a different sense inventory is the weak verb performance of systems participating in the English lexical sample in SENSEVAL-2, which may be due to the high number of senses defined for verbs in the WordNet sense inventory.
    By choosing a different set of senses, we hope to gain insight into the dependence of difficulty of the sense disambiguation task on sense inventories.
    Table 1 presents the number of words under each part of speech, and the average number of senses for each class.
    For this evaluation exercise, we decided to isolate the task of semantic tagging from the task of identifying multi-word expressions; we applied a filter that removed all examples pertaining to multi-word expressions prior to the tagging phase.
    Consequently, the training and test data sets made available for this ta
