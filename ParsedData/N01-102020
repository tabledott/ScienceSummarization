riment 1100-1300 translation word pairs.
    Dictionaries for Russian and Ukrainian were converted into romanized pronunciation dictionaries.
    There are three observations which can be made from the multipath results.
    In Table 8 &amp;quot;Cvg&amp;quot; or cognate coverage is the percentage words in the source language for which any of the bridge languages contains a cognate to the target translation.
    Italian and French bridges, for example, offer additional translation pathways to Portuguese which augment the Spanish pathways.
    Using all languages together improves coverage, although this often does not improve performance over using the best single bridge language.
    As a final note, Table 9 shows the cross-language translation rates for some of the investigated languages.
    When translating from English to one of the Romance languages, using Spanish as the bridge language achieves the highest accuracy; and using Russian as the bridge language achieves the best performance when translating
