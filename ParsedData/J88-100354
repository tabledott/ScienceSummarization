les of probabilities.
    The calculation of transitional probabilities is described by Marshall (1983).
    The entire Brown Corpus (modified by the expansion of contracted forms) was analyzed in order to produce the tables used in VOLSUNGA.
    A complete dictionary was therefore available when running the program on that same corpus.
    Since the statistics comprising the dictionary and probability matrix used by the program were derived from the same corpus analyzed, the results may be considered optimal.
    On the other hand, the Corpus is comprehensive enough so that use of other input text is unlikely to introduce statistically significant changes in the program's performance.
    This is especially true because many of the unknown words would be (a) capitalized proper names, for which tag assignment is trivial modulo a small percentage at sentence boundaries, or (b) regular formations from existing words, which are readily identified by suffixes.
    Greene and Rubin (1971) note that their suffix li
