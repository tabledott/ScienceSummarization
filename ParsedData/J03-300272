cause STRAND expects pages to be very similar in structural terms, the resulting document collections are particularly amenable to sentence- or segment-level alignment.
    Indeed, just using dynamic programming to align the markup, ignoring the text, produces reasonable first-pass alignments of the intervening text as a side effect.
    We are currently adapting statistical text-based sentence alignment techniques to take advantage of the markup available in Web-based document pairs.
    Ultimately, the utility of parallel data from the Web is a question that will need to be addressed in practice.
    The potential, of course, is as rich and diverse as the Web itself, and what we as researchers can do with it is an exciting question that remains to be answered.
