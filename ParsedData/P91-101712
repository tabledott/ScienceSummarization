 in components of the translation program, either explicitly or implicitly, especially in transfer based systems.
    Our model assumes that such a mapping of source language relations to target language relations is possible, an assumption that is valid for many practical cases.
    When applying the mapping of relations on one lexical relation of the source sentence we get several alternatives for a target relation.
    For instance, applying the mapping to example (6-c) we get three alternatives for the relation in the target sentence: (8) (verb-obj: achieve progress) (verb-obj: achieve advance) (verb-obj: achieve advancement) For example (6-d) we get 9 alternatives, since both 'II-progress' and 'II-talks' have three alternative translations.
    In order to decide which alternative is the most probable, we count the frequencies of all the alternative target relations in very large corpora.
    For example (8) we got the counts 29, 5 and 1 respectively.
    Similarly, the target relation `to increase chanc
