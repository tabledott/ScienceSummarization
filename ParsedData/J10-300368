using heuristically induced bidirectional word alignments.
    Figure 8 illustrates this extraction process for two example sentence pairs.
    For each pair, a matrix shows the alignment between the Chinese and the English words.
    Element (i, j) of the matrix is filled if there is an alignment link between the ith Chinese word and the jth English word ej.
    All phrase pairs consistent with the word alignment are then extracted.
    A consistent phrase pair can intuitively be thought of as a sub-matrix where all alignment points for its rows and columns are inside it and never outside.
    Next, Steps 8&#8211;11 take all English phrases that correspond to the same foreign phrase and infer them all to be paraphrases of each other.10 For example, the English paraphrase pair (effectively contained, under control) is obtained from Figure 8 by pivoting on the Chinese phrase , shown underlined for both matrices.
