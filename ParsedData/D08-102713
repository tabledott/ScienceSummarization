ous expert and non-expert studies have shown that this task typically yields very high interannotator agreement as measured by Pearson correlation; (Miller and Charles, 1991) found a 0.97 correlation of the annotations of 38 subjects with the annotations given by 51 subjects in (Rubenstein and Goodenough, 1965), and a following study (Resnik, 1999) with 10 subjects found a 0.958 correlation with (Miller and Charles, 1991).
    In our experiment we ask for 10 annotations each of the full 30 word pairs, at an offered price of $0.02 for each set of 30 annotations (or, equivalently, at the rate of 1500 annotations per USD).
    The most surprising aspect of this study was the speed with which it was completed; the task of 300 annotations was completed by 10 annotators in less than 11 min4(Miller and Charles, 1991) and others originally used a numerical score of [0,4]. utes from the time of submission of our task to AMT, at the rate of 1724 annotations / hour.
    As in the previous task we evaluate our nonexpert
