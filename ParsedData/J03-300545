retic approach with a simpler measure that makes no assumptions with respect to the contribution of a semantic class to the total quantity of information provided by the predicate about the semantic classes of its argument.
    It simply substitutes the argument occurring in the predicate-argument bigram with the concept by which it is represented in the WordNet taxonomy.
    Predicate-argument co-occurrence frequency is estimated by counting the number of times the concept corresponding to the argument is observed to co-occur with the predicate in the corpus.
    Because a given word is not always represented by a single class in the taxonomy (i.e., the argument co-occurring with a predicate can generally be the realization of one of several conceptual classes), Lapata, Keller, and McDonald (2001) constructed the frequency counts for a predicate-argument bigram for each conceptual class by dividing the contribution from the argument by the number of classes to which it belongs.
    They demonstrate that the
