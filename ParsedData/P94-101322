 examples.
    A 3% drop in performance is observed, but an over 90% reduction in space is realized.
    The optimum pruning strategy is subject to cost-benefit analysis.
    In the results reported below, all pruning except this final space-saving step was utilized.
    For many similar types of ambiguities, such as the Spanish subjunctive/future distinction between -ara and ard, the decision lists for individual cases will be quite similar and use the same basic evidence for the classification (such as presence of nearby time adverbials).
    It is useful to build a general decision list for all -aral arci ambiguities.
    This also tends to improve performance on words for which there is inadequate training data to build a full individual decision lists.
    The process for building this general class disambiguator is basically identical to that described in Steps 2-5 above, except that in Step 2, training contexts are pooled for all individual instances of the class (such as all -aral-ard ambiguities).
