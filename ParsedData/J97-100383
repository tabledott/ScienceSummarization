ng to their prior probabilities, weighting terms according to the distance from the location under scrutiny according to a Gaussian distribution, or treating the plot as a probabilistic time series and detecting the boundaries based on the likelihood of a transition from nontopic to topic.
    Another alternative is to devise a good normalization strategy that would allow for meaningful comparisons of &amp;quot;real&amp;quot; paragraphs, rather than regular-sized windows of text.
    The question arises as to how to extend the algorithm to capture hierarchical structure.
    One solution is to use the coarse subtopic structure to guide the more fine-grained methods.
    Another is to make several passes through the text, using the results of one round as the input, in terms of which blocks of text are compared, in the next round.
    Finally, it may prove fruitful to use localized discourse cue information or other specialized processing around potential boundary locations to help better determine exactly whe
