emiring we are using.'
    While the values of all main conditions are multiplied together to yield the value for the item under the line, the side conditions are interpreted in a Boolean manner: if all of them are nonzero, the rule can be used, but if any of them are zero, it cannot be.
    Other than for checking whether they are zero or nonzero, their values are ignored.
    Figure 4 gives an item-based description of Earley's parser.
    We assume the addition of a distinguished nonterminal S' with a single rule S' S. An item of the form [i, A &#8212;&gt; a /3,j] asserts that A =&gt; a/3 4 w, .
    .
    .
    The prediction rule includes a side condition, making it a good example.
    The rule is: Through the prediction rule, Earley's algorithm guarantees that an item of the form [j,B &#8226; -y, can only be produced if S w1 wi_iBS for some b; this top-down filtering leads to significantly more efficient parsing for some grammars than the CKY algorithm.
    The prediction rule combines side and main cond
