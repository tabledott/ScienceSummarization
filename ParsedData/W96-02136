at the word spellings, will apply to both rare words and unknown words in test data.
    For example, Table 2 contains an excerpt from training data while Table 3 contains the features generated while scanning (h3, t3), in which the current word is about, and Table 4 contains features generated while scanning (h4, 14), in which the current word, well-heeled, occurs 3 times in training data and is therefore classified as &amp;quot;rare&amp;quot;.
    The behavior of a feature that occurs very sparsely in the training set is often difficult to predict, since its statistics may not be reliable.
    Therefore, the model uses the heuristic that any feature Condition Features wi is not rare wi = X wi is rare Xis prefix of wi, IXI &lt;4 &amp; ti = T X is suffix of wi, IXI &lt; 4 wi contains number &amp; ti = T wi contains uppercase character &amp; t&#8226; = T wi contains hyphen &amp; ti = T which occurs less than 10 times in the data is unreliable, and ignores features whose counts are less than 10.3 While there ar
