    According to Kuno &amp; Kaburagi (ibid.
    ), there is only a handful of verbs with SUBJECT Ident (e.g., marry, meet, run into, hear from, receive from) and only one with nonSUBJECT Ident (come up to), none of which propagate with an operation like the Japanese complex verb formation.
    Moreover, even using these verbs, the Ident effect on pronoun interpretation is not 19Implicit here are two weakest properties to be shared: 5) nonIdent alone and 6) nonSUBJECT alone.
    These were left out because of the scarcity of actual instances in discourse.
    I found, however, that exactly the same scale of shared properties accounts for the possibility of the intra-sentential zero pronominal binding in Japanese, and that the
