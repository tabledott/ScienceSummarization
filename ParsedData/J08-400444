to imply that multiple coders increase reliability: The variance of the individual coders&#8217; distributions can be just as large with many coders as with few coders, but its effect on the value of &#954; decreases as the number of coders grows, and becomes more similar to random noise.
    The same holds for weighted measures too; see the extended version of this article for definitions and proof.
    In an annotation study with 18 subjects, we compared &#945; with a variant which uses individual coder distributions to calculate expected agreement, and found that the values never differed beyond the third decimal point (Poesio and Artstein 2005).
    We conclude with a summary of our views concerning the difference between &#960;style and &#954;-style coefficients.
    First of all, keep in mind that empirically the difference is small, and gets smaller as the number of annotators increases.
    Then instead of reporting two coefficients, as suggested by Di Eugenio and Glass (2004), the appropriate coeffic
