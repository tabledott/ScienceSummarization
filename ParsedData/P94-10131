cision lists (Rivest, 1987).
    The algorithm considers multiple types of evidence in the context of an ambiguous word, exploiting differences in collocational distribution as measured by log-likelihoods.
    Unlike standard Bayesian approaches, however, it does not combine the log-likelihoods of all available pieces of contextual evidence, but bases its classifications solely on the single most reliable piece of evidence identified in the target context.
    Perhaps surprisingly, this strategy appears to yield the same or even slightly better precision than the combination of evidence approach when trained on the same features.
    It also brings with it several additional advantages, the greatest of which is the ability to include multiple, highly non-independent sources of evidence without complex modeling of dependencies.
    Some other advantages are significant simplicity and ease of implementation, transparent understandability This research was supported by an NDSEG Fellowship, ARPA grant N00014-90-J
