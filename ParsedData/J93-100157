ormally distributed, and an alternative parameterization of the probability distributions.
    In the Brown Corpus, it happens that f (strong, enough) = 11, f (strong) -= 194, f (enough) = 426, and N = 1, 181, 041.
    Using these values, we estimate t 3.3, which is larger than 1.65, and therefore we can confidently reject the null hypothesis, and conclude that the co-occurrence is significantly larger than chance.
    The estimation uses the approximation, a2 (Pr (strong, enough)) f (strong, enough) /N2, which can be justified under appropriate binomial assumptions.
    It is also assumed that a2 (Pr (strong) Pr(enough)) is very small and can be omitted.
    Although statistics are often used to test a particular hypothesis as we have just seen, statistics can also be used to explore the space of possible hypotheses, or to discover new hypotheses (supervised/unsupervised learning/training).
