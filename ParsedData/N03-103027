 Grammar-based lexicalized models of discourse (Forbes et al., 2001) has already shown how to exploit within a single framework lexical, syntactic, and discourse cues.
    Various linguistics studies have also shown how intertwined syntax and discourse are (Maynard, 1998).
    However, to our knowledge, this is the first paper that empirically shows that the connection between syntax and discourse can be computationally exploited at high levels of accuracy on open domain, newspaper text.
    Another interesting finding is that the performance of current state-of-the-art syntactic parsers (Charniak, 2000) is not a bottleneck for coming up with a good solution to the sentence-level discourse parsing problem.
    Little improvement comes from using manually built syntactic parse trees instead of automatically derived trees.
    However, experiments show that there is much to be gained if better discourse segmentation algorithms are found; 83% accuracy on this task is not sufficient for building highly accurate d
