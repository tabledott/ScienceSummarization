lexicon, as has been proposed on linguistic grounds (Dowty, 1988; Steedman, 1991, and others).
    It also treats conjunction lexically, by giving &amp;quot;and&amp;quot; the generalized category x\x/x and barring it from composition. all analyses in a cell are to be semantically distinct.
    (Karttunen, 1986) suggests enforcing that property directly&#8212;by comparing each new analysis semantically with existing analyses in the cell, and refusing to add it if redundant&#8212;but (Hepple &amp; Morrill, 1989) observe briefly that this is inefficient for large charts.3 The following sections show how to obtain effectively the same result without doing any semantic interpretation or comparison at all.
  
  
    It is convenient to begin with a special case.
    Suppose the CCG grammar includes not some but all instances of the binary rule templates in (4).
    (As always, a separate lexicon specifies the possible categories of each word.)
    If we group a sentence's parses into semantic equivalence classes, i
