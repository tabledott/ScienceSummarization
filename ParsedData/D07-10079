n translationaccuracy rather than other measures such as alignment error rate, which may not actually lead to im proved translation quality; in contrast, for example, Garcia-Varea et al (2001) and Garcia-Varea et al (2002) show improved alignment error rate with a maximum entropy based context-dependent lexicalchoice model, but not improved translation accuracy.
			In contrast, our evaluation in this paper is conducted on the actual decoding task, rather than in termediate tasks such as word alignment.
			Moreover,in the present work, all commonly available auto mated MT evaluation metrics are used, rather than only BLEU score, so as to maintain a more balanced perspective.
			Another problem in the context-sensitive lexical choice in SMT models of Garcia Varea et al is that their feature set is insufficiently rich to make much better predictions than the SMT model itself.
			In contrast, our WSD-based lexical choice models are designed to directly model the lexical choice in the actual translation direction,
