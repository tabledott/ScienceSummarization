al information scores fail to identify aujourd hui as the best candidate&#8212;it is only ranked fourth.
    Furthermore, the four SI scores are very similar, thus not clearly differentiating the results.
    In contrast, the Dice coefficient clearly identifies aujourd hui as the group of words most similar to today, which is what we want.
    After implementing Champollion, we attempted to generalize these results and confirm our theoretical argumentation by performing an experiment to compare SI and the Dice coefficient in the context of Champollion.
    We selected a set of 45 collocations with mid-range frequency identified by XTRACT and we ran Champollion on them using sample training corpora (databases).
    For each run of Champollion, and for each input collocation, we took the final set of candidate translations of different lengths produced by Champollion (with the intermediate stages driven by the Dice coefficient) and compared the results obtained using both the Dice coefficient and SI at the last
