ntic concordance.
  If the corpus is some specific text, it is a specific semantic concordance; ff the corpus includes many different exts, it is a universal semantic concordance.
  We have begun constructing a universal semantic oncor- dance in conjunction with our work on a lexical database.
  The result can be viewed either as a collection of passages in which words have been tagged syntactically and semanti- eally, or as a lexicon in which illustrative sentences can be found for many definitions.
  At the present time, the correla- tion of a lexical meaning with examples in which a word is used to express that meaning must be done by hand.
  Manual semantic tagging is tedious; it should be done automatically as soon as it is possible to resolve word senses in context automatically.
  It is hoped that the manual creation of a semantic oncordance will provide an appropriate environ- ment for developing and testing those automatic procedures.
