 a query containing the (Mesh) terms protein binding, interaction, and molecular to Medline, while the rest of 53 have been extracted randomly from the GENIA corpus (Collier et al., 1999).
    It contains a total of 3713 protein references.
    The second dataset is Aimed2 which has been previously used for training the protein interaction extraction systems in (Bunescu et al., 2004).
    It consists of 225 Medline abstracts, of which 200 are known to describe interactions between human proteins, while the other 25 do not refer to any interaction.
    There are 4084 protein references in this dataset.
    We compared the performance of three systems: LT-RMN is the RMN approach using local templates and the overlap template, GLT-RMN is the full RMN approach, using both local and global templates, and CRF, which uses a CRF for labeling token sequences.
    We used the CRF implementation from (McCallum, 2002) with the set of tags and features used by the MaximumEntropy tagger described in (Bunescu et al., 2004).
