here is ~o longer a single node; rather ~ul auxiliary trec replaces the node.
  Wc believe that this approach of ~sociating two statements with a node in the auxiliary tree is iu the spirit of TAGs because of the OA constraints in TAGs.
  A node with OA constraints cannot bc viewed as a single node and must be considered as something that has to be replaced by an auxiliary tree.
  t and b axe restrictions about tile auxiliary tree that must be adjoined at this node.
  Note that if the node does not have OA constraint then we should expect and b to be compatible.
  For example, in the final sentential tree, this node will be viewed as a single entity.
  Thus, in general, with every internal node, ~, (i.e., where adjunction could take place), we associate two structures, tn and b n. With each terminal node, we would associate only one structure 4, xtroot t fo~t X___-~ bfoot Figure 4: Feature structures and adjunction 4It is posslblc to allow adjunctlons at nodes corresponding to pre-lexlcal items.
