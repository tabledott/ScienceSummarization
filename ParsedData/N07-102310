99; Klein and Manning, 2003), i.e., factorize n-ary grammar productions into products of n right-hand side probabilities, a technique sometimes called Markovization.
    Markovization is generally head-driven, i.e., reflects a decomposition centered around the head of each CFG production: l , AL- &#183;&#183;&#183; L'HR' &#183;&#183;&#183; RnA (4) 4K&amp;M incorporate lexical probabilities through n-gram models, but such language models are obviously not good for preventing such unreasonable deletions. where H is the head, L1,..., Lm the left modifiers, R1, ... , Rn are right modifiers, and A termination symbols needed for accurate probability estimations (e.g., to capture the fact that certain constituents are more likely than others to be the rightmost constituent); for simplicity, we will ignore A in later discussions.
    For a given SCFG production l &#8594; h&#945;f, &#945;ci, we ask, given the source RHS &#945;f that is assumed given (e.g., provided by a syntactic parser), which of its RHS elements are
