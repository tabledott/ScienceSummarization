ent the official scores for the top five DUC 2004 participants and the human summaries in Table 4 and Table 5 for Tasks 2 and 4, respectively.
    Our top few results for each task are either better than or statistically indifferent from the best system in the official runs considering the 95% confidence interval.
  
  
    We have presented a novel approach to define sentence centrality based on graph-based prestige scoring of sentences.
    Constructing the similarity graph of sentences provides us with a better view of important sentences compared to the centroid approach, which is prone to overgeneralization of the information in a document cluster.
    We have introduced two different methods, Degree and LexPageRank, for computing prestige in similarity graphs.
    The results of applying these methods on extractive summarization is quite promising.
    Even the simplest approach we have taken, degree centrality, is a good enough heuristic to perform better than lead-based and centroid-based summaries.
