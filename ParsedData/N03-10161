    However, when dealing with wide-coverage grammars and long sentences, even cubic algorithms can be far too expensive in practice.
    Two primary types of methods for accelerating parse selection have been proposed.
    Roark (2001) and Ratnaparkhi (1999) use a beam-search strategy, in which only the best n parses are tracked at any moment.
    Parsing time is linear and can be made arbitrarily fast by reducing n. This is a greedy strategy, and the actual Viterbi (highestprobability) parse can be pruned from the beam because, while it is globally optimal, it may not be locally optimal at every parse stage.
    Chitrao and Grishman (1990), Caraballo and Charniak (1998), Charniak et al. (1998), and Collins (1999) describe best-first parsing, which is intended for a tabular item-based framework.
    In best-first parsing, one builds a figure-of-merit (FOM) over parser items, and uses the FOM to decide the order in which agenda it
