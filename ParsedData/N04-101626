in in its lexicalized form.
    Furthermore, we experimented with several conditional and unconditional variants of (7) and (6).
    Co-occurrence frequencies were estimated from the web using inflected queries (see Section 2).
    Determiners were inserted before nouns resulting in queries of the type story/stories about and about the/a/0 war/wars for the compound war story.
    As shown in Table 10, the best performance was obtained using the web-based trigram model (f(n1, p,n2)); it significantly outperformed the best BNC model.
    The comparison with the literature in Table 11 showed that the best Altavista model significantly outperformed both the baseline and the best model in the literature (Lauer&#8217;s word-based model).
    The BNC model, on the other hand, achieved a performance that is not significantly different from the baseline, and significantly worse than Lauer&#8217;s best model.
  
  
    The next analysis task that we consider is the problem of determining the countability of nouns.
