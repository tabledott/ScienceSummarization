onymy involves &amp;quot;using one entity to refer to another that is related to it&amp;quot; (Lakoff and Johnson 1980, p. 35).
    &amp;quot;The ham sandwich is waiting for his check.&amp;quot; For example, in (2) the metonymy is that the concept for ham sandwich is related to an aspect of another concept, for &amp;quot;the person who ordered the ham sandwich.&amp;quot; Several attempts have been made to organize instances of metonymy into categories (e.g., Lakoff and Johnson 1980; Stern 1931; Yamanashi 1987) or &amp;quot;metonymic concepts,&amp;quot; as Lakoff and Johnson call them.
    A common metonymic concept is PART FOR WHOLE, otherwise known as synechdoche.
    &amp;quot;Dave drank the glasses&amp;quot; (= the liquid in the glasses).
    &amp;quot;The kettle is boiling&amp;quot; (= the liquid in the kettle) (Waldron 1967, p. 186; Yamanashi 1987, p. 78).
    CONTAINER FOR CONTENTS, another metonymic concept, occurs in (7) between 'drink' and the sense of 'glasses' meaning &amp;quot;containers,&amp;quot
