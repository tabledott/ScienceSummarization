 questions.
    However, using the splitting theorem of Breiman, Friedman, 01shen, and Stone [Breiman et aL, 1984], it is possible to find the most informative of these 2v questions in time which is linear in V. The flip-flop algorithm begins by making an initial assignment of the English translations into two classes, and then uses the splitting theorem to find the best question about the potential informant.
    This question divides the French vocabulary into two sets.
    One can then use the splitting theorem to find a division of the English translations of w into two sets which has maximal mutual information with the French sets.
    In the flip-flop algorithm, one alternates between splitting the French vocabulary into two sets and the English translations of w into two sets.
    After each such split, the mutual information between the French and English sets is at least as great as before the split.
    Since the mutual information is bounded by one bit, the process converges to a partition of the F
