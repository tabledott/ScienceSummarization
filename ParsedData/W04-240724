he best unlabeled attachment score is lower than forEnglish, where the best results are above 90% (attach ment score per word) (Collins et al, 1999; Yamada and Matsumoto, 2003), but higher than for Czech (Collins et al., 1999).
			This is encouraging, given that the size of the training set in our experiments is fairly small, onlyabout 10% of the standard training set for the Penn Tree bank.
			One reason why our results nevertheless compare reasonably well with those obtained with the much larger training set is probably that the conversion to dependency trees is more accurate for the Swedish treebank, given theexplicit annotatation of grammatical functions.
			More over, the fact that our parser uses labeled dependenciesis probably also significant, since the possibility of using information from previously assigned (labeled) de pendencies during parsing seems to have a positive effect on accuracy (Nivre, 2004).
			Finally, it may be interesting to consider the accuracy for individual dependency types.
