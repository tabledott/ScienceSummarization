onal speech.
    These results, besides validating the methods described, are of interest for several reasons.
    For example, unlike in most previous work on DA labeling, the corpus is not task-oriented in nature, and the amount of data used (198,000 utterances) exceeds that in previous studies by at least an order of magnitude (see Table 14).
    To keep the presentation interesting and concrete, we will alternate between the description of general methods and empirical results.
    Section 2 describes the task and our data in detail.
    Section 3 presents the probabilistic modeling framework; a central component of this framework, the discourse grammar, is further discussed in Section 4.
    In Section 5 we describe experiments for DA classification.
    Section 6 shows how DA models can be used to benefit speech recognition.
    Prior and related work is summarized in Section 7.
    Further issues and open problems are addressed in Section 8, followed by concluding remarks in Section 9.
