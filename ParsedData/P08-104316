flects our belief that all the segmentations of the given input sentence are a-priori equally likely; the only reason to prefer one segmentation over the another is due to the overall syntactic context which is modeled via the PCFG derivations.
    A compatible view is presented by Charniak et al. (1996) who consider the kind of probabilities a generative parser should get from a PoS tagger, and concludes that these should be P(w|t) &#8220;and nothing fancier&#8221;.3 In our setting, therefore, the Lattice is not used to induce a probability distribution on a linear context, but rather, it is used as a common-denominator of state-indexation of all segmentations possibilities of a surface form.
    This is a unique object for which we are able to define a proper probability model.
    Thus our proposed model is a proper model assigning probability mass to all (7r, L) pairs, where 7r is a parse tree and L is the one and only lattice that a sequence of characters (and spaces) W over our alpha-beth gives rise to.
