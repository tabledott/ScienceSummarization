ilter encoding of the language models (Bloom, 1970).
    Feature instances of types i and ii are weighted using the tf*idf scheme and normalised by the L2 norm.
    Feature type iii is weighted using frequency counts, while iii and iv are scaled so that their final value has approximately the same order of magnitude as i and ii.
    The script length is based on the number of words and is mainly added to balance the effect the length of a script has on other features.
    Finally, features whose overall frequency is lower than four are discarded from the model.
  
  
    In order to evaluate our AA system, we use two correlation measures, Pearson&#8217;s product-moment correlation coefficient and Spearman&#8217;s rank correlation coefficient (hereafter Pearson&#8217;s and Spearman&#8217;s correlation respectively).
    Pearson&#8217;s correlation determines the degree to which two linearly dependent variables are related.
    As Pearson&#8217;s correlation is sensitive to the distribution of data and, due to
