 algorithms in Figure 7 are special cases of Translator CT.
    It is therefore possible to implement an MTSMT system using just one inference algorithm, parameterized by a grammar, a semiring, and a search strategy.
    An advantage of building an MT system in this manner is that improvements invented for ordinary parsing algorithms can often be applied to all the main components of the system.
    For example, Melamed (2003) showed how to reduce the computational complexity of a synchronous parser by , just by changing the logic.
    The same optimization can be applied to the inference algorithms in this paper.
    With proper software design, such optimizations need never be implemented more than once.
    For simplicity, the algorithms in this paper are based on CKY logic.
    However, the architecture in Figure 7 can also be implemented using generalizations of more sophisticated parsing logics, such as those inherent in Earley or Head-Driven parsers.
