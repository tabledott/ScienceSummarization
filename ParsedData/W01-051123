second noun not present in the training set).
    This seems to indicate that the second noun is more important for the classification that the first one.
  
  
    We have presented a simple approach to corpusbased assignment of semantic relations for noun compounds.
    The main idea is to define a set of relations that can hold between the terms and use standard machine learning techniques and a lexical hierarchy to generalize from training instances to new examples.
    The initial results are quite promising.
    In this task of multi-class classification (with 18 classes) we achieved an accuracy of about 60%.
    These results can be compared with Vanderwende &#162;Note that for unseen words, the baseline lexical-based logistic regression approach, which essentially builds a tabular representation of the log-odds for each class, also reduces to random guessing.
