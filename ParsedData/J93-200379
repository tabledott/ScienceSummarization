lish word.
    They were unaware of a connection to the EM algorithm, but they did realize that their method is not entirely satisfactory.
    For example, once it is clearly established that in (La porte est rouge I The door is red), it is red that produces rouge, one is uncomfortable using this sentence as support for red producing porte or door producing rouge.
    They suggest removing words once a correlation between them has been clearly established and then reprocessing the resulting impoverished translations hoping to recover less obvious correlations now revealed by the departure of their more prominent relatives.
    From our present perspective, we see that the proper way to proceed is simply to carry out more iterations of the EM algorithm.
    The likelihood for Model 1 has a unique local maximum for any set of training data.
    As iterations proceed, the count for porte as a translation of red will dwindle away.
    In a later paper, Brown et al. (1990) describe a model that is essentially the
