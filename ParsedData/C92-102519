  The general organization of the system like the one we have described suggests that the role of rules might be quite different.
  Instead of being essential for the production and comprehension f speech, the rules that linguists are trying to discover may be--if they exist in the mind at all--only sec- ondary reflections on the generalizations that can be encoded in the finite-state l xi- cal structure itself.
