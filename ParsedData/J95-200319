inite description and c is its denotation, its value-free interpretation (discussed in Section 8), or an object related to it by &amp;quot;speaker's reference&amp;quot; (Kripke 1977).
    More importantly, when NP is a pronoun, the principles that determine the c's for which it is the case that NP directly realizes c do not derive exclusively from syntactic, semantic, or pragmatic factors.
    They are principles that must be elicited from the study of discourse itself.
    An initial formulation of some such principles is given in Section 8.6 The forward-looking centers of Un depend only on the expressions that constitute that utterance; they are not constrained by features of any previous utterance in the segment.
    The elements of Cf(Un) are partially ordered to reflect relative prominence in U.
    In Section 5, we discuss a number of factors that may affect the ordering on the elements of Cf.
    The more highly ranked an element of Cf (Un), the more likely it is to be Cb (Un+1).
    The most highly ra
