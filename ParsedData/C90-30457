we see that the links in the opera?
			tor trees (those in 7) are preserved in the resultant pair, accounting for the sole remaining link.
			Tile trees in 7 are linked in this way so that other tree pairs can modify the N. We can continue the derivation, using 5 and ~ to gen- erate the pair given in Figure 2 thereby associating the meaning violently' ( hates' (george', cooked'( broccol i') ) ) ) with the sentence "George hates cooked broccoli vio- lently."
			A subtle issue mises with respect o link updating in the resultant pair if two links impinge on the same node.
			When one of the links is chosen and an adjunction per- formed at the node, the other link must appear in the resultant.
			The question as to whether that link should now end at the root or foot of the adjoined tree can be re- solved in several ways.
			Although the choice of method does not affect any of the examples in this paper, we mention our current resolution of this problem here.
			If the remaining link is connected initially to the
