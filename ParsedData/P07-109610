from Q, and uses it to update P and Q, until a span covering the whole sequence is added to P and Q becomes empty.
    This is explained in detail below.
    At each step, we remove from Q the span p' such that the action (not hypothesis) score of its top hypothesis, p'.S.T, is the highest.
    This represents the labeling action for the next move that we are most confident about.
    Now we need to update P and Q with the selected span p'.
    We add p' to P, and remove from P the spans included in p', if any.
    Let S be the set of removed spans.
    We remove from Q each span which takes one of the spans in S as context, and replace it with a new candidate span taking p' (and another accepted span) as context.
    We always maintain B different states for each span.
    Back to the previous example, after Step 3 is completed, w2 found, w4 book and w5 interesting have been tagged and we have There are two candidate spans in Q, each with its associated hypotheses and most recent actions.
