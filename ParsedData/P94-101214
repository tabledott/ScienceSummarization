ove rates are for Type I errors.
    The alternative measure of accuracy on Type II errors is useful for machine translation applications, where the objective is to extract only 1-for-1 sentence pairs, and to discard all others.
    In this case, we are interested in the proportion of 1-for-1 output pairs that are true 1-for-1 pairs.
    (In information retrieval terminology, this measures precision whereas the above measures recall.)
    In the test session, 438 1-for-1 pairs were output, of which 377, or 86.1%, were true matches.
    Again, however, by discarding the introduction, the accuracy rises to a surprising 96.3%.
    The introductory session header exemplifies a weakness of the pure length-based strategy, namely, its susceptibility to long stretches of passages with roughly similar lengths.
    In our data this arises from the list of council members present and absent at each session (figure 4), but similar stretches can arise in many other domains.
    In such a situation, two slight perturbation
