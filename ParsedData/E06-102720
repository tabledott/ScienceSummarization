			These results suggest that the two measures ofword centrality, Net Overlap Score based on mul tiple STEP runs and the inter-annotator agreement (HM vs. GI-H4), are directly related 7.
			Thus, the Net Overlap Score can serve as a useful tool in the identification of core and peripheral membersof a fuzzy lexical category, as well as in predic 7In our sample, the coefficient of correlation between thetwo was 0.68.

			In order to make the Net Overlap Score measure usable in sentiment tagging of texts and phrases,the absolute values of this score should be normalized and mapped onto a standard [0, 1] inter val.
