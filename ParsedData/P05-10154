en items and between labels.
    Next, we consider what item similarity measure to apply, proposing one based on the positive-sentence percentage.
    Incorporating this new measure within the metriclabeling framework is shown to often provide significant improvements over the other algorithms.
    We hope that some of the insights derived here might apply to other scales for text classifcation that have been considered, such as clause-level opinion strength (Wilson, Wiebe, and Hwa, 2004); affect types like disgust (Subasic and Huettner, 2001; Liu, Lieberman, and Selker, 2003); reading level (Collins-Thompson and Callan, 2004); and urgency or criticality (Horvitz, Jacobs, and Hovel, 1999).
  
  
    We first ran a small pilot study on human subjects in order to establish a rough idea of what a reasonable classification granularity is: if even people cannot accurately infer labels with respect to a five-star scheme with half stars, say, then we cannot expect a learning algorithm to do so.
    Indeed, some pote
