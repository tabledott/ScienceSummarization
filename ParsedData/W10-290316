    Despite the lexical similarity in these examples, the semantic parser will correctly parse the first sentence but fail to parse the second because the lexical items belong to different a syntactic category (i.e., the word Texas is not part of a preposition phrase in the second sentence).
    The ability to adapt to unseen inputs is one of the key challenges in semantic parsing.
    Several works (Zettlemoyer and Collins, 2007; Kate, 2008) have addressed this issue explicitly by manually defining syntactic transformation rules that can help the learned parser generalize better.
    Unfortunately these are only partial solutions as a manually constructed rule set cannot cover the many syntactic variations.
    Given the previous example, we observe that it is enough to identify that the function capital(&#183;) and the constant const(texas) appear in the target MR, since there is only a single way to compose these entities into a single formula &#8212; capital(const(texas)).
