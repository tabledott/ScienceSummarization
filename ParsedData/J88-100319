    Its accuracy is high, but it is very slow, and it has been manually augmented in a number of ways.
    The effects upon accuracy of this manual augmentation are not individually known.
    The current paper presents an algorithm for disambiguation that is similar to CLAWS but that operates in linear rather than in exponential time and space, and which minimizes the unsystematic augments.
    Tests of the algorithm using the million words of the Brown Standard Corpus of English are reported; the overall accuracy is 96%.
    This algorithm can provide a fast and accurate front end to any parsing or natural language processing system for English.
    Every computer system that accepts natural language input must, if it is to derive adequate representations, decide upon the grammatical category of each input word.
    In English and many other languages, tokens are frequently ambiguous.
    They may represent lexical items of different categories, depending upon their syntactic and semantic c
