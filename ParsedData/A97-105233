y that m or more occurrences of patterns for i will occur with a verb which is not a member of i, given n occurrences of that verb.
    Setting a threshold of less than or equal to 0.05 yields a 95% or better confidence that a high enough proportion of patterns for i have been observed for the verb to be in class i3.
    Our approach to acquiring subcategorization classes is predicated on the following assumptions: probabilistic cue for membership of i, so membership should only be inferred if there are enough occurrences of patterns for i in the data to outweigh the error probability for i.
    This simple automated, hybrid linguistic/statistical approach contrasts with the manual linguistic analysis of the COMLEX Syntax lexicographers (Meyers et at., 1994), who propose five criteria and five heuristics for argument-hood and six criteria and two heuristics for adjunct-hood, culled mostly from the linguistics literature.
    Many of these are not exploitable automatically because they rest on semantic judgeme
