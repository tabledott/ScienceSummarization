ues for matching definite descriptions with their antecedents, discourse segmentation, recognizing discourse-new descriptions, and suggesting anchors for bridging descriptions.
  
  
    Most models of definite description processing proposed in the literature tend to emphasise the anaphoric role of these elements.'
    (Heim j19821 is perhaps the best formalization of this type of theory).
    This approach is challenged by the results of experiments we reported previously (Poesio and Vieira 1998), in which subjects were asked to classify the uses of definite descriptions in Wall Street Journal articles according to schemes derived from proposals by Hawkins (1978) and Prince (1981).
    The results of these experiments indicated that definite descriptions are not primarily anaphoric; about half of the time they are used to introduce a new entity in the discourse.
    In this paper, we present an implemented system for processing definite descriptions based on the results of that earlier study.
