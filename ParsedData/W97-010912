ually tend to stand for their most similar sense if they appear in the same context.
    In this chapter we present a similarity-based disambiguation method aimed at disambiguating sentences for subsequent PP-attachment resolution.
    Similar contextual situations (these include information on the PP-attachment) are found in the training corpora and are used for the sense disambiguation.
    If, for example, the verb buy (4 senses) appears in the sentence: The investor bought the company for 5 million dollars and somewhere else in the training corpus there is a sentence4: The investor purchased the company for 5 million dollars, we can take advantage of this similarity and disambiguate the verb &amp;quot;buy&amp;quot; to its sense that is nearest to the sense of the verb purchase, which is not ambiguous.
    The situation, however, might not be as simplistic as that, because such obvious matches are extremely rare even in a huge corpus.
    The first problem is that the sample verb in the training corpus may
