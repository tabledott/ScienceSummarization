    The KnowItAll system (Etzioni et al., 2005) achieved 97% precision with 58% recall, and 79% precision with 87% recall.5 To the best of our knowledge, other researchers have not reported results for the singer and fish categories.
    Figure 3 shows the learning curve for both algorithms using their best scoring functions on the singer category with Placido Domingo as the initial seed.
    In total, 400 candidate words were generated.
    The Out-degree scoring function ranked the candidates well.
    Figure 3 also includes a vertical line indicating where the candidate list was cut (at 180 instances) based on the zero productivity cutoff.
    One observation is that the rankings do a good job of identifying borderline cases, which typically are ranked just below most correct instances but just above the obviously bad entries.
    For example, for states, the 50 U.S. states are ranked first, followed by 14 more entries (in order): The first 7 entries are all former states of the Soviet Uni
