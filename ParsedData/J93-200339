s for which aj equals i Therefore, with Ef t(f le) = 1/ E1 d(jii m/ 1) = 1, E0 n (01 e) = 1, and po +pi = 1.
    The assumptions that we make for Model 3 are such that each of the pairs (T, 7r) in (f, a) makes an identical contribution to the sum in Equation (30).
    The factorials in Equation (32) come from carrying out this sum explicitly.
    There is no factorial for the empty cept because it is exactly canceled by the contribution from the distortion probabilities.
    By now, the reader will be able to provide his or her own auxiliary function for seeking a constrained minimum of the likelihood of a translation with Model 3, but for completeness and to establish notation, we write h(t,d,n,p, A, tt, v, Pr(fle) - E A, (f. t(f 1 e) - 1) - Eitina(Ed(j1i, m, 1) - 1) _Eve( n(01 e) - 1) - (po + pi -1).
    (33) Following the trail blazed with Models 1 and 2, we define the counts The counts in these last two equations correspond to the parameters po and p1 that determine the fertility of the empty cept in the
