    In this paper we present and evaluate a simple two-pass architecture for handling the problems of parsing transcribed speech.
    The first pass tries to identify which of the words in the string are edited (&#8220;why didn&#8217;t he,&#8221; in the above example).
    These words are removed from the string given to the second pass, an already existing statistical parser trained on a transcribed speech &#8727; This research was supported in part by NSF grant LIS SBR 9720368 and by NSF ITR grant 20100203. corpus.

    This architecture is based upon a fundamental assumption: that the semantic and pragma
