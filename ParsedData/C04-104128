ssible given the simple tag ging approach currently being used.The novel parsing strategy of allowing the grammar to decide if the supertagging is likely to be cor rect suggests a number of interesting possibilities.In particular, we would like to investigate only re pairing those areas of the chart that are most likely to contain errors, rather than parsing the sentence from scratch using a new set of lexical categories.
			This could further increase parsing effficiency.
