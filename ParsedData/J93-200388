    Improving Parameter Values.
    From Jensen's inequality (55), we see that 0(Po) is greater than 0(P0) if R(P0-, Po) is positive.
    With P= P. this suggests the following between probability distributions p and q.
    However, whereas the relative entropy is never negative, R can take any value.
    The inequality (55) for R is the analog of the inequality D &gt; 0 for D. iterative procedure, known as the EM Algorithm (Baum 1972; Dempster, Laird, and Rubin 1977), for finding locally optimal parameter values 0 for a model P: Note that for any a, R(Po, Po) is non-negative at its maximum in 0, since it is zero for = O.
    Thus 0(P0) will not decrease from one iteration to the next.
    Going From One Model to Another.
    Jensen's inequality also suggests a method for using parameter values 0 for one model I' to find initial parameter values 0 for another model P: In contrast to the case where f' = P, there may not be any 0 for which R(P0, Po) is non-negative.
    Thus, it could be that, even f
