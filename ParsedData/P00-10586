    This grammar, as well as the grammar used by the parser, is lexicalized in the sense that every elementary tree has exactly one terminal node, its lexical anchor.
    Since sister-adjunction can be simulated by ordinary adjunction, this variant is, like TIG (and CFG), weakly context-free and O(n3)-time parsable.
    Rather than coin a new acronym for this particular variant, we will simply refer to it as &amp;quot;TAG&amp;quot; and trust that no confusion will arise.
    The parameters of a probabilistic TAG (Resnik, 1992; Schabes, 1992) are: where a ranges over initial trees, ,3 over auxiliary trees, y over modifier trees, and rl over nodes.
    Pi(a) is the probability of beginning a derivation with a; Ps(a j TI) is the probability of substituting a at TI; Pa(,3 j TI) is the probability of adjoining ,3 at TI; finally, Pa(NONE j TI) is the probability of nothing adjoining at rl.
    (Carroll and Weir, 1997) suggest other parameterizations worth exploring as well.
    Our variant adds another set of param
