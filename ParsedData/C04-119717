sing ILP.
			4.2 Using Integer Linear Programming.
			As discussed previously, a collection of potential arguments is not necessarily a valid semantic label ing since it must satisfy all of the constraints.
			In this context, inference is the process of finding the best (according to Equation 1) valid semantic labels that satisfy all of the specified constraints.
			We take a similar approach that has been previously used for entity/relation recognition (Roth and Yih, 2004), and model this inference procedure as solving an ILP.
			An integer linear program(ILP) is basically the same as a linear program.
			The cost function and the (in)equality constraints are all linear in terms of thevariables.
			The only difference in an ILP is the vari ables can only take integers as their values.
			In our inference problem, the variables are in fact binary.
			A general binary integer programming problem can be stated as follows.
			Given a cost vector p ? &lt;d, a set of variables, z = (z1, . . .
