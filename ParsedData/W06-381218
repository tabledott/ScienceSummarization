 In the process, language-ambiguous words are assigned to only one language, which did not hurt performance due to the high redundancy of the task.
    However, it would have been possible to use the soft partitioning to acquire a distribution over languages for each word.
    For the acquisition of word classes, we use a different graph: the second-order graph on neighboring co-occurrences.
    To set up the graph, a co-occurrence calculation is performed which yields significant word pairs based on their occurrence as immediate neighbors.
    This can be perceived as a bipartite graph, figure 9a gives a toy example.
    Note that if similar words occur in both parts, they form two distinct nodes.
    This graph is transformed into a second-order graph by comparing the number of common right and left neighbors for two words.
    The similarity (edge weight) between two words is the sum of common neighbors.
    Figure 9b depicts the secondorder graph derived from figure 9a and its partitioning by CW.
