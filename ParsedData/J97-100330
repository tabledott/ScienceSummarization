 researchers' algorithms into a more appropriate framework for the TextTiling task.
    In the block comparison algorithm, adjacent pairs of text blocks are compared for overall lexical similarity.
    The TextTiling algorithm requires that a score, called the lexical score, be computed for every sentence, or more precisely, for the gap between every pair of sentences (since this is where paragraph breaks take place).
    The sketch in Figure 3(a) illustrates the scores computed for the block comparison algorithm.
    In this figure is shown a sequence of eight hypothetical sentences, their contents represented as columns of letters, where each letter represents a term or word.
    The sentences are grouped into blocks of size k, where in this illustration k = 2.
    The more words the blocks have in common, the higher the lexical score at the gap between them.
    If a low lexical score is preceded by and followed by high lexical scores, this is assumed to indicate a shift in vocabulary corresponding to a su
