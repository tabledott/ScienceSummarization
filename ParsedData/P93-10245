    We will consider here only the problem of classifying nouns according to their distribution as direct objects of verbs; the converse problem is formally similar.
    More generally, the theoretical basis for our method supports the use of clustering to build models for any n-ary relation in terms of associations between elements in each coordinate and appropriate hidden units (cluster centroids) and associations between those hidden units.
    For the noun classification problem, the empirical distribution of a noun n is then given by the conditional distribution p(V) = fvn/ Ev fvn&#8226; The problem we study is how to use the pn to classify the n E H. Our classification method will construct a set C of clusters and cluster membership probabilities p(c1n).
    Each cluster c is associated to a cluster centroid pc, which is a distribution over V obtained by averaging appropriately the pn.
    To cluster nouns n according to their conditional verb distributions prz, we need a measure of similarity between
