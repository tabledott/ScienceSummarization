rpretation by using the patterns observed in the input.
    We frame our semantic interpretation process as a constrained optimization process, maximizing the objective function defined by Equation 1 which relies on extracting lexical and syntactic features instead of parsing rules.
    In the remainder of this section we explain the components of our inference model.
    Following previous work, we capture the semantics of the Geoquery domain using a subset of first-order logic consisting of typed constants and functions.
    There are two types: entities E in the domain and numeric values N. Functions describe a functional relationship over types (e.g., population : E &#8594; N).
    A complete logical form is constructed through functional composition; in our formalism this is performed by the substitution operator.
    For example, given the function next to(x) and the expression const(texas), substitution replaces the occurrence of the free variable x, with the expression, resulting in a new logical form
