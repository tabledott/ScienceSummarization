	On Coreference Resolution Performance Metrics
		The paper proposes a Constrained Entity Alignment F-Measure (CEAF) for evaluatingcoreference resolution.
		The metric is com puted by aligning reference and system entities (or coreference chains) with the constraint that a system (reference) entity is aligned with at most one reference (system) entity.
		We show that the best alignment is a maximum bipartite matching problem which can be solved by theKuhn-Munkres algorithm.
		Comparative experiments are conducted to show that the widely known MUC F-measure has serious flaws in evaluating a coreference system.
		The proposed metric is also compared with the ACE-Value, the official evaluation metric in the AutomaticContent Extraction (ACE) task, and we con clude that the proposed metric possesses someproperties such as symmetry and better inter pretability missing in the ACE-Value.
