judgments and against article boundaries.
    It is possible to compare against author-specified markups, but unfortunately, as discussed above, authors usually do not specify the kind of subtopic information desired.
    As mentioned above, Hearst (1995) and Hearst and Plaunt (1993) show how to use TextTiles in information retrieval tasks, although this work does not show whether or not the results of these algorithms produce better performance than the results of some other segmentation strategy would.
    There is a growing concern surrounding issues of intercoder reliability when using human judgments to evaluate discourse-processing algorithms (Carletta 1996; Condon and Cech 1995).
    Proposals have recently been made for protocols for the collection of human discourse segmentation data (Nakatani et al. 1995) and for how to evaluate the validity of judgments so obtained (Carletta 1996; Isard and Carletta 1995; Ros&#233; 1995; Passonneau and Litman 1993; Litman and Passonneau 1995).
