   In the first stage, m different parsers analyze an input sentence, each producing a syntactic structure.
    In the second stage, a parsing algorithm is applied to the original sentence, taking into account the analyses produced by each parser in the first stage.
    Our approach produces results with accuracy above those of the best individual parsers on both dependency and constituent parsing of the standard WSJ test set.
  
  
    In dependency reparsing we focus on unlabeled dependencies, as described by Eisner (1996).
    In this scheme, the syntactic structure for a sentence with n words is a dependency tree representing head-dependent relations between pairs of words.
    When m parsers each output a set of dependencies (forming m dependency structures) for a given sentence containing n words, the dependencies can be combined in a simple wordby-word voting scheme, where each parser votes for the head of each of the n words in the sentence, and the head with most votes is assigned to each word.
