etween the source and target languages.
  Example 3 If we compose the RLCS for go (in Figure 4) with the RLCSs for John ([ThingJOHN]), school ([Location SCHOOL]), and happily ([Manner HAPPILY]), we get the CLCS corre- sponding to John went happily to school (shown in Figure 3).
  Each (content) word in the lexicon is associated with a RLCS, whose variable positions may have certain restrictions.
  The CLCS is a structure that results from com- bining the lexical items of a source-language sentence into a single underlying pivot form by means of LCS composition.
  5 The notion of unification (as used in Definition 3) differs from that of the standard unification frameworks (see, for example, Shieber et al.
  1989, 1990; Kaplan and Bresnan 1982; Kaplan et al.
  1989; Kay 1984; etc.)
  in that it is not directly invertible.
  That is, the generation process operates on the CLCS in a unification-like fashion that roughly mirrors the LCS composition process, but it is not a direct inverse of this process.
