rise is that adverbial functions again increase F,3,1 by nearly 2%, despite the fact that F1 for this ADVFTJNC assignment step was not very high.
    This result shows that cascaded modules need not be perfect to be useful.
    Up to now, we only looked at the overall results.
    Table 4 also shows individual Fp_1 values for four selected common grammatical relations: subject NP, (in)direct object NP, locative PP adjunct and temporal PP adjunct.
    Note that the steps have different effects on the different relations: Adding NPs increases Fp=i by 11.3% for subjects resp.
    16.2% for objects, but only 3.9% resp.
    3.7% for locatives and temporals.
    Adverbial functions are more important for the two adjuncts (+6.3% resp.
    +15%) than for the two complements (+0.2% resp.
    +0.7%).
    Argamon et al. (1998) report F13=1 for subject and object identification of respectively 86.5% and 83.0%, compared to 81.8% and 81.0% in this paper.
    Note however that Argamon et al. (1998) do not identify the head
