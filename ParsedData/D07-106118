ticle can move as if it were recursively looking up words in a dictionary, stepping from Synsets to the Synsets used to define them.
			Because WordNet?s gloss definitions are not sense-tagged,the particle must make an intermediate step to a To kenPOS contained in the gloss definition and then to a Synset representing a particular sense of that TokenPOS.
			The availability of sense-tagged glosseswould eliminate the noise introduced by this inter mediate step.
			The particle can reach both Synsets and TokenPOS nodes in this variant, but some parts of the graph are not reachable from other parts.
			This model incorporates much of the same information as the gloss-based WordNet measures (Banerjee and Pedersen, 2003; Patwardhan and Pedersen, 2006) but differs in that it considers many more glosses than just those in the immediate neighborhoods of the candidate words.
			MarkovJoined This variant is the natural combination of the above two; we construct the graph containing WordNet relation edges, Synset overla
