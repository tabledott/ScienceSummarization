usly noted, we expected lexical dependencies to be extremely important in labeling semantic roles, as indicated by their importance in related tasks such as parsing.
    Since the parser used assigns each constituent a head word as an integral part of the parsing model, we were able to read the head words of the constituents from the parser output.
    For example, in a communication frame, noun phrases headed by &amp;quot;Bill&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;brother&amp;quot;, or &amp;quot;he&amp;quot; are more likely to be the SpEAKER, while those headed by &amp;quot;proposal&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;story&amp;quot;, or &amp;quot;question&amp;quot; are more likely to be the Topic.
    For our experiments, we divided the FrameNet corpus as follows: one-tenth of the annotated sentences for each target word were reserved as a test set, and another one-tenth were set aside as a tuning set for developing our system.
    A few target words with fewer than ten examples were removed from the corpus.
    In our corpus, the average
