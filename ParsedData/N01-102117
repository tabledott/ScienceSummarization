en paths happen at points where the parser can disconfirm alternatives that together comprise a great amount of probability.
    Note the category ambiguity present with raced which can show up as both a past-tense verb (VBD) and a past participle (VBN).
    Figure 3 shows the reading time predictions5 derived via the linking hypothesis that reading time at word n is proportional to the surprisal log (&#945;&#945;&#8722;1).
    At &#8220;fell,&#8221; the parser garden-paths: up until that point, both the main-verb and reduced-relative structures are consistent with the input.
    The prefix probability before &#8220;fell&#8221; is scanned is more than 10 times greater than after, suggesting that the probability mass of the analyses disconfirmed at that point was indeed great.
    In fact, all of the probability assigned to the main-verb structure is now lost, and only parses that involve the low-probability NP rule survive &#8211; a rule introduced 5 words back.
    If this garden path effect is truly a resul
