e modelled predictions, but this time the subspace included all predictions, as well as all the original observations (380 x 4 = 1520 items).
    Finally, we tested if the predictions made by each model shared any top-10 neighbours with their corresponding gold-standard.
    We awarded 1 point for every shared neighbour.
    The results obtained with these evaluation settings were very poor.
    Only the additive model scored points (48), although the performance was rather disappointing (maximum potential score for the test was 3,800 points).
    Both the pointwise multiplicative model and the PLSR model failed to retrieve any of the gold standard neighbours.
    This poor results can be attributed to the very restrictive nature of our gold standard and, also, to the asymmetrical composition of the compared data (gold standard: 3,800 neighbours from a pool of just 380 different items; prediction space: 11,400 neighbours from a pool of 1,520 items).
    However, given the that DSMs are known for their ability
