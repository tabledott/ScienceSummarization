taining the verb under consideration.
  These instances are grouped into one or more major senses, and each major sense is turned into a single frameset.
  To show all the possible syntactic realizations of the frameset, many sentences from the corpus are included in the frames file, in the same format as the examples above.
  In many cases a particular realization will not be attested within the Penn Treebank corpus; in these cases, a constructed sentence is used, usually identified by the presence of the characters of John and Mary.
  Care was taken during the framing process to make synonymous verbs (mostly in the sense of ?
  ?sharing a VerbNet Class??)

  Generally speaking, a given lexeme/sense pair required 10?15 minutes to frame, although highly polysemous verbs could require longer.
  With the 4,500+ framesets currently in place for PropBank, this is clearly a substantial time investment, and the frames fil
