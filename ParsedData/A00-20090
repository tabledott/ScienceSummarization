  A Simple Approach To Building Ensembles Of Naive Bayesian Classifiers For Word Sense Disambiguation
  
    This paper presents a corpus-based approach to word sense disambiguation that builds an ensemble of Naive Bayesian classifiers, each of which is based on lexical features that represent co&#8212;occurring words in varying sized windows of context.
    Despite the simplicity of this approach, empirical results disamthe widely studied nouns show that such an ensemble achieves accuracy rivaling the best previously published results.
  
  
    Word sense disambiguation is often cast as a problem in supervised learning, where a disambiguator is induced from a corpus of manually sense&#8212;tagged text using methods from statistics or machine learning.
    These approaches typically represent the context in which each sense&#8212;tagged instance of a word occurs with a set of linguistically motivated features.
    A learning algorithm induces a representative model from these features which is employed as a
