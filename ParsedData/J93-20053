a document are used as keywords, is one of the most promising of recent automated approaches, yet its mediocre precision and recall characteristics indicate that there is much room for improvement (Croft 1989).
    The use of domain knowledge can enhance the effectiveness of a full-text system by providing related terms that can be used to broaden, narrow, or refocus a query at retrieval time (Debili, Fluhr, and Radasua 1988; Anick et al. 1989.
    Likewise, domain knowledge may be applied at indexing time to do word sense disambiguation (Krovetz and Croft 1989) or content analysis (Jacobs 1991).
    Unfortunately, for many domains, such knowledge, even in the form of a thesaurus, is either not available or is incomplete with respect to the vocabulary of the texts indexed.
    In this paper we examine how linguistic phenomena such as metonymy and polysemy might be exploited for the semantic tagging of lexical items.
    Unlike purely statistical collocational analyses, employing a semantic theory allows for t
