 compared to the phonetic sequence of a set of English words found in a phonetic dictionary and the word with the most similar phonetic sequence is selected as the transliteration.
    The approach described by Kawtrakul et al. (1998) requires a phonetic dictionary of English in order to match phonetic sequences.
    Only those words with known phonetic sequences in the dictionary can be mapped by the transliteration system.
    Also, applying such technique to Arabic will most likely fail because without short vowels, the pronunciation is highly ambiguous, and so is its corresponding phonetic sequence.
    Arbabi et al. (1994) describe an algorithm for the forward-transliteration of Arab names into a number of Romance and Germanic languages including English, French, and Spanish.
    The transliteration process starts by vowelizing the given Arab name by inserting the appropriate short vowels which originally are not written but necessary for the correct pronunciation of the names.
    Then, the vowelized Ar
