that were too limited to aggregate verbs effectively.
    Thus, for our system, we allowed up to two edges to intervene between a common ancestor synset and each of the verbs' respective synsets, as in Figure 2.
    In addition to the problem of the flat nature of the verb hierarchy, our results from WN-Verber are degraded by ambiguity; similar effects have been reported for nouns.
    Verbs with differences in high versus low frequency senses caused certain verbs to be incorrectly related; for example, have and drop are related by the synset meaning &amp;quot;to give birth&amp;quot; although this sense of drop is rare in WSJ.
    The results of WN-Verber in Table 2 reflect the effects of bushiness and ambiguity.
    The five most frequent synsets are given in column 1; column 2 shows some typical verbs which participate in the clustering; column 3 shows the type of article which tends to contain these synsets.
    Most articles (864/1236 = 70%) end up in the top five nodes.
    This illustrates the ineffecti
