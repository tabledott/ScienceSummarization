m of the inside scores of all the translations spanning the entire sentence.
    Figure 4 illustrates the search process for the simple grammar from Table 2.
    Each graph node represents a hypothesis translation substring covering a sub-span of the source string.
    The space of translation sub-strings is exponential in each cell&#8217;s span, and our algorithm can only sum over a small fraction of the possible strings.
    Therefore the resulting probabilities are only estimates.
    However, as demonstrated in Section 4, this algorithm is considerably more effective than maximum derivation (Viterbi) decoding.
  
  
    Our model evaluation was motivated by the following questions: (1) the effect of maximising translations rather than derivations in training and decoding; (2) whether a regularised model performs better than a maximum likelihood model; (3) how the performance of our model compares with a frequency count based hierarchical system; and (4) how translation performance scales with the number o
