			OF COLING-92, NANTES, AUG. 23-28, 1992 * If ~/tT/2 are the 2 children of a node q such that none of them is on the spine, include: b\[$~\] p~l \]~\[$I~1\]t\[$i~2 \] (4) Since (4) also encodes an immediate domination link defined by the tree-adjoining grammar, its associated probability is one.
			If 7?
			is a node labeled by a non-terminal symbol and if it does not have an obligatory adjoining constraint, then we need to consider the case that adjunetion might not take place.
			In this ease, include: t\[..~\] L b\[..~\] (5) The probabil ity of rule (5) corresponds to the proba- bility that no adjunetion takes place at node q. o If t/ is an node on which the auxiliary tree fl can be adjoined, the adjunetiou of fl can be predicted, therefore (assuming that ~tr is the root node of fl) include: t\["0\] L t\[..rl,,\] (6) The probability of rule (6) corresponds to the proba- bility of adjoining the auxiliary tree whose root node is ~/~, say/
