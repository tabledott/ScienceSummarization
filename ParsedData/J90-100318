    The ten verbs found to be most associated before to/in are: Thus, we see there is considerable leverage to be gained by preprocessing the corpus and manipulating the inventory of tokens.
  
  
    Hindle (Church et al. 1989) has found it helpful to preprocess the input with the Fidditch parser (Hindle 1983a, 1983b) to identify associations between verbs and arguments, and postulate semantic classes for nouns on this basis.
    Hindle's method is able to find some very interesting associations, as Tables 5 and 6 demonstrate.
    After running his parser over the 1988 AP corpus (44 million words), Hindle found N = 4,112,943 subject/verb/ object (SVO) triples.
    The mutual information between a verb and its object was computed from these 4 million triples by counting how often the verb and its object were found in the same triple and dividing by chance.
    Thus, for example, disconnect/ V and telephone/ 0 have a joint probability of 7IN.
    In this case, chance is 84/N x 481/N because there are 84 SVO t
