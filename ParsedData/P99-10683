e' Akupunktur) could make the difference between precision of 0.08 and precision of 0.83 on individual queries.
    Resnik (1998) presented an algorithm called STRAND (Structural Translation Recognition for Acquiring Natural Data) designed to explore the Web as a source of parallel text, demonstrating its potential with a small-scale evaluation based on the author's judgments.
    After briefly reviewing the STRAND architecture and preliminary results (Section 2), this paper goes beyond that preliminary work in two significant ways.
    First, the framework is extended to include a filtering stage that uses automatic language identification to eliminate an important class of false positives: documents that appear structurally to be parallel translations but are in fact not in the languages of interest.
    The system is then run on a somewhat larger scale and evaluated formally for English and Spanish using measures of agreement with independent human judges, precision, and recall (Section 3).
    Second, the
