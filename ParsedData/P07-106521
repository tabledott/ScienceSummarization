ave proposed a framework for deriving conventional smoothed n-gram models from the logfrequency BF scheme allowing us to do away entirely with the standard n-gram model in an SMT system.
    We hope the present work will help establish the Bloom filter as a practical alternative to conventional associative data structures used in computational linguistics.
    The framework presented here shows that with some consideration for its workings, the randomised nature of the Bloom filter need not be a significant impediment to is use in applications.
