er which is based on a MLP-network.
  A comparison of the tagging results with those of a trigram tagger and a IIMM tagger showed that the accuracy is as high as that of the trigram tagger and the robustness on small training corpora is as good as that of the HMM tagger.
  Thus, the Net-Tagger combines advantages of both of these methods.
  The Net-Tagger has the additional advantage that problematic decisions between tags are easy to detect, aDue to the large training times needed to train the 3-layer- network, no further tests have been conducted.
  o Less than 60 % of the tagging errors were made in common by both taggers.
  so that in these cases an additional tag can be given in the output.
  In this way, the final decision can be delayed to a later processing stage, e.g.
  A disadvantage of the presented method may be its lower processing speed compared to statistical meth- ods.
  In the light of the high speed of present computer hardware, however, this does not seem to be a serious drawback.
