conclusion will also be confirmed by the experiments modeled with the other DM spaces.
    The vectors of this space are labeled with word pair tuples (w1, w2) (columns of matrix Bmode-2 in Table 3) and their dimensions are labeled with links l (rows of the same matrix).
    This arrangement of our tensor reproduces the &#8220;relational similarity&#8221; space of Turney (2006b), also implicitly assumed in much relation extraction work, where word pairs are compared based on the patterns that link them in the corpus, in order to measure the similarity of their relations (Pantel and Pennacchiotti 2006).
    The links that in W1xLW2 space provide a form of shallow typing of lexical features ((use, gun)) associated with single words (soldier) constitute under the W1W2xL view full features (use) associated with word pairs ((soldier, gun)).
    Besides exploiting this view of the tensor to solve classic relational tasks, we will also show how problems that have not been traditionally defined in terms of a word-pai
