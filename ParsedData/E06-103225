ll quite rough measures of translation similarity, and have inexact models of allowable variation in translation.
    Finally, that the fact that Bleu&#8217;s correlation with human judgments has been drawn into question may warrant a re-examination of past work which failed to show improvements in Bleu.
    For example, work which failed to detect improvements in translation quality with the integration of word sense disambiguation (Carpuat and Wu, 2005), or work which attempted to integrate syntactic information but which failed to improve Bleu (Charniak et al., 2003; Och et al., 2004) may deserve a second look with a more targeted manual evaluation.
