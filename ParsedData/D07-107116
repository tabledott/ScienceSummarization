			B)These rules are variantions of the standard func tional composition rules, where the slashes of the principal categories are reversed.
			6Rules of this type are non-standard in the sense that theyviolate Steedman?s Principle of Consistency (2000); this princi ple states that rules must be consistent with the slash direction of the principal category.
			Steedman (2000) only considers rulesthat do not violate this principle?for example, crossed compo sition rules, which we consider later, and which Steedman also considers, do not violate this principle.
			681An important point is that that these new composition and application rules can deal with quite flex ible word orders.
			For example, take the fragment to washington the latest flight.
			In this case the parse is to washington the latest flight N\N NP/N N ?f.?x.f(x)?
			?f. argmax(f, ?x.flight(x) to(x,washington) ?y.depart time(y)) .B NP\N ?f. argmax(?x.f(x)?
