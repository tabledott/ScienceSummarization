    2 Trailing constituents (SBARs and PPs) are computed by counting the number of SBARs (or PPs) not designated as an argument of (contained in) a verb phrase.
    For a comparison, we conducted a second analysis in which we used the same parser on just the first sentence of each of the 73 stories.
    In this second analysis, the parsing results included 817 noun phrases (NP) and 316 clauses (S).
    A summary of these results is shown in Figure 4.
    Note that, across the board, the percentages are higher in this analysis than in the results shown in Figure 3 (ranging from 12% higher&#8212;in the case of trailing PPs&#8212;to 1500% higher in the case of time expressions), indicating that our choices of deletion in the Hedge Trimmer a
