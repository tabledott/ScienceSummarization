relation between the event and the focus is asserted, using heuristics defining coherent tense sequences; see (Song and Cohen 1991) for more details.
    Note that the tagged TIME expressions aren't used in determining these inter-event temporal relations, so this eventordering component could be used to order events which don't have time VALs.
    In addition, we have also investigated the alignment of events on a calendric line, using the tagged TIME expressions.
    The processing, applied to documents tagged by the time tagger, is in two stages.
    In the first stage, for each sentence, each &#8220;taggable verb occurrence&#8221; lacking a time expression is given the VAL of the immediately previous time expression in the sentence.
    Taggable verb occurrences are all verb occurrences except auxiliaries, modals and verbs following &#8220;to&#8221;, &#8220;not&#8221;, or specific modal verbs.
    In turn, when a time expression is found, the immediately previous verb lacking a time expression is given th
