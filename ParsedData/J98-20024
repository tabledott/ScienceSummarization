al. 1994; Tanaka 1996; Utsuro and Matsumoto 1997), while others do not rely on any prior knowledge (Pereira, Tishby, and Lee 1993; Grishman and Sterling 1994; Tanaka 1994).
    In this paper, we propose a new generalization method, belonging to the first of these two categories, which is both theoretically well-motivated and computationally efficient.
    Specifically, we formalize the problem of generalizing values of a case frame slot for a given verb as that of estimating a conditional probability distribution over a partition of words, and propose a new generalization method based on the Minimum Description Length principle (MDL): a principle of data compression and statistical estimation from information theory.'
    In order to assist with efficiency, our method makes use of an existing thesaurus and restricts its attention on those partitions that are present as &amp;quot;cuts&amp;quot; in the thesaurus tree, thus reducing the generalization problem to that of estimating a &amp;quot;tree cut model&amp;
