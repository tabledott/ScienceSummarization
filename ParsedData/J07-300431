o acquire a complete lexicon if we have seen all participles (and their possible modifiers) in all their possible surface positions.
    Similar regularities have been recognized and given a categorial analysis by Carpenter (1992), who advocates lexical rules to account for the use of predicatives as adjuncts.
    In a statistical model, the parameters for such lexical rules are difficult to estimate.
    We therefore follow the approach of Aone and Wittenburg (1990) and implement these type-changing Type-changing rules reduce the number of lexical category types required for complex adjuncts. operations in the derivational syntax, where these generalizations are captured in a few rules.
    If these rules apply recursively to their own output, they can generate an infinite set of category types, leading to a shift in generative power from context-free to recursively enumerable (Carpenter 1991, 1992).
    Like Aone and Wittenburg, we therefore consider only a finite number of instantiations of these type-chan
