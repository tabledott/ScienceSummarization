sult confirms that the linguistic contexts in which the literal and the idiomatic use of ins Wasser fallen appear are very different, indicating&#8212;not surprisingly&#8212;that the semantic difference between the literal meaning and the idiomatic meaning is reflected in the way these these phrases are used.
    Our next task was to investigate whether this difference could be used in particular cases to determine what the intended use of an MWE in a particular context was.
    To evaluate this, we did a 10-fold cross-validation study, calculating the literal and idiomatic vectors for ins Wasser fallen on the basis of the training data and doing a simple nearest neighbor classification of each memember of the test set on the basis of the meaning vectors computed from its local context (the 30 word window).
    Our result of an average accurace of 72% for our LSA-based classifier far exceeds the simple maximum-likelihood baseline of 58%.
    In the final part of this experiment we compared the meaning vector
