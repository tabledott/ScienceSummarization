 the source and the target language are purely local.
    In other cases there is a non-local dependency between the subcategorizing verb and a dislocated phrase.
    This is illustrated by the relative clause in (11): ...the letter, that the student seemed to answer.
    The within-clause functions of the relativized phrases in the source and target language are determined by predicates which may be arbitrarily deeply embedded, but the relativized phrase in the target language must correspond to the one in the source language.
    Let us assume that relative clauses can be analyzed by the following slightly simplified phrase structure rules, making use of functional uncertainty (see Kaplan and Maxwell 1988b for a technical discussion of functional uncertainty) to capture the non-local dependency of the relativized phrase (equations on the head NP are ignored): The second structure is the f-structure the grammar of French assigns to the sentence in (6b).
    This f-structure is the input for the generation pr
