st ten examples from each predicate, while 17% of the Propbank data had fewer than ten training examples.
    Removing these examples from the test set gives 84.1% accuracy with gold-standard parses and 80.5% accuracy with automatic parses.
    As our path feature is a somewhat unusual way of looking at parse trees, its behavior in the system warrants a closer look.
    The path feature is most useful as a way of finding arguments in the unknown boundary condition.
    Removing the path feature from the known-boundary system results in only a small degradation in performance, from 82.3% to 81.7%.
    One reason for the relatively small impact may be sparseness of the feature &#65533; 7% of paths in the test set are unseen in training data.
    The most common values of the feature are shown in Table 3, where the first two rows correspond to standard subject and object positions.
    One reason for sparsity is seen in the third row: in the Treebank, the adjunction of an adverbial phrase or modal verb can cause
