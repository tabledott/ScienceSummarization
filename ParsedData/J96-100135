ant, a fact that should indicate a constant degree of relatedness between the two variables.
    Neither of these problems occurs with the Dice coefficient, exactly because that measure combines the conditional probabilities of &amp;quot;1&amp;quot;s in both directions without looking at the marginal distributions of the two variables.
    In fact, in cases such as the examples of Table 1, where p(X = 1 I Y = 1) = p(Y = 1 I X = 1), the Dice coefficient becomes equal to these conditional probabilities.
    The dependence of SI(X, Y) on the marginal probabilities of &amp;quot;1&amp;quot;s shows that using it would make rare word groups look more similar than they really are.
    For our example in Table 1, the specific mutual information is SI(X, Y) = log 0.05o.o20.05 = log 8 = 3 bits for the original variables, but SI(X', Y') = log 0.95%920,95 = log 1.019391 = 0.027707 bits for the transformed variables.
    Note, however, that the change is in the opposite direction from the appropriate one; that is, the new
