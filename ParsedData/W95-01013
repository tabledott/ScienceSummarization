ce compared to stochastic taggers, and captures the learned knowledge in a set of simple deterministic rules instead of a large table of statistics.
    In addition, the learned rules can be converted into a deterministic finite state transducer.
    Tagging with this finite state transducer requires n steps to tag a sequence of length n, independent of the number of rules, and results in a part of speech tagger ten times faster than the fastest stochastic tagger [Roche and Schabes, 1995].
    One weakness of this rulebased tagger is that no unsupervised training algorithm has been presented for learning rules automatically without a manually annotated corpus.
    In this paper we present such an algorithm.
    We describe an algorithm for both unsupervised and weakly supervised training of a rule-based part of speech tagger, and compare the performance of this algorithm to that of the Baum-Welch algorithm.
  
  
    The rule-based tagger is based on a learning algorithm called transformation-based errordrive
