texts as EDITORIAL.
    Such confusion suggests that these genre types are closely related to each other, as in fact they are.
    Editorials might best be treated in future experiments as a subtype of NONFICTION, perhaps distinguished by separate facets such as OPINION and INSTITUTIONAL AUTHORSHIP.
    Although Table 1 shows that our methods predict BROW at above-baseline levels, further analysis (Table 2) indicates that most of this performance comes from accuracy in deciding whether or not a text is HIGH BROW.
    The other levels are identified at near baseline performance.
    This suggests problems with the labeling of the BROW feature in the training data.
    In particular, we had labeled journalistic texts on the basis of the overall brow of the host publication, a simplification that ignores variation among authors and the practice of printing features from other publications.
    We plan to improve those labelings in future experiments by classifying brow on an article-by-article basis.
