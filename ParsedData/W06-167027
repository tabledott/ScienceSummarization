ty is only one of the problems in WSD.
    More needs to be understood concerning sources of information, and processes, that affect word sense selection in context.
    As far as the tagger is concerned, we applied the simplest feature representation, more sophisticated features can be used, e.g., based on kernels, which might contribute significantly by allowing complex feature combinations.
    These results also suggest new directions of research within this model.
    In particular, the labels occurring in each sequence tend to coincide with predicates (verbs) and arguments (nouns and named entities).
    A sequential dependency model might not be the most accurate at capturing the grammatical dependencies between these elements.
    Other conditional models, e.g., designed on head to head, or similar, dependencies could prove more appropriate.
    Another interesting issue is the granularity of the tagset.
    Supersenses seem more practical then synsets for investigating the impact of broadcoverage sem
