    (Zhang et al., 2002).
    The task is transformed into a sequence classification problem.
    We investigate a wide array of lexical, syntactic and semantic features to perform the mention detection and classification task including, for all three languages, features based on pre-existing statistical semantic taggers, even though these taggers have been trained on different corpora and use different semantic categories.
    Moreover, the presented approach implicitly learns the correlation between these different semantic types and the desired output types.
    We propose a novel MaxEnt-based model for predicting whether a mention should or should not be linked to an existing entity, and show how this model can be used to build entity chains.
    The effectiveness of the approach is tested by applying it on data
