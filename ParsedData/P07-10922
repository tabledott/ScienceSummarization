the United Nations (UN) being a prime example.
    They present a challenge for current SMT systems due to their relatively moderate size and domain variability (examples of UN texts include policy documents, proceedings of meetings, letters, etc.).
    Our method translates each target phrase, t, first to an intermediate language, i, and then into the source language, s. We call this two-stage translation process triangulation (Kay, 1997).
    We present a probabilistic formulation through which we can estimate the desired phrase translation distribution (phrase-table) by marginalisation, p(s|t) _ Ei p(s, i|t).
    As with conventional smoothing methods (Koehn et al., 2003; Foster et al., 2006), triangulation increases the robustness of phrase translation estimates.
    In contrast to smoothing, our method alleviates data sparseness by exploring additional multiparallel data rather than adjusting the probabilities of existing data.
    Importantly, triangulation provides us with separately estimated phrase-t
