elevant analogy seems the crucial one in metaphor recognition.
    Figure 10 shows the match of the nonrelevant cells from animall and carl.
    The cell use2, gasolinel I has been removed.
    There are three inclusive cell matches as animals and cars share physical objectlike properties of boundedness, three dimensions, Semantic vector for a metaphorical semantic relation and solidity.
    Two cell matches are exclusive.
    Animals are composed of flesh, whereas cars are composed of steel.
    Animals are living, whereas cars are nonliving.
    There are two distinctive cells of animall and five distinctive cells of carl .
    Tourangeau and Sternberg's (1982) hypothesis predicts that the greater the distance between the conceptual domains of the terms involved in a metaphor, the more apt the metaphor.
    The proportion of similarities (inclusive cell matches) to differences (exclusive cell matches) is 3 to 2, which is a middling distance suggesting, tentatively, an unimposing metaphor.
    All of these m
