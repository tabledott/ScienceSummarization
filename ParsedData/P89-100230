 the problem of coherence discussed in the previous section.
    The rules outlined here are less efficient than necessary because the distribution of store elements among the subject and complements of a verb does not check whether the variable bound by a store element actually appears in the semantics of the phrase to which it is being assigned, leading to many dead ends in the generation process.
    Also, the rules are sound for generation but not for analysis, because they do not enforce the constraint that every occurrence of a variable in logical form be outscoped by the variable's binder.
    Adding appropriate side conditions to the rules, following the constraints discussed by Hobbs and Shieber (Hobbs and Shieber, 1987) would not be difficult.
    As it stands, the generation algorithm chooses particular lexical forms on-line.
    This approach can lead to a certain amount of unnecessary nondeterminism.
    For instance, the choice of verb form might depend on syntactic features of the verb's subjec
