cific semantic relations: isa, part-of, succession, reaction, and production.
    Espresso achieves higher and more balanced performance than other state of the art systems.
    By exploiting generic patterns, system recall substantially increases with little effect on precision.
    There are many avenues of future work both in improving system performance and making use of the relations in applications like question answering.
    For the former, we plan to investigate the use of WordNet to automatically learn selectional constraints on generic patterns, as proposed by (Girju et al. 2006).
    We expect here that negative instances will play a key role in determining the selectional restrictions.
    Espresso is the first system, to our knowledge, to emphasize concurrently performance, minimal supervision, breadth, and generality.
    It remains to be seen whether one could enrich existing ontologies with relations harvested by Espresso, and it is our hope that these relations will benefit NLP applications.
