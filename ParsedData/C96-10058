17 First, the algorithm represents in a lattice the nouns present in the window, their senses and hypernyms (step 1).
  Then, the program computes the Conceptual Density of each concept in WordNet according to the senses it contains in its subhierarchy (step 2).
  It selects the concept c with highest Conceptual Density (step 3) and selects the senses below it as the correct senses for the respective words (step 4).
  The algorithm proceeds then to compute the density for the remaining senses in the lattice, and continues to disambiguate he nouns left in W (back to steps 2, 3 and 4).
  When no further disambiguation is possible, the senses left for w are processed and the result is presented (step 5).
  Besides completely disambiguating a word or failing to do so, in some cases the disambiguation algorithm returns everal possible senses for a word.
  In the experiments we considered these partial outcomes as failure to disambiguate.
