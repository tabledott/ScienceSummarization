Walter  Thompson" ORG_TYPE : COMPANY &lt;PERSON-9402240133-5&gt; := PER NAME: "Peter Kim" Although we cannot explain al] tile details of the template here, a few highlights shouht be noted.
  For each executive post; one generates a SUCCESSION_EVENT template, which contains refl~rences to the ORGANIZATION template for the organization i volved, and the IN_AND OUT template for the activity involving that post (if an article describes a person leaving and a per- son start;ing the same job, there will be two IN_AND_OUT templates).
  The IN_AND_OUT template contains references to the tmnt)lates fl)r the PERSON and tbr the ORGANIZATI()N from which the person came (if he/she is starting a new job).
  The PERSON and ORGANIZATION templates are the "temt)late lement" templates, which are invariant across scenarios.
