 to show which strategy is to be used in applying it.
    We also assume that rules are annotated to show whether they are to be taken as obligatory or optional.
    We have considered only obligatory rules up to now, but optional rules are also commonly used to account for cases of free variation.
    The mathematical treatment of optional rules will turn out to be a simpler case of what must be done for obligatory rules and, therefore, a natural step in the general development.
    As well as providing for various strategies for reapplying a single rule, we also consider the possibility of what we call a batch rule.
    This is a set of rules that the application strategies treat as one entity, the individual rules being otherwise unordered relative to one another.
    This mode of rule application will turn out to be interesting even if it is not an explicit part of any particular phonological formalism because, as we shall see, it constitutes an essential step in the interpretation of rules that use featu
