uilding conceptual case frames begins with extraction patterns and a semantic lexicon for the domain.
    The semantic lexicon is a dictionary of words that belong to relevant semantic categories.
    We used AutoSlog-TS to generate the extraction patterns and a corpus-based algorithm to generate the semantic lexicon.2 The corpus-based algorithm that we used to build the semantic lexicon (Riloff and Shepherd, 1997) requires five &amp;quot;seed words&amp;quot; as input for each semantic category, and produces a ranked list of words that are statistically associated with each category.
    First, the algorithm looks for all sentences in which a seed word is used as the head noun of a noun phrase.
    For each such occurrence of a seed word, the algorithm collects a small context window around the seed word.
    The context window consists of the closest noun to the left of the seed word, and the closest noun to its right.
    The context windows for all seed words that belong to the same category are then combi
