 MUSE system (Maynard et al., 2001) is a multi-purpose Named Entity recognition system which is capable of processing texts from widely different domains and genres, thereby aiming to reduce the need for costly and time-consuming adaptation of existing resources to new applications and domains.
    The system aims to identify the parameters relevant to the creation of a name recognition system across different types of variability such as changes in domain, genre and media.
    For example, less formal texts may not follow standard capitalisation, punctuation and spelling formats, which can be a problem for many generic NE systems.
    Current evaluations with this system average around 93% precision and 95% recall across a variety of text types.

    This requires systems to perform recognition and tracking tasks of named, nominal and pronominal entities and their mentions acro
