the task setup, preparation, and discusses the results.
  
  
    The GE task follows the task definition of BioNLPST 2009, which is briefly described in this section.
    For more detail, please refer to (Kim et al., 2009).
    Table 1 shows the event types to be addressed in the task.
    For each event type, the primary and secondary arguments to be extracted with an event are defined.
    For example, a Phosphorylation event is primarily extracted with the protein to be phosphorylated.
    As secondary information, the specific site to be phosphorylated may be extracted.
    From a computational point of view, the event types represent different levels of complexity.
    When only primary arguments are considered, the first five event types in Table 1 are classified as simple event types, requiring only unary arguments.
    The Binding and Regulation types are more complex: Binding requires detection of an arbitrary number of arguments, and Regulation requires detection of recursive event structure.
