p;quot; so with knowledge of semantics, an algorithm could avoid conflating these two words.
    To maintain the &amp;quot;knowledge-free&amp;quot; paradigm, such semantics would need to be automatically induced.
    Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) (Deerwester, et al., 1990); Landauer, et at., 1998) is a technique which automatically identifies semantic information from a corpus.
    We here show that incorporating LSA-based semantics alone into the morphology-induction process can provide results that rival a state-ofthe-art system based on stem-and-affix statistics (Goldsmith's Linguistica). lError examples are from Goldsmith's Linguistica Our algorithm automatically extracts potential affixes from an untagged corpus, identifies word pairs sharing the same proposed stem but having different affixes, and uses LSA to judge semantic relatedness between word pairs.
    This process serves to identify valid morphological relations.
    Though our algorithm could be applied to any inflectional language, we here re
