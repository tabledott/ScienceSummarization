es over context values comprising a pair of direction (left or right) and valence (first, second, or third or higher) values, and s corresponds to child symbols.
    We restrict q(&#952;s0z0c) and q(&#966;s0z0) to be Dirichlet distributions and q(z) to be multinomial.
    As with prior work (Liang et al., 2009b), we assume a degenerate q(&#946;) - &#948;0&#8727;(&#946;) for tractability reasons, i.e., all mass is concentrated on some single &#946;&#8727;.
    We also assume that the top level stick-breaking distribution is truncated at T, i.e., q(&#946;) assigns zero probability to integers greater than T. Because of the truncation of &#946;, we can approximate q(&#960;ss0z0c) with an asymmetric finite dimensional Dirichlet.
    The factors are updated one at a time holding all other factors fixed.
    The variational update for q(&#960;) is given by: where term Eq(z)[Css0z0c(z)] is the expected count w.r.t. q(z) of child symbol s and subsymbol z in context c when generated by parent symbol s0 and subsymbol z
