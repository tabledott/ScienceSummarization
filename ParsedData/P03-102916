ed similarly.
    However, the precision of Chain patterns dropped suddenly by 20% at recall level 38%, while the SUBT patterns keep the precision significantly higher than Chain patterns until it reaches 58% recall.
    Even after SUBT hit the drop at 56%, SUBT is consistently a few percent higher in precision than Chain patterns for most recall levels.
    Figure 3(a) also shows that although PA keeps high precision at low recall level it has a significantly lower ceiling of recall (52%) compared to other models.
    Figure 3(b) shows the extraction performance on the Arrest scenario task.
    Again, the PredicateArgument model has a much lower recall ceiling (25%).
    The difference in the performance between the Subtree model and the Chain model does not seem as obvious as in the Succession task.
    However, it is still observable that the Subtree model gains a few percent precision over the Chain model at recall levels around 40%.
    A possible explanation of the subtleness in performance difference i
