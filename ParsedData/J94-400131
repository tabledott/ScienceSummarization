s a bunsetsu to the left of it.
    In the next level analysis (the term we give to the analysis of its parent CS or of the whole sentence if no parent CS exists), the CS node is handled as a symbol.
    This means that bunsetsus outside a CS can no longer depend on bunsetsus in it, except the KB and the EB.
    Even in the case of a CS that consists of more than two conjuncts, the same analysis takes place, except that the dependency tree of the CS is composed of more than two sub-trees into which each conjunct is parsed.
    Parsing a series of bunsetsus in a certain range (conjuncts of CSs, or a whole sentence after merging all the CSs into CS nodes) is performed in the following way.
    The head bunsetsu is determined from right to left for each bunsetsu in the range of bunsetsus to the right of it with a no-cross condition.'
    The type of bunsetsu as a head is classified into two types, NB and PB.6 Whether a bunsetsu depends on NB or PB is determined by the conjugation of its IW or by the type of its
