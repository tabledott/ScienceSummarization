 examples such as: Sentence: hangi eyaletin texas ye siniri vardir Meaning: answer(state(borders(tex))) where the sentence is in Turkish and the meaning representation is a variable-free logical expression of the type that has been used in recent work (Kate et al., 2005; Kate &amp; Mooney, 2006; Wong &amp; Mooney, 2006; Lu et al., 2008).
    The reason for generalizing to multiple languages is obvious.
    The need to learn over multiple representations arises from the fact that there is no standard representation for logical form for natural language.
    Instead, existing representations are ad hoc, tailored to the application of interest.
    For example, the variable-free representation above was designed for building natural language interfaces to databases.
    Our approach works by inducing a combinatory categorial grammar (CCG) (Steedman, 1996, 2000).
    A CCG grammar consists of a language-specific lexicon, whose entries pair individual words and phrases with both syntactic and semantic information,
