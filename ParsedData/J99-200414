gram models based on the distribution of supertags in an LTAG parsed corpus.
    Moreover, since the supertags encode dependency information, we can also use information about the distribution of distances between a given supertag and its dependent supertags.
    Note that as in standard part-of-speech disambiguation, supertag disambiguation could have been done by a parser.
    However, carrying out part-of-speech disambiguation prior to parsing makes the job of the parser much easier and therefore speeds it up.
    Supertag disambiguation reduces the work of the parser even further.
    After supertag disambiguation, we would have effectively completed the parse and the parser need &amp;quot;only&amp;quot; combine the individual structures; hence the term &amp;quot;almost parsing.&amp;quot; This method can also be used to associate a structure to sentence fragments and in cases where the supertag sequence after disambiguation may not combine into a single structure.
    LTAGs, by virtue of possessing the Ex
