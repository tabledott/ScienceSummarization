are given a set of arguments in t and must label each one with its appropriate semantic role.
    Formally, let L denote a mapping of the nodes in t to a label set of semantic roles (including NONE) and let Id(L) be the mapping which collapses L&#8217;s non-NONE values into ARG.
    Then we can decompose the probability of a labeling L into probabilities according to an identification model PID and a classification model PCLS.
    This decomposition does not encode any independence assumptions, but is a useful way of thinking about the problem.
    Our local models for semantic role labeling use this decomposition.
    Previous work has also made this distinction because, for example, different features have been found to be more effective for the two tasks, and it has been a good way to make training and search during testing more efficient.
    Here we use the same features for local identification and classification models, but use the decomposition for efficiency of training.
