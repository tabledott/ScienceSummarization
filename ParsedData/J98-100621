  When the amount of evidence is small, the value of the measure must be larger in order to insure that e is indeed exceeded.
    Table 2 shows precision and recall values for serve, hard, and line at eight different settings of 0 using a 60% confidence interval.
    TLC was first trained on 100 examples of each sense, and it was then tested on separate 100-example sets.
    In all cases, precision was positively correlated with the square root of 0 (all r values &gt; .97), and recall was negatively correlated with the square root of 0 (r values &lt; &#8212;.96).
    As cross-validation, the equations of the lines that fit the precision and recall results on the test sample were used to predict the precision and recall at the various values of 0 on a second test sample.
    They provided a good fit to the new data, accounting for an average of 93% of the variance.
    The standard errors of estimate for hard, serve, and line were .028, .030, and .029 for precision, and .053, .068, and .041 for recall.
