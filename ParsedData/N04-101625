ability of the head given the same preposition, and assumes that these two probabilities are independent.
    Here, t1 and t2 represent concepts in Roget&#8217;s thesaurus.
    Lauer (1995) also experimented with a lexicalized version of (7) where probabilities are calculated on the basis of word (rather than concept) frequencies which Lauer obtained from Grolier&#8217;s encyclopedia heuristically via pattern matching.
    Lauer (1995) tested the model in (7) on 282 compounds that he selected randomly from Grolier&#8217;s encyclopedia and annotated with their paraphrasing prepositions.
    The preposition of accounted for 33% of the paraphrases in this data set (see Baseline in Table 11).
    The conceptbased model (see (7)) achieved an accuracy of 28% on this test set, whereas its lexicalized version reached an accuracy of 40% (see Table 11).
    We attempted the interpretation task with the lexicalized version of the bigram model (see (7)), but also tried the more data intensive trigram model (see (6)), aga
