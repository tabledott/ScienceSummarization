s follows: = Yi t sign(g 0\ 2&#8212; kx2,m &lt; i &lt; n Thus the first m labels are simply copied from the labeled examples, while the remaining (n &#8212; m) examples are taken as the current output of the second classifier.
    We can now add a new weak hypothesis 14 based on a feature in X1 with a confidence value al hl and atl are chosen to minimize the function We now define, for 1 &lt;i &lt;n, the following virtual distribution, As before, Ztl is a normalization constant.
    Equ.
    (8) can now be rewritten5 as which is of the same form as the function Zt used in AdaBoost.
    Using the virtual distribution Di (i) and pseudo-labels&amp;quot;y.,&#8222; values for Wo, W&#177; and W_ can be calculated for each possible weak hypothesis (i.e., for each feature x E Xi); the weak hypothesis with minimal value for Wo + 2/WW _ can be chosen as before; and the weight for this weak hypothesis at = ln ww+411:) can be calculated.
    This procedure is repeated for T rounds while alternating between the two classi
