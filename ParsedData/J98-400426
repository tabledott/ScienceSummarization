 given a short name, which is used to identify it in the rest of the paper.
    Designing the tree transformations is complicated by the fact that there are in general many different tree transformations that correctly transform the simple cases discussed in Section 4, but behave differently on more complex constructions that appear in the WSJ corpus.
    The actual transformations investigated here have the advantage of simplicity, but many other different transformations would correctly transform the trees discussed in Sections 3 and 4 and be just as linguistically plausible as the transforms below, yet would presumably induce PCFGs with very different properties.
    Id is an identity transformation, i.e., it does not modify the trees at all.
    This condition studies the behavior of the Penn II tree representation used in the WSJ corpus.
    NP-VP produces trees that represent PP modification of both NPs and VPs using Chomsky adjunction.
    The NP-VP transform is the result of exhaustively applying all
