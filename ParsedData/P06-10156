nly to is-a extraction.
    These methods use clustering algorithms to group words according to their meanings in text, label the clusters using its members&#8217; lexical or syntactic dependencies, and then extract an is-a relation between each cluster member and the cluster label.
    Caraballo (1999) proposed the first attempt, which used conjunction and apposition features to build noun clusters.
    Recently, Pantel and Ravichandran (2004) extended this approach by making use of all syntactic dependency features for each noun.
    The advantage of clustering approaches is that they permit algorithms to identify is-a relations that do not explicitly appear in text, however they generally fail to produce coherent clusters from fewer than 100 million words; hence they are unreliable for small corpora.
  
  
    Espresso is based on the framework adopted in (Hearst 1992).
    It is a minimally supervised bootstrapping algorithm that takes as input a few seed instances of a particular relation and iteratively
