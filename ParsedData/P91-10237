    Moreover, it is possible to extract a large subcorpus which has a much smaller error rate.
    By selecting the best scoring 80% of the alignments, the error rate is reduced from 4% to 0.7%.
    There were roughly the same number of errors in each of the English-French and EnglishGerman alignments, suggesting that the method may be fairly language independent.
    We believe that the error rate is considerably lower in the Canadian Hansards because the translations are more literal.
  
  
    Now, let us consider how sentences can be aligned within a paragraph.
    The program makes use of the fact that longer sentences in one language tend to be translated into longer sentences in the other language, and that shorter sentences tend to be translated into shorter sentences.2 A probabilistic score is assigned to each proposed pair of sentences, based on the ratio of lengths of the two sentences (in characters) and the variance of this 2.
    We will have little to say about how sentence boundaries are ident
