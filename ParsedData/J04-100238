 is not a hypernym of animal, so Met* searches for a metaphorical interpretation, coming up with (thing, use, energy source).
    Martin (1990) describes the Metaphor Interpretation, Denotation, and Acquisition System (MIDAS), a computational model of metaphor interpretation.
    MIDAS has been integrated with the Unix Consultant (UC), a program that answers English questions about using Unix.
    UC tries to find a literal answer to each question with which it is presented.
    If violations of literal selectional preference make this impossible, UC calls on MIDAS to search its hierarchical library of conventional metaphors for one that explains the anomaly.
    If no such metaphor is found, MIDAS tries to generalize a known conventional metaphor by abstracting its components to the most-specific senses that encompass the question&#8217;s anomalous language.
    MIDAS then records the most concrete metaphor descended from the new, general metaphor that provides an explanation for the query&#8217;s language.
