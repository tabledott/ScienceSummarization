    In Section 2, we briefly review the Hiero statistical MT framework (Chiang, 2005, 2007), upon which this work builds, and we discuss Chiang&#8217;s initial effort to incorporate soft source-language constituency constraints for Chinese-English translation.
    In Section 3, we suggest that an insufficiently fine-grained view of constituency constraints was responsible for Chiang&#8217;s lack of strong results, and introduce finer grained constraints into the model.
    Section 4 demonstrates the the value of these constraints via substantial improvements in ChineseEnglish translation performance, and extends the approach to Arabic-English.
    Section 5 discusses the results, and Section 6 considers related work.
    Finally we conclude in Section 7 with a summary and potential directions for future work.
  
  
    Hiero (Chiang, 2005; Chiang, 2007) is a hierarchical phrase-based statistical MT framework that generalizes phrase-based models by permitting phrases with gaps.
