ether via rhetorical relations creating a hierarchical structure.
    Relations may be mononuclear or multinuclear.
    Mononuclear relations hold between two spans and reflect the situation in which one span, the nucleus, is more salient to the discourse structure, while the other span, the satellite, represents supporting information.
    Multinuclear relations hold among two or more spans of equal weight in the discourse structure.
    A total of 53 mononuclear and 25 multinuclear relations were used for the tagging of the RST Corpus.
    The final inventory of rhetorical relations is data driven, and is based on extensive analysis of the corpus.
    Although this inventory is highly detailed, annotators strongly preferred keeping a higher level of granularity in the selections available to them during the tagging process.
    More extensive analysis of the final tagged corpus will demonstrate the extent to which individual relations that are similar in semantic content were distinguished consistently duri
