y for example first focusing strictly on inferring clusters of coordinate terms, and then by inferring hypernyms over those clusters.
    Another major shortfall in previous techniques for taxonomy induction has been the inability to handle lexical ambiguity.
    Previous approaches have typically sidestepped the issue of polysemy altogether by making the assumption of only a single sense per word, and inferring taxonomies explicitly over words and not senses.
    Enforcing a false monosemy has the downside of making potentially erroneous inferences; for example, collapsing the polysemous term Bush into a single sense might lead one to infer by transitivity that a rose bush is a kind of U.S. president.
    Our approach simultaneously provides a solution to the problems of jointly considering evidence about multiple relationships as well as lexical ambiguity within a single probabilistic framework.
    The key contribution of this work is to offer a solution to two crucial problems in taxonomy inProceedings of
