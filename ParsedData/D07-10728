			The next stop on the way to the HDP-PCFG is the HDP hidden Markov model (HDP-HMM) (Beal et al., 2002; Teh et al, 2006).
			An HMM consists of a set of hidden states, where each state can be thought of as a mixture component.
			The parameters of the mixture component are the emission and transition parameters.
			The main aspect that distinguishes itfrom a flat finite mixture model is that the transition parameters themselves must specify a distribu tion over next states.
			Hence, we have not just onetop-level mixture model over states, but also a col lection of mixture models, one for each state.
			In developing a nonparametric version of the HMM in which the number of states is infinite, we need to ensure that the transition mixture models of each state share a c
