re of the techniques applied.
    Some authors, e.g.
    Alvarez and Lim (2007), use a non-linear function to map the system outputs into new values distributed more similarly to the values in the gold-standard.
    In their case, the mapping function was exp (&#8722;'4 ), which was chosen empirically.
    Finding such a function is dependent on the dataset used, and involves an extra step in the similarity calculations.
    Alternatively, the Spearman correlation provides an evaluation metric that is independent of such data-dependent transformations.
    Most similarity researchers have published their complete results on a smaller subset of the RG dataset containing 30 word pairs (Miller and Charles, 1991), usually referred to as MC, making it possible to compare different systems using different correlation.
    Table 7 shows the results of related work on MC that was available to us, including our own.
    For the authors that did not provide the detailed data we include only the Pearson correlation with
