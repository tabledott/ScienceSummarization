rs had to be developed.
    The training and evaluation data consisted of biological scientific texts, in which instances of speculative spans &#8211; that is, keywords and their linguistic scope &#8211; were annotated manually.
    Submissions to Task2 were expected to automatically annotate the cue phrases and the left and right boundaries of their scopes (exactly one scope must be assigned to a cue phrase).
    The evaluation for Task1 was carried out at the sentence level, i.e. the cue annotations in the sentence were not taken into account.
    The F&#946;=1 measure (the harmonic mean of precision and recall) of the uncertain class was employed as the chief evaluation metric.
    The Task2 systems were expected to mark cueand corresponding scope begin/end tags linked together by using some unique IDs.
    A scope-level F&#946;=1 measure was used as the chief evaluation metric where true positives were scopes which exactly matched the gold standard cue phrases and gold standard scope boundaries assigned t
