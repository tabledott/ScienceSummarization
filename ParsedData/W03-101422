t Mugabe formally declared that he had overwhelmingly won Zimbabwe&#8217;s presidential election.&#8221; Annotators are also asked to judge the strength of each private state.
    A private state may have low, medium, high or extreme strength.
    To allow us to measure interannotator agreement, three annotators (who are not authors of this paper) independently annotated the same 13 documents with a total of 210 sentences.
    We begin with a strict measure of agreement at the sentence level by first considering whether the annotator marked any private-state expression, of any strength, anywhere in the sentence.
    If so, the sentence is subjective.
    Otherwise, it is objective.
    The average pairwise percentage agreement is 90% and the average pairwise rc value is 0.77.
    One would expect that there are clear cases of objective sentences, clear cases of subjective sentences, and borderline sentences in between.
    The agreement study supports this.
    In terms of our annotations, we define a sentenc
