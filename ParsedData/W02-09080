  Improvements In Automatic Thesaurus Extraction
  
    The use of semantic resources is comin modern but methods to extract lexical semantics have only recently begun to perform well enough for practical use.
    We evaluate existing and new similarity metrics for thesaurus extraction, and experiment with the tradeoff between extraction performance and efficiency.
    We propose an approximation based on attributes and coarseand fine-grained matching, that reduces the time complexity and execution time of thesaurus extraction with only a marginal performance penalty.
  
  
    Thesauri have traditionally been used in information retrieval tasks to expand words in queries with synonymous terms (e.g.
    Ruge, (1997)).
    Since the development of WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998) and large electronic thesauri, information from semantic resources is regularly leveraged to solve NLP problems.
    These tasks include collocation discovery (Pearce, 2001), smoothing and model estimation (Brown et al., 1992; Clark and Weir
