 adjectives, and less than one thousand adverbs.
    The average polysemy for nouns, at both sense and homograph levels, is roughly the same as the overall corpus average although it is noticably higher for verbs at the sense level.
    At the sense level the average polysemy figures are much lower for adjectives and adverbs.
    This is because it is common for English words to act as either a noun or a verb and, since these are the most polysemous grammatical categories, the average polysemy count becomes large due to the cumulative effect of polysemy across grammatical categories.
    However, words that can act as adjectives or adverbs are unlikely to be nouns or verbs.
    This, plus the fact that adjectives and adverbs are generally less polysemous in LDOCE, means that their average polysemy in text is far lower than it is for nouns or verbs.
    Table 7 shows the accuracy of our system over the four subcorpora.
    We can see that the tagger achieves higher results at the homograph level than the sense
