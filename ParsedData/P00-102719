st those roots in the test set.
    It is thus a more challenging evaluation than testing simple alignment accuracy between two clean and extraneous-entry-free wordlists.
    Table 9 shows the performance of several of the investigated similarity measures.
    Frequency similarity (FS), enhanced Levenshtein (LS), and Context similarity (CS) alone achieve only 10%, 31% and 28% overall accuracy respectively.
    However, the hypothesis that these measures model independent and complementary evidence sources is supported by the roughly additive combined accuracy of 71.6%.8 The final performance of the full converged CS+FS+LS+MS model at 99.2% accuracy on the full test set, and 99.7% accuracy on inflections requiring analysis beyond simple concatenative suffixation, is quite remarkable given that the algorithm had absolutely no &lt;inflection,root&gt; examples as training data, and had no prior inventory of stem changes available, with only a slight statistical bias in favor of shorter stem changes with smaller L
