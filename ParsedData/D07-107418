  Lexicosyntactic patterns have been employed successfully in the past (e.g., Hearst, 1992; Roark and Charniak, 1998; Cederberg and Widdows, 2003), and this type of tag extraction is still a promising direction for the future.
  However, the brute force approach we tried ?
  of indiscriminately tagging the entities of enumerations of four or more entities ?
  was found to introduce a large amount of noise into the system in our develop- ment experiments.
  711 3.3 Contexts To extract contextual clues for an entity, we use the information present in that entity?s page and in the other articles that explicitly refer to that entity.
  First, the appositives in the titles of entity pages, which are eliminated to derive entity surface forms (as discussed in Section 3.1) are saved as contex- tual clues.
  For example, ?TV series?
  becomes a context for the entity Texas (TV series).
