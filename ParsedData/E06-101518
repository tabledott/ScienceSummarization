y SVMs when using polynomial kernel.
    This latter shows the minimal complexity needed to work in the dual space.
    To study the FTK running time, we extracted from PennTree bank the first 500 trees5 containing exactly n nodes, then, we evaluated all 25,000 possible tree pairs.
    Each point of the Figure 6 shows the average computation time on all the tree pairs of a fixed size n. In the figures, the trend lines which best interpolates the experimental values are also shown.
    It clearly appears that the training time is quadratic as SVMs have quadratic learning time complexity (see Figure 5) whereas the FTK running time has a linear behavior (Figure 6).
    The QTK algorithm shows a quadratic running time complexity, as expected.
    In these experiments, we investigate which kernel is the most accurate for the predicate argument classification.
    First, we run ST, SST, ST+bow, SST+bow, Linear and Poly kernels over different training-set size of PropBank.
    Figure 7 shows the learning curves asso
