), percentage of sentences with no crossing brackets (0 CB), and the percentage of sentences with two crossing brackets or fewer (&lt; 2 CB).
    In addition, we show the average number of rule expansions considered per word, that is, the number of rule expansions for which a probability was calculated (see Roark and Charniak [2000]), and the average number of analyses advanced to the next priority queue per word.
    This is an incremental parser with a pruning strategy and no backtracking.
    In such a model, it is possible to commit to a set of partial analyses at a particular point that cannot be completed given the rest of the input string (i.e., the parser can &amp;quot;garden path&amp;quot;).
    In such a case, the parser fails to return a complete parse.
    In the event that no complete parse is found, the highest initially ranked parse on the last nonempty priority queue is returned.
    All unattached words are then attached at the highest level in the tree.
    In such a way we predict no new co
