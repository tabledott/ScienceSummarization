nese word segmentation can be modeled effectively using weighted finite-state transducers.
    This architecture provides a uniform framework in which it is easy to incorporate not only listed dictionary entries but also morphological derivatives, and models for personal names and foreign names in transliteration.
    Other kinds of productive word classes, such as company names, abbreviations (termed AIM suol-xie3 in Mandarin), and place names can easily be 20 Note that 7 in fT is normally pronounced as le0, but as part of a resultative it is lino3. handled given appropriate models.
    (For some recent corpus-based work on Chinese abbreviations, see Huang, Ahrens, and Chen [1993].)
    We have argued that the proposed method performs well.
    However, some caveats are in order in comparing this method (or any method) with other approaches to segmentation reported in the literature.
    First of all, most previous articles report performance in terms of a single percent-correct score, or else in terms of th
