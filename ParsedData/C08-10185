			A stumbling block to studying abstractive sentence compression is the lack of widely available corpora for training and testing.
			Previous work has beenconducted almost exclusively on Ziff-Davis, a cor pus derived automatically from document abstractpairs (Knight and Marcu, 2002), or on human authored corpora (Clarke, 2008).
			Unfortunately,none of these data sources are suited to our problem since they have been produced with a single rewriting operation, namely word deletion.
			Al though there is a greater supply of paraphrasing corpora, such as the Multiple-Translation Chinese (MTC) corpus 1 and theMicrosoft Research (MSR) Paraphrase Corpus (Quirk et al, 2004), they are also not ideal, since they have not been created 1 Available by the LDC, Catalog Number LDC2002T01, ISBN 1-58563-217-1.
			with compression in mind.
			They contain amplerewriting operations, however they do not explic itly target information loss.
			For the reasons just described, we created our own corpus.
