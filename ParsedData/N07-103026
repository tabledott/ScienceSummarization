low several constraints between the tasks to be straightforwardly stated to ensure consistency to the assignments.
    We thus achieve large improvements with a simple formulation and no fuss.
    ILP solutions are also obtained very quickly for the objective functions and constraints we use.
    In future work, we will explore the use of global constraints, similar to those used by (Barzilay and Lapata, 2006) to improve both precision and recall.
    For example, we expect transitivity constraints over coreference pairs, as well as constraints on the entire partition (e.g., the number of entities in the document), to help considerably.
    We will also consider linguistic constraints (e.g., restrictions on pronouns) in order to improve precision.
