ropose a simple solution to this problem: we remove all and only those twinless system mentions that are singletons before applying B3 and CEAF.
    The reason is simple: since the coreference resolver has successfully identified these mentions as singletons, it should not be penalized, and removing them allows us to avoid such penalty.
    Note that we only remove twinless (as opposed to all) system mentions that are singletons: this allows us to reward a resolver for successful identification of singleton mentions that have twins, thus overcoming a major weakness of and common criticism against the MUC scorer.
    Also, we retain twinless system mentions that are nonsingletons, as the resolver should be penalized for identifying spurious coreference relations.
    On the other hand, we do not remove twinless mentions in the key partition, as we want to ensure that the resolver makes the correct (non-)coreference decisions for them.
    We believe that our proposal addresses Stoyanov et al.&#8217;s (2009) pr
