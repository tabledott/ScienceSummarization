re indicating the percentage of input tokens assigned the correct exact segmentation (as reported by Cohen and Smith (2007)).
    SEGTok(noH) is the segmentation accuracy ignoring mistakes involving the implicit definite article h.11 To evaluate our performance on the tagging task we report CPOS and FPOS corresponding to coarse- and fine-grained PoS tagging results (F1) measure.
    Evaluating parsing results in our joint framework, as argued by Tsarfaty (2006), is not trivial under the joint disambiguation task, as the hypothesized yield need not coincide with the correct one.
    Our parsing performance measures (SY N) thus report the PARSEVAL extension proposed in Tsarfaty (2006).
    We further report SYNCS, the parsing metric of Cohen and Smith (2007), to facilitate the comparison.
    We report the F1 value of both measures.
    Finally, our U (unparsed) measure is used to report the number of sentences to which our system could not propose a joint analysis.
