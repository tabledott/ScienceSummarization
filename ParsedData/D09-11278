duce resolution, which we will return to with the help of bilingual constraints in Section 3.
    The three action system was originally described by Yamada and Matsumoto (2003) (although their methods require multiple passes over the input), and then appeared as &#8220;arc-standard&#8221; in Nivre (2004), but was argued against in comparison to the four-action &#8220;arc-eager&#8221; variant.
    Most subsequent works on shift-reduce or &#8220;transition-based&#8221; dependency parsing followed &#8220;arc-eager&#8221; (Nivre and Scholz, 2004; Zhang and Clark, 2008), which now becomes the dominant style.
    But we argue that &#8220;arc-standard&#8221; is preferable because: and disjoint, whereas the semantics of 4 actions are not completely disjoint.
    For example, their Left action assumes an implicit Reduce of the left item, and their Right action assumes an implicit Shift.
    Furthermore, these two actions have non-trivial preconditions which also causes the next problem (see below).
    We argue that
