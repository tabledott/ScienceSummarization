associated with the maximum value among the scores provided by the Ci, i.e. t = argmaxi&#8712;S score(Ci), where S is the set of argument types.
    We adopted the OVA approach as it is simple and effective as showed in (Pradhan et al., 2004).
    Note that the representation in Figure 4 is quite intuitive and, to conceive it, the designer requires much less linguistic knowledge about semantic roles than those necessary to define relevant features manually.
    To understand such point, we should make a step back before Gildea and Jurafsky defined the first set of features for Semantic Role Labeling (SRL).
    The idea that syntax may have been useful to derive semantic information was already inspired by linguists, but from a machine learning point of view, to decide which tree fragments may have been useful for semantic role labeling was not an easy task.
    In principle, the designer should have had to select and experiment all possible tree subparts.
    This is exactly what the tree kernels can automati
