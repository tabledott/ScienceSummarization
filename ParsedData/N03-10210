    translational equivalence between their components. link generated by a D-MTG has components.
    Some (but not all) components of a link may be empty.
    An empty component indicates that an expression vanishes in translation.
    To express empty we add a special terminal to special nonterminal MTG applications, the different components of a link will typically come largely disjoint subsets of vocabularies or sets of grammatical categories from different languages.
    Each MTG also has a set of production rules (or just &amp;quot;productions&amp;quot; for short), which fall into one of two categories.'
    YIELD productions have the form t X is a link of and t is a link of is empty if and only if empty, &lt; D. productions have the form X=NPM (2) where M is a non-empty vector of nonterminal links, is a non-empty vector of and is a rendering function, explained The rank of an MTG production is the number of nonterminal links on its RHS.
    The rank of a
