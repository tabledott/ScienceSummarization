 the completion step, which takes 0(12) for each input position, 1 being the length of the current prefix.
    The total time is therefore 0(13) for an input of length 1, which is also the complexity of the standard Inside/Outside (Baker 1979) and LRI (Jelinek and Lafferty 1991) algorithms.
    For grammars of bounded ambiguity, the incremental per-word cost reduces to 0(1), 0(12) total.
    For deterministic CFGs the incremental cost is constant, 0(1) total.
    Because of the possible start indices each state set can contain 0(1) Earley states, giving 0(12) worst-case space complexity overall.
    Apart from input length, complexity is also determined by grammar size.
    We will not try to give a precise characterization in the case of sparse grammars (Appendix B.3 gives some hints on how to implement the algorithm efficiently for such grammars).
    However, for fully parameterized grammars in CNF we can verify the scaling of the algorithm in terms of the number of nonterminals n, and verify that it has t
