e IBM-4 translation model is provably NP-complete, as shown in Knight (1999) and Germann et al. (2001), word reordering restrictions as introduced in this article are essential for obtaining an efficient search algorithm that guarantees that a solution close to the optimal one will be found.
    To quantify the reordering restrictions in Section 3.5, the four non-negative numbers numskip, widthskip, nummove, and widthmove are used (widthskip corresponds to L, widthmove corresponds to R in Section 3.4; here, we use a more intuitive notation).
    Within the implementation of the DP search, the restrictions are provided to the algorithm as an input parameter of the following type: S numskip widthskip M nummove widthmove The meaning of the reordering string is as follows: The two numbers following S that are separated by an underscore describe the way words may be skipped; the two numbers following M that are separated by an underscore describe the way words may be moved during word reordering.
    The first num
