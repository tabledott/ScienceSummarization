			There is a one-to-one correspondence ? between dbps of v and derivations of v: ?e, ( j1 ? ?
			j|e|)?
			?e,D j1 (T1(e)) ? ?
			?D j|e| (T |e|(e))?
			Accordingly, we extend the weight function w to dbps: w(D?) = w(D) if D?
			D. This in turn induces an ordering on dbps: D?
			D??
			iff w(D?) ? w(D??).
			Let D?i(v) denote the ith-best dbp of v.Where no confusion will arise, we use the terms ?deriva tion?
			and ?dbp?
			interchangeably.
			Computationally, then, the k-best problem can bestated as follows: given a hypergraph H with arity a, com pute D?1(t), . . .

			More generally, hypergraphs can be used to represent the search space of most weighted deductive sys tem (Nederhof, 2003).
			For example, the weighted CKY algorithm given a context-free gram
