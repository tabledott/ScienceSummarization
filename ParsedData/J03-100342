the target object.
    In terms of the graphtheoretical framework, this would go as follows.
    First, we assign salience weights to the vertices in the scene graph using the salience weights definition proposed by Krahmer and Theune.
    Subsequently, in the sketch of the basic algorithm (Figure 6), the set of distractors should be redefined as follows: In I n E VG n matchGraphs(v, H, n, G) n n =&#65533; v n sw(n) &gt; sw(v)} That is, the distractor set is restricted to those vertices n in the scene graph G that currently are at least as salient as the target object v. For target objects that are linguistically salient, this will typically lead to a reduction of the distractor set.
    Consequently, distinguishing graphs for these target objects will generally be smaller than those for nonsalient objects.
    Moreover, we will be able to find distinguishing graphs for a salient object v relatively fast, since we already have a distinguishing graph (constructed for the first definite reference to v) and we c
