as input and sentence vectors as output.
    Hence, at least theoretically, one should be able to build sentence vectors and compare their synonymity in exactly the same way as one measures word synonymity.
    Pregroup Grammars The aforementioned linear maps turn out to be the grammatical reductions of a type-logic called a Lambek pregroup grammar (Lambek, 2008)2.
    Pregroups and vector spaces share the same high level mathematical structure, referred to as a compact closed category, for a proof and details of this claim see Coecke et al. (2010); for a friendly introduction to category theory, see Coecke and Paquette (2011).
    One consequence of this parity is that the grammatical reductions of a pregroup grammar can be directly transformed into linear maps that act on vectors.
    In a nutshell, pregroup types are either atomic or compound.
    Atomic types can be simple (e.g. n for noun phrases, s for statements) or left/right superscripted&#8212;referred to as adjoint types (e.g. nr and nl).
