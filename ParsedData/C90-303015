amp;NP would be properly considered.
  Every constraint embodies a true statement.
  Oc- casionally the constraints might seem quite down-to- earth and even trivial, given mainstream conceptions of what constitutes a linguistically sig- nificant generalization.
  But the very essence of CG is that low-level constraints (i) are easily express- ible, and (it) prove to be effective in parsing.
  Constraints for intrasentential clause boundaries Clause boundary constraints establish locations of clause boundaries.
  They are important especially for the formulation of proper syntactic constraints.
  E.g., the syntactic constraint "there is only one finite predi- cate in a simplex non-coordinated clause" presup- poses that clause boundary locations are known.
  Clause boundaries occur i.a.
  as the inherent fea- ture "&lt;**CLB&gt;" in the input stream.
  subjunctions are lexically marked by this feature.
  But many boun- daries must be spotted by specific constraints.
  Clause boundary constraints have the specia
