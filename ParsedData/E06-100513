rds).
    Table 1 gives an overview of the test corpora, on which the enhanced hypotheses alignment was computed, and for which the consensus translations were determined.
    The official IWSLT04 test corpus was used for the IWSLT 04 tasks; the CSTAR03 test corpus was used for the speech translation task.
    The March 2005 test corpus of the TC-STAR evaluation (verbatim condition) was used for the EPPS task.
    In Table 1, the number of running words in English is the average number of running words in the hypotheses, from which the consensus translation was computed; the vocabulary of English is the merged vocabulary of these hypotheses.
    For the BTEC IWSLT04 corpus, the statistics for English is given for the experiments described in Sections 3.3 and 3.5, respectively.
    Well-established objective evaluation measures like the word error rate (WER), positionindependent word error rate (PER), and the BLEU score (Papineni et al., 2002) were used to assess the translation quality.
    All measures were
