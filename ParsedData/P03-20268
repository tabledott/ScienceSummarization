B is a set of contexts, and gj(a,b) is a binary function that returns value 1 when feature fj exists in context b and the category is a.
    Otherwise, gj(a,b) returns value 0. p~ (a,b) is the occurrence rate of the pair (a,b) in the training data.
  
  
    We selected 13 error categories for detection.
    We obtained data from 56 learners&#8217; with error tags.
    We used 50 files (5599 sentences) as the training data, and 6 files (617 sentences) as the test data.
    We tried to detect each error category using the methods discussed in Sections 3.2 and 3.3.
    There were some error categories that could not be detected because of the lack of training data, but we have obtained the following results for article errors which occurred most frequently.
    We assumed that the results were inadequate because we did not have sufficient training data.
    To overcome this, we added the correct sentences to see how this would affect the results.
    As discussed in Section 2.1, our error tags provided a correc
