 contain, they might do more harm than good for the system&#8217;s performance.
    The best way to make use of this sentence pair is to extract and use for training just the translated (highlighted) fragments.
    This is the aim of our work.
    Identifying parallel subsentential fragments is a difficult task.
    It requires the ability to recognize translational equivalence in very noisy environments, namely sentence pairs that express different (although overlapping) content.
    However, a good solution to this problem would have a strong impact on parallel data acquisition efforts.
    Enabling the exploitation of corpora that do not share parallel sentences would greatly increase the amount of comparable data that can be used for SMT.
  
  
    The high-level architecture of our parallel fragment extraction system is presented in Figure 3.
    The first step of the pipeline identifies document pairs that are similar (and therefore more likely to contain parallel data), using the Lemur information retr
