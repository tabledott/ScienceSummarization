81.
    This drops to 0.51 after ensuring that the predominant sense in BC is the same as that of WSJ, confirming that the sense priors in the newly gathered BC data more closely follow the sense priors in WSJ.
    Using this new set of training examples, we perform domain adaptation using active learning to obtain the curve a-truePred in Figure 3.
    For comparison, we also plot the curves a and a-truePrior for this set of 9 nouns in Figure 3.
    Results in Figure 3 show that a-truePred starts off at a higher accuracy and performs consistently better than the a curve.
    In contrast, though a-truePrior starts at a high accuracy, its performance is lower than a-truePred and a after 50% of adaptation examples are added.
    The approach represented by atruePred is a compromise between ensuring that the sense priors in the training data follow as closely as possible the sense priors in the evaluation data, while retaining enough training examples.
    These results highlight the importance of striking a bala
