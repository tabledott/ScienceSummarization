			We sorted them according to their precision.
			Table 3 shows five of the clusters evenly distributed according to their precision ranking along with their Top-15 features with highest mutual-information.
			The words in the clusters are listed in descending order of their similarity to the cluster centroid.
			For each cluster c, we also include wn(c).
			The underlined words are in wn(c).
			The first cluster is clearly a cluster of firearms
