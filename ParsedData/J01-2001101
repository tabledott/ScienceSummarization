 simplest grammatical description of a given corpus (the child's input) it is only the language-particular part of the description that contributes to complexity&#8212;that is what the theory stipulates.
    By contrast, the MDL approach makes minimal universal assumptions, and so the complexity of everything comprising the description of the corpus must be counted in determining the complexity of the description.
    The difference between these hypotheses vanishes asymptotically (as Janos Simon has pointed out to me) as the size of the language increases, or to put it another way, strong Chomskian rationalism is indistinguishable from pure empiricism as the information content of the (empiricist) MDL-induced grammar increases in size relative to the information content of UG.
    Rephrasing that slightly, the significance of Chomskian-style rationalism is greater, the simpler language-particular grammars are, and it is less significant as language-particular grammars grow larger, and in the limit, as the si
