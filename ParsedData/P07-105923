ates for retrieving at least one adequate answer in the top 10 results shows relative improvements over the baseline of 11.1% for local query expansion, and of 40.7% for combined SMT-based expansion.
    Success rates at top 20 results show similar relative improvements of 14.2% for local query expansion, and of 22.8% for combined SMT-based expansion.
    On the easier task of retrieving a material or adequate answer, success rates drop by a small amount for local expansion, and stay unchanged for SMT-based expansion.
    These results can be explained by inspecting a few sample query expansions.
    Examples (1)-(3) in Table 4 illustrate cases where SMT-based query expansion improves results over baseline performance, but local expansion decreases performance by introducing irrelevant terms.
    In (4) retrieval performance is improved over the baseline for both expansion techniques.
    In (5) both local and SMT-based expansion introduce terms that decrease retrieval performance compared to retrieval withou
