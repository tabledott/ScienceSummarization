 uses a combination of binary classifiers for each entailment direction.
    The classifiers use both monolingual alignment features based on METEOR (Banerjee and Lavie, 2005) alignments (translations obtained from Google Translate), and cross-lingual alignment features based on GIZA++ (Och and Ney, 2000) (word alignments learned on Europarl).
    ICT [pivoting, compositional] (Meng et al., 2012) adopts a pivoting method (using Google Translate and an in-house hierarchical MT system), and the open source EDITS system (Kouylekov and Negri, 2010) to calculate similarity scores between monolingual English pairs.
    Separate unidirectional entailment judgments obtained from binary classifier are combined to return one of the four valid CLTE judgments.
    JU-CSE-NLP [pivoting, compositional] (Neogi et al., 2012) uses Microsoft Bing translator7 to produce monolingual English pairs.
    Separate lexical mapping scores are calculated (from T1 to T2 and vice-versa) considering different types of information and simi
