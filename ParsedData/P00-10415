    It is likely that further processing, such as lemmatization, might be useful, producing smaller and better language models, but this was not evaluated for this paper.
    Content selection requires that the system learn a model of the relationship between the appearance of some features in a document and the appearance of corresponding features in the summary.
    This can be modeled by estimating the likelihood of some token appearing in a summary given that some tokens (one or more, possibly different tokens) appeared in the document to be summarized.
    The very simplest, &#8220;zero-level&#8221; model for this relationship is the case when the two tokens in the document and the summary are identical.
    This can be computed as the conditional probability of a word occurring in the summary given that the word appeared in the document: where and represent the bags of words that the headline and the document contain.
    Once the parameters of a content selection model have b
