    The ARGUMENT IS WAR metaphor forms a systematic way of talking about the battling aspects of arguing.... Because the metaphorical concept is systematic, the language we use to talk about the concept is systematic (ibid., p. 5).
    What Lakoff and Johnson fail to discuss is how metaphors in general, let alone individual metaphorical concepts, are recognized.
    Martin's (1988; 1990) work has addressed this issue.
    He has pursued a conventional metaphor view using KODIAK (Wilensky 1984), a variant of Brachman's KLONE knowledge representation language.

    In Martin's work, &amp;quot;metaphor-maps,&amp;quot; a kind of VIEW (ibid., p. 64), are used to represent conventional metaphors and the conceptual information they contain.
