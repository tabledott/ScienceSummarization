by coder A and Statements by coder B, which receive the maximal weight of 1, and the six utterances marked as Info-Requests by coder A and Checks by coder B, which are given a weight of 0.5.
    The observed disagreement is calculated by summing up all the cells in the contingency table, multiplying each cell by its respective weight, and dividing the total by the number of items (in the following calculation we ignore cells with zero items).
    Expected disagreement of the weighted coefficients for the data from Table 4.
    Two issues recently raised by Di Eugenio and Glass (2004) concern the behavior of agreement coefficients when the annotation data are severely skewed.
    One issue, which Di Eugenio and Glass call the bias problem, is that &#960; and &#954; yield quite different numerical values when the annotators&#8217; marginal distributions are widely divergent; the other issue, the prevalence problem, is the exceeding difficulty in getting high agreement values when most of the items fall under on
