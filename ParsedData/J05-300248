two sentences from the test corpus, along with input sentences.
    The examples are chosen so as to reflect good- and bad-performance cases.
    Note that the first example results in inclusion of the essential information (the fact that bodies were found, along with time and place) and leaves out details (that it was a remote location or how many miles west it was, a piece of information that is in dispute in any case).
    The problematic example incorrectly selects the number of people killed as six, even though this number is not repeated and different numbers are referred to in the text.
    This mistake is caused by a noisy entry in our paraphrasing dictionary which erroneously identifies &#8220;five&#8221; and &#8220;six&#8221; as paraphrases of each other.
    Table 7 shows the length ratio, precision, recall, F-measure, and grammaticality score for each algorithm.
    The length ratio of a sentence was computed as the ratio of its output length to the average length of the theme input sentences.
