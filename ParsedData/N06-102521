ws (i.e. using multiple measures at the same time).
    In order to yield the desired performance improvements, it turns out to be essential to filter out irrelevant features.
    Table 5 shows the relevance of the best performing features on the BNEWS section.
    As our feature selection mechanism chooses the best set of features by removing them (see Section 4.2), we evaluate the contributions of the remaining features as follows.
    We start with a baseline system using all the features from Soon et al. (2001) that were not removed in the feature selection process (i.e.
    DISTANCE).
    We then train classifiers combining the current feature set with each feature in turn.
    We then choose the best performing feature based on the MUC score F-measure and add it to the model.
    We iterate the process until all features are added to the baseline system.
    The table indicates that all knowledge sources are relevant for coreference resolution, as it includes SRL, WordNet and Wikipedia features.
