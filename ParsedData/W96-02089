    Several recent research projects have taken a corpus-based approach to lexical disambiguation (Brown, Della-Pietra, Della-Pietra, St Mercer, 1991; Gale, Church, St Yarowsky, 1992b; Leacock et al., 1993b; Lehman, 1994).
    The goal is to learn to use surrounding context to determine the sense of an ambiguous word.
    Our tests are based on the corpus assembled by Leacock et al. (1993b).
    The task is to disambiguate the word &amp;quot;line&amp;quot; into one of six possible senses (text, formation, division, phone, cord, product) based on the words occurring in the current and previous sentence.
    The corpus was assembled from the 1987-89 Wall Street Journal and a 25 million word corpus from the American Printing House for the Blind.

    There are a total of 4,149 examples in the full corpus unequally distributed across the six senses.
