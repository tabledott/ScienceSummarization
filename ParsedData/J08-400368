the arc-standard parser (r = 0.571, p = 0.02), although clearly not as strong as for the listbased parser.
    It therefore seems reasonable to conclude that the non-projective parser in general can be expected to outperform a strictly projective parser with a margin that is directly related to the proportion of non-projective dependencies in the data.
    Having compared the non-projective, list-based parser to the strictly projective parsers, we will now scrutinize the results obtained when coupling the projective parsers with the pseudo-projective parsing technique, as an alternative method for capturing non-projective dependencies.
    The overall pattern is that pseudo-projective parsing improves the accuracy of a projective parser for languages with more than 1% of non-projective dependencies, as seen from the results for Czech, Dutch, German, and Portuguese.
    For these languages, the pseudo-projective parser is never outperformed by its strictly projective counterpart, and usually does considerably
