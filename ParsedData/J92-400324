cies of Hum pty and Dumpty.
    Notice that the property of being a sticky pair is not symmetric and so, while Hum pty Dumpty forms a sticky pair, Dumpty Hum pty does not.
    Instead of seeking pairs of words that occur next to one another more than we would expect, we can seek pairs of words that simply occur near one another more than we would expect.
    We avoid finding sticky pairs again by not considering pairs of words that occur too close to one another.
    To be precise, let Prnear (w1 w2) be the probability that a word chosen at random from the text is w1 and that a second word, chosen at random from a window of 1,001 words centered on wi but excluding the words in a window of 5 centered on w1, is w2.
    We say that w1 and w2 are semantically sticky if Prnear (W1W2) is much larger than Pr (w1) Pr (w2) .
    Unlike stickiness, semantic stickiness is symmetric so that if w1 sticks semantically to w2, then w2 sticks semantically to w1.
    In Table 6, we show some interesting classes that we constru
