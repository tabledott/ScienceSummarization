y node is the minimal tree fragment (i.e., connected set of local trees) required to connect the empty node with all of the nodes coindexed with it.
    Any indices occuring on nodes in the pattern are systematically renumbered beginning with 1.
    If an empty node does not bear an index, its pattern is just the local tree containing it.
    Figure 4 displays the single pattern that would be extracted corresponding to the two empty nodes in the tree depicted in Figure 1.
    For this kind of pattern we define pattern matching informally as follows.
    If p is a pattern and t is a tree, then p matches t iff t is an extension of p ignoring empty nodes in p. For example, the pattern displayed in Figure 4 matches the subtree rooted under SBAR depicted in Figure 2.
    If a pattern p matches a tree t, then it is possible to substitute p for the fragment of t that it matches.
    For example, the result of substituting the pattern shown in Figure 4 for the subtree rooted under SBAR depicted in Figure 2 is the tre
