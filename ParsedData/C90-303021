tic mapping, that certain labels are incompatible with the clausal context at hand.
  There may be several mapping statements for the same morphological feature(s), e.g.
  Map- ping statements with more narrowly specified con- texts have precedence over more general statements.
  In the present implementation of CGP, the mapping statements apply in plain linear order.
  The last mapping statement for a particular feature 1"/2 provides the worst case, i.e.
  the maximal assort- ment of function labels for that feature.
  Every word-form will have at least one syntactic label after morphosyntactic mapping, and all possible syntactic ambiguities have also now been introduced.
  In step three, syntactic constraints reduce syn- tactic ambiguities where such exist due either to lexical information (cf.
  the infinitive move above), or to morphosyntactic mapping.
  Syntactic constraints discard the remaining superfluous syntactic labels.
  Syntactic constraints differ from context-dependent disambiguation constraint
