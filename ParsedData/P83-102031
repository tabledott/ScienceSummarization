 manner, until it finds itself unable to fill the next template slot somehow or other.
    At this point some mechanism must decide what additional predications to add to allow the parser to proceed.
    The functional force of the stipulations discussed above is to sevei ely restrict the range of possibilities that can be considered in such a situation.
    Indeed, we would be delighted if it turned out to be the case that the parser can never consider more than several possibilities at any point that such an operation will be performed.
    It is particularly worthy of note that these two constraints interact to predict that the range of constructions that can be reanalyzed in the manner discussed in the last section is severely circumscribed, and that this prediction is borne out (see (Quirk, Greenbaum, Leech &amp; Svartvik 721, &#167;12.64).
    These two constraints together predict that verb reanalysis is possible only when a single constituent precedes the trigger for reanalysis: Suppose that there wer
