ates, thus allowing us to include such documentlevel event descriptive information into the relations holding between referring expressions (REs).
    Instead of exploring different kinds of data representations, task definitions or machine learning techniques (Ng &amp; Cardie, 2002; Yang et al., 2003; Luo et al., 2004) we focus on a few promising semantic features which we evaluate in a controlled environment.
    That way we try to overcome the plateauing in performance in coreference resolution observed by Kehler et al. (2004).
  
  
    Vieira &amp; Poesio (2000), Harabagiu et al. (2001), and Markert &amp; Nissim (2005) explore the use of WordNet for different coreference resolution subtasks, such as resolving bridging reference, otherand definite NP anaphora, and MUC-style coreference resolution.
    All of them present systems which infer coreference relations from a set of potential antecedents by means of a WordNet search.
    Our approach to WordNet here is to cast the search results in terms of sema
