838; C, of conjunctive nodes.
    Our concern is only the set of features associated with each conjunctive node, and the shape of the tree structure is irrelevant to the computation of probabilities of unpacked trees.
    Hence, we do not distinguish an unpacked tree from a set of conjunctive nodes.
    The collection of unpacked trees represented by a feature forest is defined as a multiset of unpacked trees because we allow multiple occurrences of equivalent unpacked trees in a feature forest.2 Given multisets of unpacked trees, A, B, we define the union and the product as follows.
    Intuitively, the first operation is a collection of trees, and the second lists all combinations of trees in A and B.
    It is trivial that they satisfy commutative, associative, and distributive laws.
    We denote a set of unpacked trees rooted at node n E C U D as &#8486;(n).
    &#8486;(n) is defined recursively.
    For a terminal node c E C, obviously &#8486;(c) = {{c}}.
    For an internal conjunctive node c E C, an u
