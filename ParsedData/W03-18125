, the MWE must be of simple decomposable type.
    The particular similarity method we adopt is latent semantic analysis, or LSA (Deerwester et al., 1990).
    LSA allows us to calculate the similarity between an arbitrary word pair, offering the advantage of being able to measure the similarity between the MWE and each of its constituent words.
    For MWEs such as house boat, therefore, we can expect to capture the fact that the MWE is highly similar in meaning to both constituent words (i.e. the modifier house and head noun boat).
    More importantly, LSA makes no assumptions about the lexical or syntactic composition of the inputs, and thus constitutes a fully construction- and language-inspecific method of modelling decomposability.
    This has clear advantages over a more conventional supervised classifierstyle approach, where training data would have to be customised to a particular language and construction type.
    Evaluation is inevitably a difficulty when it comes to the analysis of MWEs, due to
