er, Dang, and Fellbaum (2007) in combination with a distance metric such as the one just proposed, it is possible to get more flexible and, we believe, more realistic assessments of the degree of agreement in situations such as this.
    For instance, in case the reliability study had already been carried out under the standard SENSEVAL guidelines, the distance metric proposed above could be used to identify post hoc cases of partial agreement by adding to each WN sense its hypernyms according to the groupings proposed by Palmer, Dang, and Fellbaum.
    For example, A&#8217;s annotation could be turned into a new set label {WN1,LABEL} and B&#8217;s mark into the set table {WN3,LABEL}, which would give a distance d = 2/3, indicating a degree of overlap.
    The method for computing agreement proposed here could could also be used to allow coders to choose either a more specific label or one of Palmer, Dang, and Fellbaum&#8217;s superlabels.
    For example, suppose A sticks to WN1, but B decides to mark the us
