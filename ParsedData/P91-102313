  That is, 8 = (12 &#8211; 11 c)/4T 7.. Then, Prob(I81) is computed by integrating a standard normal distribution (with mean zero and variance 1).
    Many statistics textbooks include a table for computing this.
    The prior probability of a match, Prob(match), is fit with the values in Table 5 (below), which were determined from the UBS data.
    We have found that a sentence in one language normally matches exactly one sentence in the other language (1-1), three additional possibilities are also considered: 1-0 (including 0-1), 2-1 (including 1-2), and 2-2.
    Table 5 shows all four possibilities.
    This completes the discussion of the distance measure.
    Prob(matchI8) is computed as an deletion, substitution, etc.
    The function takes four arguments: xi , Y12 X22 Y2.
  
  
    The algorithm is summarized in the following
  
  
    To evaluate align, its results were compared with a human alignment.
    All of the UBS sentences were aligned by a primary judge, a native speaker of English with a rea
