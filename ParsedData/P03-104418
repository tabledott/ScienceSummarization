-training&#8221;: the only evidence it has on a given iteration is derived from its own guesses on previous iterations.
    Thus once it starts to go astray, it is difficult to set it back on course.
    Counter-training provides a framework in which other recognizers, training in parallel with a given recognizer , can label documents as belonging to their own, other categories, and therefore as being less likely to belong to &#8217;s category.
    This likelihood is proportional to the amount of anticipated ambiguity or overlap among the counter-trained scenarios.
    We are still in the early stages of exploring the space of possibilities provided by this methodology, though it is clear that it is affected by several factors.
    One obvious contributing factor is the choice of seed patterns, since seeds may cause the learner to explore different parts of the document space first, which may affect the subsequent outcome.
    Another factor is the particular combination of competing scenarios.
