ncreasing P(e) more than it decreases P(a,fe).2 By only considering helpful zero-fertility insertions, we save ourselves significant overhead in the AddZfert operation, in many cases eliminating all possibilities and reducing its cost to less than that of AddNull.
  
  
    Over the last decade, many instances of NPcomplete problems have been shown to be solvable in reasonable/polynomial time using greedy methods (Selman et al., 1992; Monasson et al., 1999).
    Instead of deeply probing the search space, such greedy methods typically start out with a random, approximate solution and then try to improve it incrementally until a satisfactory solution is reached.
    In many cases, greedy methods quickly yield surprisingly good solutions.
    We conjectured that such greedy methods may prove to be helpful in the context of MT decoding.
    The greedy decoder that we describe starts the translation process from an English gloss of the French sentence given as input.
    The gloss is constructed by aligning each
