es can be derived in a number of sensible ways; the technique used by Collins was adapted from that used in Bikel et al. (1997), which makes use of a quantity called the diversity of the history context (Witten and Bell 1991), which is equal to the number of unique futures observed in training for that history context.
    6.8.1 Deficient Model.
    As previously mentioned, n back-off levels require n&#8722;1 smoothing weights.
    Collins&#8217; parser effectively uses n weights, because the estimator always adds an extra, constant-valued estimate to the back-off chain.
    Collins&#8217; parser hardcodes this extra value to be a vanishingly small (but nonzero) &#8220;probability&#8221; of 10&#8722;19, resulting in smoothed estimates of the form when there are three levels of back-off.
    The addition of this constant-valued en = 10&#8722;19 causes all estimates in the parser to be deficient, as it ends up throwing away probability mass.
    More formally, the proof leading to equation (17) no longer holds:
