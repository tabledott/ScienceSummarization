  Thus, the generation algorithm is non-deterministic in this respect (although one might imagine there are other factors which determine which of the two re- alizations is preferrable in a given context}.
  The surface semantic structure for the simpler of the two noun phrase structures is as shown in figure 4.
  ONE ANAPHORA The algorithms employed in EPICURE also permit the generation of onc-anaphora, as in Slice the large green capsicum.
  Now remove the top of the small red one.
  The deep semantic structure corresponding to the noun phrase the small red one is as shown in fig- ure 5.
  The mechanisms which construct the surface semantic structure determine whether one-anaphora is possible by comparing the
