lting assignment is one that maximally agrees with the decisions of the classifier, that is, where all and only the links predicted to be coreferential are used for constructing the chains.
    This is in contrast with the usual clustering algorithms, in which a unique antecedent is typically picked for each anaphor (e.g., the most probable or the most recent).
    The second step provides the joint formulation: the coreference classifier is now combined with an anaphoricity classifier and constraints are added to ensure that the ultimate coreference and anaphoricity decisions are mutually consistent.
    Both of these formulations achieve significant performance gains over the base classifier.
    Specifically, the joint model achieves f-score improvements of 3.7-5.3% on three datasets.
    We begin by presenting the basic coreference classifier and anaphoricity classifier and their performance, including an upperbound that shows the limitation of using them in a cascade.
    We then give the details of our
