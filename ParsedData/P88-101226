haracterization of interpretation says that we must derive this expression from the axioms or from assumptions.
    Back-chaining on reduce' (el, p, I) yields decrease(p, 1, si) A vertical(s1) A etc3(p, 1, si ) Back-chaining on erode' (el, x) yields We unify the goals decrease(p, I, si) and decrease(x , 12, 32), and thereby identify the object of the erosion with the plain.
    The goals vertical(31) and vertical(s2) also unify, telling us the reduction was on the altitude scale.
    Backchaining on plain(p) yields and landf orrn(x) unifies with landf orm(p), reinforcing our identification of the object of the erosion with the plain.
    Back-chaining on lever (e2, I, y). yields and vertical(33) and vertical(s2) unify, as do flat(y) and flat(p), thereby identifying &amp;quot;it&amp;quot;, or y, as the plain p. We have not written out the axioms for this, but note also that &amp;quot;present&amp;quot; implies the existence of a change of level, or a change in the location of &amp;quot;it&amp;quot; on a vertica
