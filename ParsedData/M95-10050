  Bedford, MA 01730 mbv, john, aberdeen, lynette@mitre .org; dennis.x.connolly@ameritech.com This note describes a scoring scheme for the coreference task in MUC6 .
  It improves o n the original approach l by: (1) grounding the scoring scheme in terms of a model ; (2) producing more intuitive recall and precision scores ; and (3) not requiring explici t computation of the transitive closure of coreference .
  The principal conceptual differenc e is that we have moved from a syntactic scoring model based on following coreferenc e links to an approach defined by the model theory of those links .
  In brief, the scheme operates by comparing the equivalence classes defined by the link s in the key and the response, rather than the links themselves (thus, this is only wel l defined for identity links, at the moment) .
  These classes are of course t
