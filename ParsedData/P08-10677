f the WordEdges feature (see Figure 2(c) and Section 3.2 for details).
    Using a machine learning algorithm, the weight vector w can be estimated from the training data where each sentence si is labelled with its correct (&#8220;gold-standard&#8221;) parse y&#8727;i .
    As for the learner, Collins (2000) uses the boosting algorithm and Charniak and Johnson (2005) use the maximum entropy estimator.
    In this work we use the averaged perceptron algorithm (Collins, 2002) since it is an online algorithm much simpler and orders of magnitude faster than Boosting and MaxEnt methods.
    Shown in Pseudocode 1, the perceptron algorithm makes several passes over the whole training data, and in each iteration, for each sentence si, it tries to predict a best parse yi among the candidates cand(si) using the current weight setting.
    Intuitively, we want the gold parse y&#8727;i to be picked, but in general it is not guaranteed to be within cand(si), because the grammar may fail to cover the gold parse, and becaus
