    We are developing a polynomialtime Earley style parsing algorithm.
    The parser returns a parse forest encoding all parses for an input string.
    The performance of this parser is sensitive to the grammar and input.
    Indeed it appears that for grammars that lexicalize CFG and for English grammar (where the structures are similar to the LTAG developed at University of Pennsylvania (XTAG Research Group, 1995)) we obtain cubic-time complexity.
  
  
    DTG, like other formalisms in the TAG family, is lexicalizable, but in addition, its derivations are themselves linguistically meaningful.
    In future work we intend to examine additional linguistic data, refining aspects of our definition as needed.
    We will also study the formal properties of DTG, and complete the design of the Earley style parser.
