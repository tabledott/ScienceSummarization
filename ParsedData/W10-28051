nceforth DSMs), are computational models that build contextual semantic representations for lexical items from corpus data.
    DSMs have been successfully used in the recent years for a number of different computational tasks involving semantic relations between words (e.g. synonym identification, computation of semantic similarity, modelling selectional preferences, etc., for a thorough discussion of the field, cf.
    Sahlgren, 2006).
    The theoretical foundation of DSMs is to be found in the &#8220;distributional hypothesis of meaning&#8221;, attributed to Z. Harris, which maintains that meaning is susceptible to distributional analysis and, in particular, that differences in meaning between words or morphemes in a language correlate with differences in their distribution (Harris 1970, pp.
    784&#8211;787).
    While the vector-based representation of word meaning has been used for a long time in computational linguistics, the techniques that are currently used have not seen much development with rega
