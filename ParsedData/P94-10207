 the sample counts from the highest-order marginals composed of only interdependent variables.
    These statistics are the maximum likelihood estimates of the mean values of the corresponding marginals distributions.
    Consider, for example, a random sample taken from a population in which four contextual features are used to characterize each occurrence of an ambiguous word.
    The sufficient statistics for the model describing contextual features one and two as independent but all other variables as interdependent are, for all i, j, k, in, n (in this and all subsequent equations, f is an abbreviation for feature): Within the class of decomposable models, the maximum likelihood estimate for E[x] reduces to the product of the sufficient statistics divided by the sample counts defined in the marginals composed of the common elements in the sufficient statistics.
    As such, decomposable models are models that can be expressed as a product of marginals,1 where each marginal consists of only interdependent
