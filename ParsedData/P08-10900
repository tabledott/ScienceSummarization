  Unsupervised Learning of Narrative Event Chains
  
    used in the 1970-80s as knowledge backbones that enabled inference and other NLP tasks requiring deep semantic knowledge.
    We propose unsupervised of similar schemata called chains raw newswire text.
    A narrative event chain is a partially ordered set of events related by a common protagonist.
    We describe a three step process to learning narrative event chains.
    The first uses unsupervised distributional methods to learn narrative relations between events sharing coreferring arguments.
    The second applies a temporal classifier to partially order the connected events.
    Finally, the third prunes and clusters self-contained chains from the space of events. introduce two evaluations: the evaluate event relatedness, and an orcoherence to evaluate narrative order. show a over baseline narrative prediction and temporal coherence. tate learning, and thus this paper addresses the three of chain induction: event ordering of events selection (p
