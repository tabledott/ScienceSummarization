  An Algorithm For Pronominal Anaphora Resolution
  
    This paper presents an algorithm for identifying the noun phrase antecedents of third person pronouns and lexical anaphors (reflexives and reciprocals).
    The algorithm applies to the syntactic representations generated by McCord's Slot Grammar parser and relies on salience measures derived from syntactic structure and a simple dynamic model of attentional state.
    Like the parser, the algorithm is implemented in Prolog.
    The authors have tested it extensively on computer manual texts and conducted a blind test on manual text containing 360 pronoun occurrences.
    The algorithm successfully identifies the antecedent of the pronoun for 86% of these pronoun occurrences.
    The relative contributions of the algorithm's components to its overall success rate in this blind test are examined.
    Experiments were conducted with an enhancement of the algorithm that contributes statistically modelled information concerning semantic and real-world rela
