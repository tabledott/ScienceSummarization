ing based approach for sentiment classification of tweets.
    Specifically, (Davidiv et al., 2010) propose to classify tweets into multiple sentiment types using hashtags and smileys as labels.
    In their approach, a supervised KNN-like classifier is used.
    In contrast, (Barbosa and Feng, 2010) propose a two-step approach to classify the sentiments of tweets using SVM classifiers with abstract features.
    The training data is collected from the outputs of three existing Twitter sentiment classification web sites.
    As mentioned above, these approaches work in a target-independent way, and so need to be adapted for target-dependent sentiment classification.
  
  
    The problem we address in this paper is targetdependent sentiment classification of tweets.
    So the input of our task is a collection of tweets containing the target and the output is labels assigned to each of the tweets.
    Inspired by (Barbosa and Feng, 2010; Pang and Lee, 2004), we design a three-step approach in this paper: In e
