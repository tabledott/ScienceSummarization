ng examples had been seen, was to ascend the type hierarchy until reaching a level for which training data are available.
    To do this, counts of training data were percolated up the semantic hierarchy in a technique similar to that of, for example, McCarthy (2000).
    For each training example, the count #(r, s, pt, t) was incremented in a table indexed by the semantic role r, WordNet sense s, phrase type pt, and target word t, for each WordNet sense s above the head word h in the hypernym hierarchy.
    In fact, the WordNet hierarchy is not a tree, but rather includes multiple inheritance.
    For example, person has as hypernyms both life form and causal agent.
    In such cases, we simply took the first hypernym listed, effectively converting the structure into a tree.
    A further complication is that several WordNet senses are possible for a given head word.
    We simply used the first sense listed for each word; a word sense disambiguation module capable of distinguishing WordNet senses might impr
