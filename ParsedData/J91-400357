he set of projective expansions generated from all elements of the conclusion space, on role R of predicate Q: as: P(43R) = {(P(Q1)P(Q)) I(Qi, &#8226; &#8226; &#8226; , Qn) 430.
    From this resulting representation, we can generate a relational structure that can be considered the set of ad hoc categories and relations associated with a lexical item (cf.
    Barselou 1983).
    Using these definitions, let us return to the sentences in Example 58.
    I will assume that the noun prisoner has a qualia structure such as that shown in 60.
    Using the representation in 60 above, I now trace part of the derivation of the projective conclusion space for prisoner.
    Inheritance structures are defined for each qualia role of an element.
    In the case above, values are specified for only two roles.
    For each role, R, we apply a projective transformation 7 onto the predicate Q that is the value of that role.
    For example, from the telic role of prisoner we can generalize (e.g. drop the conjunct) to the co
