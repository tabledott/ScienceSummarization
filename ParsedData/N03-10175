an existing hypothesis by the translation of a phrase as follows: A sequence of untranslated foreign words and a possible English phrase translation for them is selected.
    The English phrase is attached to the existing English output sequence.
    The foreign words are marked as translated and the probability cost of the hypothesis is updated.
    The cheapest (highest probability) final hypothesis with no untranslated foreign words is the output of the search.
    The hypotheses are stored in stacks.
    The stack contains all hypotheses in which foreign words have been translated.
    We recombine search hypotheses as done by Och et al. [2001].
    While this reduces the number of hypotheses stored in each stack somewhat, stack size is exponential with respect to input sentence length.
    This makes an exhaustive search impractical.
    Thus, we prune out weak hypotheses based on the cost they incurred so far and a future cost estimate.
    For each stack, we only keep a beam of the best hypotheses.
