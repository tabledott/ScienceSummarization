    The purpose of this module is twofold: (1) to compensate for errors in the text parsing and Logic Form transformation phase, such as prepositional attachments and subject/object detection in verbs, (2) to detect correct answers when the NLP and XWN (Extended WordNet) axioms fail to provide all the necessary inferences.
    During the relaxation, arguments to predicates in the question are incrementally uncoupled, the proof score is reduced, and the justification is re-attempted.
    The loop between the Justification and the Relaxation modules continues until the proof succeeds, or the proof score is below a predefined threshold.
    When all the candidate answers are processed, the candidate answers are ranked based on their proof scores, with the output from COGEX being the ranked answers and the answer justifications.
  
  
    A text logic form (LF) is an intermediary step between syntactic parse and the deep semantic form.
    The LF codification acknowledges syntax-based relationships such as: (1)
