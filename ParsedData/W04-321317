From the set of target verbs, we derived an extended verb set that comprises all of the original target verbs as well as any verb that shares a class with one of those target verbs.
    This gives us a set of 1159 verbs to observe in total, and increases the likelihood that some verb class information is available for each of the possible classes of the target verbs.
    Observing the entire extended set also provides more data for our probability estimators that do not use verb class information.
    We have made several changes to the semantic roles as given by VerbNet.
    First, selectional restrictions such as [+Animate] are removed since our coarse model of noun class does not allow us to reliably determine whether such restrictions are met.
    Second, a few semantic distinctions that are made in VerbNet appeared to be too fine-grained to capture, so we map these to a more coarse-grained subset of the VerbNet roles.
    For instance, the role Actor is merged with Agent, and Patient with Theme.
