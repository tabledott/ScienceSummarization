vot-based method.
    Several variants of such adaptations are developed that generate candidate rephrasings driven by fluency, semantic equivalence, and authoring value, respectively.
    We also believe that a large-scale annual community-wide evaluation should become a trend since it is required to foster further research in, and use of, paraphrase extraction and generation.
    Although there have been recent workshops and tasks on paraphrasing and entailment as discussed in Section 5, this evaluation would be much more focused, providing sets of shared guidelines and resources, in the spirit of the recent NIST MT Evaluation Workshops (NIST 2009).
  
  
    Over the last two decades, there has been much research on paraphrase extraction and generation within a number of research communities in natural language processing, in order to improve the specific application with which that community is concerned.
    However, a large portion of this research can be easily adapted for more widespread use outside i
