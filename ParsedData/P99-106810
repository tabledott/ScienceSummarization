   'The level of significance (p &lt; .05) was the initial selection during algorithm development, and never changed.
    This, the unmatched-tokens threshold for prima facie rejection due to mismatches (20%), and the maximum distance between hyperlinks in the generaIn the preliminary evaluation, I generated a test set containing 90 English-Spanish candidate pairs, using the candidate generation stage as just described.
    I evaluated these candidates by hand, identifying 24 as true translation pairs.5 Of these 24, STRAND identified 15 as true translation pairs, for a recall of 62.5%.
    Perhaps more important, it only generated 2 additional translation pairs incorrectly, for a precision of 15/17 = 88.2%.
  
  
    In the original STRAND architecture, additional filtering stages were envisaged as possible (see Figure 1), including such languagedependent processes as automatic language identification and content-based comparison of structually aligned document segments using cognate matching or existing bili
