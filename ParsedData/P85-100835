    It would be easy enough in our framework to implement these approaches.
    We can define a function a of three arguments the entity, and the condition used to entity the sense, or intension, abstract corresponding to actual for that cognizer and Sentence would be represented, not as (16), but as A ri eel( , o( ES , J, J ,Q AEveninpS tari(Q , ES) tend to prefer to think of the value as abstract Whatever it is, it is necessary that the of J, Qi)be something different from the value Qs) where is, different objects must correspond to the condition of being Star and the condition of being the Morning It because of this feature that we escape the problem 67 intersubstitutivity of identicals, for substitution of (18) yields `... 41)) rather than A S, J, A , would be the representation of sentence (1$).
