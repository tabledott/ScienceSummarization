just as with the early proposals regarding segmentation, many of these proposals are based on fairly informal studies.
    It is only recently that attempts have been made to quantitatively evaluate how utterance features correlate with independently justified segmentations.
    Many of the studies discussed in the preceding subsection take this approach.
    The types of linguistic features investigated include prosody (Grosz and Hirschberg 1992; Nakatani, Hirschberg, and Grosz 1995; Hirschberg and Nakatani 1996; Swerts 1995; Swerts and Ostendorf 1995), term repetition (Hearst 1994), cue words (Moser and Moore 1995; Whittaker and Stenton 1988), and discourse anaphora (Walker and Whittaker 1990).
    Grosz and Hirschberg (1992) investigate the prosodic structuring of discourse.
    The correlation of various prosodic features with their independently obtained consensus codings of segmental structure (codings on which all labelers agreed) is analyzed using t-tests; the results support the hypothesis that disco
