    Table 4 summarizes the final test results, where our work performs the best in all four types of (unlabeled) accuracies: word, non-root, root, and complete match (all excluding punctuations).

    This work was inspired in part by Generalized LR parsing (Tomita, 1991) and the graph-structured stack (GSS).
    Tomita uses GSS for exhaustive LR parsing, where the GSS is equivalent to a dynamic programming chart in chart parsing (see Footnote 4).
    In fact, Tomita&#8217;s GLR is an instance of techniques for tabular simulation of nondeterministic pushdown automata based on deductive systems (Lang, 1974), which allow for cubictime exhaustive shift-reduce parsing with contextfree grammars (Billot and Lang, 1989).
    Our work advances this line of research in two aspects.
    First, ours is more general than GLR in 9Duan et al. (2007) and Zhang and Clark (2008) did not report word accuracies, but those can be recovered given nonroot and root ones, and the number of no
