d(r) = jB(r)j.
    Given a newly learned rule b that is to be applied to S, the goal is to identify the rules r for which at least one of the sets G (r) , B (r) is modified by the application of rule b.
    Obviously, if both sets are not modified when applying rule b, then the value of the objective function for rule r remains unchanged.
    2The algorithm was implemented by the the authors, following the description in Hepple (2000).
    The presentation is complicated by the fact that, in many NLP tasks, the samples are not independent.
    For instance, in POS tagging, a sample is dependent on the classification of the preceding and succeeding 2 samples (this assumes that there exists a natural ordering of the samples in S).
    Let V (s) denote the &amp;quot;vicinity&amp;quot; of a sample the set of samples on whose classification the sample s might depend on (for consistency, s 2 V (s)); if samples are independent, then V (s) = fsg.
    Let s be a sample on which the best rule b applies (i.e.
    [b (s)
