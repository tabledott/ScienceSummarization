nd earliest such efforts is the Penn Treebank (Marcus, Santorini, and Marcinkiewicz 1993; Marcus et al. 1994), which contains a one-million word subcorpus of Wall Street Journal text that has become the de facto standard training and test data for statistical parsers.
    Its annotation, which is based on generic phrasestructure grammar (with coindexed traces and other null elements indicating non-local dependencies) and function tags on nonterminal categories providing (a limited degree of) syntactic role information, is designed to facilitate the extraction of the underlying predicate&#8211;argument structure.
    Statistical parsing on the Penn Treebank has made great progress by focusing on the machine-learning or algorithmic aspects (Magerman 1994; Ratnaparkhi 1998; Collins 1999; Charniak 2000; Henderson 2004; McDonald, Crammer, and Pereira 2005).
    However, this has often resulted in parsing models and evaluation measures that are both based on reduced representations which simplify or ignore the ling
