 to compare the performance of the four algorithms under realistic conditions, thereby complementing the purely formal analysis presented so far.
    The purpose is not to produce state-of-the-art results for all algorithms on the data sets used, which would require extensive experimentation and optimization going well beyond the limits of this study.
    The data sets used are taken from the CoNLL-X shared task on multilingual dependency parsing (Buchholz and Marsi 2006).
    We have used all the available data sets, taken Data sets.
    Tok = number of tokens (&#215;1000); Sen = number of sentences (&#215;1000); T/S = tokens per sentence (mean); Lem = lemmatization present; CPoS = number of coarse-grained part-of-speech tags; PoS = number of (fine-grained) part-of-speech tags; MSF = number of morphosyntactic features (split into atoms); Dep = number of dependency types; NPT = proportion of non-projective dependencies/tokens (%); NPS = proportion of non-projective dependency graphs/sentences (%).
