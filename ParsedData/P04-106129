 direct connection to surface statistics.
    Our results here are just on the ungrounded induction of syntactic structure.
    Nonetheless, we see the investigation of what patterns can be recovered from corpora as important, both from a computational perspective and from a philosophical one.
    It demonstrates that the broad constituent and dependency structure of a language can be recovered quite successfully (individually or, more effectively, jointly) from a very modest amount of training data.

    This work also benefited from an enormous amount of useful feedback, from many audiences and individuals.
