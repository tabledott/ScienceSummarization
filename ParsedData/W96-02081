    Three general approaches are statistical, neural-network, and symbolic machine learning and numerous specific methods have been developed under each of these paradigms (Wermter, Riloff, &amp; Scheler, 1996; Charniak, 1993; Reilly &amp; Sharkey, 1992).
    An important question is whether some methods perform significantly better than others on particular types of problems.
    Unfortunately, there have been very few direct comparisons of alternative methods on identical test data.
    A somewhat indirect comparison of applying stochastic context-free grammars (Periera &amp; Shabes, 1992), a transformation-based method (Brill, 1993), and inductive logic programming (Zelle &amp; Mooney, 1994) to parsing the ATIS (Airline Travel Information Service) corpus from the Penn Treebank (Marcus, Santorini, &amp; Marcinkiewicz, 1993) indicates fairly similar performance for these three very different methods.
    Also, comparisons of Bayesian, informationretrieval, neural-network, and case-based methods on word-se
