ition of the Replace operator, with the generic &lt; and &gt; now representing the sets of all left and right identity brackets: This relation allows for any of the appropriate replacements separated by identity substrings.
    It is regular because of the union-closure property; this would not be the case, of course, if intersection or complementation had been required for its construction.
    A model of the left-to-right application optional application of a batch rule is obtained by substituting the new, more complex definitions in the composition cascade for ordinary rules with these application parameters: Optional right-to-left and simultaneous batch rules are modeled by similar substitutions in the corresponding ordinary-rule cascades.
    Obligatory applications are handled by combining instances of the Obligatory operator constructed independently for each subrule.
    Obligatory(/i', &lt;k, &gt;k) excludes all strings in which the kth subrule failed to apply, moving from left to right, when its con
