Rank generates an 100-words summary &#8212; the task undertaken by other systems participating in this single document summarization task.
    For evaluation, we are using the ROUGE evaluation toolkit, which is a method based on Ngram statistics, found to be highly correlated with human evaluations (Lin and Hovy, 2003).
    Two manually produced reference summaries are provided, and used in the evaluation process5.
    Fifteen different systems participated in this task, and we compare the performance of TextRank with the top five performing systems, as well as with the baseline proposed by the DUC evaluators &#8211; consisting of a 100-word summary constructed by taking the first sentences in each article.
    Table 2 shows the results obtained on this data set of 567 news articles, including the results for TextRank (shown in bold), the baseline, and the results of the top five performing systems in the DUC 2002 single document summarization task (DUC, 2002).
