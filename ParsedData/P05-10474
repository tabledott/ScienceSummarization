cular IE scenario are likely to contain further relevant patterns.
    This approach, which can be viewed as being document-centric, operates by associating confidence scores with patterns and relevance scores with documents.
    Initially seed patterns are given a maximum confidence score of 1 and all others a 0 score.
    Each document is given a relevance score based on the patterns which occur within it.
    Candidate patterns are ranked according to the proportion of relevant and irrelevant documents in which they occur, those found in relevant documents far more than in irrelevant ones are ranked highly.
    After new patterns have been accepted all patterns&#8217; confidence scores are updated, based on the documents in which they occur, and documents&#8217; relevance according to the accepted patterns they contain.
    This approach has been shown to successfully acquire useful extraction patterns which, when added to an IE system, improved its performance (Yangarber et al., 2000).
    However, it rel
