thdates, however it has low precision on generic ones like is-a and partof.
    Pantel et al. (2004) proposed a similar, highly scalable approach, based on an edit-distance technique, to learn lexico-POS patterns, showing both good performance and efficiency.
    Espresso uses a similar approach to infer patterns, but we make use of generic patterns and apply refining techniques to deal with wide variety of relations.
    Other pattern-based algorithms include (Riloff and Shepherd 1997), who used a semi-automatic method for discovering similar words using a few seed examples, KnowItAll (Etzioni et al. 2005) that performs large-scale extraction of facts from the Web, Mann (2002) who used part of speech patterns to extract a subset of is-a relations involving proper nouns, and (Downey et al.
    2005) who formalized the problem of relation extraction in a coherent and effective combinatorial model that is shown to outperform previous probabilistic frameworks.
    Clustering approaches have so far been applied o
