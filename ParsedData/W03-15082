 spoken by a speaker of the foreign language &#8212; a process referred to as transliteration.
    Therefore, if a mechanism were available to render, say, an English name in its phonemic form, and another mechanism were available to convert this phonemic string into the orthography of, say, Chinese, then one would have a mechanism for transliterating English names using Chinese characters.
    The first step has been addressed extensively, for other obvious reasons, in the automatic speech synthesis literature.
    This paper describes a statistical approach for the second step.
    Several techniques have been proposed in the recent past for name transliteration.
    Rather than providing a comprehensive survey we highlight a few representative approaches here.
    Finite state transducers that implement transformation rules for back-transliteration from Japanese to English have been described by Knight and Graehl (1997), and extended to Arabic by Glover-Stalls and Knight (1998).
    In both cases, the goal
