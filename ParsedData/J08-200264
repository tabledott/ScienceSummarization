summarizes the results for the local model in the same form.
    The biggest differences are in the performance on CORE arguments, which can be seen by comparing the confusion matrices in Figures 7(b) and 11(b).
    The F-Measure on each of the core argument labels has increased by at least three points: the F-Measure on ARG2 by 5.7 points, and the F-Measure on ARG3 by eight points.
    The confusions of core argument labels with NONE have gone down significantly, and also there is a large decrease in the confusions of NONE with ARG1.
    There is generally a slight increase in F-Measure on modifier labels as well, but the performance on some of the modifier labels has gone down.
    This makes sense because our joint features are targeted at capturing the dependencies among core arguments.
    There may be useful regularities for modifier arguments as well, but capturing them may require different joint feature templates.
