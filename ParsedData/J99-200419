hastic and rule-based approaches to supertag disambiguation.
    Percentage drop in the number of supertags with and without filtering for sentences of length 2 to 50 words.
  
  
    Before proceeding to discuss the various models for supertag disambiguation, we would like to trace the time course of development of this work.
    We do this not only to show the improvements made to the early work reported in our 1994 paper (Joshi and Srinivas 1994), but also to explain the rationale for choosing certain models of supertag disambiguation over others.
    We summarize the early work in the following subsection.
    As reported in Joshi and Srinivas (1994), we experimented with a trigram model as well as the dependency model for supertag disambiguation.
    The trigram model that was trained on (part-of-speech, supertag) pairs, instead of (words, supertag) pairs, collected from the LTAG derivations of 5,000 WSJ sentences and tested on 100 WSJ sentences produced a correct supertag for 68% of the words in the tes
