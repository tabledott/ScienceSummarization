dates to the Lagrange multipliers enforcing agreement between the two models.
    Our second example problem is the integration of a phrase-structure parser with a higher-order dependency parser.
    The goal is to add higher-order features to phrase-structure parsing without greatly increasing the complexity of inference.
    First, we define an index set for second-order unlabeled projective dependency parsing.
    The secondorder parser considers first-order dependencies, as well as grandparent and sibling second-order dependencies (e.g., see Carreras (2007)).
    We assume that Id,p is an index set containing all such dependencies (for brevity we omit the details of this index set).
    For convenience we define an extended index set that makes explicit use of first-order dependeny&#8712;Y z&#8712;Z Dual decomposition exploits this idea; it results in the algorithm given in figure 1.
    The algorithm optimizes the combined objective by repeatedly solving the two sub-problems separately&#8212;that is, it
