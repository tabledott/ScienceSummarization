ove, except for &#8220;c &#8221;, and &#8220;c &#8221; for which see Section 4.3.
    Results for the open tests are presented in Tables 9&#8211;12; again, see Section 4.3 for the explanation of &#8220;c &#8221;, and &#8220;c &#8221;.
    Let us assume that the recall rates for the various system represent the probability that a word will be successfully identified, and let us further assume that a binomial distribution is appropriate for this experiment.
    Given the Central Limit Theorem for Bernouilli trials &#8212; e.g.
    (Grinstead and Snell, 1997, page 330), then the 95% confidence interval is given as , where is the number of trials (words).
    The values for are given in Tables 5&#8211;12, under the heading &#8220;c &#8221;.
    They can be interpreted as follows: To decide whether two sites are significantly different (at the 95% confidence level) in their performance on a particular task, one just has to compute whether their confidence intervals overlap.
    Similarly one can treat the precisio
