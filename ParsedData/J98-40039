ctually grist for Japanese transliterators.
    For example, people rarely transliterate auxiliary verbs, but surnames are often transliterated.
    We have approximated such a model by removing high-frequency words like has, an, are, am, were, their, and does, plus unlikely words corresponding to Japanese sound bites, like coup and oh.
    We also built a separate word sequence model containing only English first and last names.
    If we know (from context) that the transliterated phrase is a personal name, this model is more precise.
    The next WFST converts English word sequences into English sound sequences.
    We use the English phoneme inventory from the on-line CMU Pronunciation Dictiofederal I 0.0013 nary, minus the stress marks.2 This gives a total of 40 sounds, including 14 vowel sounds (e.g., AA, AE, UW), 25 consonant sounds (e.g., K, HH, R), plus one special symbol (PAUSE).
    The dictionary has pronunciations for 110,000 words, and we organized a tree-based WFST from it: Note that we insert
