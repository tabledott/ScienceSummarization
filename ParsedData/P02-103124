at the preposition attaches to the predicate rather than to its direct object is not represented.
    In interpreting these results, it is important to keep in mind the differences between this task and other information extraction datasets.
    In comparison to the domain-specific relations evaluated by the Message Understanding Conference (MUC) tasks, we have a wider variety of relations but fewer training instances for each.
    The relations may themselves be less susceptible to finite state methods.
    For example, a named-entity system which indentifies corporation names can go a long way towards finding the &amp;quot;employment&amp;quot; relation of MUC, and similarly systems for tagging genes and proteins help a great deal for relations in the biomedical domain.
    Both Propbank and FrameNet tend to include longer arguments with internal syntactic structure, making parsing decisions more important in finding argument boundaries.
    They also involve abstract relations, with a wide variety of possib
