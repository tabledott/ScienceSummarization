 the parser, it would certainly improve the chances of arriving at a parse for a sentence.
    In fact, Table 7 presents the performance of the supertagger that selects, at most, the top three supertags for each word.
    The optimum number of supertags to output to balance the success rate of the parser against the efficiency of the parser must be determined empirically.
    A more serious limitation of this approach is that it fails to parse ill-formed and extragrammatical strings such as those encountered in spoken utterances and unrestricted texts.
    This is due to the fact that the Earley-style LTAG parser attempts to combine the supertags to construct a parse that spans the entire string.
    In cases where the supertag sequence for a string cannot be combined into a unified structure, the parser fails completely.
    One possible extension to account for ill-formed and extragrammatical strings is to extend the Earley parser to produce partial parses for the fragments whose supertags can be combined.
