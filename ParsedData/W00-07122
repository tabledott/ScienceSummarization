 morphology induction.
    Thus, in this paper, we show how to automatically induce morphological relationships between words.
    Previous morphology induction approaches (Goldsmith, 1997, 2000; Mean, 1998; Gaussier, 1999) have focused on inflectional languages and have used statistics of hypothesized stems and affixes to choose which affixes to consider legitimate.
    Several problems can arise using only stem-and-affix statistics: (1) valid affixes may be applied inappropriately (&amp;quot;ally&amp;quot; stemming to &amp;quot;all&amp;quot;), (2) morphological ambiguity may arise (&amp;quot;rating&amp;quot; conflating with &amp;quot;rat&amp;quot; instead of &amp;quot;rate&amp;quot;), and (3) non-productive affixes may get accidentally pruned (the relationship between &amp;quot;dirty&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;dirt&amp;quot; may be lost).1 Some of these problems could be resolved if one could incorporate word semantics.
    For instance, &amp;quot;all&amp;quot; is not semantically similar to &amp;quot;ally,&am
