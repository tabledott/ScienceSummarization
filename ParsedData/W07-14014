 introduced, on the one hand to make the challenge more stimulating and, on the other, to encourage collaboration between system developers.
    In particular, a limited number of longer texts, i.e. up to a paragraph in length, were incorporated in order to move toward more comprehensive scenarios, which incorporate the need for discourse analysis.
    However, the majority of examples remained similar to those in the previous challenges, providing pairs with relatively short texts.
    Another innovation was represented by a resource pool4, where contributors had the possibility to share the resources they used.
    In fact, one of the key conclusions at the second RTE Challenge Workshop was that entailment modeling requires vast knowledge resources that correspond to different types of entailment reasoning.
    Moreover, entailment systems also utilize general NLP tools such as POS taggers, parsers and named-entity recognizers, sometimes posing specialized requirements to such tools.
