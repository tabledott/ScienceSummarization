  The state transition probabilities and emission probabilities are estimated using maximum likelihood estimation with absolute smoothing, which was found to be effective in previous experiments, including Seymore et al. (1999).
    We experiment with two datasets of research paper content.
    One consists of the headers of research papers.
    The other consists of pre-segmented citations from the reference sections of research papers.
    These data sets have been used as standard benchmarks in several previous studies (Seymore et al., 1999; McCallum et al., 2000; Han et al., 2003).
    The header of a research paper is defined to be all of the words from the beginning of the paper up to either the first section of the paper, usually the introduction, or to the end of the first page, whichever occurs first.
    It contains 15 fields to be extracted: title, author, affiliation, address, note, email, date, abstract, introduction, phone, keywords, web, degree, publication number, and page (Seymore et al., 199
