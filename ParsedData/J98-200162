 we tested resulted in a very good agreement among annotators; and second, even the task of identifying the antecedent of discourse-related definite descriptions (i.e., coreferential and bridging) is problematic&#8212;we only obtained an acceptable agreement in the case of coreferential definite descriptions, and it was difficult for our annotators to choose a single antecedent for a definite description when both bridging and coreference were allowed.
    These results indicate that annotating corpora for anaphoric information may be more difficult than expected.
    The task of indicating a unique antecedent for bridging definite descriptions appears to be especially challenging, for the reasons discussed above (multiple equally good antecedents and referential underspecification, for example).
    On the positive side, we have two observations: our subjects did reasonably well at distinguishing fir&#167;t-mention from subsequent-mention antecedents, and at identifying the antecedent of a subsequent-mention
