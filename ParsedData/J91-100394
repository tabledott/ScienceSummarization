    These observations, I would argue, support the view that metonymy has primarily a referential function, allowing something to stand for something else &#8212; a connection between a concept and an aspect of another concept.
    The observations also support the view that metaphor's primary function is understanding, allowing something to be conceived of in terms of something else: the role of analogy is especially crucial to this function.
    The treatment of metonymy permits chains of metonymies (Reddy 1979), and allows metonymies to co-occur with instances of either literalness, metaphor, or anomaly.
    The kinds of inferences sought resemble the kinds of inferences that Yamanashi (1987) notes link sentences.
