    The phrase penalty feature counts the number of phrases produced, and can allow the model to prefer either short or long phrases.
    Phrases from Conventional Lexicon The baseline alignment template system makes use of the ChineseEnglish lexicon provided by LDC.
    Each lexicon entry is a potential phrase translation pair in the alignment template system.
    To score the use of these lexicon entries (which have no normal translation probability), this feature function counts the number of times such a lexicon entry is used.
    Additional Features A major advantage of the loglinear modeling approach is that it is easy to add new features.
    In this paper, we explore a variety of features based on successively deeper syntactic representations of the source and target sentences, and their alignment.
    For each of the new features discussed below, we added the feature value to the set of baseline features, re-estimated feature weights on development data, and obtained results on test data
