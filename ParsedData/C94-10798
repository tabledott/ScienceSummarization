			The parse trees of the input sentence can be retrieved h'om the parse forest one by one.
			The next section explains how tile constraints attached to the nodes and links in the network ensure that the parse trees satisfy all the prin- ciples.
			GB principles are implemented as local and percolation constraints on the items.
			Lo- cal constraints are attached to nodes in the network.
			All items at a node must satisfy the node's local constraint, l?ercolation con- straints are attached to the links in the net- work.
			A message can be sent across a link only if the item satisfies the percolation constraint of the link.
			We will only use two examples to give the reader a general idea about how GB principles are interpreted as loc, al and percolation con- straints.
			Interested reader is referred to Lin (1993) for more details.
