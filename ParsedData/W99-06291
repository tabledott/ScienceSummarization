 be enough to find only simple NPs and VPs in a sentence, for information extraction we might also want to find relations between constituents as for example the subject and object of a verb.
    In this paper we discuss some Memory-Based (MB) shallow parsing techniques to find labeled chunks and grammatical relations in a sentence.
    Several MB modules have been developed in previous work, such as: a POS tagger (Daelemans et al., 1996), a chunker (Veenstra, 1998; Tjong Kim Sang and Veenstra, 1999) and a grammatical relation (GR) assigner (Buchholz, 1998).
    The questions we will answer in this paper are: Can we reuse these modules in a cascade of classifiers?
    What is the effect of cascading?
    Will errors at a lower level percolate to higher modules?
    Recently, many people have looked at cascaded and/or shallow parsing and OR assignment.
    Abney (1991) is one of the first who proposed to split up parsing into several cascades.
    He suggests to first find the chunks and then the dependecies b
