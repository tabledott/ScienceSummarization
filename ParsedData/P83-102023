is always or never takes place.
    The position that we find most tenable, given the evidence, is that reanalysis sometimes takes place.
    (Of course, the fact that purely lexical accounts (see, e.g.
    (Bresnan 821) seem plausible leaves the older tree-building theories on not entirely untenable ground.)
    But how can any reanalysis at all be reconciled with the determinism hypothesis?
    Consider the analysis that a D-theory parser will have built up after having parsed &amp;quot;made a mess&amp;quot;, but before noticing &amp;quot;of&amp;quot;.
    At this point the parser should assign the sentence a non-idiomatic reading, with &amp;quot;a mess&amp;quot; the real object of &amp;quot;made&amp;quot;.
    Some of the predications in the analysis will be where vp 1 is a vp node dominating &amp;quot;made&amp;quot; and npl is an rip node dominating &amp;quot;a mess&amp;quot;.
    (Note that in (8.1) The children made a mess, but then cleaned it up.
    &amp;quot;it&amp;quot; refers to a mess, but that on
