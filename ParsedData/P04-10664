ng equation: Equation 1 gives the Model 1 estimate for the probability of a target sentence, given a source sentence.
    We may also be interested in the question of what is the most likely alignment of a source sentence and a target sentence, given an instance of Model 1; where, by an alignment, we mean a specification of which source words generated which target words according to the generative model.
    Since Model 1, like many other word-alignment models, requires each target word to be generated by exactly one source word (including the null word), an alignment a can be represented by a vector a1,... , am, where each aj is the sentence position of the source word generating tj according to the alignment.
    It is easy to show that for Model 1, the most likely alignment a&#710; of S and T is given by this equation: Since in applying Model 1, there are no dependencies between any of the ajs, we can find the most likely aligment simply by choosing, for each j, the value for aj that leads to the highest
