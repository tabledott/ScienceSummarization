f the WSJ part of the Penn II treebank, evaluating against the PARC 700 and DCU 105 respectively.
			The paper is structured as follows: we give a brief introduction to LFG.
			We outline the automatic f-structure annotation algorithm, PCFG-based LFG grammar approximations and parsing architecturesof (Cahill et al, 2002).
			We present our subcategorisation frame extraction and introduce the treebank based acquisition of finite approximations of LFG functional uncertainty equations in terms of LDD paths.
			We present the f-structure LDD resolution algorithm, provide results and extensive evaluation.We compare our method with previous work.
			Fi nally, we conclude.
	
	
			Lexical-Functional Grammar (Kaplan and Bres nan, 1982; Dalrymple, 2001) minimally involves two levels of syntactic representation:3 c-structure and f-structure.
			C(onstituent)-structure represents the grouping of words and phrases into largerconstituents and is realised in terms of a CF PSG grammar.
			F(unctional)-structure represents ab
