sterior probability of each n-gram is computed.
    A new automaton is then created by intersecting each ngram with weight (from Equation 2) to an unweighted lattice.
    Finally, the MBR hypothesis is extracted as the best path in the automaton.
    We will refer to this procedure as FSAMBR.
    The above steps are carried out one n-gram at a time.
    For a moderately large lattice, there can be several thousands of n-grams and the procedure becomes expensive.
    We now present an alternate approximate procedure which can avoid this where the posterior probability of an n-gram in the lattice is given by enumeration making the resulting algorithm much faster than FSAMBR.
    The key idea behind this new algorithm is to rewrite the n-gram posterior probability (Equation 4) as follows: where f(e, w, E) is a score assigned to edge e on path E containing n-gram w: { 1 w &#8712; e,p(e|G) &gt; p(e'|G), e' precedes e on E 0 otherwise In other words, for each path E, we count the edge that contributes n-gram w and
