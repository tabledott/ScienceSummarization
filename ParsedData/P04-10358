  And we could also simultaneously use knowledgelean methods to assign the association scores.
    Interestingly, Yu and Hatzivassiloglou (2003) compared an individual-preference classifier against a relationship-based method, but didn&#8217;t combine the two; the ability to coordinate such algorithms is precisely one of the strengths of our approach.
    But a crucial advantage specific to the utilization of a minimum-cut-based approach is that we can use maximumfflow algorithms with polynomial asymptotic running times &#8212; and near-linear running times in practice &#8212; to exactly compute the minimumcost cut(s), despite the apparent intractability of the optimization problem (Cormen, Leiserson, and Rivest, 1990; Ahuja, Magnanti, and Orlin, 1993).2 In contrast, other graph-partitioning problems that have been previously used to formulate NLP classification problems3 are NP-complete (Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown, 1997; Agrawal et al., 2003; Joachims, 2003).
