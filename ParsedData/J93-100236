 is distinct from the nonterminal one, so the procedure described above will not deal properly with a unification grammar rule whose mother category is assumed elsewhere in the grammar to be a lexical category.
    The modification we make is to automatically associate two different atomic categories, one terminal and one nonterminal, with such categories, and to augment the backbone grammar with a unary rule expanding the nonterminal category to the terminal.
    Two other aspects of the ANLT grammar formalism require further minor elaborations to the basic algorithm: firstly, a rule may introduce a gap by including the feature specification [NULL +] on the gapped daughter&#8212;for each such daughter an extra rule is added to the backbone grammar expanding the gap category to the null string; secondly, the formalism allows Kleene star and plus operators (Gazdar et al. 1985)&#8212; in the ANLT grammar these operators are utilized in rules for coordination.
    A rule containing Kleene star daughters is treat
