d directly to single unification grammar rules.
    At choice points, reductions involving these rules are not presented to the user; instead the system applies the reductions automatically, proceeding until the next shift action or choice point is reached, including these options in those presented to the user.
    The final set of measures taken to reduce the amount of interaction required with the user is to ask if the phrase being parsed contains one or more gaps or instances of coordination before presenting choices involving either of these phenomena, blocking consideration of rules on the basis of the presence of particular feature-value pairs.
    Figure 7 shows the system parsing a phrase with a four-choice lookahead.
    The resulting parse tree is displayed with category aliases substituted for the actual complex categories.
    The requests for manual selection of the analysis path are displayed to the analyst in as terse a manner as possible, and require knowledge of the ANLT grammar and lexicon
