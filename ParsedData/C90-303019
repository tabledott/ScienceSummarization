  This may be 4 171 compared to traditional grammar book statements such as "the syntactic functions of nou ns are subject, object, indirect object .... ".
  CG contains one enrichment of this scheme.
  A mapping statement may be constrained by the con- text condition mechanism specified in section 5.
  Thus, a mapping statement is a triple &lt;morphologi- cal feature(s), context condition(s), syntactic func- tion(s)&gt;.
  The first element is a feature string occurring in a morphological reading, the second is either NIL (no conditions) or a list of sublists each of which is a legal context condition.
  Finally the requi- site grammatical function label(s) are listed.
  Here are some mapping statements without context condi- tions, providing a maximal set of labels: ("PRON GEN" NIL GN&gt; @PCOMPL-S @ PCOM PL-O) ("A" NIL AN&gt; @PCOMPL-S @PCOMPL-O @SUBJ @OBJ @I-OBJ) ("N NOM" NIL @SUBJ @OBJ @I-OBJ @PCOMPL-S @PCOMPL-O @APP @NN&gt; @&lt;P) A pronoun in the genitive case is either prenominal genitival modifier,
