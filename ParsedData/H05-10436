it product features (E).
			OPINE?s Feature As sessor and its use of Web PMI statistics are vital for the extraction of high-quality features (see 3.2).
			OPINE then identifies opinion phrases associated with features in Eand finds their polarity.
			OPINE?s novel use of relaxationlabeling techniques for determining the semantic orien tation of potential opinion words in the context of given features and sentences leads to high precision and recall on the tasks of opinion phrase extraction and opinion phrase polarity extraction (see 3.3).In this paper, we only focus on the extraction of explicit features, identifying corresponding customer opin ions about these features and determining their polarity.We omit the descriptions of the opinion clustering, im plicit feature generation and opinion ranking algorithms.
