pect that this solution will simply lower, somewhat, both the baseline and the tagger performance.
    Finally, we adopted a beginning (B) and continuation of entity (I) plus no label (0), encoding; i.e., the actual class space defines 83 labels.
    The supersense tagger was trained on the Semcor datasets SEM and SEMv.
    The only free parameter to set in evaluation is the number of iterations to perform T (cf.
    Algorithm 1).
    We evaluated the model&#8217;s accuracy on Semcor by splitting the SEM data randomly in training, development and evaluation.
    In a 5-fold cross-validation setup the tagger was trained on 4/5 of the SEM data, the remaining data was split in two halves, one used to fix T the other for evaluating performance on test.
    The full SEMv data was always added to the training portion of SEM.
    We also evaluated the model on the Senseval-3 data, using the same value for T set by cross-validation on the SEM data5.
    The ordering of the training instances is randomized across diff
