speech tagged using Brill's transformation-based learning tagger (Brill, 1995).
    The tags assigned by the Brill tagger were manually mapped onto the simpler part-of-speech tag set used in LDOCE.2 If a word has more than one homograph with the same part of speech, then part-of-speech tags alone cannot always identify a single homograph; in such cases we chose the first sense listed in LDOCE since this is the one which occurs most frequently.3 It was found that 87.4% of the polyhomographic content words were assigned the correct homograph.
    A baseline for this task can be calculated by computing the number of tokens that would be correctly disambiguated if the first homograph for each was chosen regardless of part of speech.
    78% of polyhomographic tokens were correctly disambiguated this way using this approach.
    These results show there is a clear advantage to be gained (over 42% reduction in error rate) by using the very simple part-of-speech&#8212;based method described compared with simply choo
