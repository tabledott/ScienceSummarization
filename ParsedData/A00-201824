re 3.
    Note that the subordinate vp has a vp parent.
    Thus np and vp parents of constituents are marked to indicate if the parents are a coordinate structure.
    A vp coordinate structure is defined here as a constituent with two or more vp children, one or more of the constituents comma, cc, conjp (conjunctive phrase), and nothing else; coordinate np phrases are defined similarly.
    Something very much like this is done in [15].
    As shown in Figure 2, conditioning on this information gives a 0.6% improvement.
    We believe that this is mostly due to improvements in guessing the sub-constituent's pre-terminal and head.
    Given we are already at the 88% level of accuracy, we judge a 0.6% improvement to be very much worth while.
    Next we add the less obvious conditioning events noted in our previous discussion of the final model &#8212; grandparent label lg and left sibling label /b.
    When we do so using our maximum-entropy-inspired conditioning, we get another 0.45% improvement in average
