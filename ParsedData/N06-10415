ements into topical sections (see figure 1(c)).
    Labels in this domain tend to be &#8220;sticky&#8221; in that the correct annotation tends to consist of multi-element fields of the same label.
    The overall approach of Grenager et al. (2005) typifies the process involved in fully unsupervised learning on new domain: they first alter the structure of their HMM so that diagonal transitions are preferred, then modify the transition structure to explicitly model boundary tokens, and so on.
    Given enough refinement set of the CLASSIFIEDS data.
    The BOUNDARY field is not present in the original annotation, but added to model boundaries (see Section 5.3).
    The starred tokens are the results of collapsing of basic entities during pre-processing as is done in (Grenager et al., 2005) ments the model learns to segment with a reasonable match to the target structure.
    In section 5.3, we discuss an approach to this task which does not require customization of model structure, but rather centers on featur
