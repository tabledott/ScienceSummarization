eir increases on the opinion piece data.
    Similarly, the precision increases of the ADJpses on the subjective-element data are as good as or better than the performance of this set of PSEs on the opinion piece data.
    Finally, the precisions increases for the ADJpses are higher than for the VERBpses on all data sets.
    This is again consistent with the higher performance of the ADJpses sets in the opinion piece data sets.
  
  
    In this section, we examine the various types of clues used together.
    In preparation for this work, all instances in OP1 and OP2 of all of the PSEs identified as described in Section 3 have been automatically identified.
    All training to define the PSE instances in OP1 was performed on data separate from OP1, and all training to define the PSE instances in OP2 was performed on data separate from OP2.
    Table 9 summarizes the results from previous sections in which the opinion piece data are used for testing.
    The performance of the various features is consistentl
