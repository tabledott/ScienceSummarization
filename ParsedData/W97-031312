: On a scale of 0 to 5, rate each word's strength of association with the given category using the following criteria.
    We'll use the category ANIMAL as an example.
    5: CORE MEMBER OF THE CATEGORY: If a word is clearly a member of the category, then it deserves a 5.
    For example, dogs and sparrows are members of the ANIMAL category.
  
  
    If a word refers to a part of something that is a member of the category, then it deserves a 4.
    For example, feathers and tails are parts of ANIMALS.
  
  
    If a word refers to something that is strongly associated with members of the category, but is not actually a member of the category itself, then it deserves a 3.
    For example, zoos and nests are strongly associated with ANIMALS.
  
  
    If a word refers to something that can be associated with members of the category, but is also associated with many other types of things, then it deserves a 2.
    For example, bowls and parks are weakly associated with ANIMALS.
