ition, are less likely than syntactic parses to obey clearly nested hierarchical composition rules.
    Moreover, the semantic parses are less likely to share an exactly isomorphic structure across the input and output languages, since the raison d&#8217;&#234;tre of semantic parsing is to capture semantic frame and role regularities independent of syntactic variation &#8211; monolingually and cross-lingually.
    This makes it difficult to incorporate semantic parsing into SMT merely by applying the sort of dynamic programming techniques found in current syntactic and tree-structured SMT models, most of which rely on being able to factor the computation into independent computations on the subtrees.
    In other words, the key computational obstacle is that the semantic parse of a larger string (or string pair, in the case of translation) is not in general strictly mechanically composable from the semantic parses of its smaller substrings (or substring pairs).
    In fact, the lack of easy compositionality i
