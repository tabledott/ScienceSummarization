the basis for determining discourse structure.
    What is essential for discourse structure is that such intentions bear certain kinds of structural relationships to one another.
    Since the CPs can never know the whole set of intentions that might serve as DP/DSPs, what they must recognize is the relevant structural relationships among intentions.
    Although there is an infinite number of intentions, there are only a small number of relations relevant to discourse structure that can hold between them.
    In this paper we distinguish between the determination of the DSP and the recognition of it.
    We use the term determination to refer to a semantic-like notion, namely, the complete specification of what is intended by whom; we use the term recognition to refer to a processing notion, namely, the processing that leads a discourse participant to identify what the intention is.
    These are obviously related concepts; the same information that determines a DSP may be used by an OCP to recognize it.
