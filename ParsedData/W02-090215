have carried out to test the methods just outlined. quent German and English words and their translations.
    We are trying to build a one-to-one GermanEnglish translation lexicon for the use in a machine translation system.
    To evaluate this performance we use two different measurements: Firstly, we record how many correct word-pairs we have constructed.
    This is done by checking the generated wordpairs against an existing bilingual lexicon.4 In essence, we try to recreate this lexicon, which contains 9,206 distinct German and 10,645 distinct English nouns and 19,782 lexicon entries.
    For a machine translation system, it is often more important to get more frequently used words right than obscure ones.
    Thus, our second evaluation measurement tests the word translations proposed by the acquired lexicon against the actual word-level translations in a 5,000 sentence aligned parallel corpus.5 The starting point to extending the lexicon is the seed lexicon of identically spelled words, as described
