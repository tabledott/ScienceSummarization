 of brevity only representative samples of CorMet&#8217;s data are shown.
    See Mason (2002) for a more detailed account.
    CorMet&#8217;s inputs are two domain sets of characteristic keywords for each domain (Table 4).
    The keywords must characterize a cluster in the space of Internet documents, but CorMet is relatively insensitive to the particular keywords.
    It is difficult to find keywords characterizing a cluster centering on money alone, so keywords for a more general domain, FINANCE, are provided.
    It is also difficult to characterize a cluster of documents mostly about liquids.
    Chemical-engineering articles and hydrographic encyclopedias tend to pertain to the highly technical aspects of liquids instead of their everyday behavior.
    Documents related to laboratory work are targeted on the theory that most references to liquids in a corpus dedicated to the manipulation and transformation of different states of matter are likely to be literal and will not necessarily be highly technic
