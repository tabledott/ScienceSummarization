			This is covered by three numerical features measuring the length of the text, of the hypothesis and the relative length of hypothesis with regard to the text.
	
	
			3.1 Semantic Interpretation.
			We use a robust wide-coverage CCG-parser (Bos etal., 2004) to generate fine-grained semantic representations for each T/H-pair.
			The semantic representation language is a first-order fragment of the DRS language used in Discourse Representation Theory(Kamp and Reyle, 1993), conveying argument struc ture with a neo-Davidsonian analysis and includingthe recursive DRS structure to cover negation, dis junction, and implication.
			Consider for example: Example: 78 (FALSE) T: Clinton?s new book is not big seller here.
			H: Clinton?s book is a big seller.
			drs(T): x1 x2 x3 book(x1) book(x2) ? x1=x2 clinton(x3) of(x1,x3) ? e4 x5 big(x5) seller(x5) be(e4) agent(e4,x1) patient(e4,x5) loc(e4,here) drs(H): x1 x2 e3 x4 book(x1) clinton(x2) of(x1,x2) big(x4) seller(x4) be(e3) agent(e3,x1) p
