1.3 Consequences for Processing Theories.
    Given that first-mention definite descriptions are so numerous, and that recognizing them does not depend on commonsense knowledge alone, we conclude that any general theory of definite description interpretation should include methods for recognizing such definites.
    The architecture of our own classifier (see below) is also consistent with Fraurud's hypothesis that these methods are not just used when no suitable antecedent can be found, but more extensive investigations will be needed before we can conclude that this architecture significantly outperforms other ones.
    The presence of such a large number of discourse-new definite descriptions is also problematic for the idea that definite descriptions are interpreted with respect to the global focus (Grosz 1977; Grosz and Sidner 1986).
    A significant percentage of the larger situation definite descriptions encountered in our corpus cannot be said to be in the global focus in any significant sense: as we
