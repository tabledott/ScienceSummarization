    A preposition is the head of a PP, a noun of an NP and so on.
    Defining relations to hold between heads means that the algorithm can, for example, find a subject relation between a noun and a verb without necessarily having to make decisions about the precise boundaries of the subject NP.
    Suppose we had the POS-tagged sentence shown in Figure 1 and we wanted the algorithm to decide whether, and if so how, Miller (henceforth: the focus) is related to the first verb organized.
    We then construct an instance for this pair of words by extracting a set of feature values from the sentence.
    The instance contains information about the verb and the focus: a feature for the word form and a feature for the POS of both.
    It also has similar features for the local context of the focus.
    Experiments on the training data suggest an optimal context width of two elements to the left and one to the right.
    In the present case, elements are w
