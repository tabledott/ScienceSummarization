n the corpus of interest.
    In practice, all we can do is assign weights by a rough, intuitive sense of semantic contribution, and refine them by successive approximation on a representative sample of the corpus.
    One would think that since we are deriving the logical form of the sentence, rather than determining what can be inferred from the logical form of the sentence, we could not use superset information in processing the sentence.
    That is, since we are back-chaining from the propositions in the logical form, the fact that, say, lube oil is a fluid, which would be expressed as (5) (V x)lube-oil(x) D fluid(x) could not play a role in the analysis.
    Thus, in the text Flow obstructed.
    Metal particles in lube oil filter. we know from the first sentence that there is a fluid.
    We would like to identify it with the lube oil mentioned in the second sentence.
    In interpreting the second sentence, we must prove the expression (3 x)lube-oil(x) If we had as an axiom (V x)fluid(x) D lube-oil(x)
