    The VSM was evaluated on a set of 374 SAT questions, achieving a score of 47%.
    In contrast with the corpus-based approach of Turney and Littman (2005), Veale (2004) applied a lexicon-based approach to the same 374 SAT questions, attaining a score of 43%.
    Veale evaluated the quality of a candidate analogy A:B::C:D by looking for paths in WordNet, joining A to B and C to D. The quality measure was based on the similarity between the A:B paths and the C:D paths.
    Turney (2005) introduced Latent Relational Analysis (LRA), an enhanced version of the VSM approach, which reached 56% on the 374 SAT questions.
    Here we go beyond Turney (2005) by describing LRA in more detail, performing more extensive experiments, and analyzing the algorithm and related work in more depth.
    French (2002) cites Structure Mapping Theory (SMT) (Gentner 1983) and its implementation in the Structure Mapping Engine (SME) (Falkenhainer, Forbus, and Gentner 1989) as the most influential work on modeling of analogy making
