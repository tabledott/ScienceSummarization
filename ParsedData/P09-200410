 10% absolute improvement over those obtained by Marcu (2000) in his corpus-based approach which achieves an f-score of 84.9%3 for identifying discourse connectives in text.
    While bearing in mind that the evaluations were done on different corpora and so are not directly comparable, as well as that our results would likely drop slightly if an automatic parser was used instead of the gold-standard parses, syntactic features prove highly beneficial for discourse vs. non-discourse usage prediction, as expected.
  
  
    While most connectives almost always occur with just one of the senses (for example, because is almost always a Contingency), a few are quite ambiguous.
    For example since is often a Temporal relation, but also often indicates Contingency.
    After developing syntactic features for the discourse versus non-discourse usage task, we investigated whether these same features would be useful for sense disambiguation.
    Experiments and results We do classification between the four senses for
