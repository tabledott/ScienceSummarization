    Some statistics about this correlation were reported by Fraurud (1990): she found that in her corpus 75% of complex definite NPs (i.e., modified by genitives, postposed PPs, restrictive adjectival modifiers) were first-mention.
    A great number of definite descriptions with restrictive postmodifiers are unfamiliar in our corpus as well (Poesio and Vieira 1998); in fact, restrictive postmodification was found to be the single most frequent feature of first-mention descriptions.
    Constructions of this type are good indicators of discourse novelty because a restrictive poshnodifier may license the use of a definite description either by providing a link to the rest of the discourse (as in Prince's &amp;quot;containing inferrables&amp;quot;) or by making the description into a functional concept.
    Looking for restrictive postmodifiers might therefore be a good way of identifying discourse-new descriptions.
    The distribution of restrictive postmodifiers in our corpus is shown in Table 3;
