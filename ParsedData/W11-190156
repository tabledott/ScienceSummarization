sier for the systems to generate better entities given gold mentions.
    Although, ideally, one would expect a perfect mention detection score, it is the case that one of the two systems &#8211; lee &#8211; did not get a 100% Recall.
    This could possibly be owing to unlinked singletons that were removed in post-processing.
    The lee system developers also ran a further experiment where both gold mentions for the elements of the coreference chains and also gold annotations for all the other layers were available to the system.
    Surprisingly, the improvement in coreference performance from having gold annotation of the other layers was almost negligible.
    This suggests that either: i) the automatic models are predicting those layers well enough that switching to gold doesn&#8217;t make much difference; ii) information from the other layers does not provide much leverage for coreference resolution; or iii) current coreference models are not capable of utilizing the information from these other layers
