ve been developed for English and trained on the Penn Treebank (Marcus et al., 1993), which raises the question whether these models generalize to other languages, and to annotation schemes that differ from the Penn Treebank markup.
    The present paper addresses this question by proposing a probabilistic parsing model trained on Negra (Skut et al., 1997), a syntactically annotated corpus for German.
    German has a number of syntactic properties that set it apart from English, and the Negra annotation scheme differs in important respects from the Penn Treebank markup.
    While Negra has been used to build probabilistic chunkers (Becker and Frank, 2002; Skut and Brants, 1998), the research reported in this paper is the first attempt to develop a probabilistic full parsing model for German trained on a treebank (to our knowledge).
    Lexicalization can increase parsing performance dramatically for English (Carroll and Rooth, 1998; Charniak, 1997, 2000; Collins, 1997), and the lexicalized model proposed by
