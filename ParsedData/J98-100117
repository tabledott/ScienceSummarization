    Preference semantics specifies selectional restrictions for combinations of lexical items in a sentence that can be relaxed when a word with the preferred restrictions does not appear, thus enabling, especially, the handling of metaphor (as in My car drinks gasoline, where the restrictions on drink prefer an animate subject but allow an inanimate one).
    Boguraev (1979) shows that preference semantics is inadequate to deal with polysemous verbs and attempts to improve on Wilks' method by using a combination of evidence, including selectional restrictions, preferences, case frames, etc.
    He integrates semantic disambiguation with structural disambiguation to enable judgments about the semantic coherence of a given sense assignment.
    Like many other systems of the era, these systems are sentencebased and do not account for phenomena at other levels of discourse, such as topical and domain information.
    The result is that some kinds of disambiguation are difficult or impossible to accomplish.
