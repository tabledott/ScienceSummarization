re the following: [1] The MT output is incomprehensible, with little or no information transferred accurately.
    It cannot be edited, needs to be translated from scratch.
    Providing reliable effort estimates turned out to be a difficult task for the PE-effort judges, even in the current set-up (with post edited outputs available for consultation).
    To eliminate some of the noise from these judgments, we performed an intermediate cleaning step, in which we eliminated the sentences for which the difference between the maximum score and the minimum score assigned between the three judges was &gt; 1.

    Besides score disagreement, we noticed another trend on the human judgements of PE-effort.
    Some judges tend to give more moderate scores (in the middle of available range), while others
