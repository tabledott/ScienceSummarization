-tree [NP [CD 200] [JJ domestic] [E1-PER ...]] of T1 is kept in T2.
    By comparing the performance of T1 and T2, we can evaluate the effect of sub-trees with partial production rules as shown in T2 and the necessity of keeping the whole left and right context sub-trees as shown in T1 in relation extraction.
    T3 is CPT, where the two sub-trees circled by dashed lines are included as the context to T2 and make T3 context-sensitive.
    This is to evaluate whether the limited context information in CPT can boost performance.
    FPT in T4 is formed by removing the two circled nodes in T2.
    This is to study whether and how the elimination of single non-terminal nodes affects the performance of relation extraction. fits to 200 domestic partners of their own workers in New York&#8221;, where the phrase type &#8220;E1-PER&#8221; denotes that the current node is the 1st entity with type &#8220;PERSON&#8221;, and likewise for the others.
    The relation instance is excerpted from the ACE 2003 corpus, where a
