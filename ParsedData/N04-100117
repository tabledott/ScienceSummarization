    This section introduces a novel statistical approach to entity tracking.
    We choose to model the process of forming entities from mentions, one step at a time.
    The process works from left to right: it starts with an initial entity consisting of the first mention of a document, and the next mention is processed by either linking it with one of the existing entities, or starting a new entity.
    The process could have as output any one of the possible partitions of the mention set.8 Two separate models are used to score the linking and starting actions, respectively.
    Formally, let be mentions in a document.
    Let be the map from mention index to entity index.
    For a mention index , l
