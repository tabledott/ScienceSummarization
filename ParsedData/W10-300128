is due to the practical importance of the task for (principally biomedical) applications and because it addresses several open research questions.
    Although several approaches were introduced by the participants of the shared task and we believe that the ideas described in this proceedings can serve as an excellent starting point for the development of an uncertainty detector, there is a lot of room for improving such systems.
    The manually annotated datasets and software tools developed for the shared task may act as benchmarks for these future experiments (they are freely available at http://www.inf. u-szeged.hu/rgai/conll2010st).
