ince the lack of semantic information in the trees prohibits us from assessing the quality of the resulting sentences.
    In fact, our early experimentation with generation from constituent phrases (e.g., NPs, VPs) demonstrated that it was difficult to ensure that semantically anomalous or ungrammatical sentences would not be generated.
    Instead, we select a combination already present in the input sentences as a basis and transform it into a fusion sentence by removing extraneous information and augmenting the fusion sentence with information from other sentences.
    The advantage of this strategy is that, when the initial sentence is semantically correct and the applied transformations aim to preserve semantic correctness, the resulting sentence is a semantically correct one.
    Our generation strategy is reminiscent of Robin and McKeown&#8217;s (1996) earlier work on revision for summarization, although Robin and McKeown used a three-tiered representation of each sentence, including its semantics and
