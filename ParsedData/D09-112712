   Here the stack tops are st = Bill, st&#8722;1 = saw, and the queue head is wi = with; underlined texts mark the source and target spans being considered, and wavy underlines mark the allowed spans (Tab.
    3).
    Red bold alignment links violate contiguity constraints.
  
  
    As suggested in Section 2.2, shift-reduce conflicts are the central problem we need to address here.
    Our intuition is, whenever we face a decision whether to combine the stack tops st&#8722;1 and st or to shift the current word wi, we will consult the other language, where the word-alignment information would hopefully provide a preference, as in the running example of PP-attachment (see Figure 1).
    We now develop this idea into bilingual contiguity features.
    Informally, if the correct decision is a reduction, then it is likely that the corresponding words of st&#8722;1 and st on the target-side should also form a contiguous span.
    For example, in Figure 3(a), the source span of a reduction is [saw .. Bill], which m
