ch constituent in the parse tree, and the predicate p: We break the probability estimation into two parts, the first being the probability P(riIFi, p) of a constituent&#8217;s role given our five features for the consituent, and the predicate p. Due to the sparsity of the data, it is not possible to estimate this probability from the counts in the training data.
    Instead, probabilities are estimated from various subsets of the features, and interpolated as a linear combination of the resulting distributions.
    The interpolation is performed over the most specific distributions for which data are available, which can be thought of as choosing the topmost distributions available from a backoff lattice, shown in Figure 3.
    The probabilities P(ri|Fi, p) are combined with the probabilities P({r1..n}|p) for a set of roles appearing in a sentence given a predicate, using the following formula: This approach, described in more detail in Gildea and Jurafsky (2002), allows interaction between the role assignmen
