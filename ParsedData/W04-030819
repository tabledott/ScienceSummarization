ts dependents, whereas bottomup construction means that a dependent is attached to its head before the head is attached to its head.
    However, top-down construction of dependency graphs does not involve the prediction of lower nodes from higher nodes, since all nodes are given by the input string.
    Hence, in terms of what drives the parsing process, all algorithms discussed here correspond to bottom-up algorithms in context-free parsing.
    It is interesting to note that if we recast the problem of dependency parsing as context-free parsing with a CNF grammar, then the problematic structures (1), (6&#8211;7) in Figure 4 all correspond to rightbranching structures, and it is well-known that bottom-up parsers may require an unbounded amount of memory in order to process rightbranching structure (Miller and Chomsky, 1963; Abney and Johnson, 1991).
    Moreover, if we analyze the two algorithms discussed here in the framework of Abney and Johnson (1991), they do not differ at all as to the order in which n
