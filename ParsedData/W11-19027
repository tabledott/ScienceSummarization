uster id, our model will attempt to resolve only m2 and m4.
    Furthermore, we discard first mentions that start with indefinite pronouns (e.g., some, other) or indefinite articles (e.g., a, an) if they have no antecedents that have the exact same string extents.
    For each selected mention mi, all previous mentions mi&#8722;1, ... , m1 become antecedent candidates.
    All sieves traverse the candidate list until they find a coreferent antecedent according to their criteria or reach the end of the list.
    Crucially, when comparing two mentions, our approach uses information from the entire clusters that contain these mentions instead of using just information local to the corresponding mentions.
    Specifically, mentions in a cluster share their attributes (e.g., number, gender, animacy) between them so coreference decision are better informed.
    For example, if a cluster contains two mentions: a group of students, which is singular, and five students, which is plural, the number attribute of the ent
