   Clearly, the figure is dependent on the state of the AST (e.g. lower similarities become more acceptable as the AST becomes more and more narrow), but the thresholds relevant to our algorithm can be precomputed at compile-time.
    The figure shown would be appropriate to pass 3 in our experiment.
    In the formula used, there are a few reasonable simplifications concerning the nature of the AST; however, a Monte-Carlo simulation that is exactly in accordance with our algorithm confirmed the depicted figure in every essential detail.
    7 This discussion could also be cast in an information theoretic framework using the notion of &amp;quot;mutual information&amp;quot; (Fano 1961), estimating the variance of the degree of match in order to find a frequency-threshold (see Church and Hanks 1990).
    Likelihood that a word pair is a spurious match as a function of a word's frequency and its similarity with a word in the other text (maximum 0.94). associations are added to the ones inherited from the precedi
