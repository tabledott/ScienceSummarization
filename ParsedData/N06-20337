ill (1999) proposed two parser combination schemes, one that picks an entire tree from one of the parsers, and one that, like ours, builds a new tree from constituents from the initial trees.
    The latter scheme performed better, producing remarkable results despite its simplicity.
    The combination is done with a simple majority vote of whether or not constituents should appear in the combined tree.
    In other words, if a constituent appears at least (m + 1)/2 times in the output of the m parsers, the constituent is added to the final tree.
    This simple vote resulted in trees with f-score significantly higher than the one of the best parser in the combination.
    However, the scheme heavily favors precision over recall.
    Their results on WSJ section 23 were 92.1 precision and 89.2 recall (90.61 f-score), well above the most accurate parser in their experiments (88.6 f-score).
  
  
    In our dependency parsing experiments we used unlabeled dependencies extracted from the Penn Treebank using the
