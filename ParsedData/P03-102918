 lessen the significance of too general patterns.
    The detailed analysis of the experiment revealed that the overly-general patterns are more severely penalized in the Subtree model compared to the Chain model.
    Although both models penalize general patterns in the same way, the Subtree model also promotes more scenario-specific patterns than the Chain model.
    In Figure 3, the large drop was caused by the pattern (( C-DATE -ON) C-POST ), which was mainly used to describe the date of appointment to the C-POST in the list of one&#8217;s professional history (which is not regarded as a Succession event), but also used in other scenarios in the business domain (18% precision by itself).
    Although the scoring function described in Section 3.3 is the same for both models, the Subtree model can also produce contributing patterns, such as (( C-PERSON C-POST -SBJ)( C-POST -TO) shuninsuru) &#8220; C-PERSON C-POST was appointed to C-POST &#8221; whose ranks were higher than the problematic pattern.
