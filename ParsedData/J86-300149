   In general, however, for any fragment, task-oriented or otherwise, this is not necessary.
    It is essential to notice that the intentional structure is neither identical to nor isomorphic to a general plan for removing the flywheel.
    It is not identical because a plan encompasses more than a collection of intentions and relationships between them (compare Pollack's (1986) critique of Al planning formalisms as the basis for inferring intentions in discourse).
    It is not isomorphic because the intentional structure has a different substructure from the general plan for removing the flywheel.
    In addition to the intentions arising from steps in the plan, the intentional structure typically contains DSPs corresponding to intentions generated by the particular execution of the task and the dialogue.
    For example, the general plan for the disassembly of a flywheel includes subplans for loosening the setscrews and pulling off the wheel; it might also include subplans (of the loosening step) for find
