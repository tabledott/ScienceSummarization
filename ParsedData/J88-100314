    Certain cases of this sort may be soluble by making the collocational matrix distinguish classes of ambiguities&#8212;this question is being pursued.
    Approximately 1% of running text is tagged by IDIOMTAG (letter, G. N. Leech to Henry Kucera, June 7, 1985; letter, E. S. Atwell to Henry Kucera, June 20, 1985).
    Marshall notes the possibility of consulting a complete three-dimensional matrix of collocational probabilities.
    Such a matrix would map orde
