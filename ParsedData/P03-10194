rd-reorderings, i.e. permutations, that satisfy the chosen constraints.
    First, we will consider the ITG constraints.
    Afterwards, we will describe the IBM constraints.
    Let us now consider the ITG constraints.
    Here, we interpret the input sentence as a sequence of blocks.
    In the beginning, each position is a block of its own.
    Then, the permutation process can be seen as follows: we select two consecutive blocks and merge them to a single block by choosing between two options: either keep them in monotone order or invert the order.
    This idea is illustrated in Fig.
    1.
    The white boxes represent the two blocks to be merged.
    Now, we investigate, how many permutations are obtainable with this method.
    A permutation derived by the above method can be represented as a binary tree where the inner nodes are colored either black or white.
    At black nodes the resulting sequences of the children are inverted.
    At white nodes they are kept in monotone order.
    This represent
