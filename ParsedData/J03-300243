h words, 23.4 French words after tokenization).
    As before, we used the maximum weighted bipartite matching algorithm.
    The final lexicon consists of all word pairs with nonzero probability and contains 132,155 entries.
    Note that all word pairs in the enhanced dictionary are included; we have merely added to that dictionary by bootstrapping additional entries from the Bible.
    3.2.2 Results.
    In order to compare tsim with structural similarity scoring, we applied it to 325 English-French Web document pairs for which human evaluations were carried out in Section 2.
    As there is only one feature under consideration (tsim), the classifier must be a threshold on that value.
    At different thresholds, Cohen&#8217;s &#954; score of agreement (with each of Resnik&#8217;s (1999) two judges and their intersection) may be computed for comparison with STRAND, along with recall and precision against a gold standard (for which we use the intersection of the judges: the set of examples for which the jud
