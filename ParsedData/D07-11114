			We first describe our approach to multilingual dependency parsing, fol lowed by our approach for domain adaptation.
			We then provide an analysis of the results obtained with our system, and discuss possible improve ments.
	
	
			pendency Parsing Our overall parsing approach uses a best-first probabilistic shift-reduce algorithm based on the LR algorithm (Knuth, 1965).
			As such, it follows a bottom-up strategy, or bottom-up-trees, as defined in Buchholz and Marsi (2006), in contrast to the shift-reduce dependency parsing algorithm described by Nivre (2003), which is a bottom-up/top down hybrid, or bottom-up-spans.
			It is unclear whether the use of a bottom-up-trees algorithm has any advantage over the use of a bottom-up-spans algorithm (or vice-versa) in practice, but the avail ability of different algorithms that perform the same parsing task could be advantageous in parser ensembles.
			The main difference between our pars er and a traditional LR parser is that we do not use an LR
