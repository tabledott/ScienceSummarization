ch other, and as it stands will give unreasonably high probability to two unlike phrases being coordinated.
    To fix these problems, the non-terminal label in coordination cases was altered to be the same as that of the second conjunct (the phrase directly to the right of the head of the phrase).
    See figure 5.
    A similar transformation was made for cases where a comma was the head of a phrase.
    Figure 6 shows an additional change concerning commas.
    This change increases the sensitivity of the model to punctuation.
    This section describes some modifications to the parameterization of the model. guish main clauses from relative clauses: both have a verb as the head, so both are labeled VP.
    (b) A typical parsing error due to relative and main clauses not being distinguished.
    (note that two main clauses can be coordinated by a comma, as in John likes Mary, Mary likes Tim).
    (c) The solution to the problem: a modification to relative clause structures in training data.
