nima, and tries to find out what word correspondences are the most reliable ones.
    In order to limit the search space, translations that are known beforehand can be used as anchor points.
    Future work will deal with the following as yet unresolved problems: &#8226; Computational limitations require the vocabularies to be limited to subsets of all word types in large corpora.
    With criteria like the corpus frequency of a word, its specificity for a given domain, and the salience of its co-occurrence patterns, it should be possible to make a selection of corresponding vocabularies in the two languages.
    If morphological tools and disambiguators are available, preliminary lemmatization of the corpora would be desirable.
    &#8226; Ambiguities in word translations can be taken into account by working with continuous probabilities to judge whether a word translation is correct instead of making a binary decision.
    Thereby, different sizes of the two matrices could be allowed for.
    It can be expe
