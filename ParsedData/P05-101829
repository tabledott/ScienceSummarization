lexical chains (Morris and Hirst, 1991).
    An entirely different approach is to develop fully lexicalized models, akin to traditional language models.
    Cache language models (Kuhn and Mori, 1990) seem particularly promising in this context.
    In the discourse literature, entity-based theories are primarily applied at the level of local coherence, while relational models, such as Rhetorical Structure Theory (Mann and Thomson, 1988; Marcu, 2000), are used to model the global structure of discourse.
    We plan to investigate how to combine the two for improved prediction on both local and global levels, with the ultimate goal of handling longer texts.
