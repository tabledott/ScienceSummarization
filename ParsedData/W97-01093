ing the discourse context is, however, extremely difficult because we do not have enough theoretical background to decide which bits of context are needed to correctly disambiguate and which are irrelevant.
    There have been numerous attempts to substitute context by superficial knowledge extracted from a large corpus.
    Pioneering research on corpus-based statistical PP attachment ambiguity resolution has been done by Hindle and Rooth in [H&amp;R93].
    They extracted over 200,000 verb-nounpreposition triples with unknown attachment decisions.
    An iterative, unsupervised method was then used to decide between adjectival and adverbial attachment in which the decision was based on comparing the co-occurence probabilities of the given preposition with the verb and with the noun in each quadruple.
    Another promising approach is the transformation-based rule derivation presented by Brill and Resnik in [B&amp;R941, which is a simple learning algorithm that derives a set of transformation rules.
