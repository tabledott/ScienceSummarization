    In all experiments we automatically split words and sentences using our preprocessing tools.4 B-Cubed F-Score We evaluate over the commonly used B-Cubed F-Score (Bagga and Baldwin, 1998), which is a measure of the overlap of predicted clusters and true clusters.
    It is computed as the harmonic mean of precision (P), where cm is the number of mentions appearing both in m&#8217;s predicted cluster and in m&#8217;s true cluster, pm is the size of the predicted cluster containing m, and tm is the size of m&#8217;s true cluster.
    Finally, d represents a document from the set D, and N is the total number of mentions in D. B-Cubed F-Score has the advantage of being able to measure the impact of singleton entities, and of giving more weight to the splitting or merging of larger entities.
    It also gives equal weight to all types of entities and mentions.
    For these reasons, we report our results using B-Cubed F-Score.
    MUC F-Score We also provide results using the official MUC scoring algorithm (Vi
