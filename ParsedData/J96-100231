    The actual algorithms, along with the appropriate mathematical framework, are presented in the appendix.
  
  
    In the next few pages we discuss several applications of maximum entropy modeling within Candide, a fully automatic French-to-English machine translation system under development at IBM.
    Over the past few years, we have used Candide as a test bed for exploring the efficacy of various techniques in modeling problems arising in machine translation.
    We begin in Section 5.1 with a review of the general theory of statistical translation, describing in some detail the models employed in Candide.
    In Section 5.2 we describe how we have applied maximum entropy modeling to predict the French translation of an English word in context.
    In Section 5.3 we describe maximum entropy models that predict differences between French word order and English word order.
    In Section 5.4 we describe a maximum entropy model that predicts how to div
