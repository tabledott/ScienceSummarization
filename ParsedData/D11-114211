rence), so it is unlikely to represent a bona fide relation.
    We describe the implementation details of the lexical constraint in Section 4.
    3.3 Limitations Our constraints represent an idealized model of relation phrases in English.
    This raises the question: How much recall is lost due to the constraints?
    To address this question, we analyzed Wu and Weld&#8217;s set of 300 sentences from a set of random Web pages, manually identifying all verb-based relationships between noun phrase pairs.
    This resulted in a set of 327 relation phrases.
    For each relation phrase, we checked whether it satisfies our constraints.
    We found that 85% of the relation phrases do satisfy the constraints.
    Of the remaining 15%, we identified some of the common cases where the constraints were violated, summarized in Table 3.
    Many of the example relation phrases shown in Table 3 involve long-range dependencies between words in the sentence.
    These types of dependencies are not easily representable u
