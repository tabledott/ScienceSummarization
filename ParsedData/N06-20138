 select one in a consistent arbitrary manner (first in a sorted list of analyses).
    MADA, The Morphological Analysis and Disambiguation for Arabic tool, is an off-the-shelf resource for Arabic disambiguation (Habash and Rambow, 2005).
    MADA selects among BAMA analyses using a combination of classifiers for 10 orthogonal dimensions, including POS, number, gender, and pronominal clitics.
    For BAMA and MADA, applying a preprocessing scheme involves moving features (as specified by the scheme) out of the chosen word analysis and regenerating the word without the split off features (Habash, 2004).
    The regeneration guarantees the normalization of the word form.
    Table 1 exemplifies the effect of the different schemes on the same sentence.
    ST: Simple Tokenization is the baseline preprocessing scheme.
    It is limited to splitting off punctuations and numbers from words and removing any diacritics that appear in the input.
    This scheme requires no disambiguation.
