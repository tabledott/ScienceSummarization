opaque second argument.
    Axioms will express the fact that rw-identieal is an equivalence relation: Finally, the following axiom, together with axiom (17), would express Leibniz's Law: (Nies, es)rw-identical(63, es) 3 (Ezist(et ) n Ezist(e2)) From all of this we can prove that if the Evening Star rises then the Morning Star rises, but we cannot prove from John's belief that the Evening Star rises that John believes the Morning Star rises.
    If John knows the Morning Star and the Evening Star are identical, and he knows axiom (17), then his belief that the Morning Star rises can be proved as one would prove his belief in the consequences of any other syllogism whose premises he believed, in accordance with a treatment of reasoning about belief developed in a longer version of this pas.er.
    This solution is in the spirit of our whole representational approach in that it forces us to be painfully explicit about everything.
    The notation does no magic for us.
