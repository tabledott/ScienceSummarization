t al., 1993) and learns a log-linear model to weight parses.
    KRISP (Kate and Mooney, 2006) is a discriminative approach where meaning representation structures are constructed from the natural language strings hierarchically.
    It is built on top of SVMstruct with string kernels.
    Additionally, there is substantial related research that is not directly comparable to our approach.
    Some of this work requires different levels of supervision, including labeled syntactic parse trees (Ge and Mooney, 2005; Ge and Mooney, 2006).
    Others do not perform lexical learning (Tang and Mooney, 2001).
    Finally, recent work has explored learning to map sentences to lambda-calculus meaning representations (Wong and Mooney, 2007; Zettlemoyer and Collins, 2005; Zettlemoyer and Collins, 2007).
  
  
    We restrict our meaning representation (MR) formalism to a variable free version as presented in (Wong and Mooney, 2006; Kate et al., 2005).
    A training instance consists of a natural language sentence (NL sen
