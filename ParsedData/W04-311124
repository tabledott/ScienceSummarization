vestigate methods to identify relations over the variation components that are extracted using the entity tagger.
  
  
    We have described here an integrated annotation approach for two areas of biomedical information extraction.
    We discussed several issues that have arisen for this integration of annotation layers.
    Much effort has been spent on the entity definitions and how they relate to the higher-level concepts which are desired for extraction.
    There are promising initial results for training taggers to extract these entities.
    Next steps in the project include: (1) continued annotation of the layers we are currently doing, (2) integration of the level of predicate-argument annotation, and (3) further development of the statistical taggers, including taggers for identifying relations over their component entities.
