man experts, we suspect then that this is too stringent a scale for our task, which is qualitatively quite different from content analysis.
    Evaluating the experts' performance summarized in Table 16, we can remark two things, which confirm our expectations.
    First, the task is difficult&#8212;i.e., not performed at 100% (or close) even by trained experts, when compared to the gold standard, with the highest percent agreement with Levin at 86.5%.
    Second, with respect to comparison of the experts among themselves, the rate of agreement is never very high, and the variability in agreement is considerable, ranging from .53 to .66.
    This evaluation is also supported by a 3-way agreement measure (Siegel and Castellan 1988).
    Applying this calculation, we find that the percentage of verbs to which the three experts gave the same classification (60%, K = 0.6) is smaller than any of the pairwise agreements, indicating that the experts do not all agree on the same subset of verbs.
    The observation t
