 listed in Table 2.
    If no proposition is detected as in a nominal sentence, the context is split.
    That is, there is no link between the proposition of the previous sentence and that of the next sentence.
    We claim these two types of context can be used for unsupervised learning as clues to assign a tentative polarity to unknown expressions.
    To validate our assumption, we conducted preliminary observations using various corpora.
    Throughout this paper we used Japanese corpora from discussion boards in four different domains, whose features are shown in Table 3.
    All of the corpora have clues to the boundaries of postings, so they were suitable to identify the discourses.
    How strong is the coherency in the context proposed in Section 4.1?
    Using the polar clauses detected by the SA system with the initial lexicon, we observed the coherent precision of domain d with lexicon L, defined as: where #(Coherent) and #(Conflict) are occurrence counts of the same and opposite polarities obser
