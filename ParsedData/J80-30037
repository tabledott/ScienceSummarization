 then it is plausible that S believes that A wants to achieve the effects of ACT.&amp;quot; From simple rules like this can be derived more complex plan inference rules such as: &amp;quot;If S believes that A wants S to recognize A's intention to do ACT, then it is plausible that S believes that A wants S to recognize A's intention to achieve the effects of ACT.&amp;quot; Notice that the complex rule is obtained by introducing &amp;quot;S believes A wants&amp;quot; in the antecedent and consequent of the simple rule, and by interpreting &amp;quot;S recognizes A's intention&amp;quot; as &amp;quot;S comes to believe that A wants&amp;quot;.
    Throughout the paper we identify &amp;quot;want&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;intend&amp;quot;.
    We show that rules of the second type can account for S's recognition of many indirect speech acts by A, i.e. those in which S recognizes A's intention that S perform cooperative acts.
