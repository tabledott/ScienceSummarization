 or name (proper noun).
    For this test we specified a list of possible phrase types (NP, VP, PP, N, Name) that count as a successful parse.
    We intend to run other tests with other grammatical categories, but expect that these other categories could need a different heuristic for deciding which substring to parse, as well as a different set of acceptable phrase types.
    Four candidate strings were derived from the original by making the three different possible edits, and also including the original string unchanged.
    Each of these strings was analyzed by the parser.
    When the original sequence did not parse, but one of edits resulted in a sequence that parsed, the original sequence was very unlikely to be a false positive (right for 34 of 35 cases).
    Furthermore, the edit that parsed was chosen to be the repaired string.
    When more than one of the edited strings parsed, the edit was chosen by preferring them in the following order: (1) Mi IX/VI , (2) RIM].
    , (3) M1R11M1R1.
