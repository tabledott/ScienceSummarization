  The Necessity Of Parsing For Predicate Argument Recognition
  
    Broad-coverage corpora annotated with semantic role, or argument structure, information are becoming available for the first time.
    Statistical systems have been trained to automatically label semantic roles from the output of statistical parsers on unannotated text.
    In this paper, we quantify the effect of parser accuracy on these systems' performance, and examine the question of whether a flatter &amp;quot;chunked&amp;quot; representation of the input can be as effective for the purposes of semantic role identification.
  
  
    Over the past decade, most work in the field of information extraction has shifted from complex rule-based, systems designed to handle a wide variety of semantic phenomena including quantification, anaphora, aspect and modality (e.g.
    Alshawi (1992)), to simpler finite-state or statistical systems such as Hobbs et al. (1997) and Miller et al.
    (1998).
    Much of the evaluation of these systems has b
