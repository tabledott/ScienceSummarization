s of the category, equation (I) reduces to the following linear algebraic formula with 3The relation &#8804; is the partial order of the pregroup.
    It corresponds to implication =&#8658; in a logical reading thereof.
    If these inequalities are replaced by equalities, i.e. if nln = 1 = nnr, then the pregroup collapses into a group where nl = nr. lower dimensions, hence the dimensional explosion problem for Kronecker products is avoided: cats into the first argument place of the verb (similarly for object and second argument place).
    -+st is a basis vector of the sentence space S in which meanings of sentences live, regardless of their grammatical structure.
    The degree of synonymity of sentences is obtained by taking the cosine measure of their vectors.
    S is an abstract space: it needs to be instantiated to provide concrete meanings and synonymity measures.
    For instance, a truth-theoretic model is obtained by taking the sentence space S to be the 2dimensional space with basis vectors J1) (T
