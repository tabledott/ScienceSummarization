orris and Hirst's pioneering work on computing discourse structure from lexical relations (Morris and Hirst 1991; Morris 1988) is a precursor to the work reported on here.
    Influenced by Halliday and Hasan's (1976) theory of lexical coherence, Morris developed an algorithm that finds chains of related terms via a comprehensive thesaurus (Roget's Fourth Edition)!
    For example, the words residential and apartment both index the same thesaural category and can thus be considered to be in a coherence relation with one another.
    The chains are used to structure texts according to the attentional/intentional theory of discourse structure (Grosz and Sidner 1986) discussed above.
    The extent of the lexical chains is assumed to correspond to the extent of a segment.
    The algorithm also incorporates the notion of chain returns&#8212;repetition of terms after a long hiatus&#8212;to complete an intention that spans over a digression.
    The boundaries of the segments correspond to the sentences that conta
