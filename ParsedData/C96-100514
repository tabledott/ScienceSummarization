  The 3 senses related to animals appear in the files ANIMAL and FOOD.
  This mcans that while the homograph level in [Yarowsky 92] distinguishes two sets of senses, the file level in WordNet distinguishes six sets of senses, still finer in granularity.
  Figure 6 shows that, as expected, file-level matches attain better performance (71.2% overall and 53.9% for polysemic nouns) than sense-level matches.

  Coverage tends to get stabilised near 80%, getting little improvement for window sizes bigger than 20.
  The figure also shows the guessing baseline, given hy selecting senses at random.
  This baseline was first calculated analytically and later checked experimentally.
  We also compare the performance of our algorithm with that of the "most fre
