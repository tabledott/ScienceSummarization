12; case is that of events which had count zero but get a non-zero count in the next iteration, caused by the &amp;quot;N-best&amp;quot; nature of the re-estimation process.
    Consider a given sentence in our &amp;quot;development&amp;quot; set.
    The &amp;quot;N-best&amp;quot; derivations for this sentence are trajectories through the state space of our model.
    They will change from one iteration to the other due to the smoothing involved in the probability estimation and the change of the parameters &#8212; event counts &#8212; defining our model, thus allowing new events to appear and discarding others through purging low probability events from the stacks.
    The higher the number of trajectories per sentence, the more dynamic this change is expected to be.
    The results we obtained are presented in the experiments section.
    All the perplexity evaluations were done using the left-to-right formula (8) (L2RPPL) for which the perplexity on the &amp;quot;development set&amp;quot; is not guarantee
