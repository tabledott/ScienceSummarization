 the particle &amp;quot;up&amp;quot; was available, even though this information appears nowhere in the goal semantics.
    That is, the generator operated appropriately despite a semantically nonmonotonic grammar.
    Finally, even though much of the processing is top-down, left-recursive rules, even deadlock-prone rules (e.g. rule (3)), are handled in a constrained manner by the algorithm.
    For these reasons, we feel that the semantic-head-driven algorithm is a significant improvement over top-down methods and the previous bottom-up method based on Earley deduction.
    We will outline here how the new algorithm can generate, from a quantified logical form, sentences with quantified NPs one of whose readings is the original logical form; that is, how it performs quantifier lowering automatically.
    For this, we will associate a quantifier store with certain categories and add to the grammar suitable store manipulation rules.
    Each category whose constituents may create store elements will have a sto
