e-off between cost and execution time.
    However, replicating our approach would not necessarily result in the same costs. it still took little more time to be completed.
    On the other hand, although the &#8220;Unidirectional Entailment&#8221; task was expected to be more difficult and thus rewarded more than the &#8220;Bidirectional Entailment&#8221; one, in the end it took notably less time to be completed.
    Nevertheless, the overall figures (435 USD, and about 22.5 days of MTurk work to complete the process)15 clearly demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach.
    Even considering the time needed for an expert to manage the pipeline (i.e. one week to prepare gold units, and to handle the I/O of each HIT), these figures show that our methodology provides a cheaper and faster way to collect entailment data in comparison with the RTE average costs reported in Section 1.
    As regards the amount of data collected, the resulting corpus contains 1,620 pairs with the following distribution of entailm
