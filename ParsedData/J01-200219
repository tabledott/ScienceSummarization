 second-level features can be exploited by WPDV, as well as by a wide selection of other machine learning algorithms.
    Our first choice from these other algorithms is a memory-based second-level learner, implemented in TiMBL (Daelemans et al. 1999), a package developed at Tilburg University and Antwerp University.'
    Memory-based learning is a learning method that is based on storing all examples of a task in memory and then classifying new examples by similarity-based reasoning from these stored examples.
    Each example is represented by a fixed-length vector of feature values, called a case.
    If the case to be classified has been observed before, that is, if it is found among the stored cases (in the case base), the most frequent corresponding output is used.
    If the case is not found in the case base, k nearest neighbors are determined with some similarity metric, and the output is based on the observed outputs for those neighbors.
    Both the value of k and the similarity metric used can be
