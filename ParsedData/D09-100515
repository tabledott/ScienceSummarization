ngle hyperedge e, in which case (p(d), p(d)r(d)) = ke (thanks to our choice of ke), and where d is empty, in which case 5However, in a more tricky way, the second-order expectation semiring can be constructed using the first-order expectation semiring, as will be seen in Section 4.3. ing is a pair (p, r).
    The second and third rows define the operations between two elements (p1, r1) and (p2, r2), and the last two rows define the identities.
    Note that the multiplicative identity 1 has an r component of 0.
    (= saeea) is stored as a pair (sa, `a) where sa and `a are the sign bit of a and natural logarithm of |a|, respectively.
    This table shows the operations between two values a = sa2ea and b = sb2eb, assuming `a &#8805; `b.
    Note: log(1 + x) (where The proof for the second-order expectation semiring is similar.
    In particular, one mainly needs to show that &#174;e&#8712;d ke = (p(d), p(d)r(d), p(d)s(d), p(d)r(d)s(d)).
    In Tables 1&#8211;2, we do not discuss how to store p, r, s, and t. If
