  Refining Event Extraction through Cross-Document Inference
  
    We apply the hypothesis of &#8220;One Sense Per Discourse&#8221; (Yarowsky, 1995) to information extraction (IE), and extend the scope of &#8220;discourse&#8221; from one single document to a cluster of topically-related documents.
    We employ a similar approach to propagate consistent event arguments across sentences and documents.
    Combining global evidence from related documents with local decisions, we design a simple scheme to conduct cross-document inference for improving the ACE event ex- Without using any additional labeled data this new approach obtained 7.6% higher F-Measure in trigger labeling and 6% higher F-Measure in argument labeling over a state-of-the-art IE system which extracts events independently for each sentence.
  
  
    Identifying events of a particular type within individual documents &#8211; &#8216;classical&#8217; information extraction &#8211; remains a difficult task.
