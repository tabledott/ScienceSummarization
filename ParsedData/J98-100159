 very often regarded as all words or characters falling within some window of the target, with no regard for distance, syntactic structure, or other relations.
    Early corpus-based work, such as that of Weiss (1973) used this approach; spreading activation and dictionary-based approaches also do not usually differentiate context input on any basis other than occurrence in a window.
    Schtitze's vector space method (this volume) is a recent example of an approach that ignores adjacency information.
    Overall, the bag-of-words approach has been shown to work better for nouns than for verbs (cf.
    Schtitze, this volume), and to be in general less effective than methods that take other relations into consideration.
    However, as demonstrated in Yarowsky's (1992) work, the approach is cheaper than those requiring more complex processing and can achieve sufficient disambiguation for some applications.
    We examine below some of the other parameters.
    Distance.
