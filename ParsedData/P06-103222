ing it possible to apply the SMT paradigm to ESL error correction.
    One challenge faced by the SMT model is the extremely high quality that will need to be attained before a system might be usable.
    Since it is highly undesirable that learners should be presented with inaccurate feedback that they may not have the experience or knowledge to assess, the quality bar imposed on error correction is far higher than is that tolerated in machine translation.
    Exploration of error correction and writing assistance using SMT models may thus prove an important venue for testing new SMT models.
    Statistical Machine Translation has provided a hugely successful research paradigm within the field of natural language processing over the last decade.
    One of the major advantages of using SMT in ESL writing assistance is that it can be expected to benefit automatically from any progress made in SMT itself.
    In fact, the approach presented here benefits from all the advantages of statistical machine translati
