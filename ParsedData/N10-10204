existing dialogue inventories, we evaluate using qualitative visualizations and a novel conversation ordering task, to ensure our models have the opportunity to discover dialogue phenomena unique to this medium.
  
  
    To enable the study of large-data solutions to dialogue modeling, we have collected a corpus of 1.3 million conversations drawn from the microblogging service, Twitter.
    3 To our knowledge, this is the largest corpus of naturally occurring chat data that has been available for study thus far.
    Similar datasets include the NUS SMS corpus (How and Kan, 2005), several IRC chat corpora (Elsner and Charniak, 2008; Forsyth and Martell, 2007), and blog datasets (Yano et al., 2009; Gamon et al., 2008), which can display conversational structure in the blog comments.
