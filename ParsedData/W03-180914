ere .700 and .387, respectively.
    These are only very slightly higher than the overall scores, suggesting, although by no means proving, that polysemy was not a significant confounding factor.
    The results for each VPC type can be seen in Table 1, broken down into the verb and particle entailment judgements and based on the 26 participants.
    We took two approaches to deriving a single judgement for each test.
    First, we took the majority judgement to be the correct one (majority).
    Second, we identified the participant who achieved the highest overall r. score with the other participants, and took their judgements to be correct (centroid annotator).
    Both sets of results will be referred to in evaluating our models.
    It is interesting to look at the way in which the results for component entailment are distributed across the VPCs.
    According to the majority view, there are 21 fully-compositional items, 10 items where neither the verb nor the particle is entailed, 9 items where only the
