assignment of subjectivity labels to word senses.
    We devise an algorithm relying on distributionally similar words to calculate a subjectivity score, and show how it can be used to automatically assess the subjectivity of a word sense.
    Second, can automatic subjectivity analysis be used to improve word sense disambiguation?
    To address this question, the output of a subjectivity sentence classifier is input to a word-sense disambiguation system, which is in turn evaluated on the nouns from the SENSEVAL-3 English lexical sample task (Section 5).
    The results of this experiment show that a subjectivity feature can significantly improve the accuracy of a word sense disambiguation system for those words that have both subjective and objective senses.
    A third obvious question is, can word sense disambiguation help automatic subjectivity analysis?
    However, due to space limitations, we do not address this question here, but rather leave it for future work.
