uages, where such data is not available in sufficient quantities.
  Jelinek (1985) and Cutting et al.
  (1992) circumvent his problem by training their taggers on untagged ata using tile Itaum-Welch algo- rithm (also know as the forward-backward algorithm).
  They report rates of correctly tagged words which are comparable to that presented by Church (1988) and Kempe (1993).
  A third and rather new approach is tagging with artificial neural networks.
  In the area of speech recog- nition neural networks have been used for a decade r, ow.
  They have shown performances comparable to that of IIidden Ivlarkov model systems or even better (Lippmann, 1989).
  Part-of-speech prediction is an- other area, closer to POS tagging, where neural net- works have been applied successfidly.
  Nakamura el; al.
  (1990) trained a d-layer feed-forward network with up to three preceding part-of-speech tags ,as input to predict the word category of the next word.
  The pre- diction accuracy was similar to that of a trigram-b,~s
