ersome way presupposed by the algorithm.
  
  
    We now develop a concrete example of the use of restriction in parsing by extending Earley's algorithm to parse grammars in the PATR-II formalism just presented.
    Earley's algorithm L1 a bottom-up parsing algorithm that uses top-down prediction to hypothesize the starting points of possible constituents.
    Typically, the prediction step determines which categories of constituent can start at a given point in a sentence.
    But when most of the information is not in an atomic category symbol, such prediction is relatively useless and many types of constituents are predicted that could never be involved in a completed parse.
    This standard Earley's algorithm is presented in Section 4.2.
    By extending the algorithm so that the prediction step determines which dogs can start at a given point, we can use the information in the features to be more precise in the predictions and eliminate many hypotheses.
    However, because there are a potentially infi
