 well be- haved text; in any case, it is not clear how the figure would be normalized over a wide range of text types, some of them not completely 'clean', as is the case with our data.
			Third, close analysis of the most common types of error our algorithm currently makes reveals two spe- cific configurations in the input which confuse the pro- cedure and contribute to the error rate: gender mis- match (35% of errors) and certain long range contextttal (stylistic) phenomena, best exemplified by text contain- ing quoted passages in-line (14% of errors).
			Implementing a gender (dis-)agreement fil er is not technically complex; as noted above, the current algo- rithrn contains one.
			The persistence of gender mis- matches in the output simply reflects the lack of a con- sistent gender slot in the I,\[NGSOFT tagger output.
			Aug- menting the algorithm with a lexical database which includes more detailed gender information will result in improved accuracy.
