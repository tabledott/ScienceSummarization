    Following the first unsupervised segmentation approach by Hearst (1994), most algorithms assume that variations in lexical distribution indicate topic changes.
    When documents exhibit sharp variations in lexical distribution, these algorithms are likely to detect segment boundaries accurately.
    For example, most algorithms achieve high performance on synthetic collections, generated by concatenation of random text blocks (Choi, 2000).
    The difficulty arises, however, when transitions between topics are smooth and distributional variations are subtle.
    This is evident in the performance of existing unsupervised algorithms on less structured datasets, such as spoken meeting transcripts (Galley et al., 2003).
    Therefore, a more refined analysis of lexical distribution is needed.
    Our work addresses this challenge by casting text segmentation in a graph-theoretic framework.
    We abstract a text into a weighted undirected graph, where the nodes of the graph correspond to sentences an
