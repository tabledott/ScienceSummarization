    Second, we tried disregarding annotators who have very low agreement with others, by throwing away judgments for the annotators with the lowest judgments.
    Figures 4 and 5 show how the K values improve for intra- and inter-annotator agreement under these two strategies, and what percentage of the judgments are retained as more annotators are removed, or as the initial learning period is made longer.
    It seems that the strategy of removing the worst annotators is the best in terms of improving inter-annotator K, while retaining most of the judgments.
    If we remove the 33 judges with the worst agreement, we increase the inter-annotator K from fair to moderate, and still retain 60% of the data.
    For the results presented in the rest of the paper, we retain all judgments.
