uot;Controls&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;computerized&amp;quot;), the first tag is not the K-best tags and probabilities. correct one.
    However, in all instances the correct tag is included in the set.
    Note the first word, &amp;quot;Bailey,&amp;quot; is unknown to the system, therefore, all of the open class tags are possible.
    In order to reduce the ambiguity further, we tested various ways to limit how many tags were returned based on their probabilities.
    Often one tag is very likely and the others, while possible, are given a low probability, as in the word &amp;quot;in&amp;quot; above.
    Therefore, we tried removing all tags whose probability was less than some arbitrary threshold (similar to de Marcken's &amp;quot;factor&amp;quot;), for example removing all tags whose likelihood is more than e2 less likely than the most likely tag.
    So only tags within the threshold 2.0 of the most likely would be included (i.e., if the most likely tag had a log probability of &#8212;0.19, only tags with a
