 extend words are considered to be correctly iden- tified.
			For instance, compounds occur very often in Chi- nese text, but none of the existing systems except ours pay much attention to identify them.
			Proper name is another type of words which cannot be listed exhaus- tively in the lexicon.
			Therefore simple matching algo- rithms can not successfully identify either compounds or proper names.
			In this paper, we like to raise the ptx~blems and the difficulties in identifying words and suggest the possible solutions.
