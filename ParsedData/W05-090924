mantically meaningful additional &amp;quot;synthetic&amp;quot; references from a small set of real references* We plan to explore whether using such synthetic references can improve the performance of our metric* Weigh Matches Produced by Different Modules Differently: Our current multi-stage approach prefers metric imposes a priority on the different matching mo dules* However, once all the stages have been run, unigrams mapped through different mapping modules are treated the same* Another approach to treating different mappings differently is to apply different weights to the mappings produced by different mapping mo dules* Thus &amp;quot;computer&amp;quot; may match &amp;quot;computer&amp;quot; with a score of 1, &amp;quot;computers&amp;quot; with a score of 0*8 and &amp;quot;workstation&amp;quot; with a score of 0*3* As future work we plan to develop a version of METEOR that uses such weighting schemes*
