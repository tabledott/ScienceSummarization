MTGs generate tuples of parse trees that are isomorphic up to reordering of sibling nodes and deletion.
    Figure 2 shows two representations of a tree that might be generated by an MTG in GCNF for the imperative sentence pair Wash the dishes / Pasudu moy .
    The tree exhibits both deletion and inversion in translation.
    We shall refer to such multidimensional trees as multitrees.
    The different classes of generalized parsing algorithms in this paper differ only in their grammars and in their logics.
    They are all compatible with the same parsing semirings and search strategies.
    Therefore, we shall describe these algorithms in terms of their underlying logics and grammars, abstracting away the semirings and search strategies, in order to elucidate how the different classes of algorithms are related to each other.
    Logical descriptions of inference algorithms involve inference rules: means that can be inferred from and .
    An item that appears in an inference rule stands for the propositio
