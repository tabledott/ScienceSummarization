generally converged in 20-30 iterations, Clark and Curran (2004) report experiments involving 479 iterations of training for one model, and 1550 iterations for another.
    The primary contribution of this paper is the extension of the max-margin approach of Taskar et al. (2003) to context free grammars.
    We show that this framework allows high-accuracy parsing in cubic time by exploiting novel kinds of lexical information.
  
  
    In the discriminative parsing task, we want to learn a function f : X &#8212;* Y, where X is a set of sentences, and Y is a set of valid parse trees according to a fixed grammar G. G maps an input x E X to a set of candidate parses G(x) C Y.2 We assume a loss function L : X x Y x Y &#8212;* R+.
    The function L(x, y, &#710;y) measures the penalty for proposing the parse y&#710; for x when y is the true parse.
    This penalty may be defined, for example, as the number of labeled spans on which the two trees do not agree.
    In general we assume that L(x, y, &#710;y) = 0 for
