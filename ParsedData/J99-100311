d 5 and the dynamic programming solution.
    Another interesting approach is possible when part-of-speech taggers are available for both languages.
    The insight that parts of speech are usually preserved in translation enabled Papageorgiou, Cranias, and Piperidis (1994) to design an alignment algorithm that maximizes the number of matching parts of speech in aligned segments.
    It is difficult to compare this algorithm's performance to that of other algorithms in the literature, because results were only reported for a relatively easy bitext.
    On this bitext, the algorithm's performance was nearly perfect.
    A translation model between parts of speech would not help on bitext regions like the one in Table 1.
    The alignment algorithms described above work nearly perfectly given clean bitexts that have easily detectable sentence boundaries.
    However bitext mapping at the sentence level is not an option for many bitexts (Church 1993).
    Sentences are often difficult to detect, especially when
