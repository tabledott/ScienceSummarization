y, they made no use of features, one of the primary benefits of discriminative learning.
    Taskar et al. (2004) took a large margin approach to discriminative learning, but achieved only small gains.
    We suspect that this is in part due to the grammar that they chose &#8211; the grammar of (Klein and Manning, 2003), which was hand annotated with the intent of optimizing performance of a PCFG.
    This grammar is fairly sparse &#8211; for any particular state there are, on average, only a few rules with that state as a parent &#8211; so the learning algorithm may have suffered because there were few options to discriminate between.
    Starting with this grammar we found it difficult to achieve gains as well.
    Additionally, their long training time (several months for WSJ15, according to (Turian and Melamed, 2006)) made feature engineering difficult; they were unable to really explore the space of possible features.
    More recent is the work of (Turian and Melamed, 2006; Turian et al., 2007), which i
