ment measure that is well suited to the task and takes both decisions into account, we assessedthem separately.
			We first examined whether the annotators compressed at a similar level.
			The com pression rate was 56% for one annotator and 54% for the other.
			2 We also assessed whether theyagreed in their rewrites by measuring BLEU (Pap ineni et al, 2002).
			The inter-annotator BLEU score was 23.79%, compared with the source agreement BLEU of only 13.22%.
			Both the compression rateand BLEU score indicate that the task is welldefined and the compressions valid.
			The remaining 25 documents were compressed by a single an notator to ensure consistency.
			All our experiments used the data from this annotator.
			3Table 1 illustrates some examples from our corpus.
			As can be seen, some sentences contain a single rewrite operation.
			For instance, a PP is para phrased with a genitive (see (1)), a subordinate clause with a present participle (see (2)), a passive sentence with an active one (see (3)).
