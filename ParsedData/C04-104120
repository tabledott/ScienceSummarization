			Hence we applied a limit to the number of categories in the chart, as in the previous section,and reverted to a more restrictive setting of the su pertagger if the limit was exceeded.
			We first used a value of ? = 0.01, and then reverted to ? = 0.05, and finally ? = 0.1.
			In this paper we take the opposite approach: westart with a very restrictive setting of the supertag ger, and only assign more categories if the parser cannot find an analysis spanning the sentence.
			In this way the parser interacts much more
