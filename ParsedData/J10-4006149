e core of semantic modeling (the distributional memory), and the procedural problem-solving components (possibly supervised procedures to perform different semantic tasks).
    This separation is in line with what is commonly assumed in cognitive science and formal linguistics, and we hope it will contribute to make corpus-based modeling a core part of the ongoing study of semantic knowledge in humans and machines.
