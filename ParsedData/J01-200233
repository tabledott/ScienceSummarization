per noun The annotation of the corpus was realized by a semiautomatic upgrade of the tagging inherited from an earlier project.
    The resulting consistency has never been exhaustively measured for either the Wotan or the original tagging.
    The training/test separation of the corpus is done at sample boundaries (each 1st to 9th sample is training and each 10th is test).
    This is a much stricter separation than applied for LOB and WSJ, as for those two corpora our test utterances are related to the training ones by being in the same samples.
    Partly as a result of this, but also very much because of word compounding in Dutch, we see a much higher percentage of new tokens-6.24% tokens unseen in the training set.
    A further 1.45% known tokens have new tags for Wotan, and 0.45% for WotanLite.
    The training set consists of 640K tokens and the test set of 72K tokens.
    The second ingredient for our experiments is a set of four tagger generator systems, selected on the basis of variety and availabi
