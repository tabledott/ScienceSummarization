			From both Table 3 and 5, we see, as expected,improvement from closed tests to open tests, indicating the significant contribution of domain knowl edge lexicons.

			that the improvement is monotonically related to the OOV rate (OOV rates are listed in Table 1).
			This is desirable because new word detection is most needed in situations that have high OOV rate.
			At low OOV rate, noisy new word detection
