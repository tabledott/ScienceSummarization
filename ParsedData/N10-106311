hen the feature matches on one sentence and not the other.
    None of the above features fire on a null alignment, in either the ranker or CRF.
    There is also a bias feature for these two models, which fires on all non-null alignments.
    Word-level induced lexicon features A common problem with approaches for parallel sentence classification, which rely heavily on alignment models trained from unrelated corpora, is low recall due to unknown words in the candidate sentence-pairs.
    One approach that begins to address this problem is the use of self-training, as in (Munteanu and Marcu, 2005).
    However, a selftrained sentence pair extraction system is only able to acquire new lexical items that occur in parallel sentences.
    Within Wikipedia, many linked article pairs do not contain any parallel sentences, yet contain many words and phrases that are good translations of each other.
    In this paper we explore an alternative approach to lexicon acquisition for use in parallel sentence extraction.
