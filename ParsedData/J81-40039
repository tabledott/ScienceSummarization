f transformation is not used, but a conceptual operation of some kind is required for instance to relate a relative pronoun to a &amp;quot;hole&amp;quot; in the structural representation of the constituent following the pronoun.
    To describe a fragment of language where left extraposition occurs, one might start with a CFG which gives a rough approximation of the fragment.
    The grammar may then be refined by adding arguments to non-terminals, to carry extraposed constituents across phrases.
    This method is analogous to the introduction of &amp;quot;derived&amp;quot; rules by Gazdar [5].
    Take for example the CFG in Figure 4.1.
    In this grammar it is possible to use rule (1) to expand a noun phrase into a trace, even outside a relative clause.
    To prevent this, I will add arguments to all non-terminals from Which a noun phrase might be extraposed.
    The modified grammar, now a DCG, is given in Figure 4.2.
    A variable 'Hole...' will have the value 'trace' if an extraposed noun phrase occu
