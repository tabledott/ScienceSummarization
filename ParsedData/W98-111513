 edges, we check to see if a matching constituent (i.e. a constituent with the same head, start, and end points) already exists in either the agenda or the chart.
    If there is no match, we simply add the new edge to the agenda.
    If there is a match but the old parse of Nild, is better than the new one, we discard the new parse.
    Finally, if we have found a better parse of N.4, we add the new edge to the agenda, removing the old one if it has not already been popped.
    We tested the parser on section section 22 of the WSJ text with various normalization constants .77, working on each sentence only until we reached the first full parse.
    For each sentence we recorded the number of popped edges needed to reach the first parse, and the precision and recall of that parse.
    The average number of popped edges to first parse as a function of q is shown in Figure 1, and the average precision and recall are shown in Figure 2.
    The number of popped edges decreases as ij increases from 1.0 to 1.7, the
