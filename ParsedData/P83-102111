ind of mixed top-down bottom-up mechanism that the Earley parsing algorithm provides for context-free grammars.
    Earley Deduction operates on two sets of definite clauses called the program and the state.
    The program is just the set of input clauses and remains fixed.
    The state consists of a set of derived clauses, where each nonunit dause has one of its negative literals selected; the state is continually being added to.
    Whenever a nonunit clause is added to the state, one of its negative literals is selected.
    Initially the state contains just the goal statement (with one of its negative literals selected).
    There are two inference rules, called instantiation and reduction, which can map the current state into a new one by adding a new derived clause.
    For an instantiation step, there is some clause in the current state whose selected literal unifies with the positive literal of a nonunit clause C in the program.
    In this case, the derived clause is arj, where o. is a most general
