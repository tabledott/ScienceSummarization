    Adaptor grammars as defined in section 2 have a large number of free parameters that have to be chosen by the grammar designer; a rule probability &#952;r for each PCFG rule r &#8712; R and either one or two hyperparameters for each adapted nonterminal X &#8712; A, depending on whether Chinese Restaurant or Pitman-Yor Processes are used as adaptors.
    It&#8217;s difficult to have intuitions about the appropriate settings for the latter parameters, and finding the optimal values for these parameters by some kind of exhaustive search is usually computationally impractical.
    Previous work has adopted an expedient such as parameter tying.
    For example, Johnson (2008) set &#952; by requiring all productions expanding the same nonterminal to have the same probability, and used Chinese Restaurant Process adaptors with tied parameters &#945;X, which was set using a grid search.
    We now describe two metho
