gmentations, while Pk only asks whether the two sentences are in the same segment or not.
    Pk and WindowDiff are penalties, so lower values indicate better segmentations.
    We use the evaluation source code provided by Malioutov and Barzilay (2006).
    System configuration We evaluate our Bayesian approach both with and without cue phrases.
    Without cue phrases, we use the dynamic programming inference described in section 3.3.
    This system is referred to as BAYESSEG in Table 1.
    When adding cue phrases, we use the Metropolis-Hastings model described in 4.1.
    Both basic and linguisticallymotivated proposal distributions are evaluated (see Section 4.2); these are referred to as BAYESSEGCUE and BAYESSEG-CUE-PROP in the table.
    For the sampling-based systems, results are averaged over five runs.
    The initial configuration is obtained from the dynamic programming inference, and then 100,000 sampling iterations are performed.
    The final segmentation is obtained by annealing the last 25,0
