onents of multitoken units, e.g. if as well as is taken to be a coordinating conjunction, it is tagged &amp;quot;as_CC-1 well_CC-2 as_CC-3&amp;quot;, using three related but different ditto tags.
    11 These numbers are calculated on the basis of a lexicon derived from the whole corpus.
    An actual tagger will have to deal with unknown words in the test set, which will tend to increase the ambiguity and decrease Random and LexProb.
    Note that all actual taggers and combiners in this paper do have to cope with unknown words as their lexicons are based purely on their training sets.
    12 Because of the way in which the tagger generators treat their input, we do count tokens as different even though they are the same underlying token, but differ in capitalization of one or more characters.
    13 In the material we have available, quotes are represented slightly differently, so that there are only 45 different tags.
    In addition, the corpus contains a limited number of instances of 38 &amp;quot;indete
