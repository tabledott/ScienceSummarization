onominal mention with the most recent non-pronominal antecedent when determining the word features, which include: 3 In ACE, each mention has a head annotation and an extent annotation.
    In all our experimentation, we only consider the word string between the beginning point of the extent annotation and the end point of the head annotation.
    This has an effect of choosing the base phrase contained in the extent annotation.
    In addition, this also can reduce noises without losing much of information in the mention.
    For example, in the case where the noun phrase &#8220;the former CEO of McDonald&#8221; has the head annotation of &#8220;CEO&#8221; and the extent annotation of &#8220;the former CEO of McDonald&#8221;, we only consider &#8220;the former CEO&#8221; in this paper.
    4 In this paper, the head word of a mention is normally set as the last word of the mention.
    However, when a preposition exists in the mention, its head word is set as the last word before the preposition.
