nding state set, an Earley parser performs all three operations exhaustively, i.e., until no new states are generated.
    One crucial insight into the working of the algorithm is that, although both prediction and completion feed themselves, there are only a finite number of states that can possibly be produced.
    Therefore recursive prediction and completion at each position have to terminate eventually, and the parser can proceed to the next input via scanning.
    To complete the description we need only specify the initial and final states.
    The parser starts out with 0: o &#8212;.S, where S is the sentence nonterminal (note the empty left-hand side).
    After processing the last symbol, the parser verifies that 1: 0 has been produced (among possibly others), where 1 is the length of the input x.
    If at any intermediate stage a state set remains empty (because no states from the previous stage permit scanning), the parse can be aborted because an impossible prefix has been detected.
