    Lemma 3 For any inversion transduction grammar G, there exists an equivalent inversion transduction grammar G' where T(G) = T(G'), such that G' does not contain any productions of the form A B.
    For any inversion transduction grammar G, there exists an equivalent inversion transduction grammar G' in which every production takes one of the following forms: A (Bi BO where n &gt; 3 and A 0 S. Include in G' all productions of the first six types.
    The remaining two types are transformed as follows: able from A [B1 &#8226; &#8226; &#8226; Bn], where e is output on stream 1 and c .on stream 2.
    Define e` as the substring of e derived from B,, and similarly define c'.
    Then Xi generates the set of rules A -4 (B2Y2) &#8226; &#8226; &#8226; , Yn-3 (Bn-2Yn-2), Yn-2 (Bn&#8212;lBn).
    Let additional string-pairs are generated due to the new productions.
    0 Henceforth all transduction grammars will be assumed to be in normal form.
  
  
    We now turn to the expressiveness
