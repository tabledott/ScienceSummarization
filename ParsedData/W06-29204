from scoring.
    Results across languages and systems varied widely from 37.8% (worst score on Turkish) to 91.7% (best score on Japanese).
    See Section 6 for detailed results.
    However, variations are consistent enough to allow us to draw some general conclusions.
    Section 7 discusses the implications of the results and analyzes the remaining problems.
    Finally, Section 8 describes possible directions for future research.
  
  
    Tesni`ere (1959) introduced the idea of a dependency tree (a &#8220;stemma&#8221; in his terminology), in which words stand in direct head-dependent relations, for representing the syntactic structure of a sentence.
    Hays (1964) and Gaifman (1965) studied the formal properties of projective dependency grammars, i.e. those where dependency links are not allowed to cross.
    Mel&#8217;&#711;cuk (1988) describes a multistratal dependency grammar, i.e. one that distinguishes between several types of dependency relations (morphological, syntactic and semantic).
