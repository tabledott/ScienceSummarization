th Of: We can then calculate the BLEU score of hypotheses e in the context of O.
    But the larger O is, the smaller the impact the current sentence will have on the BLEU score.
    To correct for this, and to bring the loss function roughly into the same range as typical margins, we scale the BLEU score by the size of the input: which we also simply write as B(e).
    Finally, the loss function is defined to be: We now describe the selection of e&#8727;.
    We know of three approaches in previous work.
    The first is to force the decoder to output the reference sentence exactly, and select the derivation with the highest model score, which Liang et al. (2006) call bold updating.
    The second uses the decoder to search for the highest-BLEU translation (Tillmann and Zhang, 2006), which Arun and Koehn (2007) call max-BLEU updating.
    Liang et al. and Arun and Koehn experiment with these methods and both opt for a third method, which Liang et al. call local updating: generate an n-best list of translatio
