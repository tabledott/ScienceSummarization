 other researchers.
    For example, Hearst (1992) used the pattern such as to discover hyponyms and Berland and Charniak (1999) used the pattern of the to discover meronyms.
    Both of these patterns are included in the 4,000 patterns automatically generated by LRA.
    The novelty in Turney and Littman (2005) is that their patterns are not used to mine text for instances of word pairs that fit the patterns (Hearst 1992; Berland and Charniak 1999); instead, they are used to gather frequency data for building vectors that represent the relation between a given pair of words.
    The results in Section 6.8 show that a vector contains more information than any single pattern or small set of patterns; a vector is a distributed representation.
    LRA is distinct from Hearst (1992) and Berland and Charniak (1999) in its focus on distributed representations, which it shares with Turney and Littman (2005), but LRA goes beyond Turney and Littman (2005) by finding patterns automatically.
