 shown, the combined classifier was consistently more accurate than the classifier using words alone.
    Although the gain in accuracy was not statistically significant for the small recognizer test set because of a lack of power, replication for a larger hand-transcribed test set showed the gain to be highly significant for both subtasks by a Sign test, p &lt; .001 and p &lt; .0001 (one-tailed), respectively.
    Across these, as well as additional subtasks, the relative advantage of adding prosody was larger for recognized than for true words, suggesting that prosody is particularly helpful when word information is not perfect.
  
  
    We now consider ways to use DA modeling to enhance automatic speech recognition (ASR).
    The intuition behind this approach is that discourse context constrains the choice of DAs for a given utterance, and the DA type in turn constrains the choice of words.
    The latter can then be leveraged for more accurate speech recognition.
