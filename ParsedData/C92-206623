			We also conducted a similar experiment with the inside-outside algorithm for context-free grammar (Baker, 1979), starting with all pc~sible Chomsky Nor- mal Form rules over 4 non-terminals and the set of ter- minal symbols {a,b} (72 rules).
			The inferred grammar does not quite correctly model the language L. Fur- thermore, the algorithm does not converge as fast as in the case of SLTAG (See Figure 1).
