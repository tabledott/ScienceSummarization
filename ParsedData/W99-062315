et this is that less than 5% of the correct constituents are missing from the hypotheses generated by the union of the three parsers.
    The maximum precision oracle is an upper bound on the possible gain we can achieve by parse hybridization.
    We do not show the numbers for the Bayes models in Table 2 because the parameters involved were established using this set.
    The precision and recall of similarity switching and constituent voting are both significantly better than the best individual parser, and constituent voting is significantly better than parser switching in precision.4 Constituent voting gives the highest accuracy for parsing the Penn Treebank reported to date.
    Table 3 contains the results for evaluating our systems on the test set (section 22).
    All of these systems were run on data that was not seen during their development.
    The difference in precision between similarity and Bayes switching techniques is significant, but the difference in recall is not.
    This is the first s
