BC D. Although this property can potentially lead to certain problems with overgeneralization, there are a number of reasons why it should be viewed as a feature.
    First of all, it permits the system to generalize more quickly to unseen structures.
    For example, having seen the rule [question] [aux] [subject] [predicate] (as in &amp;quot;May I go?&amp;quot;) and the rule [question] [have] [subject] [link] [pred-adjective] (as in &amp;quot;Has he been good?&amp;quot;), the system would also understand the forms [question] = [have] [subject] [predicate] (as in &amp;quot;Has he left?&amp;quot;) and [question] [aux] [subject] [link] [pred-adjective] (as in &amp;quot;Should I be careful?&amp;quot;).&amp;quot; Secondly, it greatly simplifies the implementation, because rules do not have to be explicitly monitored during the parse.
    Given a particular parent and a particular child, the system can generate the allowable right siblings without having to note who the left siblings (beyond the immediate one) we
