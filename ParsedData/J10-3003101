    Because vectors that are more similar are more likely to have similar fingerprints, vectors (or distributions) can simply be compared by comparing their fingerprints, leading to a more efficient distributional similarity algorithm (Charikar 2002; Ravichandran, Pantel, and Hovy 2005).
    We also believe that the influence of the Web will extend to other avenues of paraphrase generation such as the aforementioned extrinsic evaluation or lack thereof.
    For example, Fujita and Sato (2008b) propose evaluating phrasal paraphrase pairs, automatically generated from a monolingual corpus, by querying the Web for snippets related to the pairs and using them as features to compute the pair&#8217;s paraphrasability.
    Combining Multiple Sources of Information.
    Another important trend in paraphrase generation is that of leveraging multiple sources of information to determine whether two units are paraphrastic.
    For example, Zhao et al. (2008) improve the sentential paraphrases that can be generated via t
