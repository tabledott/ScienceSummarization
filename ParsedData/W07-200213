			WSD is performed by assigning to each in duced cluster a score equal to the sum of weights of hyperedges found in the local context of the target word.
			The system was tested and tuned on 10 nouns of Senseval-3 lexical-sample.
			Official Results Participants were required to induce the senses of the target words and cluster all target word contextsaccordingly2.
			Table 2 summarizes the average num ber of induced senses as well as the real senses in the gold standard.
			2They were allowed to label each context with a weighted score vector, assigning a weight to each induced sense.
			In the unsupervised evaluation only the sense with maximum weightwas considered, but for the supervised one the whole score vector was used.
			However, none of the participating systems la beled any instance with more than one sense.
