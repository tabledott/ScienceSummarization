t, may exhibit great differences at the sentence level (reorderings, additions, etc).
    Therefore, they pose hard problems for the dynamic programming alignment approach.
    In contrast, our method is more robust.
    The document pair selection part plays a minor role; it only acts as a filter.
    We do not attempt to find the best-matching English document for each foreign one, but rather a set of similar documents.
    And, most importantly, we are able to reliably judge each sentence pair in isolation, without need for context.
    On the other hand, the dynamic programming approach enables discovery of many-to-one sentence alignments, whereas our method is limited to finding one-toone alignments.
    The approach of Fung and Cheung (2004) is a simpler version of ours.
    They match each foreign document with a set of English documents, using a threshold on their cosine similarity.
    Then, from each document pair, they generate all possible sentence pairs, compute their cosine similarity, and apply
