	A Simple and Effective Hierarchical Phrase Reordering Model
		While phrase-based statistical machine translation systems currently deliver state-of-the art performance, they remain weak on word order changes.
		Current phrase reordering models can properly handle swaps between adjacent phrases, but they typically lack theability to perform the kind of long-distance re orderings possible with syntax-based systems.
		In this paper, we present a novel hierarchical phrase reordering model aimed at improvingnon-local reorderings, which seamlessly in tegrates with a standard phrase-based system with little loss of computational efficiency.
		Weshow that this model can successfully han dle the key examples often used to motivate syntax-based systems, such as the rotation of a prepositional phrase around a noun phrase.
		We contrast our model with reordering models commonly used in phrase-based systems, and show that our approach provides statistically significant BLEU point gains for two language pairs: Chinese-En
