 the Cf.
    Accordingly, any hearer-old expression in utterance U, is given the highest preference as a potential antecedent for an anaphoric or functional anaphoric expression in 111&#177;1.
    Any mediated expression is ranked just below hearerold expressions.
    Any hearer-new expression is ranked lowest.
    Ordering constraint (2) fixes the ordering when the sets OLD, MED, or NEW contain elements of the same type.
    In these cases, the elements of each set are ranked according to their text position.
    In Table 12 we show the analysis of text fragment (2) using the basic algorithm see Table 3) with the basic functional Cf ranking constraints (see Table 9).
    The fragment starts with the evoked discourse entity SENTRY in (2a) (the definiteness of the NP indicates that it was already mentioned earlier in the text).
    The pronouns he in (2b) and (2c) are evoked, while signs and tunic are brand-new.
    We assume Mike in (2d) to be evoked, too (MIKE is the main character of that story).
