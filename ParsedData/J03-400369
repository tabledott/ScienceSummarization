 are added to the nonterminals, and the base-NP/nonrecursive NP distinction is made, then the coverage problem is made worse.
    Table 11 gives the statistics in this case.
    By our counts, 17.1% of all sentences (1 in 5.8 sentences) contain at least 1 one-count rule. the impact of the coverage problem on parsing accuracy.
    Section 0 of the treebank was parsed with models 1 and 2 as before, but the parse trees were restricted to include rules already seen in training data.
    Table 12 shows the results.
    Restricting the rules leads to a 0.5% decrease in recall and a 1.6% decrease in precision for model 1, and a 0.9% decrease in recall and a 2.0% decrease in precision for model 2. only motivation for breaking down rules.
    The method may also improve estimation.
    To see this, consider the rules headed by told, whose counts are shown in Table 13.
    Estimating the probability P(Rule  |VP, told) using Charniak&#8217;s (1997) method would interpolate two maximum-likelihood estimates: &#955;Pml(Rul
