ody is important for DA recognition for two reasons.
    First, as we saw earlier, word-based classification suffers from recognition errors.
    Second, some utterances are inherently ambiguous based on words alone.
    For example, some YES-No-QUESTIONS have word sequences identical to those of STATEMENTS, but can often be distinguished by their final FO rise.
    A detailed study aimed at automatic prosodic classification of DAs in the Switchboard domain is available in a companion paper (Shriberg et al. 1998).
    Here we investigate the interaction of prosodic models with the dialogue grammar and the word-based DA models discussed above.
    We also touch briefly on alternative machine learning models for prosodic features. tures computed automatically from the waveform, without reference to word or phone information.
    The features can be broadly grouped as referring to duration (e.g., utterance duration, with and without pauses), pauses (e.g., total and mean of nonspeech regions exceeding 100 ms), pi
