    These problems have prompted a more flexible FS representation for attributive adjectives &#8212; functions from the meaning of a noun onto the meaning of a modified noun (Montague, 1970a).
    This mapping could now be sensitive to the particular noun the adjective receives, and it does not need to return a subset of the original noun denotation (as in the case of fake N).
    However, FS has nothing to say on how these functions should be constructed.
    In the last few years there have been attempts to build compositional models that use distributional semantic representations as inputs (see Section 2 below), most of them focusing on the combination of a verb and its arguments.
    This paper addresses instead the combination of nouns and attributive adjectives.
    This case was chosen as an interesting testbed because it has the property of recursivity (it applies in black dog, but also in large black do
