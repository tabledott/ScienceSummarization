 description (via increased cross-entropy, we might say).
    In practice, the collapsing of signatures is rejected by the MDL measure that we have implemented here.
    In work in progress, we treat groups of signatures (as defined here) as parts of larger groups, called paradigms.
    A paradigm consisting of the suffixes NULL.ed.ing.s, for example, includes all 15 possible combinations of these suffixes.
    We can in general estimate the number of stems we would expect to appear with zero counts for one or more of the suffixes, given a frequency distribution, such as a multinomial distribution, for the suffixes.'
    In this way, we can establish some reasonable frequencies for the case of stems appearing in a corpus with only a single suffix.
    It appears at this time that the unavailability of this information is the single most significant cause of inaccuracies in the present algorithm.
    It is thus of considerable importance to get a handle on such estimates.'
