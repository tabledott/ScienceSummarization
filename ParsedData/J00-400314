s to try to keep the rules for processing them fairly separate from those for processing other types of descriptions and to attempt to use agreement measures to evaluate the performance of the system, in addition to more traditional precision and recall figures.
    The results discussed above further support Fraurud's (1990) criticism of the approach to processing definite NPs based on the assumption that they are primarily anaphoric.
    Because of the large proportion of first-mention definites found in the texts she examined, Fraurud (1990, 421) claims that: a model where the processing of first-mention definites always involves a failing search for an already established discourse referent as a first step seems less attractive.
    A reverse ordering of the procedures is, quite obviously, no solution to this problem, but a simultaneous processing as proposed by Bosch and Geurts (1989) might be.
    Fraurud proposes, contra Heim (1982), that processing a definite NP may involve establishing a new discours
