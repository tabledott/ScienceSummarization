pact on overall dependency recovery.
    Although there is now a sizable literature on trace and function-tag insertion algorithms (Blaheta and Charniak 2000; Johnson 2002; Campbell 2004), and integrated parsing with function tags or null elements (Dienes and Dubey 2003a, 2003b; Merlo and Musillo 2005; Gabbard, Kulick, and Marcus 2006), such approaches typically require additional pre- or postprocessing steps that are likely to add further noise and errors to the parser output.
    A completely integrated approach that is based on a syntactic representation which allows direct recovery of the underlying predicate&#8211;argument structure might therefore be preferable.
    Such representations are provided by grammar formalisms that are more expressive than simple phrase-structure grammar, like Lexical-Functional Grammar (LFG) (Kaplan and Bresnan 1982), Head-driven Phrase-Structure Grammar (HPSG) (Pollard and Sag 1994), Tree-Adjoining Grammar (TAG) (Joshi and Schabes 1992), Minimalist Program&#8211;related Gra
