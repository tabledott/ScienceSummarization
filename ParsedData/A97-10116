 he thought that the linear order of the words does not belong to the syntactic level of representation which comprises the structural order only.
    Some early formalisations, c.f.
    (Hays, 1964), have brought the strict projectivity (context-free) requirement into the dependency framework.
    This kind of restriction is present in many dependency-based parsing systems (McCord, 1990; Sleator and Ternperley, 1991; Eisner, 1996).
    But obviously any recognition grammar should deal with non-projective phenomena to the extent they occur in natural languages as, for example, in the analysis shown in Figure 2.
    Our system has no in-built restrictions concerning projectivity, though the formalism allows us to state when crossing links are not permitted.
    We maintain that one is generally also interested in the linear order of elements, and therefore it is presented in the tree diagrams.
    But, for some purposes, presenting all arguments in a canonical order might be more adequate.
    This, however, i
