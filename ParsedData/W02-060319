rder of the segments.
    The following step consists in retrieving the segmentation produced by one of the unsupervised segmentation algorithms, and trying to align this segand Finnish word forms.
    The Finnish words are auton (car&#8217;s), puutaloja ([some/ wooden houses) and tehnyt ([has/ done).
    The tags are A (adjective), ACT (active voice), ADV (adverb), CMP (comparative), GEN (genitive), N (noun), PCP2 (2nd participle), PL (plural), PTV (partitive), SG (singular), V (verb), and &lt;DER:ly&gt; (-ly derivative). mentation with the desired morphemic label sequence (cf.
    Figure 4).
    A good segmentation algorithm will produce morphs that align gracefully with the correct morphemic labels, preferably producing a one-to-one mapping.
    A one-to-many mapping from morphs to labels is also acceptable, when a morph forms a common entity, such as the suffix ja in puutaloja, which contains both the plural and partitive element.
    By contrast, a many-to-one mapping from morphs to a label is a sign of
