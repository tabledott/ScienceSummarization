cture of WordNet: for instance, in WordNet the nouns room, wall, and floor are encoded as part of building but not of house (see Figure 2).
    In summary, our tests have shown that the knowledge encoded in WordNet is not sufficient to interpret all semantic relations between a bridging description and its antecedent found in the kind of text we are dealing with: only 46% of the relations observed were encoded in WordNet.
    The possibility of using domain-specific, automatically acquired lexical information for this purpose is being explored: see, for example, Poesio, Schulte im Walde, and Brew (1998).
    In addition, we found that just looking for the closest semantic relative is not enough to find anchors for bridging descriptions; this search has to be constrained by some type of focusing mechanism, Identifying named entity types is a prerequisite for resolving descriptions based on names.
    The simple heuristics discussed in Section 5.4 identified entity types for 66% (535/814) of all names in the co
