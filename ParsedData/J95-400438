eatures are prespecified.
    Then, for unknown words: Using this equation for unknown word emit probabilities within the stochastic tagger, an accuracy of 85% was obtained on the Wall Street Journal corpus.
    This portion of the stochastic model has over 1,000 parameters, with 108 possible unique emit probabilities, as opposed to a small number of simple rules that are learned and used in the rule-based approach.
    In addition, the transformation-based method learns specific cues instead of requiring them to be prespecified, allowing for the possibility of uncovering cues not apparent to the human language engineer.
    We have obtained comparable performance on unknown words, while capturing the information in a much more concise and perspicuous manner, and without prespecifying any information specific to English or to a specific corpus.
    In table 2, we show tagging results obtained on a number of different corpora, in each case training on roughly 9.5 x 105 words total and testing on a separate tes
