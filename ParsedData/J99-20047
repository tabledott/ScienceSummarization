    These systems use grammars that are represented as cascaded finite-state regular expression recognizers.
    The regular expressions are usually hand-crafted.
    Each recognizer in the cascade provides a locally optimal output.
    The output of these systems is mostly in the form of noun groups and verb groups rather than constituent structure, often called a shallow parse.
    There are no clause-level attachments or modifier attachments in the shallow parse.
    These parsers always produce one output, since they use the longestmatch heuristic to resolve cases of ambiguity when more than one regular expression matches the input string at a given position.
    At present none of these systems use any statistical information to resolve ambiguity.
    The grammar itself can be partitioned into domain-independent and domain-specific regular express
