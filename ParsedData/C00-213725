 In this example, there are 10"1 relations that should be found (are of interest).
  Of these, 19 are recalled by both methods, 28 are recalled by method I but not; II, and 6 are recalled by II but not I.
  The correlation coeificient estilnate between the methods recalls is 0.35.
  In addi- tion, 5 stmrious (not of interest) relations arc found by both methods, with method I find- ing an additional 43 Sl)uriolls relationships (not found by method II) and me?hod II finding an additional 9 relationships.
  There are a total of 28+6+43+9=86 relations that are found (whether of interest oi not) by one method, but not the other.
  This is too many to t)erfornl an exact randolnizgtion, so a 1048576 trial apt)roximate randomization is perfornmd.
  In 96 of these trials, method Is recall is greater than method iIs recall by at, least (45.6%-24.3%).
  Similarly, in 14794 of the trials, the F-score difference is at least (47.5%-35.2%).
  In 25770 of the trials, method IIs precision is greater than method Is precision
