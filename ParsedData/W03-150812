eral characters sharing the same pin-yin symbol is somewhat arbitrary.
  
  
    Several multi-lingual speech and text applications require some form of name transliteration, crosslingual spoken document retrieval being a prototypical example.
    We build upon the experimental infrastructure developed at the 2000 Johns Hopkins Summer Workshop (Meng et al., 2000) where considerable work was done towards indexing and retrieving Mandarin audio to match English text queries.
    Specifically, we find that in a large number of queries used in those experiments, English proper names are not available in the translation lexicon, and are subsequently ignored during retrieval.
    We use the technique described above to transliterate all such names into Chinese characters and observe the effect on retrieval performance.
    The TDT-2 corpus, which we use for our experiments, contains 2265 audio clips of Mandarin news stories, along with several thousand contemporaneously published Chinese text articles, and English t
