 baseline.
    Second, we see that even after the initial unambiguous role assignment step, the algorithm achieves close to the baseline percent correct.
    Furthermore, over 96% of the initially assigned roles are correct.
    This means that much of the work in narrowing down the candidate lists is actually being preformed during frame matching.
    It is noteworthy that such a simple method of choosing the initial candidates can be so useful, and it would seem that even supervised methods might benefit from employing such an explicit use of the lexicon to narrow down role candidates for a slot.
    After unambiguous role assignment, about 21% of the test data remains unassigned (116 slots).
    Of these 116 slots, 100 have a non-null candidate list.
    These 100 are assigned by our iterative probability model, so we are especially interested in the results on them.
    We find that 76 of these 100 are assigned correctly (accounting for the 13.7% increase to 90.1%), and 24 are assigned incorrectly, yieldi
