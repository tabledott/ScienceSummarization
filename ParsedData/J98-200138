sagreement was not so much annotators' errors as the fact, already mentioned, that the classes are not mutually exclusive.
    The confusion matrix in Table 4 indicates that the major classes of disagreements were definite descriptions classified by annotator A as larger situation and by annotator B as associative, and vice versa.
    One such example is the government in (20).
    This definite description could be classified as larger situation because it refers to the government of Korea, and presumably the fact that Korea has a government is shared knowledge; but it could also be classified as being associative on the predicate Koreans.'
    We will analyze the reasons for the disagreement in more detail in relation to our second experiment, in which we also asked the annotators to indicate the antecedent of definite descriptions. in this experiment, we were able to confirm the correlation observed by Hawkins between the syntactic structure of certain definite descriptions and their classification as disc
