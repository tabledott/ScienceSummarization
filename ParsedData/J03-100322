e graph in Figure 3 is planar, as is any graph with only four vertices).
    In general, there is no a priori reason to assume that our scene representations will be planar.
    Yet every nonplanar graph can be modified into a closely related planar one.
    We briefly address planarization of scene graphs in the Appendix.
    A final alternative is worth mentioning.
    The general approach to the problem of subgraph isomorphism detection assumes that both graphs are given on-line.
    For our current purposes, however, it may happen that the scene graph is fixed and known beforehand, and only the referring graph is unknown and given on-line.
    Messmer and Bunke (1995, 1998) describe a method that converts the known graph (or model graph, as they call it) into a decision tree.
    At run time, the input graph is classified by the decision tree, which detects subgraph isomorphisms.
    The disadvantage of this approach is that the decision tree may contain, in the worst case, an exponential number of nodes.
