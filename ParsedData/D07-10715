			2.1 Semantics.
			Training examples in our approach consist of sen tences paired with lambda-calculus expressions.
			We use a version of the lambda calculus that is closely related to the one presented by Carpenter (1997).There are three basic types: t, the type of truth val 1He and Young (2006) do not give results for recovering fully correct parses.
			ues; e, the type for entities; and r, the type for realnumbers.
			Functional types are defined by specify ing their input and output types, for example ?e, t?is the type of a function from entities to truth val ues.
			In general, declarative sentences have a logical form of type t. Question sentences generally have functional types.2 Each expression is constructed from constants, logical connectors, quantifiers and lambda functions.
			2.2 Combinatory Categorial Grammars.
			Combinatory categorial grammar (CCG) is a syn tactic theory that models a wide range of linguistic phenom
