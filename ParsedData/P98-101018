or example, identifying only a four-word portion of this pattern would yield both a recall and precision errors.
    Tagassignment scoring, on the other hand, will give it a score of 80%.
    We hold the view that such an identification is an error, rather than a partial success.
    We used the datasets created by RM95 for NP learning; their results are shown in Table 3.3 The Fo difference is small (0.4%), yet they use a richer feature set, which incorporates lexical information as well.
    The method of Ramshaw and Marcus makes a decision per word, relying on predefined rule templates.
    The method presented here makes decisions on sequences and uses sequences as its memory, thereby attaining a dynamic perspective of the last line shows the results of Ramshaw and Marcus (1995) (recognizing NP's) with the same train/test data.
    The optimal parameters were obtained by 5-fold cross-validation. pattern structure.
    We aim to incorporate lexical information as well in the future, it is still unclear whet
