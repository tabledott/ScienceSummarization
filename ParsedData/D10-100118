 in a parse tree, there must be exactly one production higher in the tree that generates (X, i, j) as one of its children.
    The constraints in Eq.
    7 enforce consistency between the &#181;(i, Y ) variables and rule variables higher in the tree.
    Note that the constraints in Eqs.
    (5&#8211;7) can be written in the form A&#181; = b, &#181; &#8805; 0, as in Eq.
    4.
    Under these definitions, we have the following: Theorem 5.1 Define Y to be the set of all CFG parses, as defined in section 4.
    Then Proof: This theorem is a special case of Martin et al. (1990), theorem 2.
    The marginal polytope for tagging, conv(Z), can also be expressed using linear constraints as in Eq.
    4; see figure 3.
    These constraints follow from results for graphical models (Wainwright and Jordan, 2008), or from the Martin et al. (1990) construction.
    As a final point, the following theorem gives an important property of marginal polytopes, which we will use at several points in this paper: Theorem 5.2 (Kort
