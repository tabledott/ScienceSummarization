 al. (2001) presented parsing results for a DOP tree-gram model using a small data set (500 sentences) and semiautomatic morphological disambiguation.
    Tsarfaty (2006) was the first to demonstrate that fully automatic Hebrew parsing is feasible using the newly available 5000 sentences treebank.
    Tsarfaty and Sima&#8217;an (2007) have reported state-of-the-art results on Hebrew unlexicalized parsing (74.41%) albeit assuming oracle morphological segmentation.
    The joint morphological and syntactic hypothesis was first discussed in (Tsarfaty, 2006; Tsarfaty and Sima&#8217;an, 2004) and empirically explored in (Tsarfaty, 2006).
    Tsarfaty (2006) used a morphological analyzer (Segal, 2000), a PoS tagger (Bar-Haim et al., 2005), and a general purpose parser (Schmid, 2000) in an integrated framework in which morphological and syntactic components interact to share information, leading to improved performance on the joint task.
    Cohen and Smith (2007) later on based a system for joint inference on facto
