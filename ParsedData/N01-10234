8220;label&#8221; given an input sentence.
    For example, given the sentence Pierre Vinken will join the board as a non-executive director, the parser is expected to produce an output as shown in Figure 1.
    Since the entire parse cannot be reasonably considered as a monolithic label, the usual method in parsing is to decompose the structure assigned in the following way: However, such a recursive decomposition of structure does not allow a simple notion of a tag dictionary.
    We solve this problem by decomposing the structure in an approach that is different from that shown above which uses context-free rules.
    The approach uses the notion of tree rewriting as defined in the Lexicalized Tree Adjoining Grammar (LTAG) formalism (Joshi and Schabes, 1992)1 which retains the notion of lexicalization that is crucial in the success of a statistical parser while permitting a simple definition of tag dictionary.
    For example, the parse in Figure 1 can be generated by assigning the structured labels shown
