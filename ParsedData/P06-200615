 this genre.
    We also catalogued incorrect PoS tags from WSJ parse failures and manually modified the tagger lexicon where appropriate.
    These modifications mostly consisted of adjusting lexical probabilities of extant entries with highly-skewed distributions.
    We also added some tags to extant entries for infrequent words.
    These modifications took a further day.
    The tag transition probabilities were not reestimated.
    Thus, we have made no use of the PTB itself and only limited use of WSJ text.
    This method of grammar and lexicon development incrementally improves the overall performance of the system averaged across all the datasets that it has been applied to.
    It is very likely that retraining the PoS tagger on the WSJ and retraining the parser using PTB would yield a system which would perform more effectively on DepBank.
    However, one of our goals is to demonstrate that an unlexicalized parser trained on a modest amount of annotated text from other sources, coupled to a tagge
