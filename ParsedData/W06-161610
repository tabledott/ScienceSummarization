irst introduce some of the concepts of linear and integer linear programming (for a more thorough introduction see Winston and Venkataramanan (2003)).
    Linear Programming (LP) is a tool for solving optimisation problems in which the aim is to maximise (or minimise) a given linear function with respect to a set of linear constraints.
    The function to be maximised (or minimised) is referred to as the objective function.
    A number of decision variables are under our control which exert influence on the objective function.
    Specifically, they have to be optimised in order to maximise (or minimise) the objective function.
    Finally, a set of constraints restrict the values that the decision variables can take.
    Integer Linear Programming is an extension of linear programming where all decision variables must take integer values.
    There are several explicit formulations of the MST problem as an integer linear program in the literature (Williams, 2002).
    They are based on the concept of elimin
