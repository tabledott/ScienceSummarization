two steps: 1.
    For each constituent P &gt; in the parse tree a simple set of rules' identifies which of the children Ci is the 'head-child' of P. For example, NN would be identified as the head-child of NP &lt;DET .13 33 NN&gt;, VP would be identified as the head-child of S &lt;NP VP&gt;.
    Head-words 2.
    Head-modifier relationships are now extracted from the tree in Figure 2.
    Figure 3 illustrates how each constituent contributes a set of dependency relationships.
    VBD is identified as the head-child of VP &#8212;&gt; &lt;VBD NP NP&gt;.
    The head-words of the two NPs, resignation and yesterday, both modify the head-word of the VBD, announced.
    Dependencies are labeled by the modifier non-terminal, NP in both of these cases, the parent non-terminal, VP, and finally the head-child non-terminal, VBD.
    The triple of nonterminals at the start, middle and end of the arrow specify the nature of the dependency relationship &#8212; &lt;NP , S , VP&gt; represents a subject-verb dependency, &lt;P
