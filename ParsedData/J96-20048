ss how well the coders agreed on the absence of boundaries, or to compare measures (1) and (4).
    In addition, note that since false positives and missed negatives are rolled together in the denominator of the figure, measure (1) does not really distinguish expert and naive coder roles as much as it might.
    Nonetheless, this style of measure does have some advantages over measures (2), (3), and (4), since these measures produce artificially high agreement figures when one category of a set predominates, as is the case with boundary judgments.
    One would expect measure (1)'s results to be high under any circumstances, and it is not affected by the density of boundaries.
    So far, we have shown that all four of these measures produce figures that are at best, uninterpretable and at worst, misleading.
    KID make no comment about the meaning of their figures other than to say that the amount of agreement they show is reasonable; Silverman et al. simply point out that where figures are calculated over
