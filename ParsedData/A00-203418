only as many times as the item is in both sets.
    For example, if one slot contained the argument heads (person, person, person, child, man, spokeswoman), and the other slot contained {person, person, child, chair, collection}, then the intersection would be {person, person, child}, and LO would be t .
    This measure ranges between zero (no overlap) and I (where one set is a proper subset of that at the other slot).
    Using the Mann Whitney U test on the LO scores, we obtained a z score of 2.00.
    This is significant to the 95% level, a lower level than that for the classbased experiments.
    The results using the mean and median of the LO scores are shown in table 3.
    Performance is lower than that for the class-based experiments.
    The outcome for the individual verbs using the mean as a threshold was:add admit answer borrow choose climb cost declare demand drink eat feel imagine notice outline pack paint perform plan practise prescribe proclaim read remain sing steal suck survive understand w
