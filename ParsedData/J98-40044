 in the Penn II treebank corpora (Marcus, Santorini, and Marcinkiewicz 1993) and the &amp;quot;Chomsky adjunction&amp;quot; representation now standardly assumed in generative linguistics.
    One of the weaknesses of a PCFG model is that it is insensitive to nonlocal relationships between nodes.
    If these relationships are significant then a PCFG will be a poor language model.
    Indeed, the sense in which the set of trees generated by a CFG is &amp;quot;context free&amp;quot; is precisely that the label on a node completely characterizes the relationships between the subtree dominated by the node and the nodes that properly dominate this subtree.
    Roughly speaking, the more nodes in the trees of the training corpus, the stronger the independence assumptions in the PCFG language model induced from those trees.
    For example, a PCFG induced from a corpus of completely flat trees (i.e., consisting of the root node immediately dominating a string of terminals) generates precisely the strings of trainin
