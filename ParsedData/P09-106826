6;Typed Chain&#8217; in figure 6 shows the average ranked position over the test set.
    The untyped chains plateau and begin to worsen as the amount of training data increases, but the typed model is able to improve for some time after.
    We see a 6.9% gain at 2004 when both lines trend upwards.
    The second evaluation compares the performance of the narrative schema model against single narrative chains.
    We ignore argument types and use untyped chains in both (using equation 1 instead of 4).
    The dotted line &#8216;Chain&#8217; and solid &#8216;Schema&#8217; show performance results in figure 6.
    Narrative Schemas have better ranked scores in all data sizes and follow the previous experiment in improving results as more data is added even though untyped chains trend upward.
    We see a 3.3% gain at 2004.
    The final evaluation combines schemas with argument types to measure overall gain.
    We evaluated with both head words and CBC clusters as argument representations.
    Not only do typ
