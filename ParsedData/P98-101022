    We have presented a novel general schema and a particular instantiation of it for learning sequential patterns.
    Applying the method to three syntactic patterns in English yielded positive results, suggesting its applicability for recognizing local linguistic patterns.
    In future work we plan to investigate a datadriven approach for optimal selection and weighting of statistical features of candidate scores, as well as to apply the method to syntactic patterns of Hebrew and to domain-specific patterns for information extraction.
