erives from its equality mechanism .
  This subcomponent allows one to make two semantic individuals co-designating, i.e., to "equate" them .
  Facts that formerly held of only one individual are then copied to its co-designating siblings .
  This in turn enables inference that may have been previously inhibited because the necessary antecedents were distributed ove r (what were then) distinct individuals .
  This equality machinery is exploited at many levels in processing semantic and domain constraints .
  One of the clearest such uses is in enforcing the semantics of coreference, either definite reference or appositional coreference.
  Take for example the following phrase from the walkthrough message, which we show here a s parsed by the phraser.
