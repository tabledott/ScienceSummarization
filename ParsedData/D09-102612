 correspondence between the labels and topics, the model can display automatic topical summaries for each label k in terms of the topic-specific distribution &#946;k.
    Similarly, since the model assigns a label zz to each word wz in the document d automatically, we can now extract portions of the document relevant to each label k (it would be all words wz E w(d) such that zz = k).
    In addition, we can use the topic distribution &#952;(d) to rank the user specified labels in the order of their relevance to the document, thereby also eliminating spurious ones if necessary.
    Finally, we note that other less restrictive variants of the proposed L-LDA model are possible.
    For example, one could consider a version that allows topics that do not correspond to the label set of a given document with a small probability, or one that allows a common background topic in all documents.
    We did implement these variants in our preliminary experiments, but they did not yield better performance than L-LDA in th
