d to the variable.
    The input representation for sentence (2) is, then, the following (ignoring tense): A complex term can be read &amp;quot;quantifier variable such that restriction&amp;quot;, e.g., &amp;quot;most c such that c is a company&amp;quot;.
    The output language is identical to the input language, except that it does not contain complex terms.
    Quantifiers are expressed in the output language as operators that take three arguments: the variable bound by the quantifier, a wff restricting the range of the quantified variable, and the body scoped by the quantification, schematically quantifier(variable, restriction, body) This encoding of quantification is the same as that found in Woods (1977) and Moore (1981).
    We will refer to such expressions as quantified wffs.
    Thus, one reading for sentence (2) is represented by the following quantified wff: Intermediate structures built during the course of scoping include both complex terms and quantified wffs.
    We use the term full scoping
