eriments to be run without concern about the cost, availability and reliability of human evaluators.
    The filter-based approach is designed to identify likely (source word, target word)' pairs, using a statistical decision procedure.
    Candidate word pairs are drawn from a corpus of aligned sentences: (S, T) is a candidate if T appears in the translation of a sentence containing S. In the simplest case, the decision procedure considers all candidates for inclusion in the lexicon; but the new framework allows a cascade of non-statistical filters to remove inappropriate pairs from consideration.
    Each filter is based on a particular knowledge source, and can be placed into the cascade independently of the others.
    The knowledge sources investigated here are: [Bro94] investigated the statistical use of MRBDs, though not as filters.
    The other three knowledge sources have not previously been used for the task of inducing translation lexicons.
