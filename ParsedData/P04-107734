    Once we have acquired synonym and paraphrase data, we then need to design a soft matching function that assigns partial credits to these approximate matches.
    In this scenario, statistically generated data has the advantage of being able to provide scores reflecting the strength of similarity between synonyms and paraphrased.
    ROUGE-L, ROUGE-W, and ROUGE-S have also been applied in automatic evaluation of summarization and achieved very promising results (Lin 2004).
    In Lin and Och (2004), we proposed a framework that automatically evaluated automatic MT evaluation metrics using only manual translations without further human involvement.
    According to the results reported in that paper, ROUGE-L, ROUGE-W, and ROUGE-S also outperformed BLEU and NIST.
