ed as in the Baseline system.5 String match feature.
    Soon&#8217;s string match feature (SOON STR) tests whether the two NPs under consideration are the same string after removing determiners from each.
    We hypothesized, however, that splitting this feature into several primitive features, depending on the type of NP, might give the learning algorithm additional flexibility in creating coreference rules.
    Exact string match is likely to be a better coreference predictor for proper names than it is for pronouns, for example.
    Specifically, we replace the SOON STR feature with three features &#8212; PRO STR, PN STR, and WORDS STR &#8212; which restrict the application of string matching to pronouns, proper names, and non-pronominal NPs, respectively.
    (See the first entries in Table 3.)
    Although similar feature splits might have been considered for other features (e.g.
    GENDER and NUMBER), only the string match feature was tested here.
