ds, rather thanproperties of individual words, considered in isolation.
			For example, consider the knowledge en coded in WordNet: much of the knowledge in WordNet is embedded in the graph structure that connects words.
			Analogies of the form A:B::C:D are calledproportional analogies.
			These types of lowerlevel analogies may be contrasted with higher level analogies, such as the analogy between the solar system and Rutherford?s model of the atom (Falkenhainer et al, 1989), which are sometimes called conceptual analogies.
			We believe that the difference between these two types is largely a matter of complexity.
			A higher-level analogy is composed of many lower-level analogies.
			Progresswith algorithms for processing lower-level analo gies will eventually contribute to algorithms for higher-level analogies.The idea of subsuming a broad range of semantic phenomena under analogies has been sug gested by many researchers.
