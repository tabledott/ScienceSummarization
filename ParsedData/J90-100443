ished the delayed rules are applied and the correct forms can be chosen deterministically.
    The delay mechanism is useful in the following two general cases: First, the mechanism is useful if an inflectional variant depends on syntatic features that are not yet available.
    The particular choice of whether a verb has singular or plural inflection depends on the syntactic agreement features of its subject; these are only available after the subject has been generated.
    Other examples may include the particular choice of personal and relative pronouns, and so forth.
    Second, delaying lexical choice is useful when there are several variants for some word that are equally possible because they are semantically and syntactically identical.
    For example, a word may have several spelling variants.
    If we delay orthography then the generation process computes with only one &amp;quot;abstract&amp;quot; variant.
    After the generation process is completed, several variants can be filled in for this a
