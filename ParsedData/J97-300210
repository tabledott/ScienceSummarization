preted just as in a simple transduction grammar, except that two possible orientations are allowed.
    Pure simple transduction grammars have the implicit characteristic that for both output streams, the symbols generated by the right-hand-side constituents of a production are concatenated in the same left-to-right order.
    Inversion transduction grammars also allow such productions, which are said to have straight orientation.
    In addition, however, inversion transduction grammars allow productions with inverted orientation, which generate output for stream 2 by emitting the constituents on a production's right-hand side in right-to-left order.
    We indicate a production's orientation with explicit notation for the two varieties of concatenation operators on string-pairs.
    The operator [1 performs the &amp;quot;usual&amp;quot; pairwise concatenation so that [AB] yields the string-pair (C1, C2) where C1 =Bi and C2 = A2B2.
    But the operator () concatenates constituents on output stream 1 while re
