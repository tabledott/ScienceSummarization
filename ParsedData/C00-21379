e transformatiol&gt;rulc t)ased t.cch- nique was rUll with diflerent sets of start ing con- ditions and/or  different, but overlapl)ing , sub- sets of the training set.
  Recall comparisons were ma(le on the same test (lata.
  set 1)etween l;he d i f fcrent variations.
  Many of the comparisons were, of how well two wu:iations recalled a particular subset of the relations.
  A total of 40 compar- isons were made..
  The r]2s on all d0 were 1)osi- tire.
  3 of the r,2s w(~re ill the 0.20-0.30 range.
  24 of the rj2s wore in the 0.50--0.79 range.
  13 of the r]2s were in the 0.80-1.0() range.
  So in our ext)erin~ents, we were usually eom- t)aring 1)ositivcly correlated results.
  How much error is introdu(:e(t t)y assuming independence?
  An easy--to-analyze case is when the stan- dard devial,ions for the results being eoml)ared a:tc the same.
  ?~ J}hen equation 2 reduces to s , , -  sV /2 ( l -  r12), where s = sl = ,s2.
  If one, assumes the re.sults me indcpel:dent (~/SSllllle r,2 = 0), then sd :-~ .sv/22.
