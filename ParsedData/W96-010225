lete tagger generation process on a 2 million words training set (lexicon construction and known and unknown words case-base construction), and tested on 200,000 test words.
    Performance on known words, unknown words, and total are given in Table 4.
    In this experiment, numbers were not stored in the known words case base; they are looked up in the unknown words case base.
    'We are not convinced that variation in the results of the experiments in a 10-fold-cv set-up is statistically meaningful (the 10 experiments are not independent), but follow common practice here.
  
  
    A case-based approach, similar to our memory-based approach, was also proposed by Cardie (1993a, 1994) for sentence analysis in limited domains (not only POS tagging but also semantic tagging and structural disambiguation).
    We will discuss only the reported POS tagging results here.
    Using a fairly complex case representation based on output from the CIRCUS conceptual sentence analyzer (22 local context features describi
