uld be possible to increase variability by extending the corpus to include human-translated parallel text, or by combining evidence from multiple or more distantly related source languages in the spirit of Resnik and Yarowsky (1999).
    On inspecting the target sets qualitatively, we find that they contain many outliers, largely owing to noisy alignment.
    The problem worsens when the outliers are monosemous, since a monosemous word with a misleading sense will erroneously bias the sense tag assignment for the other target set words.
    For example, the word types adolescence, idol, teen, and teenager form a target set for the French source word adolescence, and the presence of idol has a negative impact ort the sense assignment for the other members of the set.
    In addition, semantically distant words can align with the same source word; e.g., amorce in French may align with initiation, bait, and cap, which are all correct translations in suitable contexts but provide Ito suitable basis for semantic r
