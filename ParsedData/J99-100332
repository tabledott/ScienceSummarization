 heuristic filter, this one will reject some perfectly valid candidates.
    If a more precise bitext map is desired, some of these valid chains can be recovered during an extra sweep through the bitext space.
    Since bitext maps are mostly injective, valid chains that are rejected by the angle deviation filter usually occur between two accepted chains, as shown in Figure 7.
    If Chains C and D are accepted as valid, then the slope of the TBM between the end of Chain C and the start of Chain D must be much closer to the slope of Chain X than to the slope of the main diagonal.
    Chain X should be accepted.
    During a second pass through the bitext space, SIMR searches for sandwiched chains in any space between two accepted chains that is large enough to accommodate another chain.
    This subspace of the bitext space will have its own main diagonal.
    The slope of this local main diagonal can be quite different from the slope of the global main diagonal.
