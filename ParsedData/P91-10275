and makes a permanent judgment on a single example will always degrade as the number of occurrences increases.
    In fact, making a judgment based on any fixed number of examples with any finite error rate will always lead to degradation with corpussize.
    A better approach is to require a fixed percentage of the total occurrences of any given verb to appear with a given SF before concluding that random error is not responsible for these observations.
    Unfortunately, determining the cutoff percentage requires human intervention and sampling error makes classification unstable for verbs with few occurrences in the input.
    The sampling error can be dealt with (Brent, 1991) but predetermined cutoff percentages still require eye-balling the data.
    Thus robust, unsupervised judgments in the face of error pose the third challenge to developing an accurate learning system.
    The architecture of the system, and that of this paper, directly reflects the three challenges described above.
    The system co
