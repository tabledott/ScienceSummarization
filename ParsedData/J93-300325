pitch between the last pitch accent of the current intermediate phrase and the beginning of the next&#8212;or the end of the utterance.
    An intonational phrase is composed of one of more intermediate phrases, plus a boundary tone.
    Boundary tones may be high (H%) or low (L%) also, and fall exactly at the edge of the intonational phrase.
    So, each intonational phrase ends with a phrase accent and a boundary tone.
    A given sentence may be uttered with considerable variation in phrasing.
    For example, the utterance in Figure 2 was produced as a single intonational phrase, whereas in Figure 5 now is set off as a separate phrase.
    Intuitively, prosodic phrases divide an utterance into meaningful &amp;quot;chunks&amp;quot; of information (Bolinger 1989).
    Variation in phrasing can change the meaning hearers assign to tokens of a given sentence.
    For example, the interpretation of a sentence like Bill doesn't drink because he's unhappy is likely to change, depending upon whether it is uttered
