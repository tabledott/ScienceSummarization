ned an average POS tagging accuracy of 83.1% for that set of features.
    The features that worked well for English POS tagging did not seem to apply to Chinese in the maximum entropy framework.
    Language differences between Chinese and English have no doubt made the direct porting of an English POS tagging method to Chinese ineffective.
  
  
    Since one-at-a-time, word-based POS tagging did not yield good accuracy, we proceeded to investigate other combinations of processing architecture and feature representation.
    We observed that character features were successfully used to build our word segmenter and that of (Xue and Shen, 2003).
    Similarly, character features were used to build a maximum entropy Chinese parser by (Luo, 2003), where his parser could perform word segmentation, POS tagging, and parsing in an integrated, unified approach.
    We hypothesized that assigning POS tags on a character-by-character basis, making use of character features in the surrounding context may yield good acc
