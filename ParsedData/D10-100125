e in practice; we use it in this paper.
    In our experiments we found that in the vast majority of cases, case 1 applies, after a small number of iterations; see the next section for more details.
  
  
    u(k+1) , u(k) where g(k) is the subgradient of L at u(k) and &gt; 0 is the step size of the update.
    The complete subgradient algorithm is given in figure 4.
    The following convergence theorem is well-known (e.g., see page 120 of Korte and Vygen (2008)): Theorem 6.1 If limk,,,,, = 0 and = oo, then limk,,,,, L(u(k)) = L(u).
    The following proposition is easily verified: Proposition 6.1 The algorithm in figure is an instantiation of the algorithm in figure 4,8 with = X2 = conv(i), and the matrices E and F defined to be binary matrices specifying the constraints &#181;(i, t) = v(i, t) for all (i, t) E Zuni.
    Under an appropriate definition of the step sizes it follows that the algorithm in figure 1 defines a sequence of Lagrange multiplers u(k) minimizing a dual of the LP relaxation in Eq.
