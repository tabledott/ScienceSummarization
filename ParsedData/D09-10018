    Unsupervised semantic parsing (USP) rests on three key ideas.
    First, the target predicate and object constants, which are pre-specified in supervised semantic parsing, can be viewed as clusters of syntactic variations of the same meaning, and can be learned from data.
    For example, borders represents the next-to relation, and can be viewed as the cluster of different forms for expressing this relation, such as &#8220;borders&#8221;, &#8220;is next to&#8221;, &#8220;share the border with&#8221;; Utah represents the state of Utah, and can be viewed as the cluster of &#8220;Utah&#8221;, &#8220;the beehive state&#8221;, etc.
    Second, the identification and clustering of candidate forms are integrated with the learning for meaning composition, where forms that are used in composition with the same forms are encouraged to cluster together, and so are forms that are composed of the same sub-fo
