ntrast, two identical parse trees may generate a linear number of non-null pairs if there are few groups of nodes associated with the same production rule.
    (c) Such approach is perfectly compatible with the dynamic programming algorithm which computes A.
    In fact, the only difference with the original approach is that the matrix entries corresponding to pairs of different production rules are not considered.
    Since such entries contain null values they do not affect the application of the original dynamic programming.
    Moreover, the order of the pair evaluation can be established at run time, starting from the root nodes towards the children.
  
  
    An interesting application of the SST kernel is the classification of the predicate argument structures defined in PropBank (Kingsbury and Palmer, 2002) or FrameNet (Fillmore, 1982).
    Figure 4 shows the parse tree of the sentence: &amp;quot;Mary brought a cat to school&amp;quot; along with the predicate argument annotation proposed in the PropBa
