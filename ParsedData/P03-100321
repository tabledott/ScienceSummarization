pairs.
    Consider, for example, the following two factoid-question template pairs: Qt1: What is the capital of _c?
    St1: The capital of _c is capital(_c).
    Qt2: How did _p die?
    St2: _p died of causeDeath(_p).
    Using extraction patterns (Muslea, 1999), we apply these two templates on the World Fact Book database and on biography.com pages to instantiate question and answer-tagged sentence pairs such as: These question-factoid pairs are useful both in training and testing.
    In training, we simply add all these pairs to the training data set.
    In testing, for every question Q, we select factoids that overlap sufficiently enough with Q as sentences that potentially contain the answer.
    For example, given the question &#8220;Where was Sartre born?&#8221; we will select the following factoids: Up to now, we have collected about 100,000 question-factoid pairs.
    We found out that these pairs cover only 24 of the 500 TREC 2002 questions.
    And so, in order to evaluate the value of these fa
