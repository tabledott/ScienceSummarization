ge can be a good thing.
    The approach described here strikes a balance somewhere between the endless construction-by-construction tuning of rule-based approaches, ort the one hand, and, ort the other, the development of insufficiently constrained stochastic models.
    We have systematically diagnosed a common assumption that has been dealt with previously ort a case by case basis, but not named.
    Most of the models we know of from early work at IBM to second-generation models such as that of Knight and Yamada rectify glaring problems caused by the failure of the DCA using a range of pre- or post-processing techniques.
    We have identified the source for a host of these problems and have suggested diagnostics for future cases where we might expect these problems to arise.
    More important, we have shown that linguistically informed strategies can be developed efficiently to improve output that is otherwise compromised by situations where the DCA does not hold.
    In addition to resolving the remain
