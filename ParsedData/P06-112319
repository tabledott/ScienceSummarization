    Table 6 shows the results of this analysis.
    In category 1, 60% of the word alignments that could not be hierarchically aligned without gaps were caused by word alignment errors.
    E.g.
    : The word drug appears in both sentences, but for different purposes, so drug and drug should not have been linked.6 Three errors were caused by words like targeted and started, which our word alignment algorithm deemed cognates.
    12 of the hierarchical alignment failures in this category were true failures.
    For example: sion of his trip was to organize an assault on Iraq.
    The alignment pattern of the words in bold is the familiar (3,1,4,2) permutation, as in Figure 1.
    Most of the 12 true failures were due to movement of prepositional phrases.
    The freedom of movement for such modifiers would be greater in bitexts that involve languages with less rigid word order than English.
    Of the 30 sentence pairs in category 2, 16 could not be hierarchically aligned due to parser errors and 4 due to fau
