    This confirms our intuition that PINC is a more useful measure when semantic content has been preserved.
    Finally, while we do not believe any single score could adequately describe the quality of a paraphrase outside of a specific application, we experimented with different ways of combining BLEU and PINC into a single score.
    Almost any simple combination, such as taking the average of the two, yielded decent correlation with the human ratings.
    The best correlation was achieved by taking the product of PINC and a sigmoid function of BLEU.
    This follows the intuition that semantic preservation is closer to a binary decision (i.e. a paraphrase either preserves the meaning or it does not, in which case PINC does not matter at all) than a linear function.
    We used an oracle to pick the best logistic function in our experiment.
    In practice, some sample human ratings would be required to tune this function.
    Other more complicated methods for combining BLEU and PINC are also possible wi
