    Since both words are in the same language, the similarity model can be derived based on both semantic similarity and surface similarity, and the overall similarity model is a linear interpolation of the two: where and reflect the semantic and surface similarity between and e; , respectively, and &#945; is the interpolation factor.
    Since the semantic similarity between two target words is source-dependent, the semantic similarity model is derived by using the source word sequence as a hidden layer: where is the source sentence.
    Moreover, in order to handle the case that two target words are synonyms but neither of them has counter-part in the source sentence, a null is introduced on the source side, which is represented by f0.
    The last step in (3) assumes that first ei generates all source words including null.
    Then ej&#8217; is generated by all source words including null.
    In the common SMT scenario where a large amount of bilingual parallel data is available, we can estimate the tran
