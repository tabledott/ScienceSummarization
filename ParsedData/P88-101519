 as reliable in predicting shifts.
    This result challenges the claims of recent discourse theories (5, 10) which argue for a the close relation between cue words and discourse structure.
    We also examined how utterance type related to topic shift and found that few interruptions introduced a new topic.
    Finally there was evidence for high level structures in these dialogues as evidenced by topic initiation and control, with early topics being initiated and dominated by the client and the opposite being true for the later parts.
    Another focus of current research has been the modelling of speaker and listener goals (1, 3) but there has been little research on real dialogues investigating how goals are communicated and inferred.
    This study identifies surface linguistic phenomena which reflect the fact that participants are continuously monitoring their goals.
    When plans are perceived as succeeding, participants use explicit cues such as prompts, repetitions and summaries to signal their read
