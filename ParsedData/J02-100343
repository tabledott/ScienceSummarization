ithm.
    Logically superfluous properties can, for example, be motivated by &#8220;overloading&#8221; if they serve communicative purposes other than identification (Pollack 1991; Dale and Reiter 1995, Section 2.4; Stone and Webber 1998; Jordan 1999).
    A description may also contain fewer properties than would be necessary for identification&#8212;for example, when no distinguishing description exists.
    A nondistinguishing description may take the form either of a definite description (as in John&#8217;s son, when John has several sons) or of an indefinite description (as in one of John&#8217;s sons; Horacek 1997; Stone and Webber 1998; Krahmer and Theune 1999).
    In both cases, the description may be useful even though it fails to be distinguishing.
    Tractability.
    Computational tractability has also been paramount in our explorations.
    There is no agreement on the extent to which computational linguists should worry about the computational complexity of algorithms, or about the precise way
