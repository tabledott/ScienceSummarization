nce E. The alignment A is represented as a matrix with binary values.
    A matrix element with value 1 means that the words at the corresponding positions are aligned and the value 0 means that the words are not aligned.
    If a source word is not aligned to a target word then it is aligned to the empty word eo which shall be at the imaginary position i = 0.
    This alignment representation is a generalization of the baseline alignments described in (Brown et al., 1993) and allows for many-to-many alignments.
    The classes used in P and E are automatically trained bilingual classes using the method described in (Och, 1999) and constitute a partition of the vocabulary of source and target language.
    The class functions T and e map words to their classes.
    The use of classes instead of words themselves has the advantage of a better generalization.
    If there exist classes in source and target language which contain all towns it is possible that an alignment template learned using a special town can
