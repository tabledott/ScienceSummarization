Comprehensive morphological descrip- tions of this type have been developed for several languages including Finnish, Swedish, Russian, English, Swahili, and Arabic.
  Although they have several good features, these Kimmo-systems also have some limitations.
  The ones we want to ad- dress in this paper are the following: (1) Lexical representations tend to be arbitrary.
  Because it is difficult to write and test two-level systems that map between pairs of radically dissimilar forms, lexical representations i  existing two-level analyzers tend to stay close to the surface forms.
  This is not a problem for morpho- logically simple languages like English because, for most words, inflected forms are very similar to the canonical dictionary entry.
  Except for a small number of irregular verbs and nouns, it is not difficult to create a two-level description for English in which lexical forms coincide with the canonical citation forms found in a dictionary.
  However, current analyzers for mor- phologically more c
