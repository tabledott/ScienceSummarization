  In the three-sense task, the Bayesian classifier did best on the tezt sense, perhaps because it had open and closed quotes as important okens.
  This advantage was lost in the six-sense task because quo- tation marks also appear in the contexts of the phone sense.
  It is not immediately obvious why the formation sense should be hard.
  From inspection of the contexts, it appears that the crucial information is close to the word, and context hat is more than a few words away is noise.
  These corpus-based statistical techniques use an impov- erished representation of the training contexts: simple counts of tokens appearing within two sentences.
  We believe significant increases in resolution accuracy will not be possible unless other information, such as word order or syntactic information, is incorporated into the techniques.
