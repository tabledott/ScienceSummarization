 an LR of 89.6%, our results show a 9% relative error rate reduction.
    While SL-DOP and LS-DOP have been compared before in Bod (2002), especially in the context of musical parsing, this paper presents the The DOP approach is based on two distinctive features: (1) the use of corpus fragments rather than grammar rules, and (2) the use of arbitrarily large fragments rather than restricted ones.
    While the first feature has been generally adopted in statistical NLP, the second feature has for a long time been a serious bottleneck, as it results in exponential processing time when the most probable parse tree is computed.
    This paper showed that a PCFG-reduction of DOP in combination with a new notion of the best parse tree results in fast processing times and very competitive accuracy on the Wall Street Journal treebank.
    This paper also re-affirmed that the coarsegrained approach of using all subtrees from a treebank outperforms the fine-grained approach of specifically modeling lexical-syntactic de
