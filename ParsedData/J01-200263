, yet leads to better combination results, again witnessed by the Gain columns.
    In some cases, MXP is even able to outperform pairs of components in combination: both MXP+MBT and MXP+HMM are better than HMM+MBT+TBL.
    The final influence on combination that we measure is that of the granularity of the tagset, which can be examined with the highly structured Wotan tagset.
    Part of the examination has already taken place above, as we have added the WotanLite tagset, a less granular projection of Wotan.
    As we have seen, the WotanLite taggers undeniably have a much higher accuracy than the Wotan ones.
    However, this is hardly surprising, as they have a much easier task to perform.
    In order to make a fair comparison, we now measure them at their performance of the same task, namely, the prediction of WotanLite tags.
    We do this by projecting the output of the Wotan taggers (i.e., the base taggers, WPDV(Tags), and WPDV(Tags+Context)) to WotanLite tags.
    Additionally, we measure all taggers
