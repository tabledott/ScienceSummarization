se we simply recommend transforming the trees into flat, one-levelper-X-bar-level trees before training the model, as in the three-step procedure outlined above.
    Other models in the literature are also very likely to be sensitive to annotation style.
    Charniak&#8217;s (1997) models will most likely perform quite differently with binarybranching trees (for example, his current models will learn that rules such as VP &#8594; V SG PP are very rare, but with binary-branching structures, this context sensitivity will be lost).
    The models of Magerman (1995) and Ratnaparkhi (1997) use contextual predicates that would most likely need to be modified given a different annotation style.
    Goodman&#8217;s (1997) models are the exception, as he already specifies that the treebank should be transformed into his chosen representation, binary-branching trees. resentations in Figures 16 and 17 have the same lexical dependencies (providing that the binary-branching structures are centered about the head of the ph
