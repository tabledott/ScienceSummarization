ts right of the semicolon are observed values.
    In the continuous case, the probability is replaced by a probability density.
    With binomial and multinomials, we only deal with the discrete case.
    For repeated Bernoulli trials, m =- 2 because we observe both the number of trials and the number of positive outcomes and there is only one p. The explicit form for the likelihood function is The parameter space is the set of all values for p and the hypothesis that p -= po is a single point.
    For notational brevity the model parameters can be collected into a single parameter, as can the observed values.
    Then the likelihood function is written as where w is considered to be a point in the parameter space Q, and k a point in the space of observations K. Particular hypotheses or observations are represented by subscripting or K respectively.
    More information about likelihood ratio tests can be found in texts on theoretical statistics (Mood et al. 1974).
