s O(n2m).
    This is very expensive with even a moderate vocabulary and small attribute vectors.
    The number of terms can be reduced by introducing a minimum cutoff that ignores potential synonyms with a frequency less than the cutoff, which for our experiments was
  
  
    Early experiments in thesaurus extraction (Grefenstette, 1994) suffered from the limited size of available corpora, but more recent experiments have used much larger corpora with greater success (Lin, 1998a).
    For these experiments we ran our relation extractor over the British National Corpus (BNC) consisting of 114 million words in 6.2 million sentences.
    The POS tagging and chunking took 159 minutes, and the relation extraction took an addiWe describe the functions evaluated in these experiments using an extension of the asterisk notation used by Lin (1998a), where an asterisk indicates a set ranging over all existing values of that variable.
    For example, the set of attributes of the term w is: (w, &#57741;, &#57741;) &#5
