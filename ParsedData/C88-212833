"backwards" has been proposed previously, although the normal Prolog execution mechanism renders uch a technique unusable in practice.
  However, =.- alternative xecution models might make the practice feasible.
  As mentioned above, the technique described here is just such an exe: cution model, and is directly related to the Earley deduction model of Pereira and Warren [1983].. Hasida and Isizaki [1987] present an- other method for generating and analyzing using a DCG-like formal- ism, which they call dependency propagation.
  The technique seems to entail using dataflow dependencies implicit in the grammar to con- trol processing in a coroutining manner.
  The implementation status of their method and its practical utility are as yet unclear.
  The use of an agenda nd scheduling schemes to allow varying the control structure of a parser also finds precedent in the work of Kaplan [1973] and Kay [1967].
  Kays "powerful parser" and the GSP both em- ployed an agenda mechanism to control additions to the chart
