    Table 3 shows the distribution of word lengths in the corpus.
    Single-character words are the most frequent; these and bigrams together constitute almost 94% of words.
    Nearly half the characters appear as constituents of two-character words.
    Some published figures for Chinese language statistics indicate that this corpus may overrepresent single-character words and underrepresent bigrams&#8212;for example, Liu (1987) gives figures for modern Chinese of 5%, 75%, 14%, and 6% for one-character, two-character, three-character, and longer words, respectively.
    However, it has been argued that considering the inherent uncertainty in Chinese word segmentation, generalpurpose segmentation algorithms should segment aggressively rather than conservatively (Wu 1998); consequently this corpus seems appropriate for our use.
    Table 4 shows the results for five 500-word test files from the corpus.
    We took part of the corpus that was not used for training, divided it into 500-word segments, removed
