information is the construction of phrase type, head word, POS tag of the head word, path, subcategorization, and syntactic frame features.
  As described in Section 3.2.2, most of these features can be approximated using chunks and clauses, with the exception of the syntactic frame feature.
  It is unclear how this feature can be mimicked because it relies on the internal structure of a full parse tree.
  Therefore, it does not have a corresponding feature in the shallow parsing case.
  Table 2 reports the experimental results of argument classification when argument boundaries are known.
  In this case, because the argument classifier of our SRL system does not overpredict or miss any arguments, we do not need to train with a null class, 271 Computational Linguistics Volume 34, Number 2 Table 2 The accuracy of argument classification when argument boundaries are known.
