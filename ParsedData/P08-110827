m the IBM models, and by Florian et al.
    (2004), who trained classifiers on auxiliary data to guide named entity classifiers.
    Feature-based integration also has points in common with co-training, which have been applied to syntactic parsing by Sarkar (2001) and Steedman et al. (2003), among others.
    The difference, of course, is that standard co-training is a weakly supervised method, where guide features replace, rather than complement, the gold standard annotation during training.
    Feature-based integration is also similar to parse re-ranking (Collins, 2000), where one parser produces a set of candidate parses and a secondstage classifier chooses the most likely one.
    However, feature-based integration is not explicitly constrained to any parse decisions that the guide model might make and only the single most likely parse is used from the guide model, making it significantly more efficient than re-ranking.
    Finally, there are several recent developments in data-driven dependency parsing,
