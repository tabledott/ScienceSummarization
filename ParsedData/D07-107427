s information that was not present in the original document D. Note now that the maximization of the sum in (2) is equivalent to the maximization of each of its terms, which means that the computation reduces to nid Tee se ii ii ..1,,maxarg )( ?&gt;?&lt; ?
  ., or  equivalently, nid Tee se ii ii ..1,||||,maxarg 2 )( ?
  (3) Our disambiguation process therefore employs two steps: first, it builds the extended document vector and second, it maximizes the scalar products in equation (3).
  
  Also note that we are not normalizing the scalar products by the norms of the vectors (which would lead to the computation of cosine similarity).
  In this manner, we implicitly account for the fre- quency with which a surface form is used to men- tion various entities and for the importance of these entities (important entities have longer Wikipedia articles, are mentioned more frequently in other articles, and also tend to have more category tags).
  While rarely, one surface form can be used to mention two or more differ
