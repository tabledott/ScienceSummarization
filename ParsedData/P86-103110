ing discourse fragment, it is reasonable to assume that Rosa is the Cb of the second utterance:9 It seems equally reasonable to assume that Rosa is the Cb of the second utterance in the following variation of (2): [Cb=Rosa] If the Cb-status of an entity is homogeneous, we would expect that the two instances of the Cb above have exactly the same effect, if any, on the subsequent utterance.
    When an identical third utterance is added to both, however, it becomes clear that the centered individual Rosa is not of an equal status in the two cases: 6Grosz et. al.
    (in preparation) propose various constraints on this rule, and, among other things, distinguish between the retention and continuation of the Cb.
    I will use the words retain and continue in non-technical sense in this paper.
    7An expression realizes a center rather than denoting it.
    Realization allows either a value-free or value-loaded interpretation (see Grosz et. al.
    1983 for discussion).
