 rules used to generate x.
    For example, the weight 02 (xi) assigned to tree xi of Rule applications in a dag generated by G2.
    The weight of the dag is the product of the weights of rule applications. hence 02(xi) = 010303 = 1/2 &#8226; 2/3 &#8226; 2/3 = 2/9.
    Observe that 02(xi) = Ov3i, which is to say, 13(1(x1)4(x1).
    Moreover, since /3&#176; = 1, it does not hurt to include additional factors /ex') for those i where f, (xi) = 0.
    That is, we can define the dag weight 0 corresponding to rule weights =- On) generally as:
  
  
    i=1 The next question is how to estimate weights.
    Let us consider what happens when we use the ERF method.
    Let us assume a corpus distribution for the dags in Figure 7 analogous to the distribution in Figure 3: Using the ERF method, we estimate rule weights as in Table 4.
    This table is identical to the one given earlier in the context-free case.
    We arrive at the same weights M2 we considered above, defining dag weights ;.2(x).
    But at this point a
