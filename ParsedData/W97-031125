    When &amp;quot;Pharmaceutical&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Industry&amp;quot; occur together, they are rendered in the French text without translation as &amp;quot;Pharmaceutical Industry.&amp;quot; When they occur separately, they are translated into &amp;quot;pharmaceutique&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;industrie.&amp;quot; Thus, the English bigram &amp;quot;Pharmaceutical Industry&amp;quot; is an NCC, but the words that always occur around it are not part of the NCC.
    Similar reasoning applies to &amp;quot;ship unprocessed uranium.&amp;quot; The bigram &lt; ship, unprocessed &gt; is an NCC because its components are translated noncompositionally whenever they co-occur.
    However, &amp;quot;uranium&amp;quot; is always translated as &amp;quot;uranium,&amp;quot; so it is not a part of the NCC.
    This NCC demonstrates that valid NCCs may cross the boundaries of grammatical constituents.
