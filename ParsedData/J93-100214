 and each definition is independent, allowing us to ignore phenomena such as ellipsis.
    In addition, the language of definitions represents a recognizable sublanguage, allowing us to explore the task of tuning a general purpose grammar.
    The results reported below suggest that probabilistic information concerning the frequency of occurrence of syntactic rules correlates in a useful (though not absolute) way with the semantically and pragmatically most plausible analysis.
    In Section 2, we briefly review extant work on probabilistic approaches to corpus analysis and parsing and argue the need for a more refined probabilistic model to distinguish distinct derivations.
    Section 3 discusses work on LR parsing of natural language and presents our technique for automatic construction of LR parsers for unification-based grammars.
    Section 4 presents the method and results for constructing a LALR(1) parse table for the ANLT grammar and discusses these in the light of both computational complexity and o
