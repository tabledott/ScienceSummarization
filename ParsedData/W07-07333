  The best-scoring translation is searched for by the decoding algorithm and outputted by the system as the best translation.
    The different system components hi (phrase translation probabilities, language model, etc.) are combined in a log-linear model to obtain the score for the translation e for an input sentence f: The weights of the components Ai are set by a discriminative training method on held-out development data (Och, 2003).
    The basic components used in our experiments are: (a) two phrase translation probabilities (both p(e|f) and p(f|e)), (b) two word translation probabilities (both p(e|f) and p(f|e)), (c) phrase count, (d) output word count, (e) language model, (f) distance-based reordering model, and (g) lexicalized reordering model.
    For a more detailed description of this model, please refer to (Koehn et al., 2005).
  
  
    Since training data for statistical machine translation is typically collected opportunistically from wherever it is available, the application domain for a mac
