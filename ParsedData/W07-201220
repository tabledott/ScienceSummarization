lts with F?=0,2 are not substantially different (except for the two baselines, which roughly swappositions).
			There are some ranking swaps, but gen erally only within close pairs.The good performance of the ONE-IN-ONE baseline system is indicative of the abundance of singleton entities (entities represented by only one doc ument).

			The WEPS task ended with considerable success in terms of participation, and we believe that a careful analysis of the contributions made by participants(which is not possible at the time of writing this report) will be an interesting reference for future re search.
			In addition, all the collected and annotated dataset will be publicly available 5 as a benchmark for Web People Search systems.At the same time, it is clear that building a re liable test-bed for the task is not simple.
			First ofall, the variability across test cases is large and un predi
