erables.
    The extended version assumes a detailed treatment of a particular subset of inferables, so-called functional anaphora (in Hahn, Markert, and Strube [19961, functional anaphora are referred to as textual ellipses).
    We claim that the extended version of ranking constraints is necessary to analyze texts from certain genres, e.g., texts from technical or medical domains.
    In these areas, pronouns are used rather infrequently, while functional anaphors are the major text phenomena to achieve local coherence.
    4.3.1 Basic Cf Ranking.
    Usually, the Cf ranking is represented by an ordering relation on a single set of elements, e.g., grammatical relations (as in Table 1).
    We use a layered representation for our criteria.
    For the basic Cf ranking criteria, we distinguish between two different sets of expressions, hearer-old discourse entities in LI, (OLD) and hearernew discourse entities in U, (NEW).
    These sets can be further split into the elements of Prince's (1981, 245) familiar
