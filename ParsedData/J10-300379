f performing the usual pivoting step with the bilingual phrases in the table, they take a graphical approach and represent each phrase in the table as a node, leading to a bipartite graph.
    Two nodes in the graph are connected to each other if they are aligned to each other.
    In order to extract paraphrases, they sample random paths in the graph from any English node to another.
    Note that the traditional pivot step is equivalent to a path of length two: one English phrase to the foreign pivot phrase and then to the potentially paraphrastic English phrase.
    By allowing paths of lengths longer than two, this graphical approach can find more paraphrases for any given English phrase.
    Furthermore, instead of restricting themselves to a single bilingual phrase table, they take as input a number of phrase tables, each corresponding to a different pair of six languages.
    Similar to the single-table case, each phrase in each table is represented as a node in a graph that is no longer bipartite in n
