e exploited in customisation and in parse ranking.
    Users can specify that certain rules should not be used and so to some extent tune the parser to different genres without the need for retraining.
    The current version of the grammar finds at least one parse rooted in S for about 85% of the Susanne corpus (used for grammar development), and most of the remainder consists of phrasal fragments marked as independent text sentences in passages of dialogue.
    The coverage of our WSJ test data is 84%.
    In cases where there is no parse rooted in S, the parser returns a connected sequence of partial parses covering the input.
    The criteria are partial parse probability and a preference for longer but non-lexical combinations (Kiefer et al., 1999).
    A non-deterministic LALR(1) table is constructed automatically from a CF &#8216;backbone&#8217; compiled from the feature-based grammar.
    The parser builds a packed parse forest using this table to guide the actions it performs.
    Probabilities are a
