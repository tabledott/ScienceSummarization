ling problems such as POStagging, named entity recognition and text chunking.
			The algorithm can enumerate all possible decomposition structures and find the highest prob ability sequence together with the corresponding decomposition structure in polynomial time.
			Wehave also presented an efficient bidirectional infer ence algorithm based on the easiest-first strategy,which gives comparable performance to full bidirectional inference with significantly lower compu tational cost.
			Experimental results of POS tagging and textchunking show that the proposed bidirectional inference methods consistently outperform unidi rectional inference methods and our bidirectional MEMMs give comparable performance to thatachieved by state-of-the-art learning algorithms in cluding kernel support vector machines.
			A natural extension of this work is to replace the maximum entropy modeling, which was used asthe local classifiers, with other machine learning algorithms.
