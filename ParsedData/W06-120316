    Here we see that the linear combination of the component words of the MWE is clearly distinct from that of the MWE as a whole.
    As a further illustration of the difference between the composed vector and the MWE vector, in Table 2 we list the words whose meaning vector is most similar to that of the MWE auf dis Strecke bleiben along with their similarity values, and in Table 3 we list those words whose meaning vector is most similar to the composed vector.
    The semantic differences among these two classes are readily apparent.

    This can be illustrated by considering, for e
