 lemmas we are searching for will be quite different.
  Therefore, we parameter- ize the theorem prover by an initial set of axioms to be added to the agenda nd by a predicate on lemmas that determines which are to be regarded as satisfying the goal conditions on lemmas.
  The structure of the architecture, then, is as follows.
  The processor is an agenda-based tabular theorem prover over lemmas of the sort defined above.
  It is parameterized by a The initial conditions, u A priority function on temmas, and ?
  A predicate xpressing the concept of a successful proofl By varying these parameters, the processor can be used to implement language parsers and generators embodying a wide variety of control strategies.
  4 Instances of the Architecture We now define some examples of the use of the architecture to process with grammars.
  4.1 Parser  Ins tances Consider a processor to parse a given string built by using this archi- tecture under the following parameterization: ?
