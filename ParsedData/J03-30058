ument relations.
    The first type is adjective-noun bigrams, in which we assume that the noun is the predicate that takes the adjective as its argument.3 The second predicate-argument type we investigated is noun-noun compounds.
    For these, we assume that the rightmost noun is the predicate that selects the leftmost noun as its argument (as compound nouns are generally right-headed in English).
    Third, we included verb-object bigrams, in which the verb is the predicate that selects the object as its argument.
    We considered only direct NP objects; the bigram consists of the verb and the head noun of the object.
    For each of the three predicate-argument relations, we gathered two data sets, one containing seen bigrams (i.e., bigrams that occur in the BNC) and one with unseen bigrams (i.e., bigrams that do not occur in the BNC).
    For the seen adjective-noun bigrams, we used the data of Lapata, McDonald, and Keller (1999), who compiled a set of 90 bigrams as follows.
    First, 30 adjectives wer
