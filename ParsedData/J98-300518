les and &amp;quot;gazetteers&amp;quot; in conjunction with partial grammars in order to recognize proper nouns as unknown words in close proximity to known words (Cowie et al. 1992; Aberdeen et al.
    1992), statistical training to learn, for example, Spanish names, from on-line corpora (Ayuso et al. 1992), and the use of concept-based pattern matchers that use semantic concepts as pattern categories as well as part-of-speech information (VVeischedel et al.
    1993; Lehnert et al. 1993).
    In addition, some researchers have explored the use of both local context surrounding the hypothesized proper nouns (McDonald 1993; Coates-Stephens 1991) and the larger discourse context (Mani et al. 1993) to improve the accuracy of proper noun extraction when large known-word lists are not available.
    In a way similar to this research, our work also aims at extracting proper nouns without the aid of large word lists.
    We use a regular grammar encoding part-of-speech categories to extract certain text patterns (de
