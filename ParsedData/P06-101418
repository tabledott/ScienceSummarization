  Table 4 reports the performance of the systems, together with the first sense and the random baseline (in the last column we report the performance on the original fine-grained test set).
    The best system, Gambl, obtains almost 78% precision and recall, an interesting figure compared to 65% performance in the fine-grained WSD task.
    An interesting aspect is that the ranking across systems was maintained when moving from a fine-grained to a coarse-grained sense inventory, although two systems (SSI and IRSTDDD) show the best improvement.
    In order to show that the general improvement is the result of an appropriate clustering, we assessed the performance of Gambl by averaging its results when using 100 randomly-generated different clusterings.
    We excluded monosemous clusters from the test set (i.e. words with all the senses mapped to the same ODE entry), so as to clarify the real impact of properly grouped clusters.
    As a result, the random setting obtained 64.56% average accuracy, while the p
