    For example, the equation &lt;subject agreement&gt; = &lt;predicate agreement&gt; states that subject and predicate have the same value for agreement.
    In graph terms, this corresponds to a lattice where two vectors point to the same node: [agreement: [ subj ect 1 predicate person: 3rdn number: sg Lexical Functional Grammar (LFG) [Kaplan and Bres- agreement agreement nan, 831, Unification Grammar (UG) [Kay, 79], General- number person ized Phrase Structure Grammar (GPSG) [Gazdar and Pul- sg 3rd lum, 821, among others, use complex features.
    Another way to represent feature matrices is to think of them as directed graphs where values correspond to nodes and attributes to vectors: In a case like this, the values of the two paths have been &amp;quot;unified.&amp;quot; To represent unification in terms of feature matrices we need to introduce some new convention to distinguish between identity and mere likeness.
    Even that would not quite suffice because the graph formalis
