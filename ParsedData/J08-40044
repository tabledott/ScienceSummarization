in Discourse, it is time to reconsider the use of coefficients of agreement in CL in a systematic way.
    In this article, a survey of coefficients of agreement and their use in CL, we have three main goals.
    First, we discuss in some detail the mathematics and underlying assumptions of the coefficients used or mentioned in the CL and content analysis literatures.
    Second, we also cover in some detail Krippendorff&#8217;s &#945;, often mentioned but never really discussed in detail in previous CL literature other than in the papers by Passonneau just mentioned.
    Third, we review the past ten years of experience with coefficients of agreement in CL, reconsidering the issues that have been raised also from a mathematical perspective.2
  
  
    We begin with a quick recap of the goals of agreement studies, inspired by Krippendorff (2004a, Section 11.1).
