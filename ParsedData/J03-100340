n be captured in the graph-based algorithm as well.
    To further illustrate the flexibility of the graph perspective, we briefly discuss two such aspects.
    5.3.1 Plurals.
    Van Deemter&#8217;s (2000) proposal to generate distinguishing plural descriptions (such as the dogs) can be modeled using graphs in the following way.
    Van Deemter&#8217;s algorithm takes as input a set of target objects, which, in our case, translates into a set of vertices W from the scene graph (W C_ VG).
    Now the algorithm tries to generate a vertex-graph pair (v, H) that uniquely refers to (W, G).
    The definition of &#8220;uniquely referring graphs&#8221; has to be generalized slightly to accommodate plurals.
    The constructed subgraph should refer to each of the vertices in the set W, but not to any of the vertices in the scene graph outside this set.
    Formally, (v, H) uniquely refers to (W, G) iff H is connected, and for each w E W there is a bijection &#960; such that H C&#960; G, with &#960;.v = w and there i
