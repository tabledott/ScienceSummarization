e thought that it would be helpful to describe such a program (align) and to evaluate its results.
    In addition, a large sample of Canadian Hansards (approximately 90 million words, half in French and half in English) has been aligned with the align program and has been made available to the general research community through the Data Collection Initiative of the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL/DCI).
    In order to facilitate replication of the align program, an appendix is provided with detailed c-code of the more difficult core of the align program.
    The align program is based on a very simple statistical model of character lengths.
    The model makes use of the fact that longer sentences in one language tend to be translated into longer sentences in the other language, and that shorter sentences tend to be translated into shorter sentences.
    A probabilistic score is assigned to each pair of proposed sentence pairs, based on the ratio of lengths of the two sentences (in characters)
