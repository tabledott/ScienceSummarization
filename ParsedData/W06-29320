  Multilingual Dependency Analysis With A Two-Stage Discriminative Parser
  
    present a two-stage multilingual pendency parser and evaluate it on 13 diverse languages.
    The first stage based on the unlabeled dependency parsing models described by McDonald and Pereira (2006) augmented with morphological features for a subset of the languages.
    The second stage takes the output from the first and labels all the edges in the dependency graph with appropriate syntactic categories using a globally trained sequence classifier over components of the graph.
    We report results on the CoNLL-X shared task (Buchholz et al., 2006) data sets and present an error analysis.
  
  
    Often in language processing we require a deep syntactic representation of a sentence in order to assist further processing.
    With the availability of resources such as the Penn WSJ Treebank, much of the focus in the parsing community had been on producing syntactic representations based on phrase-structure.
    However, recently
