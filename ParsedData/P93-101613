by the structure of the grammar network.
    The combinations of items represent constructions of larger parse trees from smaller ones.
    Since the structure of the grammar network satisfies the constraint, the parse trees constructed by item combination also satisfy the X-bar theory.
    The case filter is implemented as follows: The word &amp;quot;believe&amp;quot; belongs to a subcategory of verb (V:IP) that takes an IP as the complement.
    Since there is no barrier between V:IP and the subject of IP, words like &amp;quot;believe&amp;quot; can govern into the IP complement and case-mark its subject (known as exceptional case-marking in literature).
    In (2a), the -cm attribute assigned to the item representing [NI, John] percolates to V:IP node without being blocked by any barrier.
    Since +govern +ca -cm co-occur in the item at V:IP node, the case-filter is satisfied (Figure 3.a).
    On the other hand, in (2b) the passive &amp;quot;believed&amp;quot; is not a case-assigner.
    The case-filter vi
