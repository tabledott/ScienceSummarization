r recall on our clustering algorithm (67% for the dryrun and 69% for the formal evaluation).
    The second baseline marks as coreferent any two noun phrases that have a word in common.
    The third baseline marks as coreferent any two noun phrases whose head nouns match.
    Although the baselines perform better one might expect (they outperform one MUC-6 system), the clustering algorithm performs significantly better.
    In part because we rely on base noun phrases, our Figure 2: Clustering Algorithm The algorithm then considers NP2.
    Dist(NPi, NP2) = 11.0 plus a small penalty for their difference in position.
    If this distance is &gt; r, they will not be considered coreferent, and the resulting equivalence classes will be: {{The chairman, he}, {Ms. White}}.
    Otherwise, the distance is &lt; r, and the algorithm considers c and c2 for merging.
    However, c1 contains NP3, and, as calculated above, the distance from NP2 to NP3 is oo.
    This incompatibility prevents the merging of ci and 02, so t
