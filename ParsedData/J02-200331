of the probabilities.
    The key question is how to determine a suitable level of generalization for concept c, or, alternatively, how to find a suitable class to represent concept c (assuming the choice is from those classes that contain all concepts dominated by some hypernym of c).
    Resnik&#8217;s solution to this problem (which he neatly refers to as the &#8220;vertical-ambiguity&#8221; problem) is to choose the class that maximizes the association score.
    It is not clear that the class with the highest association score is always the most appropriate level of generalization.
    For example, this approach does not always generalize appropriately for arguments that are negatively associated with some verb.
    To see why, consider the problem of deciding how well the concept (location) satisfies the preferences of the verb eat for its object.
    Since locations are not the kinds of things that are typically eaten, a suitable level of generalization would correspond to a class that has a low associ
