 SNoW learning architecture (Roth, 1998), that is available at the same site.
    This set of English NEs was hand-pruned to remove incorrectly classified words to obtain 978 single word NEs.
    In order to reduce running time, some limited preprocessing was done on the Russian side.
    All classes, whose temporal distributions were close to uniform (i.e. words with a similar likelihood of occurrence throughout the corpus) were deemed common and not considered as NE candidates.
    Unique words were grouped into 15,594 equivalence classes, and 1,605 of those classes were discarded using this method.
    Insertions/omissions features were not used in the experiments as they provided no tangible benefit for the languages of our corpus.
    Unless mentioned otherwise, the transliteration model was initialized with a subset of 254 pairs of NEs and their transliteration equivalence classes.
    Negative examples here and during the rest of the training were pairs of randomly selected non-NE English and Russian w
