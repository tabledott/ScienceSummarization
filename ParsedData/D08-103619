ow, which include the optimal values for the hyperparameters found by Johnson (2007), and report results for the best combination for each estimator below 1.
    Further, we ran each setting of each estimator at least 10 times (from randomly jittered initial starting points) for at least 1,000 iterations, as Johnson (2007) showed that some estimators require many iterations to converge.
    The results of our experiments are summarized in Figures 2&#8211;5.
    1We found that on some data sets the results are sensitive to the values of the hyperparameters.
    So, there is a bit uncertainty in our comparison results because it is possible that the values we tried were good for one estimator and bad for others.
    Unfortunately, we do not know any efficient way of searching the optimal hyperparameters in a much wider and more fine-grained space.
    We leave it to future work.
  
  
    As might be expected, our evaluation measures disagree somewhat, but the following broad tendancies seem clear.
    On small
