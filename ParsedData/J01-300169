er based on an existing approach is the one which uses simulated annealing to optimize the overlap of words shared by the dictionary definitions for a set of senses.
    In Section 4.3 we noted that Cowie et al. (1992) reported 47% correct disambiguation to the sense level using this technique, while in our adaptation over 17% more words are correctly disambiguated.
    Our application filtered out senses with the incorrect part of speech in addition to using a different method to calculate overlap that takes account of short definitions.
    It seems likely that these changes are the source of the improved results.
    Our least successful partial tagger is the one based on selectional preferences.
    Although its overall result is slightly below the overall corpus baseline, it is very successful at disambiguating verbs.
    This is consistent with the work of Resnik (1997), who reported that many words do not have strong enough selectional restrictions to carry out WSD.
    We expected preferences to be su
