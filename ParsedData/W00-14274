 and the third person singular present tense of verbs, and ed for the past tense, en for the past participle, and ing for the present participle forms of verbs.'
    The generator is implemented in Flex.
    The standard use of Flex is to construct 'scanners', programs that recognise lexical patterns in text (Levine et al., 1992).
    A Flex description&#8212;the high-level description of a scanner that Flex takes as input&#8212;consists of a set of 'rules': pairs of regular expression patterns (which Flex compiles into deterministic finite-state automata (Aho et al., 1986)), and actions consisting of arbitrary C code.
    Flex creates as output a C program which at run-time scans a text looking for occurrences of the regular expressions.
    Whenever it finds one, it executes the corresponding C code.
    Flex is part of the Berkeley Unix distribution and as a result Flex programs are very portable.
    The standard version of Flex works with any ISO-8559 character set; Unicode support is also available.
