he corresponding development of statistical methods to identify and apply information about regularities in this data.
    Now that other problems amenable to these methods, such as part-of-speech disambiguation and alignment of parallel translations, have been fairly thoroughly addressed, the problem of word sense disambiguation has taken center stage, and it is frequently cited as one of the most important problems in natural language processing research today.
    Given the progress that has been recently made in WSD research and the rapid development of methods for solving the problem, it is appropriate at this time to stand back and assess the state of the field and to consider the next steps that need to be taken.
    To this end, this paper surveys the major, well-known approaches to word sense disambiguation and considers the open problems and directions of future research.
    In general terms, word sense disambiguation involves the association of a given word in a text or discourse with a definition
