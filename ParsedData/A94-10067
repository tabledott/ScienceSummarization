    This current practice is very laborious and runs the risk of missing many important terms.
    Termight uses a part of speech tagger (Church, 1988) to identify a list of candidate terms which is then filtered by a manual pass.
    We have found, however, that the manual pass dominates the cost of the monolingual task, and consequently, we have tried to design an interactive user interface (see Figure 1) that minimizes the burden on the expert terminologist.
    The terminologist is presented with a list of candidate terms, and corrects the list with a minimum number of key strokes.
    The interface is designed to make it easy for the expert to pull up evidence from relevant concordance lines to help identify incorrect candidates as well as terms that are missing from the list.
    A single key-press copies the current candidate term
