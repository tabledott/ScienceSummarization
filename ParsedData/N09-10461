nificant challenges to the lexicalized models that are currently common in statistical machine translation.
    This problem has been widely acknowledged, and the conventional solution, which has been shown to work well for many language pairs, is to segment compounds into their constituent morphemes using either morphological analyzers or empirical methods and then to translate from or to this segmented variant (Koehn et al., 2008; Dyer et al., 2008; Yang and Kirchhoff, 2006).
    But into what units should a compound word be segmented?
    Taken as a stand-alone task, the goal of a compound splitter is to produce a segmentation for some input that matches the linguistic intuitions of a native speaker of the language.
    However, there are often advantages to using elements larger than single morphemes as the minimal lexical unit for MT, since they may correspond more closely to the units of translation.
    Unfortunately, determining the optimal segmentation is challenging, typically requiring extensive ex
