edicate as specified by the FU equation, the local predicate must (i) subcategorise for the argument in question and (ii) the argument in question must not be already filled.
			Subcategorisation requirements are provided lexically in terms of semantic forms(subcat lists) and coherence and completeness con ditions (all GFs specified must be present, and noothers may be present) on f-structure representa tions.
			Semantic forms specify which grammatical functions (GFs) a predicate requires locally.
			For ourexample in Figures 3 and 4, the relevant lexical en tries are: V ? said ?PRED=say??
			SUBJ, ? COMP?
			V ? signs ?PRED=sign??
			SUBJ, ? OBJ?
			FU equations and subcategorisation requirements together ensure that LDDs can only be resolved at suitable f-structure locations.
	
	
			In order to model the LFG account of LDD resolu tion we require subcat frames (i.e. semantic forms)and LDD resolution paths through f-structure.
			Tra ditionally, such resources were handcoded.
