eeded as any other common words.
    After transformation through class-based HMM, word segmentation becomes single-source shortest paths problem.
    Hence the best choice W# of word segmentation is easy to find using Djikstra's algorithm.
  
  
    Here, we would introduce the operation of some different track.
    We participate all the closed tracks.
    As for each closed track, we first extracted all the common words and tokens that appear in the training corpus.
    Then build the segmentation core lexicons with the words.
    Those named entity words are classified into different named entities: numeric and time expression, personal names, location names, and transliterated names.
    According to named entities in the given corpus, we could train both class-based segmentation HMM and rolebased HMM model for unknown word recognition.
    Therefore, the whole lexical system including unknown word detection is accomplished as shown in Figure 1.
    We only participate GB code open tracks.
    Actually,
