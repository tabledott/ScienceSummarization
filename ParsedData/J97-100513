ional relations was around .75, high enough to support tentative conclusions.
    Finally, a method for segmenting dialogues based on a notion of control was used in Whittaker and Stenton (1988) and Walker and Whittaker (1990).
    Utterances were classified into four types, each of which was associated with a rule that assigned a controller; the discourse was then divided into segments, based on which speaker had control.
    Neither study presented any quantitative analysis of the ability to reliably perform the initial utterance classification.
    However, in Whittaker and Stenton (1988), a higher level of discourse structure based on topic shifts was agreed upon by at least 4 of 5 judges for 46 of the 56 control shifts.
    In sum, relatively few quantitative empirical studies have been made of how to annotate discourse corpora with features of discourse structure, and those recent ones that exist use various models such as the Grosz and Sidner model (1986), an informal notion of topic (Hearst 1994; Flam
