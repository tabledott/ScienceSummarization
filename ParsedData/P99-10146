defined by Note that our application is an instance of the EM-algorithm for context-free models (Baum et al., 1970), from which the following particularily simple reestimation formulae can be derived.
    Let x = (c, y) for fixed c and y.
    Then probabilistic context-free grammar of (Carroll and Rooth, 1998) gave for the British National Corpus (117 million words).
    Intuitively, the conditional expectation of the number of times a particular v, n, or c choice is made during the derivation is prorated by the conditionally expected total number of times a choice of the same kind is made.
    As shown by Baum et al. (1970), these expectations can be calculated efficiently using dynamic programming techniques.
    Every such maximization step increases the log-likelihood function L, and a sequence of re-estimates eventually converges to a (local) maximum of L. In the following, we will present some examples of induced clusters.
    Input to the clustering algorithm was a training corpus of 1280715 tokens (60
