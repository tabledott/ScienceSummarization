hen the algorithm might show a significant improvement.
    In this analysis, error chains contributed 22 failures to Hobbs' algorithm and 19 failures to BFP.
  
  
    The numbers presented in the previous section are intuitively unsatisfying.
    They tell us nothing about what makes the algorithms more or less general, or how they might be improved.
    In addition, given the assumptions that we needed to make in order to produce them, one might wonder to what extent the data is a result of these assumptions.
    Figure 1 also fails to indicate whether the two algorithms missed the same examples or are covering a different set of phenomena, i.e. what the relative distribution of the successes and failures are.
    But having done the hand-simulation in order to produce such numbers, all of this information is available.
    In this section we will first discuss the relative importance of various factors that go into producing the numbers above, then discuss if the algorithms can be modified since the flexi
