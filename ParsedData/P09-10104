1; Oates, 2001).
    Instances of such approaches include work on inferring the meaning of words from video data (Roy and Pentland, 2002; Barnard and Forsyth, 2001), and interpreting the commentary of a simulated soccer game (Chen and Mooney, 2008).
    Most of these approaches assume some form of parallel data, and learn perceptual cooccurrence patterns.
    In contrast, our emphasis is on learning language by proactively interacting with an external environment.
    Reinforcement Learning for Language Processing Reinforcement learning has been previously applied to the problem of dialogue management (Scheffler and Young, 2002; Roy et al., 2000; Litman et al., 2000; Singh et al., 1999).
    These systems converse with a human user by taking actions that emit natural language utterances.
    The reinforcement learning state space encodes information about the goals of the user and what they say at each time step.
    The learning problem is to find an optimal policy that maps states to actions, through a tria
