es, Snow for improving the quality of these entities and the forward-backward algorithm for finding categories for the named entities.
    The combination of the three algorithms showed a substantially improved performance when compared with a single algorithm and an algorithm pair (Spanish test set: F,3=1=79.05; Dutch test set: F,3=1=74.99).
    Carreras, Marquez and Padro (2002) have approached the shared task by using AdaBoost applied to fixed-depth decision trees.
    Their system used many different input features contextual information, word-internal clues, previous entity classes, part-of-speech tags (Dutch only) and external word lists (Spanish only).
    It processed the data in two stages: first entity recognition and then classification.
    Their system obtained the best results in this shared task for both the Spanish and Dutch test data sets (Spanish test set: F,3=1=81.39; Dutch test set: F,3=1=77.05).
