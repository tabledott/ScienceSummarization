    Statistical analysis for the larger set of Hebrew examples shows that with 95% confidence our method succeeds in at least 86% of the applicable examples (using the parameters of the distribution of proportions).
    With the same confidence, our method improves the word frequency method by at least 18% (using confidence interval for the difference of proportions in multinomial distribution, where the four cells of the multinomial correspond to the four entries in the result table).
