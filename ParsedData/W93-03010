  Robust Bilingual Word Alignment For Machine Aided Translation
  
    We have developed a new program called aligning parallel text, text such as the Canadian Hansards that are available in two or more languages.
    The program takes the of 1993), a robust alternative to sentence-based alignment programs, and applies word-level constraints usa version of Brown Model 2 (Brown et al., 1993), modified and extended to deal robustness issues. tested on a subset of Canadian Hansards supplied by Simard (Simard et al., 1992).
    The combination of word_align plus char_align reduces the variance (average square error) by a factor of over More importantly, because word_align and char_align were designed to work robustly on texts that are smaller and more noisy than the Hansards, it has been possible to successfully deploy the programs at AT&amp;T Language Line Services, a commercial translation service, to help them with difficult terminology.
