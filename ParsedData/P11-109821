it correct.
    There is one additional Bombing and one Arson role that does not align with MUC-4, marked incorrect.
    We thus report 92% slot recall, and precision as 14 of 16 (88%) learned slots.
    We only measure agreement with the MUC template schemas, but our system learns other events as well.
    We show two such examples in figure 2: the Weapons Smuggling and Election Templates.
  
  
    We now present how to apply our learned templates to information extraction.
    This section will describe how to extract slot fillers using our templates, but without knowing which templates are correct.
    We could simply use a standard IE approach, for example, creating seed words for our new learned templates.
    But instead, we propose a new method that obviates the need for even a limited human labeling of seed sets.
    We consider each learned semantic role as a potential slot, and we extract slot fillers using the syntactic functions that were previously learned.
    Thus, the learned syntactic patter
