retrieval, and BLEU or multi-reference word error rate for statistical machine translation.
    The use of statistical techniques in natural language processing often starts out with the simplifying (often implicit) assumption that the final scoring is based on simply counting the number of wrong decisions, for instance, the number of sentences incorrectly translated in machine translation.
    Hence, there is a mismatch between the basic assumptions of the used statistical approach and the final evaluation criterion used to measure success in a task.
    Ideally, we would like to train our model parameters such that the end-to-end performance in some application is optimal.
    In this paper, we investigate methods to efficiently optimize model parameters with respect to machine translation quality as measured by automatic evaluation criteria such as word error rate and BLEU.
  
  
    Let us assume that we are given a source (&#8216;French&#8217;) sentence , which is to be translated into a target (&#8216;E
