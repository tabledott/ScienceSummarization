    The classifier.feature module provides a standard encoding for the information that is used to make decisions for a particular classification task.
    This standard encoding allows students to experiment with the differences between different text classification algorithms, using identical feature sets.
    The classifier.featureselection module defines a standard interface for choosing which features are relevant for a particular classification task.
    Good feature selection can significantly improve classification performance.
  
  
    The toolkit is accompanied by extensive documentation that explains the toolkit, and describes how to use and extend it.
    This documentation is divided into three primary categories: Tutorials teach students how to use the toolkit, in the context of performing specific tasks.
    Each tutorial focuses on a single domain, such as tagging, probabilistic systems, or text classification.
    The tutorials include a high-level discussion that explains a
