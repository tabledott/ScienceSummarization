recognized as a basic technique in Japanese sentence analysis, and a number of studies have been proposed for years.
    Japanese dependency structure is usually defined in terms of the relationship between phrasal units called 'bunsetsu' segments (hereafter &amp;quot;chunks&amp;quot;).
    Generally, dependency structure analysis consists of two steps.
    In the first step, dependency matrix is constructed, in which each element corresponds to a pair of chunks and represents the probability of a dependency relation between them.
    The second step is to find the optimal combination of dependencies to form the entire sentence.
    In previous approaches, these probabilites of dependencies are given by manually constructed rules.
    However, rule-based approaches have problems in coverage and consistency, since there are a number of features that affect the accuracy of the final results, and these features usually relate to one another.
    On the other hand, as large-scale tagged corpora have become availa
