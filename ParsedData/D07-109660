erent parsing and learn ing approaches, we still have only vague ideas about the strengths and weaknesses of different methodsfor languages with different typological characteris tics.
			Increasing our knowledge of the multi-causal relationship between language structure, annotation scheme, and parsing and learning methods probablyremains the most important direction for future re search in this area.
			The outputs of all systems for alldata sets from the two shared tasks are freely avail able for research and constitute a potential gold mine for comparative error analysis across languages and systems.
			For domain adaptation we have barely scratched the surface so far.
			But overcoming the bottleneckof limited annotated resources for specialized do mains will be as important for the deployment of human language technology as being able to handle multiple languages in the future.
			One result fromthe domain adaptation track that may seem surprising at first is the fact that closed class systems outperfor
