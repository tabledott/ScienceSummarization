the computations for statistical estimation and selection of the most probable analyses are done efficiently by dynamic programming, avoiding the need to unpack the parse forests and enumerate individual analyses.
    The underlying parsing system also has built-in robustness mechanisms that allow it to parse strings that are outside the scope of the grammar as a shortest sequence of wellformed &#8220;fragments&#8221;.
    Furthermore, performance parameters that bound parsing and disambiguation work can be tuned for efficient but accurate operation.
    As part of our assessment, we also measured the parsing speed of the two systems, taking into account all stages of processing that each system requires to produce its output.
    For example, since the Collins parser depends on a prior part-of-speech tagger (Ratnaparkhi, 1996), we included the time for POS tagging in our Collins measurements.
    XLE incorporates a sophisticated finite-state morphology and dictionary lookup component, and its time is part of
