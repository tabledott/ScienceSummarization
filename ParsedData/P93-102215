interpretation, as denoting a &amp;quot;typical&amp;quot; ratio between the mutual information values of each of the two words with another third word.
    The metric is reflexive (sim(w, w) = 1), symmetric (sim(wi, w2) = sim(w2, wi)), but is not transitive (the values of sim(wi, w2) and sim(w2, w3) do not imply anything on the value of sim(wi, w3)).
    The left column of Table 3 lists the six most similar words to the word 'aspects' according to this metric, based on our corpus.
    More examples of similarity were shown in Figure 1.
    The estimation method of section 3 requires that we identify the most similar words of a given word w. Doing this by computing the similarity between w and each word in the lexicon is computationally very expensive (o(l2), where 1 is the size of the lexicon, and 0(1 ) to do this in advance for all the words in the lexicon).
    To account for this problem we developed a simple heuristic that searches for words that are potentially similar to w, using thresholds on mutual in
