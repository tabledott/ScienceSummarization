    We compute the brevity penalty BP, The ranking behavior is more immediately apparent in the log domain, log BLEU = min(1 &#8722; In our baseline, we use N = 4 and uniform weights wn = 1/N.
  
  
    The BLEU metric ranges from 0 to 1.
    Few translations will attain a score of 1 unless they are identical to a reference translation.
    For this reason, even a human translator will not necessarily score 1.
    It is important to note that the more reference translations per sentence there are, the higher the score is.
    Thus, one must be cautious making even &#8220;rough&#8221; comparisons on evaluations with different numbers of reference translations: on a test corpus of about 500 sentences (40 general news stories), a human translator scored 0.3468 against four references and scored 0.2571 against two references.
    Table 1 shows the BLEU scores of the 5 systems against two references on this test corpus.
    The MT systems S2 and S3 are ve
