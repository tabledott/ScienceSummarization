ct the number of lexical entries used to parse a treebank.
    With a threshold n for the number of lexical entries and a threshold C for the probability, lexical entries are assigned to a word in descending order of probability, until the number of assigned entries exceeds n, or the accumulated probability exceeds C. If the lexical entry necessary to produce the correct parse is not assigned, it is additionally assigned to the word.
    Figure 3 shows an example of filtering lexical entries assigned to &#8220;saw&#8221;.
    With C = 0.95, four lexical entries are assigned.
    Although the lexicon includes other lexical entries, such as a verbal entry taking a sentential complement (p = 0.01 in the figure), they are filtered out.
