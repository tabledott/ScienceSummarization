the parser to fit the specific test data.
    Table 2 shows trials with increasing amounts of conditioning information from the left context.
    There are a couple of things to notice from these results.
    First, and least surprising, is that the accuracy of the parses improved as we conditioned on more and more information.
    Like the nonlexicalized parser in Roark and Johnson (1999), we found that the search efficiency, in terms of number of rule expansions considered or number of analyses advanced, also improved as we increased the amount of conditioning.
    Unlike the Roark and Johnson parser, however, our coverage did not substantially drop as the amount of conditioning information increased, and in some cases, coverage improved slightly.
    They did not smooth their conditional probability estimates, and blamed sparse data for their decrease in coverage as they increased the conditioning information.
    These results appear to support this, since our smoothed model showed no such tendency.
