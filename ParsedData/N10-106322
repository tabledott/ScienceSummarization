slator provided a sample of translation requests along with translations in GermanEnglish and Spanish-English, which acted our standard development and test set.
    Unfortunately no such tagged set was available in Bulgarian-English, so we held out a portion of the large system&#8217;s training data to use for development and test.
    In each language pair, the test set was split into a development portion (&#8220;Dev A&#8221;) used for minimum error rate training (Och, 2003) and a test set (&#8220;Test A&#8221;) used for final evaluation.
    Second, we created new test sets in each of the three language pairs by sampling parallel sentences from held out Wikipedia articles.
    To ensure that this test data was clean, we manually filtered the sentence pairs that were not truly parallel and edited them as necessary to improve adequacy.
    We called this &#8220;Wikitest&#8221;.
    This test set is available at http://research.microsoft.com/enus/people/chrisq/wikidownload.aspx.
