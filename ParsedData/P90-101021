 either believes that the speaker believes not P or that the speaker does not know P then inter- rupt; (A2)AMBIGUITY: If the listener believes that the speakers assertion is relevant but am- biguous then interrupt.
  PLAN QUALITY: The listener must believe that the action proposed by the speaker is a part of an adequate plan to achieve the mutual goal and the action must also be comprehensible to the listener.
  The two rules to express this are: (B1)EFFECTIVENESS: If the listener believes P and either believes that P presents an ob- stacle to the proposed plan or believes that P ?
  is part of the proposed plan that has already been satisfied, then interrupt; (B2) AMBIGU- ITY: If  the listener believes that an assertion about the proposed plan is ambiguous, then interrupt.
  These principles indirectly proyide a means to ensure mutual belief.
  Since a participant must in- terrupt if any condition for an interrupt holds, then lack of interruption signals that there is no discrep- ancy in mutual beliefs.
