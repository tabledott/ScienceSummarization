rks well for homonyms, it is less accurate for related senses (Krovetz 1998), and this distinction is not made in WordNet.
    We did, however, find that in SemCor, for the majority of polysemous11 lemma and file combinations, there was only one sense exhibited (see Table 5).
    We refrained from using the OSPD in situations in which there was conflicting evidence regarding the appropriate sense for a word type occurring more than once in an individual file.
    In our experiments the OSPD heuristic increased coverage by 7% and recall by 3%, at a cost of only a 1% decrease in precision.
  
  
    We quantified coverage and accuracy of sense disambiguation of verbs, adjectives, and nouns in the SENSEVAL-2 English all-words test corpus, using automatically acquired selectional preferences.
    We improved coverage and recall by applying the one-sense-per-discourse heuristic.
    The results show that disambiguation models using only selectional preferences can perform with accuracy well above the random baseli
