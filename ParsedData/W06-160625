neralize better than the phrase-based rules.
    We were also pleased to see that the Bleu score improvements going from the phrase- to the syntax-based models, as well as the Bleu improvements going from the simple syntax-based models to the combined models system are fully consistent with the human qualitative judgments in our subjective evaluations.
    This correlation suggests that we can continue to use the Bleu metric to further improve our models and systems.
