nificantly different.
    From the resulting corpus, we automatically replace translations.
    In addition, only sentences with less than 60 words in English and Chinese are used.
    To improve the translation of Chinese numbers, we use a categorization of Chinese number and date expressions.
    For the statistical learning, all number and date expressions are replaced with one of two generic symbols, $number or $date.
    The number and date expressions are subjected to a rule-based translation by simple lexicon lookup.
    The translation of the number and date expressions is inserted into the output using the alignment information.
    For Chinese and English, this categorization is implemented independently of the other language.
    To evaluate MT quality on this task, NIST made available the NIST-09 evaluation tool.
    This tool provides a modified BLEU score by computing a weighted precision of n-grams modified by a length penalty for very short translations.
