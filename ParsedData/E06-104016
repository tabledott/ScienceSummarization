s in NIST and SE scores for SUMTIMEHybrid/pCRU-roulette, and the difference in BLEU scores for SUMTIME-Hybrid/pCRU-2gram.
    Table 3 shows Pearson correlation coefficients (PCC) for the metrics and humans in Table 2.
    The strongest correlation with experts and nonexperts is achieved by NIST-5 (0.82 and 0.83), with ROUGE-4 and SE showing especially poor correlation.
    BLEU-4 correlates fairly well with the non-experts but less with the experts.
    We computed another correlation statistic (shown in brackets in Table 3) which measures how well scores by an arbitrary single human or run of a metric correlate with the average scores by a set of humans or runs of a metric.
    This is computed as the average PCC between the scores assigned by individual humans/runs of a metric (indexing the rows in Table 3) and the average scores assigned by a set of humans/runs of a metric (indexing the columns in Table 3).
    For example, the PCC for non-experts and experts is 0.845, but the average PCC between individua
