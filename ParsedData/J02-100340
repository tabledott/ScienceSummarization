gorithm finds 0 such that [[0]] = [[cp1]] n &#183; &#183; &#183; n [[cpm]].
    Then [[x]] n [[0]] = [[cp]]; but [[cp]] C [77]] C [[x]], therefore also [[77]] n [[0]] = [[cp]].
  
  
    The GRE algorithms discussed in this paper are fairly limited in their aspirations.
    For example, they do not involve relational descriptions (Dale and Haddock 1991; Horacek 1997; Krahmer, van Erk, and Verleg 2001) or properties that are vague or context dependent (van Deemter 2000).
    Moreover, they disregard shades of salience (unlike algorithms proposed in Krahmer and Theune [1999], Theune [2000]), relying instead on a simple dichotomy between those objects that are salient enough (which end up in the domain D) and those that are not (Reiter and Dale 2000, Section 5.4).
    Finally, like all other GRE algorithms that we are aware of, they disregard the generation of descriptions in intensional contexts (e.g., John knows that x is the murderer ofJones; Dowty, Wall, and Peters 1981).
    But even within this limited bri
