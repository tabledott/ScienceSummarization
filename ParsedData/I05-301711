			The People?s Republic of China had the greatest number with 17, followed by the United States (6), Hong Kong (5), Taiwan (3), six others with one each.
			Of these, 23 submitted results for scoring andsubsequently submitted a paper for these pro ceedings.
			A summary of participating groups and the tracks for which they submitted results can be found in Table!2 on the preceding page.
