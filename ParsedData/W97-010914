 quadruples are disambiguated or SDT =3.
    The above algorithm can be described as iterative clustering, because at first, the nearest quadruples are matched and disambiguated.
    Then, the similarity distance threshold is raised, and the process repeats itself in the next iteration.
    If a word is not successfully disambiguated, it is assigned its first, Le. the most frequent sense.
    The reason for starting with the best matches is that these tend to provide better disambiguations.
    Consider, for example, the following set of quadruples: At first, the algorithm tries to disambiguate quadruple Q1 .
    Starting with the verb, the algorithm searches for other quadruples which have the quadruple distance (see below) smaller than the current similarity distance threshold.
    For SDT-0 this means only for quadruples with all the words with semantic distance 0, i.e. synonyms.
    There are no matches found for Q1 and the algorithm moves to Q2, fmding quadruple Q4 as the only one matching such criteria.
