1; to predict which states are more promising, and the prefix cost includes an exact cost for the left outside context, but no right outside context. where reg, cost &#955; = w &#183; &amp;_(h&#8242;, h) where h(x) returns the head word index of tree x, because all features in this model are based on the head and modifier indices in a dependency link.
    This function is obviously bounded and monotonic in our definitions.
    The theoretical complexity of this algorithm is O(n7) because in a reduction step we have three span indices and three head indices, plus a step index E. By contrast, the naive CKY algorithm for this model is O(n5) which can be improved to O(n3) (Eisner, 1996).6 The higher complexity of our algorithm is due to two factors: first, we have to maintain both h and h&#8242; in one state, because the current shift-reduce model can not draw features across different states (unlike CKY); and more importantly, we group states by step E in order to achieve incrementality and linear runtime with b
