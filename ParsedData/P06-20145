    We aim to create an alignment system that obeys cohesion constraints most of the time, but can violate them when necessary.
    Unfortunately, Cherry and Lin&#8217;s beam search solution does not lend itself to a soft cohesion constraint.
    The imperfect beam search may not be able to find the optimal alignment under a soft constraint.
    Furthermore, it is not clear what penalty to assign to crossings, or how to learn such a penalty from an iterative training process.
    The remainder of this paper will develop a complete alignment search that is aware of cohesion violations, and use discriminative learning technology to assign a meaningful penalty to those violations.
  
  
    We require an alignment search that can find the globally best alignment under its current objective function, and can account for phrasal cohesion in this objective.
