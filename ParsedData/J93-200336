 We say that ij is pegged in these alignments.
    By the pegged Viterbi alignment for ij, which we write Vi.._1(f le), we mean that element of Ai._1(e, f) for which Pr(aie, f) is greatest.
    Obviously, we can find V&#8222;_)(fle; 1) and 17,,_1(f le; 2) quickly with a straightforward modification of the algorithm described above for finding V(f le; 1) and V(f le; 2).
    Model 3 is based on Equation (29).
    Earlier, we were unable to treat each of the conditional probabilities on the right-hand side of Equation (4) as a separate parameter.
    With Equation (29) we are no better off and must again make assumptions to reduce the number of independent parameters.
    There are many different sets of assumptions that we might make, each leading to a different model for the translation process.
    In Model 3, we assume that, for i between 1 and /, Pr(Oi 1011.-1, e) depends only on Oi and ei; that, for all i, Pr(rikirit-1, 7-1, 4, e) depends only on rik and ei; and that, for i between 1 and /, Pr(7rik 14-1, T
