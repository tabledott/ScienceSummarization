tors move each unattached chunk of structure under the node to which it should be attached.
  Notational devices allow annotators to indicate uncertainty concerning constituent labels, and to indicate multiple attachment sites for ambiguous modifiers.
  The bracketing process is described in more detail in Section 4.3.
  4.2 The Syntactic Tagset Table 3 shows the set of syntactic tags and null elements that we use in our skeletal bracketing.
  More detailed information on the syntactic tagset and guidelines concern- ing its use are to be found in Santorini and Marcinkiewicz (1991).
  Although different in detail, our tagset is similar in delicacy to that used by the Lancaster Treebank Project, except hat we allow null elements in the syntactic anno- tation.
  Because of the need to achieve a fairly high output per hour, it was decided not to require annotators to create distinctions beyond those provided by the parser.
  Our approach to developing the syntactic tagset was highly pragmatic and strongly influen
