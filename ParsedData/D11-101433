 approach jointly learns the necessary features and tree structure.
    In multi-aspect rating (Snyder and Barzilay, 2007) one finds several distinct aspects such as food or service in a restaurant and then rates them on a fixed linear scale such as 1-5 stars, where all aspects could obtain just 1 star or all aspects could obtain 5 stars independently.
    In contrast, in our method a single aspect (a complex reaction to a human experience) is predicted not in terms of a fixed scale but in terms of a multinomial distribution over several interconnected, sometimes mutually exclusive emotions.
    A single story cannot simultaneously obtain a strong reaction in different emotional responses (by virtue of having to sum to one).
  
  
    We presented a novel algorithm that can accurately predict sentence-level sentiment distributions.
    Without using any hand-engineered resources such as sentiment lexica, parsers or sentiment shifting rules, our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on commonly used sent
