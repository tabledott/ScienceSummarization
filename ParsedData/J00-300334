 evidence, we can compute word-based likelihoods P( WI U) in a straightforward way, by building a statistical language model for each of the 42 DAs.
    All DAs of a particular type found in the training corpus were pooled, and a DA-specific trigram model was estimated using standard techniques (Katz backoff [Katz 19871 with Witten-Bell discounting [Witten and Bell 1991]).
    Modified Bayes network including word hypotheses and recognizer acoustics. the above approach is only a partial solution, since we are not yet able to recognize words in spontaneous speech with perfect accuracy.
    A standard approach is to use the 1-best hypothesis from the speech recognizer in place of the true word transcripts.
    While conceptually simple and convenient, this method will not make optimal use of all the information in the recognizer, which in fact maintains multiple hypotheses as well as their relative plausibilities.
    A more thorough use of recognized speech can be derived as follows.
    The classification fra
