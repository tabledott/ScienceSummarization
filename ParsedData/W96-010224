 We did 10-fold cross-validation experiments for several sizes of datasets (in steps of 100,000 memory items), revealing the learning curve in Figure 4.
    Training set size is on the X-axis, generalization performance as measured in a 10-fold cross-validation experiment is on the Y-axis. the 'error' range indicate averages plus and minus one standard deviation on each 10-fold cross-validation experiment.'
    Already at small data set sizes, performance is relatively high.
    With increasingly larger data sets, the performance becomes more stable (witness the error ranges).
    It should be noted that in this experiment, we assumed correctly disambiguated tags in the left context.
    In practice, when using our tagger, this is of course not the case because the disambiguated tags in the left context of the current word to be tagged are the result of a previous decision of the tagger, which may be a mistake.
    To test the influence of this effect we performed a third experiment.
    We performed the comp
