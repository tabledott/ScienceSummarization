ine and the limit of our ability to measure performance.
    In so doing, we were able to obtain a much more usable estimate of (96.8%) by redefining the task from a classification task to a discrimination task.
    In addition, we also made use of the constraint that multiple instances of a polysemous word in the same discourse have a very strong tendency to take on the same sense.
    This constraint will probably prove useful for improving the performance of future word-sense disambiguation algorithms.
    Similar attempts to establish upper and lower bounds on performance have been made in other areas of computational linguistics, specifically part of speech tagging.
    For that application, it is generally accepted that the baseline part-of-speech tagging performance is about 90% (as estimated by a similar baseline system that ignores context and simply assigns the most likely part of speech to all instances of a word) and that the upper bound (imposed by the limit for judges to agree with one another)
