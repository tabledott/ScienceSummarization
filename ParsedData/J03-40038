ls to generalize by producing new rules on test data examples.
    We analyze these phenomena through experiments on parsing accuracy, by collecting frequencies of various structures in the treebank, and through linguistically motivated examples.
    Finally, section 8 gives more discussion, by comparing the models to others that have been applied to parsing the treebank.
    We aim to give some explanation of the differences in performance among the various models.
  
  
    Probabilistic context-free grammars are the starting point for the models in this article.
    For this reason we briefly recap the theory behind nonlexicalized PCFGs, before moving to the lexicalized case.
    Following Hopcroft and Ullman (1979), we define a context-free grammar G as a 4-tuple (N, E, A, R), where N is a set of nonterminal symbols, E is an alphabet, A is a distinguished start symbol in N, and R is a finite set of rules, in which each rule is of the form X &#8594; &#946; for some X E N, &#946; E (N U E)&#8727;.
