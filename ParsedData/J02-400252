    If none of the patterns match, the value Non-Prototypical is assigned.
    Sentence length.
    Kupiec, Pedersen, and Chen (1995) report sentence length as a useful feature for text extraction.
    In our implementation, sentences are divided into long or short sentences, by comparison to a fixed threshold (12 words).
    Title word contents.
    Sentences containing many &#8220;content-bearing&#8221; words have been hypothesized to be good candidates for text extraction.
    Baxendale (1958) extracted all words except those on the stop list from the title and the headlines and determined for each sentence whether or not it contained these words.
    We received better results by excluding headline words and using only title words.
    TF*IDF word contents.
    How content-bearing a word is can also be measured with frequency counts (Salton and McGill 1983).
