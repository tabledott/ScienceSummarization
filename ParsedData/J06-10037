s network, the similarity function simKF between words of the defining vocabulary is computed by means of spreading activation on this network.
  The function is extended to the rest of LDOCE by representing each word as a list W = {w1, .
  , wr} of the words in its definition; thus, for instance, simKF(linguistics, stylistics) = simKF({the, study, of, language, in, general, and, of, particular, languages, and, their, structure, and, grammar, and, history}, {the, study, of, style, in, written, or, spoken, language}) Kozima and Ito (1997) built on this work to derive a context-sensitive, or dynamic, measure that takes into account the ?associative direction?
  of a given word pair.
  For example, the context {car, bus} imposes the associative direction of vehicle (close words are then likely to include taxi, railway, airplane, etc.
  ), whereas the context {car, engine} imposes the direction of components of car (tire, seat, headlight, etc.).
