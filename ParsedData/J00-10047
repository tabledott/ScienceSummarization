t tape; if square 0 is already occupied, then v is written to the next empty square to the left of 0 if &lt; 0, or to the right of 3 if )3 &gt; 0, and similarly, if input was already read from position a, w is taken from the next unread square to the left of a if a &lt; 0 or to the right of a if a &gt; 0.
    The operation of a head transducer is nondeterministic.
    It starts by taking a head transition Kg, 9', wo, vo, 0, 0, c) where wo is one of the symbols (not necessarily the leftmost) in the input string.
    (The valid initial states are therefore implicitly defined as those with an outgoing head transition.) wo is considered to be at square 0 of the input tape and vo is output at square 0 of the output tape.
    Further state transitions may then be taken until a final state in F is reached.
    For a derivation to be valid, it must read each symbol in the input string exactly once.
    At the end of a derivation, the output string is formed by taking the sequence of symbols on the target tape, ignori
