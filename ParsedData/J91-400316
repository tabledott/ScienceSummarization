    Therefore, if done correctly, lexical semantics can be a means to reevaluate the very nature of semantic composition in language.
    In what ways could lexical semantics affect the larger methods of composition in semantics?
    I mentioned above that most of the careful representation work has been done on verb classes.
    In fact, the semantic weight in both lexical and compositional terms usually falls on the verb.
    This has obvious consequences for how to treat lexical ambiguity.
    For example, consider the verb bake in the two sentences below.
    Atkins, Kegl, and Levin (1988) demonstrate that verbs such as bake are systematically ambiguous, with both a change-of-state sense (15a) and a create sense (15b).
    A similar ambiguity exists with verbs that allow the resulative construction, shown in Examples 16 and 17, and discussed in Dowty (1979), Jackendoff (1983), and Levin and Rapoport (1988).
    These two verbs differ in their semantic representations, where run in 18a means goto-by-mean
