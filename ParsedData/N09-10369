ed by the grammar&#8217;s rules) into another stream of trees whose support is also TX.
    In adaptor grammars the base distributions HX are determined by the PCFG rules expanding X and the other adapted distributions, as explained in Johnson et al. (2007b).
    When called upon to generate another sample tree, the adaptor either generates and returns a fresh tree from HX or regenerates a tree it has previously emitted, so in general the adapted distribution differs from the base distribution.
    This paper uses adaptors based on Chinese Restaurant Processes (CRPs) or Pitman-Yor Processes (PYPs) (Pitman, 1995; Pitman and Yor, 1997; Ishwaran and James, 2003).
    CRPs and PYPs nondeterministically generate infinite sequences of natural numbers z1, z2,.
    .
    ., where z1 = 1 and each zn+1 &lt; m + 1 where m = max(z1, ... , zn).
    In the &#8220;Chinese Restaurant&#8221; metaphor samples produced by the adaptor are viewed as &#8220;customers&#8221; and zn is the index of the &#8220;table&#8221; that the n
