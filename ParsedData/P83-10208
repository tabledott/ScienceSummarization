cuous, and which allows (and perhaps even forces) grammatical generalizations to be stated in a natural way.
    As is often argued, such a representation must be embodied by our language understanding faculty, given that the grammar of a language is learned incrementally and quickly by children given only limited evidence.
    (To recast this point from an engineering point of view, this property is also a prerequisite to writing a &#8226; grammar for a subset of some given natural language which remains extensible, so that new constructions can be added to the grammar without global changes, and so that these new constructions will interact robustly with the old grammar.)
    Following [Shipman 781, as refined in (Berwick 821. we assume that the grammar is organized into a set of context free rules, which we will call base templates, and a set of pattern-action rules.
    As in Parsifal, each pattern consists of up to four elements, each of which is a partial description of an element in the buffer, or the
