ctor of decomposability as the head noun.
    This is partially supported by the statistics on the relative occurrence of NN compounds in WordNet subsumed by their head noun (71.4%) as compared to NN compounds subsumed by their modifier (13.7%).
    In an ideal world, we would hope that the values for mean hyponymy were nearly 1 for the first partition and nearly 0 for the last.
    Naturally, this presumes perfect correlation of the LSA similarities with decomposability, but classificational inconsistencies in WordNet also work against us.
    For example, vice chairman is an immediate hyponym of both chairman and president, but vice president is not a hyponym of president.
    According to LSA, however, sim(chairman, vice chairman) = .508 and sim(president, vice president) = .551.
    It remains to be determined why LSA should perform better over low-frequency items, although the higher polysemy of high-frequency items is one potential cause.
    We intend to further investigate this matter in future resear
