 parts for sibling interactions, such as the trio &#8220;plays&#8221;, &#8220;Elianti&#8221;, and &#8220;.&#8221; in Figure 1.
    The Carreras (2007) parser has parts for both sibling interactions and grandparent interactions, such as the trio &#8220;*&#8221;, &#8220;plays&#8221;, and &#8220;Haag&#8221; in Figure 1.
    These kinds of higher-order factorizations allow dependency parsers to obtain a limited form of context-sensitivity.
    Given a factorization of dependency structures into parts, we restate dependency parsing as the folAbove, we have assumed that each part is scored by a linear model with parameters w and featuremapping f(&#183;).
    For many different part factorizations and structure domains Y(&#183;), it is possible to solve the above maximization efficiently, and several recent efforts have concentrated on designing new maximization algorithms with increased contextsensitivity (Eisner, 2000; McDonald et al., 2005b; McDonald and Pereira, 2006; Carreras, 2007).
