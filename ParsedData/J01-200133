    16 Brent's description of his algorithm is not detailed enough to satisfy the curiosity of someone like the present writer, who has encountered problems that Brent's approach would seem certain to encounter equally.
    As we shall see below, the central practical problem to grapple with is the fact that when considering suffixes (or candidate suffixes) consisting of only a single letter (let us say, s, for example), it is extremely difficult to get a good estimate of how many of the potential occurrences (of word-final s) are suffixal s and how many are not.
    As we shall suggest towards the end of this paper, the only accurate way to make an estimate is on the basis of a multinornial estimate once larger suffix signatures have been established.
    Without this, it is difficult not to overestimate the frequency of single-letter suffixes, a result that may
