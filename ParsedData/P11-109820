ty extraction performance in Section 5.
    We now compare our learned templates to those hand-created by human annotators for the MUC-4 terrorism corpus.
    The corpus contains 6 template types, but two of them occur in only 4 and 14 of the 1300 training documents.
    We thus only evaluate the 4 main templates (bombing, kidnapping, attack, and arson).
    The gold slots are shown in figure 3.
    We evaluate the four learned templates that score highest in the document classification evaluation (to be described in section 5.1), aligned with their MUC-4 types.
    Figure 2 shows three of our four templates, and two brand new ones that our algorithm learned.
    Of the four templates, we learned 12 of the 13 semantic roles as created for MUC.
    In addition, we learned a new role not in MUC for bombings, kidnappings, and arson: the Police or Authorities role.
    The annotators chose not to include this in their labeling, but this knowledge is clearly relevant when understanding such events, so we consider
