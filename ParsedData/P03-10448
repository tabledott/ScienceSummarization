AutoSlog-TS learns patterns for filling an individual slot in an event template, while simultaneously acquiring a set of lexical elements/concepts eligible to fill the slot.
    AutoSlogTS, does not require a pre-annotated corpus, but does require one that has been split into subsets that are relevant vs. non-relevant subsets to the scenario.
    (Yangarber et al., 2000) attempts to find extraction patterns, without a pre-classified corpus, starting from a set of seed patterns.
    This is the basic unsupervised learner on which our approach is founded; it is described in the next section.
  
  
    We first present the basic algorithm for pattern acquisition, similar to that presented in (Yangarber et al., 2000).
    Section 3.3 places the algorithm in the framework of counter-training.
    Prior to learning, the training corpus undergoes several steps of pre-processing.
    The learning algorithm depends on the fundamental redundancy in natural language, and the pre-processing the text is designed to reduce
