earning-based coreference resolvers operate by training a model for classifying whether two mentions are co-referring or not (e.g., Soon et al. (2001), Ng and Cardie (2002b), Kehler et al.
    (2004), Ponzetto and Strube (2006)).
    Despite their initial successes, these mention-pair models have at least two major weaknesses.
    First, since each candidate antecedent for a mention to be resolved (henceforth an active mention) is considered independently of the others, these models only determine how good a candidate antecedent is relative to the active mention, but not how good a candidate antecedent is relative to other candidates.
    In other words, they fail to answer the critical question of which candidate antecedent is most probable.
    Second, they have limitations in their expressiveness: the information extracted from the two mentions alone may not be sufficient for making an informed coreference decision, especially if the candidate antecedent is a pronoun (which is semantically empty) or a ment
