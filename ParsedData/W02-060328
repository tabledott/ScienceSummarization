ies were identified), (2) correct but incomplete segmentation (i.e., not all relevant morpheme boundaries were identified, but no proposed boundary was incorrect), (3) incorrect segmentation (i.e., some proposed boundary did not correspond to an actual morpheme boundary).
    The results of the inspection for each of the three segmentation methods are shown in Table 3.
    The Recursive MDL method performs best and segments about half of the words correctly.
    The Sequential ML method comes second and Linguistica third with a share of 43% correctly segmented words.
    When considering the incomplete and incorrect segmentations the methods behave differently.
    The Recursive MDL method leaves very common word forms unsplit, and often produces excessive splitting for rare mentation and MDL cost (Rec.
    MDL), Sequential segmentation and ML cost (Seq.
    ML), and Linguistica (Ling.).
    The total MDL cost measures the compression of the corpus.
    However, the cost is computed according to Equation (1),
