cies can be better captured by the refined language-specific rules.
    We also test model performance when no linguistic rules are available, i.e., performing unconstrained variational inference.
    The model performs substantially worse (line 2), confirming that syntactic category refinement in a fully unsupervised setup is challenging.
    Learning Beyond Provided Rules Since HDPDEP is provided with linguistic rules, a legitimate question is whether it improves upon what the rules encode, especially when the rules are complete and language-specific.
    We can answer this question by comparing the performance of our model seeded with the English-specific rules against a deterministic parser that implements the same rules.
    Lines 4 and 5 of Table 6 demonstrate that the model outperforms a rules-only deterministic parser by 3.8% for sentences of length 10 or less and by 3.5% for sentences of length 20 or less.
