ship throughout the derivation, whereas nodes separated by an d-edge can be equated or have a path of any length inserted between them during a derivation.
    D-edges and i-edges are not distributed arbitrarily in d-trees.
    For each internal node, either all of its daughters are linked by i-edges or it has a single daughter that is linked to it by a d-edge.
    Each node is labelled with a terminal symbol, a nonterminal symbol or the empty string.
    A d-tree containing n d-edges can be decomposed into n + 1 components containing only i-edges.
    D-trees can be composed using two operations: subsertion and sister-adjunction.
    When a d-tree a is subserted into another d-tree fl, a component of a is substituted at a frontier nonterminal node (a substitution node) of and all components of a that are above the substituted component are inserted into d-edges above the substituted node or placed above the root node.
    For example, consider the d-trees a and shown in Figure 3.
    Note that components are
