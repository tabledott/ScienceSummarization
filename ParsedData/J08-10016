ell-suited for developing a coherence metric in the context of a ranking-based text generation system.
    We first summarize entity-based theories of discourse, and overview previous attempts for translating their underlying principles into computational coherence models.
    Next, we describe ranking approaches to natural language generation and focus on coherence metrics used in current text planners.
    Linguistic Modeling.
    Entity-based accounts of local coherence have a long tradition within the linguistic and cognitive science literature (Kuno 1972; Chafe 1976; Halliday and Hasan 1976; Karttunen 1976; Clark and Haviland 1977; Prince 1981; Grosz, Joshi, and Weinstein 1995).
    A unifying assumption underlying different approaches is that discourse coherence is achieved in view of the way discourse entities are introduced and discussed.
    This observation is commonly formalized by devising constraints on the linguistic realization and distribution of discourse entities in coherent texts.
