a sample English grammar that consists of 220 context-free rules and 40 sample sentences taken from actual publications.
    All programs are run on DEC-20 and written in MacLisp, but not compiled.
    Although the experiment is informal, the result show that the Tomita algorithm is about 5 to 10 times faster than Earley's algorithm, due to the pre-compilation of the grammar into the LR table.
    The Earley/Tomita ratio seems to increase as the size of grammar grows as shown in Figure 5.3.
    Figure 5.4 shows the relationship between the size of a produced sharedpacked forest representation (in terms of the number of nodes) and the ambiguity of its input sentence (the number of possible parses).
    The sample sentences are created from the following schema. noun verb det noun (prep det noun)n-1 An example sentence with this structure is I saw a man in the park on the hill with a telescope.
    The result shows that all possible parses can be represented in almost 0(log n) space, where n is the number of po
