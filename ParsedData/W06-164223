90% in all of the corpora, including the movie domain, which is considered to be difficult for SA (Turney, 2002).
    This is extremely high precision for this task, because the correctness of both the extraction and polarity assignment was evaluated simultaneously.
    The relative recall 1.28 in the digital camera domain means the recall is increased from 43%10 to 55%.
    The difference was smaller in other domains, but the domain-dependent polar clauses are much informative than general ones, thus the highprecision detection significantly enhances the system.
    To see the effects of our method, we conducted a control experiment which used preset criteria.
    To adopt the candidate atom a, the frequency of polarity, max(p(a), n(a)) was required to be 3 or more, and the ratio of polarity, max(&#65533;(a)&#65533;n(a)) was required to be higher &#65533;(a) than the threshold 0.
    Varying 0 from 0.05 to with various preset threshold values 0 for the digital camera and movie domains.
