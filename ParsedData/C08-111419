			Lund et al (1995) did not measure the accuracy of their algorithm on this three-class classification problem.
			Instead, following standard practice incognitive psychology, they showed that their al gorithm?s similarity scores for the 144 word pairs were correlated with the response times of human subjects in priming tests.
			In a typical priming test, a human subject reads a priming word (cradle) and is then asked to complete a partial word (complete bab as baby).
			The time required to perform thetask is taken to indicate the strength of the cogni tive link between the two words (cradle and baby).Using ten-fold cross-validation, PairClass at tains an accuracy of 77.1% on the 144 word pairs.
			Since the three classes are of equal size, guessing the majority class and random guessing both yield an
