ferred.
    This reflects the fact that the nested inferences model what the speaker intends the hearer to infer.
    If there are many inferences possible at the nested level, the speaker would not be able to ensure that the hearer would perform the correct (i.e., the intended) one.
    Example 4 shows the interpretation of &amp;quot;I want you to pass the salt&amp;quot; as a request.
    Taking the utterance literally, S infers that A wants him to know that A wants him to pass the salt.
    This yields proposition (2) which leads through the next three inferences to the intention that would be recognized from a request act, i.e. that A wants S to pass the salt (5).
    Notice that an application of the body-action rule to step (2) yields: INFORM(A, S, WA(PASS(S, A, SALT))), for, in fact, the speaker may be performing both speech acts.
    The level of inferencing heuristic favours the indirect form.
    The key step in Example 5 is the application of the know-positive rule from line (3) to line (4).
