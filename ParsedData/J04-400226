    The target word e depends on the aligned source words.
    If we denote the resulting word alignment matrix by A := A&#960;KAK and the predicted word class for word For p(ei  |{fj  |(i,j) &#8712; A}) we use a uniform mixture of a single-word model p(e  |f), which is constrained to predict only words that are in the predicted word class Ei: A disadvantage of this model is that the word order is ignored in the translation model.
    The translations the day after tomorrow or after the day tomorrow for the German word &#168;ubermorgen receive an identical probability.
    Yet the first one should obtain a significantly higher probability.
    Hence, we also include a dependence on the word positions in the lexicon model p(e  |f, i, j): Here, [(i', j) &#8712; A] is 1 if (i', j) &#8712; A and 0 otherwise.
    As a result, the word ei depends not only on the aligned French word fj, but also on the number of preceding French words aligned with ei and on the number of the preceding English words aligned
