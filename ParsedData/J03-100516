    For search purposes, we use the inverted alignment concept as introduced in Niessen et al. (1998) and Ney et al.
    (2000).
    An inverted alignment is defined as follows: inverted alignment: i &#8594; j = bi Here, a target position i is mapped to a source position j.
    The coverage constraint for an inverted alignment is not expressed by the notation: Each source position j should be &#8220;hit&#8221; exactly once by the path of the inverted alignment bI1 = b1 &#183; &#183; &#183; bi &#183; &#183; &#183; bI.
    The advantage of the inverted alignment concept is that we can construct target sentence hypotheses from bottom to top along the positions of the target sentence.
    Using the inverted alignments in the maximum approximation, we rewrite equation (1) to obtain the following search criterion, in which we are looking for the most likely target Illustration of the transitions in the regular and in the inverted alignment model.
