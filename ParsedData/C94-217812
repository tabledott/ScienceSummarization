			Conclusions.
			The K-vec algorithm generates a quick-and-dirty estimate of a bilingual exicon.
			This estimate could be used as a starting point for a more detailed alignment algorithm such as word_align (Dagan et al, 1993).
			In this way, we might be able to apply word_align to a broader class of language combinations including possibly English-Japanese and English-Chinese.
			Currently, word_align depends on charalign (Church, 1993) to generate a starting point, which limits its applicability to European languages since char_align was designed for language pairs that share a common alphabet.
