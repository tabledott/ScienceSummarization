nking algorithm, which is a greedy approximation to the MAP approximation: bitext linked to NULL.
    Otherwise, link all co-occurring token pairs (u, v) in the bitext.
    (D) The one-to-one assumption implies that linked words cannot be linked again.
    Therefore, remove all linked word tokens from their respective halves of the bitext.
    The competitive linking algorithm can be viewed as a heuristic search for the most likely assignment in the space of all possible assignments.
    The heuristic is that the most likely assignments contain links that are individually the most likely.
    The search proceeds by a process of elimination.
    In the first search iteration, all the assignments that do not contain the most likely link are discarded.
    In the second iteration, all the assignments that do not contain the second most likely link are discarded, and so on until only one assignment remains.&amp;quot; The algorithm greedily selects the most likely links first, and then selects less likely links on
