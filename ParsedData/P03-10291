icons (Riloff, 1993; Riloff and Jones, 1999) and extraction patterns (Riloff, 1996; Yangarber et al., 2000; Sudo et al., 2001).
    In particular, methods have recently emerged for the acquisition of event extraction patterns without corpus annotation in view of the cost of manual labor for annotation.
    However, there has been little study of alternative representation models of extraction patterns for unsupervised acquisition.
    In the prior work on extraction pattern acquisition, the representation model of the patterns was based on a fixed set of pattern templates (Riloff, 1996), or predicate-argument relations, such as subject-verb, and object-verb (Yangarber et al., 2000).
    The model of our previous work (Sudo et al., 2001) was based on the paths from predicate nodes in dependency trees.
    In this paper, we discuss the limitations of prior extraction pattern representation models in relation to their ability to capture the participating entities in scenarios.
    We present an alternative model
