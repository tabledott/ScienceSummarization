eed for transfer rules and relies instead on parameterized mappings that are defined and applied uniformly across all languages.
  Seven parameters are used to invoke exceptions to the ~?T4 and C$T4 functions in the context of translation divergences: :INT, :EXT, :PROMOTE, :DE- MOTE, ,, :CAT, and :CONFLATED.
  We will now present a formal description of each divergence type and its associated parameter.
  4.1 Thematic Divergence The first divergence type to be formalized is the one for thematic divergence, i.e., the repositioning ofarguments with respect to a given head.
  This type of divergence arises 607 Computational Linguistics Volume 20, Number 4 in cases in which the ~?T4 invokes the following sets of relations in place of steps 2 and 3 of (10): (11) 2.
  W ~ Z 3/Z  l ~ W Figure 9a shows the revised mapping.
  Thematic divergence arises only in cases in which there is a logical subject.
  An example of thematic divergence is the reversal of the subject with an object, as in the thematic divergence xamp
