 sentences 1.a and 1.b is ADDITIVE, because no causal connection exists between the two sentences, PRAGMATIC, because the relation pertains to illocutionary force and not to the propositional content of the sentences, and NEGATIVE, because the relation involves a CONTRAST between the two sentences.
    In the same framework, the relation between clauses 2.a and 2.b will be labeled as CAUSAL-SEMANTICPOSITIVE-NONBASIC.
    In Lascarides and Asher&#8217;s theory (1993), we would label the relation between 2.a and 2.b as EXPLANATION because the event in 2.b explains why the event in 2.a happened (perhaps by CAUSING it).
    In Hobbs&#8217;s theory (1990), we would also label the relation between 2.a and 2.b as EXPLANATION because the event asserted by 2.b CAUSED or could CAUSE the event asserted in 2.a.
    And in Mann and Thompson theory (1988), we would label sentence pairs 1.a, 1.b as CONTRAST because the situations presented in them are the same in many respects (the purchase of arms), because the situations
