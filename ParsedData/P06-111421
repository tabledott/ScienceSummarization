s identified by the system.
    When at least one of the top 50 AGQs were entailed by the original question, the answer passage associated with the top-ranked entailed question was returned as the answer.
    When none of the top 50 AGQs were entailed by the question, questionanswer pairs were re-ranked based on the entailment confidence, and the top-ranked answer was returned.
    Results for both of these conditions are presented in Table 9.
    Hybrid Method.
    Finally, we found that the best results could be obtained by combining aspects of each of these three strategies.
    Under this approach, candidate answers were initially ranked using features derived from entailment classifications performed between (1) the original question and each candidate answer and (2) the original question and the AGQ generated from each candidate answer.
    Once a ranking was established, answers that were not judged to be entailed by the question were also removed from final ranking.
