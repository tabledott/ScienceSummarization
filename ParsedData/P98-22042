cations for processing complex sentences unnecessary.
    Section 2 describes the centering model as the relevant background for my proposal.
    In Section 3, I introduce my model, its only data structure, the S-list, and the accompanying algorithm.
    In Section 4, I compare the results of my algorithm with the results of the centering algorithm (Brennan et al., 1987) with and without specifications for complex sentences (Kameyama, 1998).
  
  
    The centering model describes the relation between the focus of attention, the choices of referring expressions, and the perceived coherence of discourse.
    The model has been motivated with evidence from preferences for the antecedents of pronouns (Grosz et al., 1983; 1995) and has been applied to pronoun resolution (Brennan et al. (1987), inter alia, whose interpretation differs from the original model).
    The centering model itself consists of two constructs, the backward-looking center and the list of forward-looking centers, and a few rules and constrai
