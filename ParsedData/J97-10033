    TextTiling makes use of patterns of lexical co-occurrence and distribution.
    The algorithm has three parts: tokenization into terms and sentence-sized units, determination of a score for each sentence-sized unit, and detection of the subtopic boundaries, which are assumed to occur at the largest valleys in the graph that results from plotting sentence-units against scores.
    Three methods for score assignment have been explored: blocks, vocabulary introductions, and chains, although only the first two are evaluated in this article (the third is discussed in Hearst [1994b]).
    All three scoring methods make use only of patterns of lexical co-occurrence and distribution within texts, eschewing other kinds of discourse cues.
    The ultimate goal of passage-level structuring is not just to identify the subtopic units, but also to identify and label their subject matter.
    This article focuses only on the discovery of the segment boundaries,
