ng that some features which seem complicated at the first sight are indeed local.
    For example, the WordEdges feature in Fig.
    2(c), which classifies a node by its label, span length, and surrounding words, is still local since all these information are encoded either in the node itself or in the input sentence.
    In contrast, it would become non-local if we replace the surrounding words by surrounding POS 2In case multiple candidates get the same highest F-score, we choose the parse with the highest log probability from the baseline parser to be the oracle parse (Collins, 2000). tags, which are generated dynamically.
    More formally, we split the feature extractor f = (f1, ... , fd) into f = (fL; fN) where fL and fN are the local and non-local features, respectively.
    For the former, we extend their domains from parses to hyperedges, where f(e) returns the value of a local feature f E fL on hyperedge e, and its value on a parsey factors across the hyperedges (local productions), and we can pre-c
