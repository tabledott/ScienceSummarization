  1)) 270 Punyakanok, Roth, and Yih Importance of Parsing and Inference in SRL Xpress-MP (2004) running on a Pentium-III 800 MHz machine.
  Note that ordinary search methods (e.g., beam search) are not necessarily faster than solving an ILP problem and do not guarantee the optimal solution.
  The Importance of Syntactic Parsing We experimentally study the significance of syntactic parsing by observing the effects of using full parsing and shallow parsing information at each stage of an SRL system.
  We first describe, in Section 4.1, how we prepare the data.
  The comparison of full parsing and shallow parsing on the first three stages of the process is presented in the reverse order (Sections 4.2, 4.3, 4.4).
  Note that in the following section
