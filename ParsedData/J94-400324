condition that the difference between the alternative probabilities is significant.
    For example, if /51 -= 0.51 and /52 = 0.49, the expected success rate in choosing T1 is approximately 0.5.
    To prevent the system from making a decision in such cases, we need to impose some conditions on the probabilities One possible such condition is that Ti exceeds a prespecified threshold (or, as we shall describe below, that the threshold requirement be applied to a confidence interval).
    According to the model, this requirement ensures that the success probability of every decision exceeds the threshold.
    Even though this method satisfies the probabilistic model, it is vulnerable to noise in the data, which often causes some relatively small counts to be larger than their true value in the sample.
    The noise is introduced in part by inaccuracies in the model and in part because of errors during the automatic collection of the statistical data.
    Consequently, the estimated value of p1 may be smaller th
