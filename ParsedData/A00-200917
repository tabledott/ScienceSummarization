al features correspond to the open&#8212;class words that occur in a two sentence window of context.
    The local features occur within a window of context three words to the left and right of the ambiguous word and include co&#8212;occurrence features as well as the part&#8212;of&#8212;speech of words in this window.
    These features are represented as local &amp; topical b-o-w and p-o-s in Table 6.
    (Towel! and Voorhees, 1998) report accuracy of 87% while (Leacock et al., 1998) report accuracy of 84%.
  
  
    The word sense disambiguation ensembles in this paper have the following characteristics: Each point is discussed below.
    The Naive Bayesian classifier has emerged as a consistently strong performer in a wide range of comparative studies of machine learning methodologies.
    A recent survey of such results, as well as possible explanations for its success, is presented in (Domingos and Pazzani, 1997).
    A similar finding has emerged in word sense disambiguation, where a number of comparat
