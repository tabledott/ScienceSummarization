    The novel probabilistic paradigm for inducing translation lexicons for words from unaligned word lists is introduced.
    The set of languages on which we demonstrate these methods is broader than previously examined.
    Finally, the use of multiple bridge languages and of the high degree of intra-family language similarity for dictionary induction is new.
    There are a number of open questions.
    The first is whether there exists a better string transformation algorithm to use in the induction step.
    One possible area of investigation is to use larger dictionaries and assess how much better stochastic transducers, and distance metrics derived from them, perform with more training data.
    Another option is to investigate the use of multi-vowel or multi-consonant compounds which better reflect the underlying phonetic units, using an more sophisticated edit distance measure.
    In this paper, we explore ways of using cognate pairs to create translation lexicons.
    It is an interesting research
