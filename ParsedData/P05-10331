e and powerful mechanism for machine translation.
    The basic phrase-based model is an instance of the noisy-channel approach (Brown et al., 1993),1 in which the translation of a French sentence f into an from position i to position j inclusive, and similarly for eji .
    English sentence e is modeled as: The translation model P(f  |e) &#8220;encodes&#8221; e into f by the following steps: Other phrase-based models model the joint distribution P(e, f) (Marcu and Wong, 2002) or made P(e) and P(f  |e) into features of a log-linear model (Och and Ney, 2002).
    But the basic architecture of phrase segmentation (or generation), phrase reordering, and phrase translation remains the same.
    Phrase-based models can robustly perform translations that are localized to substrings that are common enough to have been observed in training.
    But Koehn et al. (2003) find that phrases longer than three words improve performance little, suggesting that data sparseness takes over for longer phrases.
