nerating different random data each time.
    The results in Figure 3 indicate that as the dimensionality of the problem increases MERT rapidly loses the ability to learn w&#8727;.
    Note that this synthetic problem is considerably easier than a real MT scenario, where the data is noisy and interdependent, and the gold scoring function is nonlinear.
    If MERT cannot scale in this simple scenario, it has little hope of succeeding in a high-dimensionality deployment scenario.
  
  
    We would like to modify MERT so that it scales well to high-dimensionality candidate spaces.
    The most prominent example of a tuning method that performs well on high-dimensionality candidate spaces is the MIRA-based approach used by Watanabe et al. (2007) and Chiang et al.
    (2008b; 2009).
    Unfortunately, this approach requires a complex architecture that diverges significantly from the MERT approach, and consequently has not been widely adopted.
    Our goal is to achieve the same performance with minimal modificati
