sults indicate that (even at their current level of performance) textual entailment systems can substantially improve the accuracy of Q/A, even when no other form of semantic inference is employed.
    The remainder of the paper is organized as follows.
    Section 2 describes the three methods of using textual entailment in open-domain question answering that we have identified, while Section 3 presents the textual entailment system we have used.
    Section 4 details our experimental methods and our evaluation results.
    Finally, Section 5 provides a discussion of our findings, and Section 6 summarizes our conclusions.
  
  
    In this section, we describe three different methods for integrating a textual entailment (TE) system into the architecture of an open-domain Q/A system.
    Work on the semantics of questions (Groenendijk, 1999; Lewis, 1988) has argued that the formal answerhood relation found between a question and a set of (correct) answers can be cast in terms of logical entailment.
