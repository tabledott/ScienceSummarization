    Their system is known as LEXAS (LEXical Ambiguity-resolving System), a supervised learning approach which requires disambiguated training text.
    LEXAS was based on PEBLS, a publically available exemplar-based learning algorithm.
    A set of features is extracted from disambiguated example sentences, including part-of-speech information, morphological form, surrounding words, local collocates, and words in verb-object syntactic relations.
    When a new, untagged, usage is encountered, it is compared with each of the training examples and the distance from each is calculated using a metric adopted from Cost and Salzberg (1993).
    This is calculated as the sum of the differences between each pair of features in the two vectors.
    The differences between two values vi and 02 is calculated according to (5), where CL, represents the number of training examples with value 01 that are classified with sense i in the training corpus, and Ci the number with value 01 in any sense.
