features in our formulation, we need to add extra variables zsibl , hzrir&#8712;Rsibl and zgrand , hzrir&#8712;Rgrand that indicate the presence of sibling and grandparent arcs.
    Observe that these indicator variables are conjunctions of arc indicator variables, i.e., zsibl Hence, these features can be handled in our formulation by adding the following O(|A |&#183; |V |) variables and constraints: for all triples hi, j, ki &#8712; Rgrand.
    Let R , A &#8746; Rsibl &#8746; Rgrand; by redefining z , hzrir&#8712;R and F(x) , [fr(x)]r&#8712;R, we may express our inference problem as in Eq.
    12, with O(|A |&#183; |V |) variables and constraints.
    Notice that the strategy just described to handle sibling features is not fully compatible with the features proposed by Eisner (1996) for projective parsing, as the latter correlate only consecutive siblings and are also able to place special features on the first child of a given word.
    The ability to handle such &#8220;ordered&#8221; features is intimatel
