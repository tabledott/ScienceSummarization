horizontal axis plots the length of English paragraphs, while the vertical axis shows the square of the difference of English and German lengths, an estimate of variance.
    The plot indicates that variance increases with length, as predicted by the model.
    The line shows the result of a robust regression analysis.
    Five extreme points lying above the top of this figure have been suppressed since they did not contribute to the robust regression.
    The parameters c and s2 are determined empirically from the UBS data.
    We could estimate c by counting the number of characters in German paragraphs then dividing by the number of characters in corresponding English paragraphs.
    We obtain 81105/73481 1.1.
    The same calculation on French and English paragraphs yields c 72302/68450 1.06 as the expected number of French characters per English character.
    As will be explained later, performance does not seem to be very sensitive to these precise language-dependent quantities, and therefore we simply
