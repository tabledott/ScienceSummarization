ume that the word pairs in the cartesian product are independent, is equivalent to .
    The values are computed using maximum likelihood estimators, which are smoothed using the Laplace method (Manning and Sch&#168;utze, 1999).
    For each discourse relation pair , we train a word-pair-based classifier using the automatically derived training examples in the Raw corpus, from which we first removed the cue-phrases used for extracting the examples.
    This ensures that our classifiers do not learn, for example, that the word pair if &#8211; then is a good indicator of a CONDITION relation, which would simply amount to learning to distinguish between the extraction patterns used to construct the corpus.
    We test each classifier on a test corpus of 5000 examples labeled with and 5000 examples labeled with , which ensures that the baseline is the same for all combinations and , namely 50%.
    Table 3 shows the performance of all discourse relation classifiers.
    As one can see, each classifier outperforms
