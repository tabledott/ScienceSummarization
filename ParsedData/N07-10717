 charged by Y&#8221; could have joint SPs: This distinction between joint and independent selectional preferences constitutes the difference between the two models we present in this section.
    The remainder of this section describes the ISP approach.
    In Section 3.1, we describe methods for automatically determining the semantic contexts of each single relation&#8217;s selectional preferences.
    Section 3.2 uses these for developing our inferential selectional preference models.
    Finally, we propose inference filtering algorithms in Section 3.3. cx Resnik (1996) defined the selectional preferences of a predicate as the semantic classes of the words that appear as its arguments.
    Similarly, we define the relational selectional preferences of a binary semantic relation pi as the semantic classes C(x) of the words that can be instantiated for x and as the semantic classes C(y) of the words that can be instantiated for y.
    The semantic classes C(x) and C(y) can be obtained from a conceptual taxon
