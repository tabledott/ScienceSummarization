tes, or phrases found in a pair of texts.
    In this section, we show that by using a machine learning-based classifier which combines lexico-semantic information from a wide range of sources, we are able to accurately identify aligned constituents in pairs of texts with over 90% accuracy.
    We believe the alignment of corresponding entities can be cast as a classification problem which uses lexico-semantic features in order to compute an alignment probability p(a), which corresponds to the likelihood that a term selected from one text entails a term from another text.
    We used constituency information from a chunk parser to decompose the pair of texts into a set of disjoint segments known as &#8220;alignable chunks&#8221;.
    Alignable chunks from one text (Ct) and the other text (Ch) are then assembled into an alignment matrix (Ct x Ch).
    Each pair of chunks (p E Ct x Ch) is then submitted to a Maximum Entropy-based classifier which determines whether or not the pair of chunks represents a case of
