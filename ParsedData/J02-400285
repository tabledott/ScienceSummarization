is in detail.
    (S-10, 9411019) Here, the first part describes the paper&#8217;s research goal, whereas the second expresses a contrast.
    Currently, one target category needs to be associated with the whole sentence (according to a rule in the guidelines, AIM is given preference over CONTRAST).
    As an undesired side effect, the CONTRAST-like textual parts (and the features associated with this text piece, e.g., the presence of an author&#8217;s name) are wrongly associated with the AIM target category.
    If we allowed for a smaller annotation unit (e.g., at the clause level), this systematic noise in the training data could be removed.
    Another improvement in classification accuracy might be achieved by performing the classification in a cascading way.
    The system could first perform a classification into OWN-like classes (OWN, AIM, and TEXTUAL pooled), OTHER-like categories (OTHER, CONTRAST, and BASIS pooled), and BACKGROUND, similar to the way human annotation proceeds.
