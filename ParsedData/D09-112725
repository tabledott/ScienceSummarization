more such features, especially with lexicalization and soft alignments (Liang et al., 2006), and study the impact of alignment quality on parsing improvement.
    From a linguistics point of view, we would like to see how linguistics distance affects this approach, e.g., we suspect EnglishFrench would not help each other as much as English-Chinese do; and it would be very interesting to see what types of syntactic ambiguities can be resolved across different language pairs.
    Furthermore, we believe this bilingual-monolingual approach can easily transfer to shift-reduce constituency parsing (Sagae and Lavie, 2006).
