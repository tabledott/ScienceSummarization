ry tree pairs below.
    The &#8212; symbol denotes a frontier node of an elementary tree, which must be replaced by the circled root of another elementary tree.
    If two frontier nodes are linked by a dashed line labeled with the state X, then they must be replaced by two roots that are also linked by a dashed line labeled with X.
    The elementary trees represent idiomatic translation &#8220;chunks.&#8221; The frontier nodes represent unfilled roles in the chunks, and the states are effectively nonterminals that specify the type of filler that is required.
    Thus, donnent un baiser a` (&#8220;give a kiss to&#8221;) corresponds to kiss, with the French subject matched to the English subject, and the French indirect object matched to the English direct object.
    The states could be more refined than those shown above: the state for the subject, for example, should probably be not NP but a pair (Npl, NP3s).
    STSG is simply a version of synchronous treeadjoining grammar or STAG (Shieber and Schabes, 1
