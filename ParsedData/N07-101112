    We use the B3 algorithm to evaluate the predicted coreferent clusters (Amit and Baldwin, 1998).
    B3 is common in coreference evaluation and is similar to the precision and recall of coreferent links, except that systems are rewarded for singleton clusters.
    For each noun phrase xi, let ci be the number of mentions in xi&#8217;s predicted cluster that are in fact coreferent with xi (including xi itself).
    Precision for xi is defined as ci divided by the number of noun phrases in xi&#8217;s cluster.
    Recall for xi is defined as the ci divided by the number of mentions in the gold standard cluster for xi.
    F1 is the harmonic mean of recall and precision.
    In addition to Pairwise, First-Order Uniform, and First-Order MIRA, we also compare against Pairwise MIRA, which differs from First-Order MIRA only by the fact that it is restricted to pairwise features. ence.
    FIRST-ORDER MIRA is our proposed model that takes advantage of first-order feature
