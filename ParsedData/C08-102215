matical result.
			We assume thatthe classifier has acquired a very strong link be tween the lexical item travel and the preposition tothat directs it towards this choice (cf.
			also the ex ample of look at/to).
			This suggests that individual lexical items play an important role in preposition choice along with other more general syntactic and semantic properties of the context.

			For the determiner task, we also consider only the three most frequent cases (a, the, null), which gives us a training dataset consisting of 4,043,925 instances.
			We achieve accuracy of 92.15% on theL1 data (test set size: 305,264), as shown in Table 7.
			Again, the baseline refers to the most fre quent class, null.
			The best reported results to date on determiner selection are those in Turner and Charniak (2007).
