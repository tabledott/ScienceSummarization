-up parsing differ.
    In top-down parsing, backtracking is employed to exhaustively examine the space of possible alternatives.
    Similarly, traditional control mechanisms in generation operate top-down, either deterministically (Meteer et al., 1987; Tomita and Nyberg, 1988; Penman, 1989) or by backtracking to previous choice points (Elhadad, 1993).
    This mode of operation can unnecessarily duplicate a lot of work at run time, unless sophisticated control directives are included in the search engine (Elhadad and Robin, 1992).
    In contrast, in bottomup parsing and in our generation model, a special data structure (a chart or a lattice respectively) is used to efficiently encode multiple analyses, and to allow structure sharing between many alternatives, eliminating repeated search. knowledge, the word lattice will degenerate to a string, e.g.

    We can generate a lattice with eight paths inst
