hine learned (classification) techniques, the other four are based on heuristics.
			Gerund/infinitive confusion and auxiliary presence/choice each use a single classifier.
			Preposition and determiner modules each use two classifiers, one to determine whether a preposition/article should be present, and one for the choice of preposition/article.
			All suggestions from the Suggestion Provider are collected and passed through the Language Model.
			As a first step, a suggested correction has to have a higher language model score than the original sentence in order to be a candidate for being surfaced to the user.
			A second set of heuristic thresholds is based on a linear combination of class probability as assigned by the classifier and language model score.
			The Example Provider queries the web for exemplary sentences that contain the suggested correction.
			The user can choose to consult this information to make an informed decision about the correction.
