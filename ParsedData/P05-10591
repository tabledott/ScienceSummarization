 model of Yamada and Knight (2001), a parse tree for one sentence of a translation pair is projected onto the other string.
    Melamed (2003) presents algorithms for synchronous parsing with more complex grammars, discussing how to parse grammars with greater than binary branching and lexicalization of synchronous grammars.
    Despite being one of the earliest probabilistic syntax-based translation models, ITG remains stateof-the art.
    Zens and Ney (2003) found that the constraints of ITG were a better match to the decoding task than the heuristics used in the IBM decoder of Berger et al. (1996).
    Zhang and Gildea (2004) found ITG to outperform the tree-to-string model for word-level alignment, as measured against human gold-standard alignments.
    One explanation for this result is that, while a tree representation is helpful for modeling translation, the trees assigned by the traditional monolingual parsers (and the treebanks on which they are trained) may not be optimal for translation of a specif
