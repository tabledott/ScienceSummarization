ses predominate in different domains 424 and that dominance of the first sense varies to a great extent, depending on the word.
			Previous workin all words WSD has indicated that techniques us ing hand-tagged resources outperform unsupervisedmethods.
			However, we demonstrate that it is possi ble to apply a fully automatic method to a subset ofpertinent words to improve WSD accuracy.
			The au tomatic method seems to lead to better performance for words that are salient to a domain.
			There are alsoother words which though not particularly domainsalient, have a different sense distribution to that an ticipated for a balanced corpus.
			We propose that inorder to tackle an all words task, automatic methods should be applied to words which have a sub stantial difference in sense ranking compared to that obtained from a balanced corpus.
			We demonstrate that for a set of words which meet this condition,the performance of the automatic method is far bet ter than when using data from SemCor.
