  We consider two such l%atures: se- mantic orientation, which represents an ewdualivc har- acterization of a words deviation from the norm for its semantic group (e.g., beauti/ul is positively oriented, as opposed to ugly); and gradability, which characterizes a words ability to express a property in wlrying degrees.
  In lira remainder of this paper, we [irst address adjec- tive orientation in Section 2, summarizing a previously published method for automatically separating oriented adjectives into positive and negative classes.
  Then, Sec- tion 3 presents a novel method for learning gradablc ad- jectives using a largo corpus and a statistical feature com- bination naodel.
  In Section 4, we review earlier exper- iments on testing subjectivity using wuious fcatt, res as predictors, and then present comparative analyses of the effects that orientation and gradability have on our abil- ity to Inedict sentence subjectivity from adjectives.
