are made with the use of a grammar, and the grammar may allow more than one valid action at any single point in the parsing process.
    When multiple choices are available, a grammar-driven parser may make a decision based on heuristics or statistical models, or pursue every possible action following a search strategy.
    In our case, both types of decisions are made by a classifier that chooses a unique action at every point, based on the local context of the parsing action, with no explicit grammar.
    This type of classifierbased parsing where only one path is pursued with no backtracking can be viewed as greedy or deterministic.
    In order to determine what actions the parser should take given a particular parser configuration, a classifier is given a set of features derived from that configuration.
    This includes, crucially, the two topmost items in the stack S, and the item in front of the queue W. Additionally, a set of context features is derived from a (fixed) limited number of items below th
