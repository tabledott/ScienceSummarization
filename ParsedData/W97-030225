    We denote the entropy of the sentence after thresholding by ET.
    Our search engine is given a target performance level ET to search for, 3We could use gradient descent to minimize a weighted sum of time and performance, but we wouldn't know at the beginning what performance we would have at the end.
    If our goal is to have the best performance we can while running in real time, or to achieve a minimum acceptable performance level with as little time as necessary, then a simple gradient descent function wouldn't work as well as our algorithm.
    Also, for this algorithm (although not for most experiments), our measurement of time was the total number of productions searched, rather than cpu time; we wanted the greater accuracy of measuring productions. and then tries to find the best combination of parameters that works at approximately this level of performance.
    At each point, it finds the threshold to change that gives the most &amp;quot;bang for the buck.&amp;quot; It then changes thi
