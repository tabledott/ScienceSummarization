lts are from 0.3% to 0.5% lower than those obtained on the test corpus.
    The model labeled &amp;quot;Old&amp;quot; attempts to recreate the Char97 system using the current program.
    It makes no use of special maximum-entropyinspired features (though their presence made it much easier to perform these experiments), it does not guess the pre-terminal before guessing the lexical head, and it uses a tree-bank grammar rather than a Markov grammar.
    This parser achieves an average precision/recall of 86.2%.
    This is consistent with the average precision/recall of 86.6% for [5] mentioned above, as the latter was on the test corpus and the former on the development corpus.
    Between the Old model and the Best model, Figure 2 gives precision/recall measurements for several different versions of our parser.
    One of the first and without doubt the most significant change we made in the current parser is to move from two stages of probabilistic decisions at each node to three.
    As already noted, Char9
