 corpus using existing techniques.
    By counting the frequency of occurrence of each noun at a given slot of a verb, the frequency data shown in Figure 1 can be obtained.
    We will refer to this type of data as co-occurrence data.
    The problem of generalizing values of a case frame slot for a verb (or, in general, a head) can be viewed as the problem of learning the underlying conditional probability distribution that gives rise to such co-occurrence data.
    Such a conditional distribution can be represented by a probability model that specifies the conditional probability P(n I v, r) for each n in the set of nouns Ar = {ni, n2, .
    , nN} , v in the set of verbs V = {vi, 02, , vv}, and r in the set of slot names R. = r2, ...,rRI, satisfying: This type of probability model is often referred to as a word-based model.
    Since the number of probability parameters in word-based models is large (0(N &#8226;V .R)), accurate Frequency data for the subject slot of verb fly. estimation of a word-based mode
