he target word will increase with the size of the scope of the search (with a large enough scope, e.g., a complete book, we would probably find a relative for just about any word).
  So we expect recall to decrease as scope increases, because some relationships will be found even for malapropisms (i.e., there will be more false negatives).
  But we expect that precision will increase with scope, as it becomes more likely that (genuine) relationships will be found for non-malapropisms (i.e., there will be fewer false positives), and this factor will outweigh the decrease in the overall number of suspects found.
  Table 4 and Figure 4 show suspicion precision, recall, and F for each of the 5 ?
  4 combinations of measure and scope.
  The values of precision range from 3.3% (Resnik, scope = 1) to 11% (Jiang?Conrath, scope = MAX), with a mean of 6.2%, increasing with scope, as expected, for all measures except Hirst?St-Onge.
  More specifically, differences in precision are statistically significant for the diffe
