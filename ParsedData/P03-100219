    The parses are also used by a module that recognizes predicate argument structures with any of the methods described in Section 2.
    For each templette modeling a different domain a mapping between predicate arguments and templette slots is produced.
    Figure 8 illustrates the mapping produced for two Event99 doFigure 8: Mapping rules between predicate arguments and templette slots for: (a) the &#8220;market change&#8221; domain, and (b) the &#8220;death&#8221; domain mains.
    The &#8220;market change&#8221; domain monitors changes (AMOUNT CHANGE) and current values (CURRENT VALUE) for financial instruments (INSTRUMENT).
    The &#8220;death&#8221; domain extracts the description of the person deceased (DECEASED), the manner of death (MANNER OF DEATH), an
