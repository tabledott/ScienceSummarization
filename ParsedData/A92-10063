 analyzer; the graphical representation of the underlying system can be seen in Figure 3.
    Note that the structures of the two texts are quite different: while the Host text is structured according to more abstract categories such as design structure and functionality, the Black Box text follows the path of the insecure flow through the component.
    Joyce has been fully implemented in Common Lisp, and runs on the Symbolics Lisp Machine and on Sun workstations.
    A successor version has been ported to the Apple MacIntosh.
    The multilevel Host is a complex component of the Station.
    It contains a Kernel, a TIP, a Process, a Net Handler and a group of Managers.
    The Process, the TIP, the Managers and the Net Handler communicate only through the Kernel.
    The manifestly secure Process and the Managers perform auxiliary functions.
    The Process is low-level.
    The TIP serves as interface to a User; the Net Handler handles communication with a Net.
    The security statuses of the TIP, the Man
