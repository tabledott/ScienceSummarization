    Each word is tagged with its part of speech and sense number along with a parent concept.
    For example, the tag [changing verb_3 (c-replacing)] shows that the input word is changing, the preferred sense is number 3 of the verb, and this sense falls under the concept c-replacing in the hierarchy.
    This tagging was produced even though the parser was unable to construct a complete and correct syntactic representation of the text.
    In fact, when tested on the Wall Street Journal texts (for which there has been no adaptation or customization aside from processing by a company-name recognizer [Rau 19911), the system rarely produces a single correct parse; however, the partial parses produced generally cover most of the text at the clause level.
