    In this section, we examine three important classes of coreference models that were developed in the past fifteen years, namely, the mention-pair model, the entity-mention model, and ranking models.
    The mention-pair model is a classifier that determines whether two NPs are coreferent.
    It was first proposed by Aone and Bennett (1995) and McCarthy and Lehnert (1995), and is one of the most influential learning-based coreference models.
    Despite its popularity, this binary classification approach to coreference is somewhat undesirable: the transitivity property inherent in the coreference relation cannot be enforced, as it is possible for the model to determine that A and B are coreferent, B and C are coreferent, but A and C are not coreferent.
    Hence, a separate clustering mechanism is needed to coordinate the pairwise classification decisions made by the model and construct a coreference partition.
    Another issue that surrounds
