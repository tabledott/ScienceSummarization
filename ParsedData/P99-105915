    Let VD be an arbitrary set of size t = max{IQa I : a E VT}, and for each a, define an arbitrary injection fa : Q.
    -4 VD.
    We define G = (VN, P,T[$]), where (iii) T fs(q), where we assume WLOG that Is is a singleton set {q}.
    We omit the formal proof that G and H admit isomorphic derivations and hence generate the same languages, observing only that if (x, y) = (bib2 &#8226; &#8226; &#8226; bi,b3+1- &#8226; &#8226; bk) E L(Ha)&#8212; a condition used in defining La above&#8212;then A[a] [bi] &#8226; &#8226; &#8226; B3[MaB3+1[bi+11 &#8226; &#8226; &#8226; Bk[bk], for any A, B1, .
    Bk that map to initial states in Ha, Hbl, Hb, respectively.
    In general, G has p = 0(IVD13) = 0(t3).
    The construction therefore implies that we can parse a length-n sentence under H in time 0(n4t3).
    If the HAs in H happen to be deterministic, then in each binary production given by (ii) above, symbol A is fully determined by a, b, and C. In this case p = 0(t2), so the parser will operate in tim
