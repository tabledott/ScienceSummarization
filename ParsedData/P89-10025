&amp;quot; as a generator.
    Clearly, such a generator may not terminate.
    For example, consider a grammar that includes the rule s/S --&gt; np/NP, vp(NP)/S.
    (The intention is that verb phrases like, say, &amp;quot;loves Mary&amp;quot; be associated with a nonterminal vp(X)/love(X, nary).)
    Once this rule is applied to the goal s/love(john, mary), the subgoal np/NP will be considered.
    But the generation search space for that goal is infinite and so has infinite branches, because all noun phrases, and thus arbitrarily large ones, match the goal.
    This is an instance of the general problem known from logic programming that a logic program may not terminate when called with a goal less instantiated than what was intended by the program's designer.
    Dymetman and Isabelle (1988), noting this problem, propose allowing the grammarwriter to specify a separate goal ordering for parsing and for generation.
    For the case at hand, the solution is to generate the VP first&#8212;from the goal vp(NP
