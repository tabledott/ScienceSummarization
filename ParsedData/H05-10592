machine learning algorithms as the local classifier.
			There is huge amount of work about developing classification algorithms that have high generalization performance in the machine learning community.
			Being able to incorporate such state-of-theart machine learning algorithms is important.
			Indeed, sequential classification approaches with kernel support vector machines offer competitive per formance in POS tagging and chunking (Gimenez and Marquez, 2003; Kudo and Matsumoto, 2001).
			One obvious way to improve the performance of sequential classification approaches is to enrich theinformation that the local classifiers can use.
			In stan dard decomposition techniques, the local classifiers cannot use the information about future tags (e.g. the right-side tags in left-to-right decoding), which would be helpful in predicting the tag of the targetword.
			To make use of the information about future tags, Toutanova et al proposed a tagging algo rithm based on bidirectional dependency networks 467(Toutan
