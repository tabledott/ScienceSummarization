del selection techniquesthat use heuristics to choose among competing sta tistical models; in contrast, the HDP-PCFG relies on the Bayesian formalism to provide implicit control over model complexity within the framework of a single probabilistic model.Johnson et al (2006) also explored nonparametric grammars, but they do not give an inference algorithm for recursive grammars, e.g., grammars in cluding rules of the form A ? BC and B ? DA.
			Recursion is a crucial aspect of PCFGs and our inference algorithm does handle it.
			Finkel et al(2007) independently developed another nonpara metric model of grammars.
			Though their model is also based on hierarchical Dirichlet processes and issimilar to ours, they present a different inference al gorithm which is based on sampling.
			Kurihara and Sato (2004) and Kurihara and Sato (2006) applied variational inference to PCFGs.
			Their algorithm issimilar to ours, but they did not consider nonpara metric models.
