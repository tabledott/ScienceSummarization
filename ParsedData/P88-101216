he particles are revealed and that the particles are in the filter.
    Another issue that arises in abduction is what might be called the &amp;quot;informativeness-correctness tradeoff&amp;quot;.
    Most previous uses of abduction in AI from a theorem-proving perspective have been in diagnostic reasoning (e g., Pople, 1973; Cox and Pietrzykowski, 1986), and they have assumed &amp;quot;most specific abduction&amp;quot;.
    If we wish to explain chest pains, it is not sufficient to assume the cause is simply chest pains.
    We want something more specific, such as &amp;quot;pneumonia&amp;quot;.
    We want the most specific possible explanation.
    In natural language processing, however, we often want the least specific assumption.
    If there is a mention of a fluid, we do not necessarily want to assume it is lube oil.
    Assuming simply the existence of a fluid may be the best we can do.s However, if there is corroborating evidence, we may want to make a more specific assumption.
