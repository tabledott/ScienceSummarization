 morph puu with the label PUU, and the morphs t + alo with the label TALO).
    The suffix morphs that do not match well with the base form labels will end up aligned somehow with the morphological tags (e.g., the morph ja with the labels PL + PTV).
    Comparison of methods.
    In order to compare two segmentation algorithms, the segmentation of each is aligned with the linguistic morpheme labels, and the total distance of the alignment is computed.
    Shorter total distance indicates better segmentation.
    However, one should note that the distance measure used favors long morphs.
    If a particular &#8220;segmentation&#8221; algorithm does not split one single word of the corpus, the total distance can be zero.
    In such a situation, the single morph that a word is composed of is aligned with all morphemic labels of the word.
    The morph M, i.e., the word, is unique, which means that all probabilities P(L|M) are equal to one: e.g., the morph puutaloja is always aligned with the labels PUU + TALO +
