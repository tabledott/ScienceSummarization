he output is the class with the maximum votes.
    Because the SVM training is a quadratic optimization program, its cost is super-linear to the size of the training samples even with the tailored techniques such as SMO (Platt, 1998) and kernel evaluation caching (Joachims, 1998).
    Let L be the number of the training samples, then the one-vs-rest method takes time in K &#215; OSVM(L).
    The BIO formulation produces one training sample per word, and the training with the GENIA corpus involves over 100,000 training samples as can be seen from Table 1.
    Therefore, it is apparent that the one-vsrest method is impractical with the GENIA corpus.
    On the other hand, if target classes are equally distributed, the pairwise method will take time in K(K&#8722; 1)/2 &#215; OS VM(2L/K).
    This method is worthwhile because each training is much faster, though it requires the training of (K &#8722; 1)/2 times more classifiers.
    It is also reported that the pairwise method achieves higher accuracy than other
