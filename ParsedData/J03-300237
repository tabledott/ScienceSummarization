fying assumption.
    In earlier work (Smith 2002), we sought to show how multiple linguistic resources could be exploited in combination to recognize translation, and how the equiprobability assumption allowed straightforward combination of resources (i.e., set union of translation lexicon entries).
    In Section 3.2.1 we provide a clean solution to the problem of using unweighted translation lexicons along with probabilistic ones that improves performance over the earlier result.
    This would appear to make the equiprobability assumption unnecessary (apart from concerns about computational expense).
    However, we found that, if p(x,y) is set to the empirically estimated joint probability of the lexical link type (x, y), then performance turns out to be dismal.
    This is understandable: Using parameter estimation techniques like the one we used, a great deal of probability mass in the distribution p tends to go to frequent words, which are relatively uninformative with regard to whether texts are mutu
