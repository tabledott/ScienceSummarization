, but are not (both subordinating conjunctions and complementizers appear under SBAR).
    Also, there are exclusively nounmodifying prepositions (of), predominantly verbmodifying ones (as), and so on.
    The annotation SPLIT-IN does a linguistically motivated 6-way split of the IN tag, and brought the total to 81.19%.
    Figure 5 shows an example error in the baseline which is equally well fixed by either TAG-PA or SPLIT-IN.
    In this case, the more common nominal use of works is preferred unless the IN tag is annotated to allow if to prefer S complements.
    We also got value from three other annotations which subcategorized tags for specific lexemes.
    First we split off auxiliary verbs with the SPLITAUX annotation, which appends &amp;quot;BE to all forms of be and &amp;quot;HAVE to all forms of have.10 More minorly, SPLIT-CC marked conjunction tags to indicate whether or not they were the strings [Bb]ut or &amp;, each of which have distinctly different distributions from other conjunctions.
