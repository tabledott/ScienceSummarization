			In this paper we focus exclusively on extracting relations between predefined types of entities in the ACE corpus.
			Reliably extracting relations between entities in natural-language docu ments is still a difficult, unsolved problem, whose inherent difficulty is compounded by the emergenceof new application domains, with new types of nar rative that challenge systems developed for previouswell-studied domains.
			The accuracy level of current syntactic and semantic parsers on natural lan guage text from different domains limit the extent to which syntactic and semantic information can be used in real IE systems.
			Nevertheless, various linesof work on relation extraction have shown experimentally that the use of automatically derived syntactic information can lead to significant improvements in extraction accuracy.
			The amount of syntactic knowledge used in IE systems varies from part of-speech only (Ray and Craven, 2001) to chunking(Ray and Craven, 2001) to shallow parse trees (Ze lenko et al, 2003
