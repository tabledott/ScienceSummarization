cal parser for natural language that obtains a parsing accuracy&#8212;roughly 87% precision and 86% recall&#8212;which surpasses the best previously published results on the Wall St. Journal domain.
    The parser itself requires very little human intervention, since the information it uses to make parsing decisions is specified in a concise and simple manner, and is combined in a fully automatic way under the maximum entropy framework.
    The observed running time of the parser on a test sentence is linear with respect to the sentence length.
    Furthermore, the parser returns several scored parses for a sentence, and this paper shows that a scheme to pick the best parse from the 20 highest scoring parses could yield a dramatically higher accuracy of 93% precision and recall.
  
  
    This paper presents a statistical parser for natural language that finds one or more scored syntactic parse trees for a given input sentence.
    The parsing accuracy&#8212;roughly 87% precision and 86% recall&#8212; surpass
