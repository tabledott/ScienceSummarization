    Figures 6 show the comparison results of different feature sizes for the co-training approach and two strong baselines.
    The feature size is measured as the proportion of the selected features against the total features (i.e.
    100%).
    We can see from the figure that the feature selection technique has very slight influences on the classification accuracy of the methods.
    It can be seen that the co-training approach can always outperform the two baselines with different feature sizes.
    The results further demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed cotraining approach.
  
  
    In this paper, we propose to use the co-training approach to address the problem of cross-lingual sentiment classification.
    The experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed approach.
    In future work, we will improve the sentiment classification accuracy in the following two ways: 1) The smoothed co-training approach used in (Mihalcea, 2004) will be adopted for sentiment cla
