  This goal is produced by PEA, together with the appropriate representation elements (ASK-I.
    SCAN-1, etc.) in response to the question how does the system enhance a program?.
    Different initial goals will result in different paragraphs.
    Each paragraph is represented as a tree in which branch points are RST relations and leaves are input elements.
    Figure 1 is the tree for paragraph (b).
    It contains the relations Sequence (signalled by 'then' and 'finally&amp;quot;), Elaboration (&amp;quot;in particular&amp;quot;), and Purpose (&amp;quot;in order to&amp;quot;).
    In the corresponding paragraph produced by Penman, the relations' characteristic words or phrases (boldfaced below) appear between the blocks of text they relate: [The system asks the user to tell it the characteristic of the program to be enhanced.](.)
