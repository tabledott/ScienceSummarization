e, the only resource required is a corpus of segmented text to train the compression model.
    The structure of this paper is as follows: The next section reviews previous work on the Chinese segmentation problem.
    Then we explain the operation of the adaptive text compression technique that will be used to predict word boundaries.
    Next we show how space insertion can be viewed as a problem of hidden Markov modeling, and how higher-order models, such as the ones used in text compression, can be employed in this way.
    The following section describes several experiments designed to evaluate the success of the new word segmenter.
    Finally we discuss the application of language segmentation in digital libraries.
    Our system for segmenting Chinese text is available on the World Wide Web at http://www.nzdl.org/cgi-bin/congb.
    It takes GB-encoded input text, which can be cut from a Chinese document and pasted into the input window.'
    Once the segmenter has been invoked, the result is rewritten
