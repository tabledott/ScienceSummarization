hat include references to other objects) is enhanced by the fact that both properties and relations are formalized in the same way, namely, as edges in a graph.
    (4) The combined use of graphs and cost functions paves the way for a natural integration of traditional rule-based approaches to generating referring expressions and more recent statistical approaches, such as Langkilde and Knight (1998) and Malouf (2000), in a single algorithm.
    The outline of this article is as follows.
    In Section 2 the content selection problem for generating referring expressions is explained, and some well-known solutions to the problem are discussed.
    In Section 3, we describe how scenes can be modeled as labeled directed graphs and show how content selection can be formalized as a subgraph construction problem.
    Section 4 contains a sketch of the basic generation algorithm, which is illustrated with a worked example.
    In Section 5 various ways to formalize cost functions are discussed and compared.
