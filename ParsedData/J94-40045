to construct a finite cross-linguistic classification of divergences and to implement a systematic mapping between the interlingual representation and the surface syntactic structure that accommodates all of the divergences in this classification.
  The types of divergences under consideration are those shown in Figure 1.
  The first divergence type is thematic: in (1), the theme is realized as the verbal object (Mary) in English but as the subject (Maria) of the main verb in Spanish.
  The second divergence type, promotional, is one of two head switching divergence types: in (2), the modifier (usually) is realized as an adverbial phrase in English but as the main verb soler in Spanish.
  The third divergence type, demotional, is another type of head switching divergence: in (3), the word like is realized as a main verb in English but as an adverbial modifier (gern) in German.
