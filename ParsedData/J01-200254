    If we compare to the overall best tagger, HMM, the improvements are sometimes spectacular.
    This is of course especially the case where HMM has particular difficulties with a word, e.g., about with a 46.3% reduction in error rate, but in other cases as well, e.g., to with a 32.2% reduction, which is still well above the overall error rate reduction of 24.3%.
    We can also abstract away from the words and simply look at common word class confusions, e.g., a token that should be tagged VBD (past tense verb) is actually tagged VBN (past participle verb).
    Table 8 shows the tag confusions that are present in the top seven confusion list of at least one of the systems (again the four base taggers and WPDV(Tags+Context) used on LOB).
    The number on the right in each system column is the number of times the error was made and the number on the left is the position in the confusion list.
    The rows marked with tag values show the individual errors.'
