contrast to our prior approach ( (Girju, Badulescu, and Moldovan 2003a)) when we studied one relation at a time, and learned constraints to identify only that relation.
    We study the distribution of the semantic relations across different NP patterns and analyze the similarities and differences among resulting semantic spaces.
    We define a semantic space as the set of semantic relations an NP construction can encode.
    We aim at uncovering the general aspects that govern the NP semantics, and thus delineate the semantic space within clusters of semantic relations.
    This process has the advantage of reducing the annotation effort, a time consuming activity.
    Instead of manually annotating a corpus for each semantic relation, we do it only for each syntactic pattern and get a clear view of its semantic space.
    This syntactico-semantic approach allows us to explore various NP semantic classification models in a unified way.
    This approach stemmed from our desire to answer questions such as: I
