ight to a hypothesis that moves words across longer distance, which is penalized by the distance-based model.
    In test (b) distortion limit is set as 0; i.e. reordering is done merely by syntax-based preprocessing.
    The worse result is not surprising since, after all, preprocessing discards many possibilities and thus reduce the search space of the decoder.
    Some local reordering model is still needed during decoding.
    Finally, test (c) shows that translation performance does not improve significantly by raising the number of reorderings.
    This implies that our approach is very efficient in that only a small value of n is capable of capturing the most important global reordering patterns.
  
  
    This paper proposes a novel, probabilistic approach to reordering which combines the merits of syntax and phrase-based SMT.
    On the one hand, global reordering, which cannot be accomplished by the phrase-based model, is enabled by the tree operations in preprocessing.
    On the other hand, local
