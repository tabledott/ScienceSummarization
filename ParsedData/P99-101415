ding 418290 tokens (318086 types) of pairs of verbs or adjectives and nouns.
    The lexicalized probabilistic grammar for German used is described in Beil et al. (1999).
    We compared the German example of scalar motion verbs to the linguistic classification of verbs given by Schuhmacher (1986) and found an agreement of our classification with the class of &amp;quot;einfache Anderungsverben&amp;quot; (simple verbs of change) except for the verbs anwachsen (increase) and stagnieren(stagnate) which were not classified there at all.
    Fig.
    10 shows the most probable pair of classes for increase as a transitive verb, together with estimated frequencies for the head filler pair.
    Note that the object label 17 is the class found with intransitive scalar motion verbs; this correspondence is exploited in the next section.
  
  
    In some linguistic accounts, multi-place verbs are decomposed into representations involving (at least) one predicate or relation per argument.
    For instance, the transitive
