more (and is thus less likely to be selected) than brown.
    Even though this first approximation already has some interesting consequences, it is probably not enough to obtain a plausible and useful cost function.
    For instance, it is unlikely that the co-occurrence of edges is fully independent; a husky is likely to be white, and a chihuahua is not.
    Such dependencies are not modeled by the definition given above.
    In addition, properties referring to size such as small and large probably occur more often in a corpus than properties referring to colors such as brown or yellow, which at first sight appears to run counter to the earlier observation that speakers generally prefer absolute properties over relative ones.
    The reason for this, however, is probably that there are simply fewer ways to describe the size than there are to describe the color of objects.
    Searching for a more sophisticated method of defining stochastic cost functions is therefore an interesting line of future research.
