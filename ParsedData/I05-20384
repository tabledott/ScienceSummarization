hat of the GENIA cor pus constructed at University of Tokyo (Kim et al., 2003), which is a collection of research ab stracts selected from the search results of MEDLINE database with keywords (MeSH terms) human, blood cells and transcription factors.
			In the GENIA corpus, the abstracts are en coded in an XML scheme where each abstract is numbered with MEDLINE UID and contains title and abstract.
			The text of title and abstract is segmented into sentences in which biological terms are annotated with their semantic classes.
			The GENIA corpus is also annotated for part-of speech (POS) (Tateisi and Tsujii, 2004), and coreference is also annotated in a part of the GENIA corpus by MedCo project at Institute for Infocomm Research, Singapore (Yang et al 2004).
			GTB is the addition of syntactic information to the GENIA corpus.
			By annotating various linguistic information on a same set of text, the GENIA corpus will be a resource not only for individual purpose such as named entity extrac tion or training pa
