2002).
    Each character is classified independently, using information in the neighboring five-character window.
    Liang (2005) uses the discriminative perceptron algorithm (Collins, 2002) to score whole character tag sequences, finding the best candidate by the global score.
    It can be seen as an alternative to the ME and CRF models (Xue, 2003; Peng et al., 2004), which do not involve word information.
    Wang et al. (2006) incorporates an N-gram language model in ME tagging, making use of word information to improve the character tagging model.
    The key difference between our model and the above models is the wordbased nature of our system.
    One existing method that is based on sub-word information, Zhang et al. (2006), combines a CRF and a rule-based model.
    Unlike the character-tagging models, the CRF submodel assigns tags to subwords, which include single-character words and the most frequent multiple-character words from the training corpus.
    Thus it can be seen as a step towards a w
