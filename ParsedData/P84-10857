    Because of this, the Dynamic Discourse Model that we are developing is only indirectly involved in trying to account for the a posteriori structure of a finished discourse; instead, it tries to trace the relevant states of the social space in terms of which the discourse is constructed.
    This capability is obviously of crucial importance if the model is to be applied in the construction of computer systems which can enter into actual dialogs.
    The Dynamic Discourse Model, therefore, must construct the semantic interpretation of a discourse on a clause by clause basis, from left to right, yielding intermediate semantic representations of unfinished constituents, as well as setting the semantic parameters whose values influence the interpretation of subsequent constituents.
    A syntactic/semantic system of this sort may very well be fromulated as an Augmented Transition Network grammar (Woods, 1970), a non-deterministic parsing system specified by a set of transition networks which may call ea
