in, on, inside, etc.).
    In this view, a noun such as tape would have the following qualia structure: This states that a tape is an &amp;quot;information container&amp;quot; that is also a two-dimensional physical object, where the information is written onto the object.'
    With such nouns, a logical metonymy exists (as the result of type coercion), when the logical argument of a semantic type, which is selected by a function of some sort, denotes the semantic type itself.
    Thus, in this example, the type selected for by a verb such as read refers to the &amp;quot;information&amp;quot; argument for tape, while a verb such as carry would select for the &amp;quot;physical object&amp;quot; argument.
    They are, however, logically related, since the noun itself denotes a relation.
    The representation above simply states that any semantics for tape must logically make reference to the object itself (formal), what it can contain (const), what purpose it serves (telic), and how it arises (agentive).
