e, but the scope of semantic orientation is limited to within a sentence.
    Wilson et al. (2005) proposed supervised learning, dividing the resources into prior polarity and context polarity, which are similar to polar atoms and syntactic patterns in this paper, respectively.
    Wilson et al. prepared prior polarities from existing resources, and learned the context polarities by using prior polarities and annotated corpora.
    Therefore the prerequisite data and learned data are opposite from those in our approach.
    We took the approach used in this paper because we want to acquire more domain-dependent knowledge, and context polarity is easier to access in Japanese'.
    Our approach and their work can complement each other.
  
  
    As Figure 1 illustrates, the flow of our sentiment analysis system involves three steps.
    The first step is sentence delimitation: the input document is divided into sentences.
    The second step is proposition detection: propositions which can form polar clauses ar
