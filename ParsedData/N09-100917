o be constrained to be within a family of tractable and manageable distributions, yet rich enough to represent good approximations of the true posterior.
    &#8220;Best approximation&#8221; is defined as the KL divergence between q(&#952;, y) and p(&#952;, y I x, &#181;, E, S).
    Our variational inference algorithm uses a meanfield assumption: q(&#952;, y) = q(&#952;)q(y).
    The distribution q(&#952;) is assumed to be a LN distribution with all off-diagonal covariances fixed at zero (i.e., the variational parameters consist of a single mean &#732;&#181;k,i and a single variance &#732;&#963;2k,i for each &#952;k,i).
    There is an additional variational parameter, &#732;&#950;k per multinomial, which is the result of an additional variational approximation because of the lack of conjugacy of the LN distribution to the multinomial distribution.
    The distribution q(y) is assumed to be defined by a DMV with unnormalized probabilities &#732;&#968;.
