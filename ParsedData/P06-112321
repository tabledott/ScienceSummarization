om a real monolingual bitext.7 Neither of these examples can be hierarchically aligned correctly without gaps, even without constraining parse trees.
    The received wisdom in the literature led us to expect no such examples in bilingual bitexts, let alone in monolingual bitexts.
    See http://nlp.cs.nyu.edu/GenPar/ACL06for more examples.
    The English/English lower bounds are very loose, because the automatic word aligner would not link words that were not cognates.
    Alignment failure rates on a hand aligned bitext would be higher.
    We conclude that the ITG formalism cannot account for the &#8220;natural&#8221; complexity of translational equivalence, even when translation divergences are factored out.
    Perhaps our most surprising results were those involving one constraining parse tree.
    These results explain why constraints from independently generated monolingual parse trees have not improved statistical translation models.
    For example, Koehn et al. (2003) reported that &#8220;requirin
