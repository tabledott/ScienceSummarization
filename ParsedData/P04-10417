stract syntactic functions such as SUBJ(ect), OBJ(ect), OBL(ique), closed and open clausal COMP/XCOMP(lement), ADJ(unct), APP(osition) etc. and is implemented in terms of recursive feature structures (attribute-value matrices).
			C-structurecaptures surface grammatical configurations, f structure encodes abstract syntactic information approximating to predicate-argument/dependency structure or simple logical form (van Genabithand Crouch, 1996).
			C- and f-structures are re lated in terms of functional annotations (constraints, attribute-value equations) on c-structure rules (cf.
			Figure 1).
