inese parser for this purpose.
    We also note that since all parsing evaluations were performed on Chinese treebank data, the Chinese test sentences were in-domain, whereas the English sentences were very far out-of-domain for the Penn Treebank-trained baseline English parser.
    Hence, in these evaluations, Chinese scores tend to be higher than English ones.
    Posterior word alignment probabilities were obtained from the word aligner of Liang et al. (2006) and DeNero and Klein (2007)6, trained on approximately 1.7 million sentence pairs.
    For our alignment model we used an HMM in each direction, trained to agree (Liang et al., 2006), and we combined the posteriors using DeNero and Klein&#8217;s (2007) soft union method.
    Unless otherwise specified, the maximum value of k was set to 100 for both training and testing, and all experiments used a value of 25 as the c parameter for training set pruning and a cutoff rank of 500 for test set pruning.
    To verify that all our features were contributing
