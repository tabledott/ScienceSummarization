ord collocations and distinguishing between open compounds (words are adjacent) and predicative relations (words can be separated by varying distance).
    Stage two: In the second phase, Xtra.et first uses the same components but in a different way.
    It starts with the pairwise lexical relations produced in Stage one to produce multiple word collocations, then classifies the collocations as one of three classes identified above, and finally attempts to determine the syntactic relations between the words of the collocation.
    To do this, Xtraet studies the lexical relations in context, which is exactly what lexicographers do.
    For each entry of Table 1, Xtract calls Xconcord on the two words wi and w2 to produce the concordances.
    Tables 2 and 3 show the concordances (output of Xconeord) for the input pairs: &amp;quot;average-industrial&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;index-composite&amp;quot;.
    Xstat then compiles information on the words surrounding both wi and w2 in the corpus.
    This stage allows
