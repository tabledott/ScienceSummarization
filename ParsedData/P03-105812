n labeled &#8220;P1-Baseline&#8221; in Table 3.
    The baseline accuracy corresponds to always picking the most frequently occurring sense in the training data.
    Ideally, we would hope M1 and P1 to be close in value, since this would imply that WSD based on training examples collected from the parallel text alignment approach performs as well as manually sense-tagged training examples.
    Comparing the M1 and P1 figures, we observed that there is a set of nouns for which they are relatively close.
    These nouns are: bar, bum, chair, day, dyke, fatigue, hearth, mouth, nation, nature, post, restraint, sense, stress.
    This set of nouns is relatively easy to disambiguate, since using the mostfrequently-occurring-sense baseline would have done well for most of these nouns.
    The parallel text alignment approach works well for nature and sense, among these nouns.
    For nature, the parallel text alignment approach gives better accuracy, and for sense the accuracy difference is only 0.014 (while there i
