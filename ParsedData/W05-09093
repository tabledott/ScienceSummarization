re important role than precision in obtaining high-levels of correlation with human judgments* The previous analysis focused on correlation with human judgments at the system level* In this paper, we focus our attention on improving correlation between METEOR score and human judgments at the segment level.
    High-levels of correlation at the segment level are important because they are likely to yield a metric that is sensitive to minor differences between systems and to minor differences between different versions of the same system* Furthermore, current levels of correlation at the sentence level are still rather low, offering a very significant space for improvement* The results reported in this paper demonstrate that all of the individual components included within METEOR contribute to improved correlation with human judgments* In particular, METEOR is shown to have statistically significant better correlation compared to unigram-precision, unigramrecall and the harmonic FI combination of the two* We ar
