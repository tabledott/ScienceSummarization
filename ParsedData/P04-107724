 set dskip to 0 then ROUGE-S is equivalent to bigram overlap.
    If we set dskip to 4 then only word pairs of at most 4 words apart can form skip-bigrams.
    Adjusting Equations 13, 14, and 15 to use maximum skip distance limit is straightforward: we only count the skip-bigram matches, SKIP2(X,Y), within the maximum skip distance and replace denominators of Equations 13, C(m,2), and 14, C(n,2), with the actual numbers of within distance skip-bigrams from the reference and the candidate respectively.
    In the next section, we present the evaluations of ROUGE-L, ROUGE-S, and compare their performance with other automatic evaluation measures.
  
  
    One of the goals of developing automatic evaluation measures is to replace labor-intensive human evaluations.
    Therefore the first criterion to assess the usefulness of an automatic evaluation measure is to show that it correlates highly with human judgments in different evaluation settings.
    However, high quality large-scale human judgments are hard to
