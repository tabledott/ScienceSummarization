here both X and Y are 1) are significant while 0-0 matches (samples where both X and Y are 0) are not.
    These two types of matches correspond to the cases where either both word groups of interest appear in a pair of aligned sentences or neither word group does.
    Seeing the two word groups in aligned sentences (a 1-1 match) certainly contributes to their association and increases our belief that one is the translation of the other.
    Similarly, seeing only one of them (a 1-0 or 0-1 mismatch) decreases our belief in their association.
    But, given the many possible groups of words that can appear in each sentence, the fact that neither of two groups of words appears in a pair of aligned sentences does not offer any information about their similarity.
    Even when the word groups have been observed relatively few times (together or separately), seeing additional sentences containing none of the groups of words we are interested in should not affect our estimate of their similarity.
    In other words
