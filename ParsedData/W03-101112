lopment set to optimise parameters (k, ,i3 and -y) and the remaining two used as a test set to find error rates at these optimal settings.
    The task is then for the nearest neighbours of noun n to decide which of (n, vi) and (n, v2) was the original co-occurrence.
    Each of n's neighbours, m, is given a vote which is equal to the difference in frequencies of the co-occurrences (m, vi) and (m, v2) and which it casts to the cooccurrence in which it appears most frequently.
    The votes for each co-occurrence are summed over all of the k nearest neighbours of n and the co-occurrence with the most votes wins.
    Performance is measured as error rate.
    # of ties , error = T-1(# of incorrect choices + ) 2 where T is the number of test instances. is that the hyponymy relation in WordNet is a gold standard for semantic similarity which is, of course, not true.
    However, we believe that a distributional similarity measure which more closely predicts WordNet, is more likely to be a good predictor of semant
