  The development of this model allows us to test, for the purpose of selecting the correct predicate&#8211;argument dependencies, whether there is useful information in the additional derivations.
    We also compare the performance of our best log-linear model against existing CCG parsers, obtaining the highest results to date for the recovery of predicate&#8211; argument dependencies from CCGbank.
    A key component of the parsing system is a Maximum Entropy CCG supertagger (Ratnaparkhi 1996; Curran and Clark 2003) which assigns lexical categories to words in a sentence.
    The role of the supertagger is twofold.
    First, it makes discriminative estimation feasible by limiting the number of incorrect derivations for each training sentence; the supertagger can be thought of as supplying a number of incorrect but plausible lexical categories for each word in the sentence.
    Second, it greatly increases the efficiency of the parser, which was the original motivation for supertagging (Bangalore and Joshi
