    Our idea of score propagation can now be formulated as the following recursive equation for updating the scores of all the transliteration pairs. where w(k) i is the new score of the pair (ei, ci) after an iteration, while w(k&#8722;1) is its old score i before updating; &#945; &#8712; [0, 1] is a parameter to control the overall amount of propagation (when &#945; = 1, no propagation occurs); P(j|i) is the conditional probability of propagating a score from node (ej, cj, wj) to node (ei, ci, wi).
    We estimate P (j|i) in two different ways: 1) The number of cooccurrences in the whole collection (Denote as CO).
    P(j|i) = C(i,j) where MI(i, j) is the mutual information of (ei, ci) and (ej, cj).
    As we will show, the CO method works better.
    Note that the transition probabilities between indirect neighbors are always 0.
    Thus propagation only happens between direct neighbors.
    This formulation is very similar to PageRank, a link-based ranking algorithm for Web retrieval (Brin and Page, 1
