 a Wikipedia title collection W, titles t1 and t2 with a set of incoming links L1, and L2 respectively, PMI and NGD are defined as follows: The NGD and the PMI measures can also be computed over the set of outgoing links, and we include these as features as well.
    We also included a feature indicating whether the articles each link to one another.
    Lastly, rather than taking the sum of the relatedness scores as suggested by Eq.
    3, we use two features: the average and the maximum relatedness to V. We expect the average to be informative for many documents.
    The intuition for also including the maximum relatedness is that for longer documents that may cover many different subtopics, the maximum may be more informative than the average.
    We have experimented with other semantic features, such as category overlap or cosine similarity between the TF-IDF summaries of the titles, but these did not improve performance in our experiments.
    The complete set of global features used in GLOW is given in
