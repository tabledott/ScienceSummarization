ions that can be used to calculated generative string prefix probabilities incrementally.
    In fact, left-corner parsing can be simulated by a top-down parser by transforming the grammar, as was done in Roark and Johnson (1999), and so an approach very similar to the one outlined here could be used in that case.
    Perhaps some compromise between the fully connected structures and extreme underspecification will yield an efficiency improvement.
    Also, the advantages of head-driven parsers may outweigh their inability to interpolate with a trigram, and lead to better off-line language models than those that we have presented here.
    Does a parsing model capture exactly what we need for informed language modeling?
    The answer to that is no.
    Some information is simply not structural in nature (e.g., topic), and we might expect other kinds of models to be able to better handle nonstructural dependencies.
    The improvement that we derived from interpolating the different models above indicates tha
