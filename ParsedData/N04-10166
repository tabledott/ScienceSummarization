ler than the web (Keller and Lapata, 2003).
    Comparing the performance of the same model on the web and on the BNC allows us to assess how much improvement can be expected simply by using a larger data set.
    The BNC counts were retrieved using the Gsearch corpus query tool (Corley et al., 2001); the morphological query expansion was the same as for web queries; the NEAR operator was simulated by assuming a window of five words to the left and five to the right.
    Gsearch was used to search solely for adjacent words; no POS information was incorporated in the queries, and no parsing was performed.
    For all of our tasks, we have to select either the best of several possible models or the best parameter setting for a single model.
    We therefore require a separate development set.
    This was achieved by using the gold standard data set from the literature for a given task and randomly dividing it into a development set and a test set (of equal size).
    We report the test set performance for all
