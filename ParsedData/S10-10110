    This paper presents the description and evaluation framework of SemEval-2010 Word Sense Induction &amp; Disambiguation task, as well as the evaluation results of 26 participating systems.
    In this task, participants were required to induce the senses of 100 target words using a training set, and then disambiguate unseen instances of the same words using the induced senses.
    Systems&#8217; answers were evaluated in: (1) an unsupervised manner by using two clustering evaluation measures, and (2) a supervised manner in a WSD task.

    However, word senses are usually represented as a fixed-list of definitions of a manually constructed lexical database.
    Several deficiencies are caused by this representation, e.g. lexical databases miss main domain-specif
