ns and the construction of proper meaning representations such as log ical forms (Johnson, 2002).
			Modern unification/constraint-based grammarssuch as LFG or HPSG capture deep linguistic information including LDDs, predicate-argument structure, or logical form.
			Manually scaling rich uni fication grammars to naturally occurring free text, however, is extremely time-consuming, expensiveand requires considerable linguistic and computa tional expertise.
			Few hand-crafted, deep unification grammars have in fact achieved the coverage and robustness required to parse a corpus of say the size and complexity of the Penn treebank: (Riezler et al., 2002) show how a deep, carefully hand-craftedLFG is successfully scaled to parse the Penn-II treebank (Marcus et al, 1994) with discriminative (log linear) parameter estimation techniques.The last 20 years have seen continuously increas ing efforts in the construction of parse-annotated corpora.
			Substantial treebanks2 are now available for many languages (including
