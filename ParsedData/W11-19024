een successfully used before for information extraction, e.g., in the BioNLP 2009 event extraction shared task (Kim et al., 2009), several of the top systems had a first high-recall component to identify event anchors, followed by high-precision classifiers, which identified event arguments and removed unlikely event candidates (Bj&#168;orne et al., 2009).
    In the coreference resolution space, several works have shown that applying a list of rules from highest to lowest precision is beneficial for coreference resolution (Baldwin, 1997; Raghunathan el al., 2010).
    However, we believe we are the first to show that this high-recall/high-precision strategy yields competitive results for the complete task of coreference resolution, i.e., including mention detection and both nominal and pronominal coreference.
    In our particular setup, the recall of the mention detection component is more important than its precision, because any missed mentions are guaranteed to affect the final score, but spurious mentio
