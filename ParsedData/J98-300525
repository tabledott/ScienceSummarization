 sets of templates that contain the salient facts reported in the input articles and that are produced by the message understanding systems.
    These systems extract specific pieces of information from a given news article.
    An example of a template produced by MUC systems and used in our system is shown in Figures 2 and 3.
    To test our system, we used the templates produced by systems participating in MUC-4 (MUC 1992) as input.
    MUC-4 systems operate on the terrorist domain and extract information by filling fields such as perpetrator, victim, and type of event, for a total number of 25 fields per template.
    In addition, we filled the same template forms by hand from current news articles for further testing.
    Currently, work is under way in our group on the building of an information extraction module similar to the ones used in the MUC conferences, which we will later use as an input to SUMMONS.
    We are basing our implementation on the tools developed at the University of Massachusetts (
