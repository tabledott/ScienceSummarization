from the SMT search graph and a few baseline features.
    &#8220;DFKI cfs-plsreg&#8221; uses a Best First correlation-based feature selection technique, trained with Partial Least Squares Regression, while &#8220;DFKI grcfs-mars&#8221; uses a Greedy Stepwise correlation-based feature selection technique, trained with multivariate adaptive regression splines.
    DCU-SYMC (R, S): Systems are based on a classification approach using a set of features that includes the baseline features.
    The manually assigned quality scores provided for each MT output in the training set were rounded in order to apply classification algorithms on a limited set of classes (integer values from 1 to 5).
    Three classifiers were combined by averaging the predicted classes: SVM using sequential minimal optimization and RBF kernel (parameters optimized by grid search), Naive Bayes and Random Forest.
    &#8220;DCU-SYMC constrained&#8221; is based on a set of 70 features derived only from the data provided for the task.
