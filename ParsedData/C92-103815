  OF COLING-92, NANTES, AUG. 23-28, 1992 The A lgor i thm Based on the above considerations, we have created a new algorithm for generating referring expressions.
  This algorithm is simpler and faster than the algo- rithms proposed in [Dai89,Rei90a] because i t  per- forms much less length-oriented optimization of its outputi we now believe that  the level of optimiza- tion suggested in [Da189,ReigOa] was unnecessary and psycholinguistically implausible.
  The algorithm has been implemented as part  of a larger natural- language generation system, and we are pleased with its performance to date.
