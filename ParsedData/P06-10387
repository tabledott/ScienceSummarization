ic inference, for example (Cimiano et al, 2005).
    Again, that paper uses syntactic information.
    In summary, no previous work has combined the accuracy, scalability and performance advantages of patterns with the fully unsupervised, unannotated nature possible with clustering approaches.
    This severely limits the applicability of previous work on the huge corpora available at present.
  
  
    Our first step is the discovery of patterns that are useful for lexical category acquisition.
    We use two main stages: discovery of pattern candidates, and identification of the symmetric patterns among the candidates.
    An examination of the patterns found useful in previous work shows that they contain one or more very frequent word, such as &#8216;and&#8217;, &#8216;is&#8217;, etc.
    Our approach towards unsupervised pattern induction is to find such words and utilize them.
    We define a high frequency word (HFW) as a word appearing more than TH times per million words, and a content word (CW) as a
