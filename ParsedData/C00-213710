  As flu increases in value, Sd decreases: [().38 d 0.T87(sd_i,,d) 1.27 [p.ao I 1.41 [O.80J 0.447(Sd.__i.,,.d) 2.24 lhe rightmost cohunn above indicates the mag- nitude by which erroneously assuming indepen- &gt;[lifts is actually roughly true in the coml)arisons nmde, and is assumed to be true in many of the standard Wsts for statistical significance.
  (lence (using 8d_in d ill 1)lace of sd) will increase the standard eviation estimate.
  In equation 1, sd forms the denominator of the ratio d/.s d. So erroneously assmning independence will mean that  the mmmrator  d, the difference between the two results: will nee(t to increase by that same factor in order f()r equation 1 to have the same wtlue as without the indel)endence assmnt)tion.
  Since the value of that  equation indicates the statistical significance of d, assunfing indepen- dence will mean that  e1 will have to be larger than without the.
  assumption to achieve the same al)parent level of statistical significance.
