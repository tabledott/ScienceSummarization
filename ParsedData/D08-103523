 basic and linguistically-enhanced proposal distributions.
    As in section 3.4, we set the priors 00 and 00 using gradient-based search.
    In this case, we perform gradient-based optimization after epochs of 1000 max-move, where max-move is the maximum move-length, set to 5 in our experiments.
    These parameters affect the rate of convergence but are unrelated to the underlying probability model.
    In the limit of enough samples, all nonpathological settings will yield the same segmentation results.
    Metropolis-Hasting steps.
    Interleaving samplingbased inference with direct optimization of parameters can be considered a form of Monte Carlo Expectation-Maximization (MCEM; Wei and Tanner, 1990).
  
  
    Corpora We evaluate our approach on corpora from two different domains: transcribed meetings and written text.
    For multi-speaker meetings, we use the ICSI corpus of meeting transcripts (Janin et al., 2003), which is becoming a standard for speech segmentation (e.g., Galley et al. 2003; Purve
