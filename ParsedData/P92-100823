od that words in the region might require deletion.
    Fragments can also be useful in the detection of repairs requiring deletion of more than just the fragment.
    In approximately 40% of the sentences containing fragments in our data, the fragment occurred at the right edge of a longer repair.
    In a portion of these cases, for example, &amp;quot;leaving at &lt;seven&gt; &lt;fif-&gt; eight thirty,&amp;quot; the presence of the fragment is an especially important cue because there is nothing (e.g., no matched words) to cause the pattern matcher to hypothesize the presence of a repair.
    We studied 50 fragments drawn at random from our total corpus of 366.
    The most reliable acoustic cue over the set was the presence of a silence following the fragment.
    In 49 out of 50 cases, there was a silence of greater than 60 msec; the average silence was 282 msec.
    Of the 50 fragments, 25 ended in a vowel, 13 contained a vowel and ended in a consonant, and 12 contained no vocalic portion.
