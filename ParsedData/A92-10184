-of-speech categories) are assumed to be unobservable.
    Jelinek has used this method for training a text tagger [Jelinek, 1985].
    Parameter smoothing can be conachieved using the method of interpolawhich weighted estimates are taken from secondand first-order models and a uniform probability distribution [Jelinek and Mercer, 1980].
    Kupiec used word equivclasses (referred to here as classes) on parts of speech, to pool data from individual words [Kupiec, 1989b].
    The most common words are still represented individually, as sufficient data exist for robust estimation.
    133 However all other words are represented according to the set of possible categories they can assume.
    In this manner, the vocabulary of 50,000 words in the Brown corpus can be reduced to approximately 400 distinct ambiguity classes [Kupiec, 1992].
    To further reduce the number of parameters, a first-order model can be employed (this assumes that a word's category depends only on the immediately preceding word's category)
