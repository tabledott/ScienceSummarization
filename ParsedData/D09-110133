 is abetter precision-enhancing model than mention ranking.
    Moreover, comparing the results in these two rows reveals the superiority of the joint architecture over the pipeline architecture, particularly in terms of its ability to enhance system precision.
    Similar performance trends can be observed when system mentions are used.
  
  
    We have presented a cluster-ranking approach that recasts the mention resolution process as the problem of finding the best preceding cluster to link an active mention to.
    Crucially, our approach combines the strengths of entity-mention models and mention-ranking models.
    Experimental results on the ACE 2005 corpus show that (1) jointly learning coreference resolution and discourse-new detection allows the cluster ranker to achieve better performance than adopting a pipeline coreference architecture; and (2) our cluster ranker significantly outperforms the mention ranker, the best of the three baseline coreference models, under both the pipeline architecture
