polated on a word-by-word basis with, say, a trigram model, which we will demonstrate is a useful thing to do.
    Thus, our top-down parser allows for the incremental calculation of generative conditional word probabilities, a property it shares with other left-to-right parsers with rooted derivations such as Earley parsers (Earley 1970) or left-corner parsers (Rosenkrantz and Lewis 11 1970).
    A second key feature of our approach is that top-down guidance improves the efficiency of the search as more and more conditioning events are extracted from the derivation for use in the probabilistic model.
    Because the rooted partial derivation is fully connected, all of the conditioning information that might be extracted from the top-down left context has already been specified, and a conditional probability model built on this information will not impose any additional burden on the search.
    In contrast, an Earley or left-corner parser will underspecify certain connections between constituents in the left
