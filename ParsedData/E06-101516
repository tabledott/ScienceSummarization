include deep syntactic tree annotation, we processed the FrameNet data with Collins&#8217; parser (Collins, 1997), consequently, the experiments on FrameNet relate to automatic syntactic parse trees.
    The classifier evaluations were carried out with the SVM-light-TK software available at http://ai-nlp.info.uniroma2.it/moschitti/ which encodes ST and SST kernels in the SVMlight software (Joachims, 1999).
    We used the default linear (Linear) and polynomial (Poly) kernels for the evaluations with the standard features defined in (Gildea and Jurafsky, 2002).
    We adopted the default regularization parameter (i.e., the average of 1/||x||) and we tried a few cost-factor values (i.e., j E 11, 3, 7, 10, 30,100}) to adjust the rate between Precision and Recall on the validation-set.
    For the ST and SST kernels, we derived that the best A (see Section 2.2) were 1 and 0.4, respectively.
    The classification performance was evaluated using the F1 measure3 for the single arguments and the accuracy for the fin
