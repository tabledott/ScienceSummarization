e the same as in the boundary trigram estimate.
    We assume that the probability of the nonterminal depends only on the previous tag, that the probability of the immediately following tag depends only on the nonterminal, and that the probability of the tags following that depend only on the previous tags.
    However, we make one independence assumption that differs from all of our previous estimates.
    Rather than assuming that the probability of the tags within the constituent depends on the nonterminal, giving an inside probability term, we assume that the probability of these tags depends only on the previous tags.
    Then we have which is simply the product of the two boundary statistics described in the previous section.
    We refer to this estimate as boundary statistics only. for which we use 1- .
    Then at run time we only use the trigram probabilities for tO,k&#8226; Nonzero-length edges for 95% of the probability mass for the boundary estimates.
