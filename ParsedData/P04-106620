 LLR association scores for all bilingual word pairs with a positive association (p(t, s) &gt; p(t)&#183;p(s)), and discarded from further consideration those with an LLR score of less that 0.9, which was chosen to be just low enough to retain all the &#8220;sure&#8221; word alignments in the trial data.
    This resulted in 13,285,942 possible word-to-word translation pairs (plus 66,406 possible null-word-to-word pairs).
    For most models, the word translation parameters are set automatically by EM.
    We trained each variation of each model for 20 iterations, which was enough in almost all cases to discern a clear minimum error on the 37 sentence pairs of trial data, and we chose as the preferred iteration the one with the lowest alignment error rate on the trial data.
    The other parameters of the various versions of Model 1 described in Sections 4&#8211;6 were optimized with respect to alignment error rate on the trial data using simple hill climbing.
