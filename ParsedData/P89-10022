    Unfortunately, the bottom-up, left-to-right processing regime of Earley generation&#8212;as it might be called&#8212;has its own inherent frailties.
    Efficiency considerations require that only grammars possessing a property of semantic monotonicity can be effectively used, and even for those grammars, processing can become overly nondeterministic.
    The algorithm described in this paper is an attempt to resolve these problems in a satisfactory manner.
    Although we believe that this algorithm could be seen as an instance of a uniform architecture for parsing and generation&#8212;just as the extended Earley parser (Shieber, 1985b) and the bottom-up generator were instances of the generalized Earley deduction architecture&#8212;our efforts to date have been aimed foremost toward the development of the algorithm for generation alone.
    We will have little to say about its relation to parsing, leaving such questions for later research.'
