n function V can change to reflect different extrinsic measures of quality.
    Establish the state of the art performance The results on both the ranking and the scoring subtasks established new state of the art levels on the test set used in this shared task.
    In addition to these levels, the oracle performance numbers also help understand the current performance level, and how much of a gap in performance there still exists.
    Additional data points regarding quality estimation performance are needed to establish how stable this measure of the performance gap is.
    Contrast the performance of regression and ranking techniques Most of the submissions in the ranking task used the results provided by a regression solution (submitted for the scoring task) to infer the rankings.
    Also, optimizing for ranking performance via a regression solution seems to result in regression models that perform very well, as in the case of the top-ranked submission.
    There appear to be significant differences betwe
