cess begins with a word-aligned corpus: a set of triples (f, e, &#8212;), where f is a French sentence, e is an English sentence, and &#8212; is a (many-to-many) binary relation between positions off and positions of e. The word alignments are obtained by running GIZA++ (Och and Ney 2000) on the corpus in both directions, and forming the union of the two sets of word alignments.
    We then extract from each word-aligned sentence pair a set of rules that are consistent with the word alignments.
    This can be thought of in two steps.
    First, we identify initial phrase pairs using the same criterion as most phrase-based systems (Och and Ney 2004), namely, there must be at least one word inside one phrase aligned to a word inside the other, but no word inside one phrase can be aligned to a word outside the other phrase.
    For example, suppose our training data contained the fragment Example derivation of a synchronous CFG.
