te that we do not do any hard pruning at the identification stage in testing and can find the exact labeling of the complete parse tree, which is the maximizer of Equation (1).
    We use log-linear models for multi-class classification for the local models.
    Because they produce probability distributions, identification and classification models can be chained in a principled way, as in Equation (1).
    The baseline features we used for the local identification and classification models are outlined in Figure 3.
    These features are a subset of the features used in previous work.
    The standard features at the top of the figure were defined by Gildea and Jurafsky (2002), and the rest are other useful lexical and structural features identified in more recent work (Surdeanu et al. 2003; Pradhan et al.
    2004; Xue and Palmer 2004).
    We also incorporated several novel features which we describe next.
    Example of displaced arguments.
    We found that a large source of errors for ARG0 and ARG1 ste
