solve the attachment problem independent of the sense discrimination problem.
    For example, a rule for Right Association (also known as Late Closure) says to prefer attaching a new word to the lowest nonterminal node on the rightmost branch of the current structure (i.e., in the same structure as the last word processed) (Kimball 1973).
    Semantic rules, by contrast, intertwine the problems of discrimination and attachment; one must examine all combinations of senses and attachments to locate the semantically best one.
    Such rules normally also collapse the attachment problem into the conceptual role filling problem.
    For example, a lexical preference rule specifies that the preference for a particular attachment depends on how strongly or weakly the verb of the clause prefers its possible arguments (Fodor 1978; Ford, Bresnan, and Kaplan 1982).
    Pragmatic rules also intermingle sense discrimination and attachment, but consider the context of the utterance.
    For example, one suggested rule say
