n Section 2, in which we also consider the prior probability that each nonterminal is part of the correct parse, can lead to nearly an order of magnitude improvement.
    The problem with beam search is that it only compares nonterminals to other nonterminals in the same cell.
    Consider the case in which a particular cell contains only bad nonterminals, all of roughly equal probability.
    We can't threshold out these nodes, because even though they are all bad, none is much worse than the best.
    Thus, what we want is a thresholding technique that uses some global information for thresholding, rather than just using information in a single cell.
    The second kind of thresholding we consider is a novel technique, global thresholding, described in Section 3.
    Global thresholding makes use of the observation that for a nonterminal to be part of the correct parse, it must be part of a sequence of reasonably probable nonterminals covering the whole sentence.
    The last technique we consider, multiple
