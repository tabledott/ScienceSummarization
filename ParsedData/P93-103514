ar parser parses 17% of sentences with no crossing errors, 35% with one or fewer errors and 50% with two or fewer.
    For sentences of length 2-25, 7% of sentences are parsed with no crossing errors, 16% with one or fewer, and 24% with two or fewer. the accuracy as a function of training corpus size for sentences of length 2 to 20.
    We also ran an experiment on WSJ sentences of length 2-15 starting with random binarybranching structures with final punctuation attached high.
    In this experiment, 325 transformations were found using a 250-sentence training corpus, and the accuracy resulting from applying these transformations to a test set was 84.72%.
    Finally, in figure 3 we show the sentence length distribution in the Wall Street Journal corpus.
    While the numbers presented above allow us to compare the transformation learner with systems trained and tested on comparable corpora, these results are all based upon the assumption that the test data is tagged fairly reliably (manually tagged text was
