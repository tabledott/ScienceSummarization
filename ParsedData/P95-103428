-level generation model can implicitly handle both paradigmatic and syntagmatic lexical constraints, leading to the simplification of the generator's grammar and lexicon, and enhancing portability.
    By retraining the statistical component on a different domain, we can automatically pick up the peculiarities of the sublanguage such as preferences for particular words and collocations.
    At the same time, we take advantage of the strength of the knowledge-based approach which guarantees grammatical inputs to the statistical component, and reduces the amount of language structure that is to be retrieved from statistics.
    This approach addresses the problematic aspects of both pure knowledge-based generation (where incomplete knowledge is inevitable) and pure statistical bag generation (Brown et al., 1993) (where the statistical system has no linguistic guidance).
    Of course, the results are not perfect.
    We can improve on them by enhancing the statistical model, or by incorporating more knowledge a
