equence model with additional feature, g, having weight &#181;, to be Zo(A, g, &#181;) def=Es P&#923;(s'|o) exp(ETt=1 &#181;g(st&#8722;1, st, o, t)) in the denominator is simply the additional portion of normalization required to make the new function sum to 1 over all state sequences.
    Following (Della Pietra et al., 1997), we efficiently assess many candidate features in parallel by assuming that the &#955; parameters on all included features remain fixed while estimating the gain, G(g), of a candidate feature, g, based on the improvement in log-likelihood it provides, where L&#923;+g&#181; includes &#8722;&#181;2/2&#963;2.
    In addition, we make this approach tractable for CRFs with two further reasonable and mutually-supporting approximations specific to CRFs.
    (1) We avoid dynamic programming for inference in the gain calculation with a mean-field approximation, removing the dependence among states.
    (Thus we transform the gain from a sequence problem to a token classification problem.
