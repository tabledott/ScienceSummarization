cess to silence duration but not to words), and uses as its evaluation metric the percentage of time the program identifies the start of the interregnum (see Section 2.2).
    On the other hand, [9,10] use an internally developed corpus of sentences, work from a transcript enhanced with information from the speech signal (and thus use words), but do use a metric that seems to be similar to ours.
    Undoubtedly the work closest to ours is that of Stolcke et al. [18], which also uses the transcribed Switchboard corpus.
    (However, they use information on pause length, etc., that goes beyond the transcript.)
    They categorize the transitions between words into more categories than we do.
    At first glance there might be a mapping between their six categories and our two, with three of theirs corresponding to EDITED words and three to not edited.
    If one accepts this mapping they achieve an error rate of 2.6%, down from their NULL rate of 4.5%, as contrasted with our error rate of 2.2% down from our NUL
