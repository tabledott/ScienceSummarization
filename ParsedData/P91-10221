ariety of texts than we have yet tried.
  
  
    Recent work by Brown et al., [Brown et al., 1988, Brown et at., 1990] has quickened anew the long dormant idea of using statistical techniques to carry out machine translation from one natural language to another.
    The lynchpin of their approach is a large collection of pairs of sentences that are mutual translations.
    Beyond providing grist to the statistical mill, such pairs of sentences are valuable to researchers in bilingual lexicography [Kia.vans and Tzoukerma.nn, 1990, Warwick and Russell, 1990] and may be useful in other approaches to machine translation [Sadler, 1989].
    In this paper, we consider the problem of extracting from parallel French and English corpora. pairs sentences that are translations of one another.
    The task is not trivial because at times a. single sentence in one language is translated as two or more sentences in the other language.
    At other times a sentence, or even a whole passage, may be missing from one or the o
