f this section, the performance of and relative to the other AMs is not better for high-frequency data than for low-frequency data.
    Instead, the poor performance observed in section 4.2 is explained by the considerably higher baseline precision of the high-frequency data (cf.
    Figures 5 to 8): unlike the -best lists for &#8220;frequencysensitive&#8221; measures such as log-likelihood, those of and contain a large proportion of lowfrequency candidates.
  
  
    As the frequency distribution of word combinations in texts is characterised by a large number of rare events, low-frequency data are a serious challenge for AMs.
    One way to deal with lowfrequency candidates is the introduction of cutoff thresholds.
    This is a widely used strategy, and it is motivated by the fact that it is in general highly problematic to draw conclusions from low-frequency data with statistical methods (cf.
    Weeber et al. (2000) and Figure 8).
    A practical reason for cutting off low-frequency data is the need to r
