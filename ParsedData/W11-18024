ased on the definition of event types, the entire task is divided to three sub-tasks addressing event extraction at different levels of specificity: Task 1.
    Core event extraction addresses the extraction of typed events together with their primary arguments.
    Task 2.
    Event enrichment addresses the extraction of secondary arguments that further specify the events extracted in Task 1. addresses the detection of negations and speculations over the extracted events.
    Task 1 serves as the backbone of the GE task and is mandatory for all participants, while the other two are optional.
    Figure 1 shows an example of event annotation.
    The event encoded in the text is represented in a standoff-style annotation as follows: The annotation T1 identifies the entity referred to by the string (p65) between the character offsets, 15 and 18 to be a Protein.
    T2 identifies the string, translocation, to refer to a Localization event.
    Entities other than proteins or event type references are classified
