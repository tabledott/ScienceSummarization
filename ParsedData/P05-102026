ially incorporate more high-performing coreference systems into our framework, which is flexible enough to accommodate even those that adopt knowledge-based (e.g., Harabagiu et al. (2001)) and unsupervised approaches (e.g., Cardie and Wagstaff (1999), Bean and Riloff (2004)).
    Of course, we can also expand our pre-selected set of coreference systems via incorporating additional learning algorithms, clustering algorithms, and feature sets.
    Once again, we may use previous work to guide our choices.
    For instance, Iida et al. (2003) and Zelenko et al.
    (2004) have explored the use of SVM, voted perceptron, and logistic regression for training coreference classifiers.
    McCallum and Wellner (2003) and Zelenko et al. (2004) have employed graph-based partitioning algorithms such as correlation clustering (Bansal et al., 2002).
    Finally, Strube et al. (2002) and Iida et al.
    (2003) have proposed new edit-distance-based string-matching features and centering-based features, respectively.
