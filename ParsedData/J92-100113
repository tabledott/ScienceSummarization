s to prefer to build structures describing objects just mentioned (Crain and Steedman 1985; Altmann and Steedman 1988).
    The accuracy of systems with fixed-order rules is limited by the fact that it is not always possible to strictly order a set of rules independent of the context.
    For example, Dahlgren, McDowell, and Stabler (1989) propose the rule &amp;quot;If the object of the preposition is an expression of time, then S-attach the PP&amp;quot; to explain the preference for assuming that &amp;quot;in the afternoon&amp;quot; modifies adjourn in Example 2: The judge adjourned the hearing in the afternoon.
    Although they admit this rule would fail for a sentence like John described the meeting on January 20th, where the NP has a lexical preference for a time modifier, lexical preferences are not always the determining factor either.
    The existence of a conceptually similar object in the context (such as &amp;quot;the morning trial&amp;quot;) can also create an expectation for the grouping &amp;qu
