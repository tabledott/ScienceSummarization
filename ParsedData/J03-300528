Another source of noise is the fact that Google (but not AltaVista) will sometimes return pages that do not include the search term at all.
    This can happen if the search term is contained in a link to the page (but not on the page itself).
    As we did not limit our Web searches to English (even though many search engines now allow the target language for a search to be set), there is also a risk that false positives are generated by cross-linguistic homonyms, that is, by words of other languages that are spelled in the same way as the English words in our data sets.
    However, this problem is mitigated by the fact that English is by far the most common language on the Web, as shown by Grefenstette and Nioche (2000).
    Also, the chance of two such homonyms forming a valid bigram in another language is probably fairly small.
    To summarize, Web counts are certainly less sparse than the counts in a corpus of a fixed size (see Section 2.3).
    However, Web counts are also likely to be significantly m
