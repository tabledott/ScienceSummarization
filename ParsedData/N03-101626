 free to be equally optimistic about the remainder of the context.
    The cost to &#8220;package up&#8221; the local restrictions creates their constant differences, and the shared ignorance about the wider context causes their same-slope linear drop-off.
    This suggests that it would be interesting to explore other, more global, notions of context.
    We do not claim that our context estimates are the best possible &#8211; one could hope to find features of the context, such as number of verbs to the right or number of unusual tags in the context, which would partition the contexts more effectively than adjacent tags, especially as the outside context grows in size.
    The amount of work required to (pre)calculate context summary estimates depends on how easy it is to efficiently take the max over all parses compatible with each context summary.
    The benefit provided by an estimate will depend on how well the restrictions in that summary nail down the important features of the full context.
