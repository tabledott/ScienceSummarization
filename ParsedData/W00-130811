onal word features used in Ratnaparkhi (1996) &#8212; looking at words more than one position away from the current &#8212; do not appear to be helping the overall performance of the models.
    A large number of words, including many of the most common words, can have more than one syntactic category.
    This introduces a lot of ambiguities that the tagger has to resolve.
    Some of the ambiguities are easier for taggers to resolve and others are harder.
    Some of the most significant confusions that the Baseline model made on the test set can be seen in Table 5.
    The row labels in Table 5 signify the correct tags, and the column labels signify the assigned tags.
    For example, the number 244 in the (NN, JJ) position is the number of words that were NNs but were incorrectly assigned the JJ category.
    These particular confusions, shown in the table, account for a large percentage of the total error (2652/3651 = 72.64%).
