he insight is that theorems 1 and 2 estab- mediate forms, and so can fail if the CCG rules can lish a one-to-one map between semantic equivalence be arbitrarily restricted.
    In addition, their method classes and normal forms of the pure (unrestricted) is less efficient than the present one: it considers CCG: parses in pairs, not singly, and does not remove any (15) Two parses a, a' of the pure CCG are parse until the entire parse forest has been built. semantically equivalent if they have the 6 Extensions to the CCG Formalism same normal form: NF(a)= NF(a').
    In addition to the Bn (&amp;quot;generalized composition&amp;quot;) The NF function is defined recursively by &#167;4.2's rules given in &#167;2, which give CCG power equivalent proof of theorem 1; semantic equivalence is also to TAG, rules based on the S (&amp;quot;substitution&amp;quot;) and defined independently of the grammar.
    So (15) is T (&amp;quot;type-raising&amp;quot;) combinators can be linguistically meaningful and true even if a, a'
