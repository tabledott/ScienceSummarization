attitudes in questionnaire, without actually reading all the responds.
    An important resource in realizing such identification tasks is a list of words with semantic orientation: positive or negative (desirable or undesirable).
    Frequent appearance of positive words in a document implies that the writer of the document would have a positive attitude on the topic.
    The goal of this paper is to propose a method for automatically creating such a word list from glosses (i.e., definition or explanation sentences ) in a dictionary, as well as from a thesaurus and a corpus.
    For this purpose, we use spin model, which is a model for a set of electrons with spins.
    Just as each electron has a direction of spin (up or down), each word has a semantic orientation (positive or negative).
    We therefore regard words as a set of electrons and apply the mean field approximation to compute the average orientation of each word.
    We also propose a criterion for parameter selection on the basis of magnetizati
