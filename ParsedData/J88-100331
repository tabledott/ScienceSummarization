    The CLAWS documentation describes SUMSUCCPROBS as &amp;quot;the total value of all relationships between the tags associated with this word and the tags associated with the next word.

    .&amp;quot; The probability of each node of the span network (or rather, tree) is then calculated in the following way as a tree representing all paths through which the span network is built: It appears that the goal is to make each tag's probability be the summed probability of all paths passing through it.
    At the final word of a span, pointers are followed back up the chosen path, and tags are chosen en route.
    We will see below that a simpler definition of optimal path is possible; nevertheless, there are several advantages of this general approach over previous ones.
    First, spans of
