entity distribution in a text.
    The algorithm introduced in the article automatically abstracts a text into a set of entity transition sequences and records distributional, syntactic, and referential information about discourse entities.
    We re-conceptualize coherence assessment as a learning task and show that our entity-based representation is well-suited for ranking-based generation and text classification tasks.
    Using the proposed representation, we achieve good performance on text ordering, summary coherence evaluation, and readability assessment.
  
  
    A key requirement for any system that produces text is the coherence of its output.
    Not surprisingly, a variety of coherence theories have been developed over the years (e.g., Mann and Thomson 1988; Grosz et al. 1995) and their principles have found application in many symbolic text generation systems (e.g., Scott and de Souza 1990; Kibble and Power 2004).
    The ability of these systems to generate high quality text, almost indistingui
