d to convert it to a dissimilarity.
    The choice of the constant k reflects how undesirable it is to place in the same group two adjectives which have been observed in the same minimal NP.
    Since we consider the results of the adjective-adjective module more reliable than the adjective-noun module, we use a high value for k, k=10; this practically guarantees that a suggestion by the adjective-adjective module will be respected by the clustering algorithm unless the evidence for the contrary is overwhelming.
    Note that by placing complete confidence in the output of the adjective-adjective module, the algorithm of stage three is sensitive to small errors that this module may perform.
    An incorrect suggestion would make possibly related adjectives be kept separate.
    However, this problem looks more severe than it really is.
    An erroneous opinion produced by that module must correspond to a violation of one of the three linguistic principles listed at the start of this section; such violations d
