are obviously caused by deficiencies in the training data, such as improperly segmented common words and names.
    Second, some errors stem from the topics covered by the corpus.
    It is not surprising that the error rate increases when the training and testing text represent different topic areas&#8212;such as training on news text and testing on medical text.
    The Rocling Standard Segmentation Corpus contains about two million presegmented words, represented in the Big5 coding scheme.
    We converted it to GB, used one million words for training, and compared the resulting model to that generated from the PH data, also trained on one million words.
    Both models were tested on 10 randomly chosen 1,000-word segments from each corpus (none of this material was used in training).
    The results are shown in Table 5, in terms of the mean and standard deviation (sd) of the errors.
    When the training and testing files come from the same corpus, results are good, with around 42 (for PH) and 45 (for Ro
