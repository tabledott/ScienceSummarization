me proposition or proposal; &amp;quot;the argument over foreign aid goes on and on&amp;quot;) This collection represents conceptual indexing, as equivalent word senses are represented with a unique identifier.
    4.
    We produced different versions of the synset indexed collection. introducing fixed percentages of erroneous synsets.
    Thus we simulated a word-sense disambiguation process with 5%, 10%, 20%, 30% and 60% error rates.
    The errors were introduced randomly in the ambiguous words of each document.
    With this set of experiments we can measure the sensitivity of the retrieval process to disambiguation errors.
    In all cases, we compared at c and nnn standard weighting schemes, and they produced very similar results.
    Thus we only report here on the results for nnn weighting scheme.
  
  
    In Figure 1 we compare different indexing approaches: indexing by synsets, indexing by words (basic SMART) and indexing by word senses (experiments 1, 2 and 3).
