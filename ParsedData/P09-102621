verage, by 35 percentage points over the OpTopic system, and by 20 percentage points over the OpPMI system.
    The F-measure improves, on average, by 25 percentage points over the OpTopic system, and by 17 percentage points over the OpPMI system.
    Note that in 3 out of 4 of the debates, the full system is able to make a guess for all of the posts (hence, the metrics all have the same values).
    In three of the four debates, the system using concession handling described in Section 3.4 outperforms the system without it, providing evidence that our treatment of concessions is effective.
    On average, there is a 3 percentage point improvement in Accuracy, 5 percentage point improvement in Precision and 5 percentage point improvement in F-measure due to the added concession information.
  
  
    In this section, we discuss the results from the previous section and describe the sources of errors.
    As reported in the previous section, the OpPr system outperforms both the OpTopic and the OpPMI systems.
