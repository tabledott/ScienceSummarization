determine the inherited value.
    For example, the following sentences might be found in a description of a lexicon for English: Finally an lpath is a path made up of lvalues, that is, elements which themselves may need evaluation, as in this example:
  
  
    &lt;form&gt; == &lt;&amp;quot;&lt;gen&gt;&amp;quot; &amp;quot;&lt;num&gt;&amp;quot; &amp;quot;&lt;case&gt;&amp;quot;&gt;.
    We adopt the following abbreviation convention for sets of sentences about a single node:
  
  
    DATR has seven syntactic rules of inference falling into three groups.
    The first rule just provides us with a trivial route from definitional to extensional sentences: Note that V must be a value (not an lvalue) here, otherwise the consequent would not be wellformed.
    The next three rules implement local inheritance of values, and use the following additional meta-notational device: the expression E0(E21E1) is well-formed iff EO, El and E2 are lvalues and El occurs as a subexpression of EO.
    In that case, the expression
