y the identity of differently presented entities, i.e. by coreference.
    Free intersubstitutibility of identicals seems a desirable property to preserve.
    The second possible answer to Frege's problem is to say that in the Platonic universe, the Morning Star and the Evening Star 'This 4 a purely syntactic approach, and when one tries to construct a semantics for it, one is generally driven to the third possibility.
    66 are different entities.
    It just happens that in the real world they identical.
    But it is not true that = MS, equality, like quantification, is over entities in the Platonic universe.
    The fact identical in the real world (call this relation rw-identieel) must be stated explicitly, say, by the expression MS) properly, rwidentieal(z, y) For reasoning about 're-identical* entities, that is, Platonic entities that are identical in the real world, we may take the following approach.
    Substitution in referentially transparent contexts would be achieved by use of the axiom schema
