able 9.
    In that table, we also show the results obtained with a modified matching algorithm including a third rule, which allows a premodified antecedent to match with a definite whose set of premodifiers is a superset of the set of modifiers of the antecedent (an elaboration of rule 2).
    We tested each of these three heuristics alone and in combination.
    (The fourth line simply repeats the results shown in Table 7.)
    The main result of this evaluation is that using a modified segmentation heuristic (including recency) reduces the overall impact of the heuristics for premodification on the performance of the algorithm in comparison with the system discussed in Vieira and Poesio (1996).
    The best precision is still achieved by the matching algorithm that does not allow for new information in the anaphoric expression, but the best results overall are again obtained by combining rule 1 and rule 2, although either 2 or 3 works equally well when combined with 1.
