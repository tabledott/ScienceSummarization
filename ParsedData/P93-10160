  Principle-Based Parsing Without Overgeneration
  
    Overgeneration is the main source of computational complexity in previous principle-based parsers.
    This paper presents a message passing algorithm for principle-based parsing that avoids the overgeneration problem.
    This algorithm has been implemented in C++ and successfully tested with example sen
  
  
    Unlike rule-based grammars that use a large number of rules to describe patterns in a language, Government-Binding (GB) Theory (Chomsky, 1981; Haegeman, 1991; van Riemsdijk and Williams, 1986) explains these patterns in terms of more foundmental and universal principles.
    A key issue in building a principle-based parser is how to procedurally interpret the principles.
    Since GB principles are constraints over syntactic structures, one way to implement the principles is to This implementation of GB theory is very inefficient, since there are a large number of structures being generated and then filtered out.
