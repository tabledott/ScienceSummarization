search, to find the highest scoring analysis under the model.
    The same search method is used in both training and decoding.
    We implemented the perceptron approach with the same feature set as that of an existing generative model (Roark, 2001a), and show that the perceptron model gives performance competitive to that of the generative model on parsing the Penn treebank, thus demonstrating that an unnormalized discriminative parsing model can be applied with heuristic search.
    We also describe several refinements to the training algorithm, and demonstrate their impact on convergence properties of the method.
    Finally, we describe training the perceptron model with the negative log probability given by the generative model as another feature.
    This provides the perceptron algorithm with a better starting point, leading to large improvements over using either the generative model or the perceptron algorithm in isolation (the hybrid model achieves 88.8% f-measure on the WSJ treebank, compared to f
