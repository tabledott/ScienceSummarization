    One way in which variation can be introduced is by permuting phrases within a hypothesis translation.
    A simple way of estimating a lower bound on the number of ways that phrases in a hypothesis translation can be reordered is to examine bigram mismatches.
    Phrases that are bracketed by these bigram mismatch sites can be freely permuted because reordering a hypothesis translation at these points will not reduce the number of matching ngrams and thus will not reduce the overall Bleu score.
    Here we denote bigram mismatches for the hypothesis translation given in Table 1 with vertical bars: Appeared calm  |when  |he was  |taken | to the American plane  |,  |which will | to Miami, Florida.
    We can randomly produce other hypothesis translations that have the same Bleu score but are radically different from each other.
    Because Bleu only takes order into account through rewarding matches of higher order n-grams, a hypothesis sentence may be freely permuted around these bigram mismatch sit
