criptions on the basis of syntactic information and very little lexical information about nouns that take complements.
    The current order of application of the resolution and classification steps has been determined by empirical testing, and has been compared with that suggested by decision-tree learning techniques.
    We trained a version of the system on the corpus used for the first experiment, and then compared its classification of the corpus used for the second experiment with that of our three subjects.'
    We developed two versions of the system: one that only attempts to classify subsequent-mention and discourse-new definite descriptions (Vieira and Poesio 1997), and one that also attempts to classify bridging references (Poesio, Vieira, and Teufel 1997).
    The first version of the system finds a classification for 318 definite descriptions out of the 464 in our test data (the articles used in the second experiment).
    The agreement between the system and the three annotators on the two clas
