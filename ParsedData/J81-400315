 1 , the leading symbol, is restricted to be a non-terminal.
    The right-hand side r is as in a DCG rule.
    Leaving aside the constraints discussed in the next section, the meaning of a rule like (3) is that any sequence of symbols of the form sixis 2x 2 etc. sk_ ixk_isk with arbitrary xi's, can be rewritten into rx ix 2...xk_ 1.
    Thinking procedurally, one can say that a nonterminal may be expanded by matching it to the leading symbol on the left-hand side of a rule, and the rest of the left-hand side is &amp;quot;put aside&amp;quot; to wait for the derivation of symbols which match each of its symbols in sequence.
    This sequence of symbols can be interrupted by arbitrary strings, paired to the occurrences of `...' on the left-hand side of the rule.
  
  
    When several XG rules are involved, the derivation of a surface string becomes more complicated than in the single rule example of the previous section, because rule applications interact in the way now to be described.
