04) for the models in both directions.
    Intersection eliminates the spurious alignments, but at the expense of recall.
    Intersection after training produces alignments that both models agree on.
    The joint training procedure we describe below builds on this idea by encouraging the models to agree during training.
    Consider the output of the jointly trained HMMs in Figure 1 (bottom).
    The garbage-collecting rare word is no longer a problem.
    Not only are the individual E&#8212;*F and F&#8212;*E jointly-trained models better than their independently-trained counterparts, the jointlytrained intersected model also provides a significant overall gain over the independently-trained intersected model.
    We maintain both high precision and recall.
    Before we introduce the objective function for joint training, we will write the two directional models in a symmetric way so that they share the same alignment spaces.
    We first replace the asymmetric alignments a with a set of indicator variable
