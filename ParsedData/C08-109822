			These figures are considerably lower than e.g. the 96.7% accuracy reported in Brants (2000) for the Negra treebank which is annotated with STTS tags without agreement features.

			be expected, however, because the STTS tagset ismuch smaller.
			Table 3 shows the results of an eval uation based on the plain STTS tagset.
			The first result was obtained with TnT trained on Tiger data which was mapped to STTS before.
			The second row contains the results for the TnT tagger when it is trained on the Tiger data and the output ismapped to STTS.
			The third row gives the corre sponding figures for our tagger.
