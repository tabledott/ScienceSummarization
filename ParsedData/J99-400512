happen if the proposed &amp;quot;circuit&amp;quot; is actually broken somewhere.
    So no Hamilton Circuit exists.
    Figure 3 illustrates the intuitive correspondence between selecting a good word order and finding a Hamilton Circuit.
    We note that Brew (1992) discusses the NPcompleteness of a related problem, that of finding some permutation of a string that is acceptable to a given context-free grammar.
    Both of these results deal with decision problems.
    Returning to optimization, we recall another circuit task called the Traveling Selecting a good source word order is like solving the Hamilton Circuit Problem.
    If we assume that the channel model offers deterministic, word-for-word translations, then the bigram source model takes responsibility for ordering them.
    Some word pairs in the source language may be illegal.
    In that case, finding a legal word ordering is like finding a complete circuit in a graph.
    (In the graph shown above, a sample circuit is boundary &#8212;&gt; this
