 direction is orthogonal (or, if an approximate line search is used, nearly so) to the previous direction.
    This leads to a characteristic &#8220;zig-zag&#8221; ascent, with convergence slowing as the maximum is approached.
    One way of looking at the problem with steepest ascent is that it considers the same search directions many times.
    We would prefer an algorithm which considered each possible search direction only once, in each iteration taking a step of exactly the right length in a direction orthogonal to all previous search directions.
    This intuition underlies conjugate gradient methods, which choose a search direction which is a linear combination of the steepest ascent direction and the previous search direction.
    The step size is selected by an approximate line search, as in the steepest ascent method.
    Several non-linear conjugate gradient methods, such as the Fletcher-Reeves (cg-fr) and the Polak-Ribi`erePositive (cf-prp) algorithms, have been proposed.
