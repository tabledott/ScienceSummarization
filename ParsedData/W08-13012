sable not only by computational linguists, but also by the computer science community more generally and by all sorts of information professionals including biologists, medical researchers, political scientists, law firms, business and market analysts, etc.
    Thinking about this issue, we were struck by two facts.
    First, we noted how frequently WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998) gets used compared to other resources, such as FrameNet (Fillmore et al., 2003) or the Penn Treebank (Marcus et al., 1993).
    We believe that much of the explanation for this fact lies in the difference of complexity of the representation used by the resources.
    It is easy for users not necessarily versed in linguistics to see how to use and to get value from the straightforward structure of WordNet.
    Second, we noted the widespread use of MiniPar (Lin, 1998) and the Link Parser (Sleator and Temperley, 1993).
    This clearly shows that (i) it is very easy for a non-linguist thinking in relation extraction terms to see how to make
