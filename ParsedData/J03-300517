refenstette 1994; Curran 2002), and similarity-based models of word co-occurrence probabilities (Lee 1999; Dagan, Lee, and Pereira 1999).
    In this article we investigate alternative ways for obtaining bigram frequencies that are potentially useful for such models despite the fact that some of these bigrams are identified in a heuristic manner and may be noisy.
    We also obtained corpus counts from a second corpus, the North American News Text Corpus (NANTC).
    This corpus differs in several important respects from the BNC.
