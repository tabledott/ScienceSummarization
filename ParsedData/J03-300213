poorly matched.
    Second, we required the matching algorithm to be fast, and algorithms for aligning tree structures are more demanding than those for linear structures.
    Both documents in the candidate pair are run through a markup analyzer that acts as a transducer, producing a linear sequence containing three kinds of token: The chunk length is measured in nonwhitespace bytes, and the HTML tags are normalized for case.
    Attribute-value pairs within the tags are treated as nonmarkup text (e.g., &lt;FONT COLOR=&amp;quot;BLUE&amp;quot;&gt; produces [START:FONT] followed by [Chunk:12]).
    The second step is to align the linearized sequences using a standard dynamic programming technique (Hunt and McIlroy 1975).
    For example, consider two documents that begin as follows: Using this alignment, we compute four scalar values that characterize the quality of the alignment: dp The difference percentage, indicating nonshared material (i.e., alignment tokens that are in one linearized file but not the oth
