later stages.
  Specifically, these argument candidates often overlap and differ only in one or twowords.
  On the other hand, the pruning heuristic based on full parsing never outputs overlapping candidates and consequently provides input that is easier for the next stage to handle.
  Indeed, the following argument identification stage turns out to be good in discriminating these non-overlapping candidates.
  The most crucial contribution of full parsing is in the pruning stage.
  The internal tree structure significantly helps in discriminating argument candidates, which makes the work done by the following stages easier.
