coring No computationally expensive -best lists are generated during training: for each input sentence a single block sequence is generated on each iteration over the training data.
    &#10101;block sequences are represented by high dimensional feature vectors using the binary features defined below and the translation process is handled as a multi-class classification problem in which each block sequence represents a possible class.
    The effect of this training procedure can be seen in Figure 2: each decoding step on the training data adds a high-scoring block sequence to the discriminative training and decoding performance on the training data is improved after each iteration (along with the test data decoding performance).
    A theoretical justification for the novel training procedure is given in Section 3.
    We now define the feature components for the block bigram feature vector in Eq.

    Although the training algorithm can handle realvalued features as used in (Och, 2003; Tillmann and Zh
