s of the data and is trained with error-driven and rank-based methods.
    We see that both the first-order features and the training enhancements improve performance consistently. wise Model in F1 measure for both standard training and error-driven training.
    We attribute some of this improvement to the capability of the First-Order model to capture features of entire clusters that may indicate some phrases are not coreferent.
    Also, we attribute the gains from error-driven training to the fact that training examples are generated based on errors made on the training data.
    (However, we should note that there are also small differences in the feature sets used for error-driven and standard training results.)
    Error analysis indicates that often noun xi is correctly not merged with a cluster xj when xj has a strong internal coherence.
    For example, if all 5 mentions of France in a document are string identical, then the system will be extremely cautious of merging a noun that is not equivalent
