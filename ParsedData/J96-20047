o-category distinction.
    Measure (4) falls foul of the same basic problem with chance agreement as measures (2) and (3), but in addition, the statistic itself guarantees at least 50% agreement by only pairing off coders against the majority opinion.
    It also introduces an &amp;quot;expert&amp;quot; coder by the back door in assuming that the majority is always right, although this stance is somewhat at odds with Passonneau and Litman's subsequent assessment of a boundary's strength, from one to seven, based on the number of coders who noticed it.
    Measure (1) looks at almost exactly the same type of problem as measure (4), the presence or absence of some kind of boundary.
    However, since one coder is explicitly designated as an &amp;quot;expert,&amp;quot; it does not treat the problem as a two-category distinction, but looks only at cases where either coder marked a boundary as present.
    Without knowing the density of conversational move boundaries in the corpus, this makes it difficult to asse
