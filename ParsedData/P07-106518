lean BF for various order n-gram sets from the Gigaword Corpus with the same underlying false positive rate (0.125).
    The additional space required by our scheme for storing frequency information is less than a factor of 2 compared to the standard BF.
    Figure 7 shows the number and size of frequency estimation errors made by our log-frequency BF scheme and a non-redundant scheme that stores only the exact quantised count.
    We presented 500K negatives to the filter and recorded the frequency of overestimation errors of each size.
    As shown in Section 3.1, the probability of overestimating an item&#8217;s frequency under the log-frequency BF scheme decays exponentially in the size of this overestimation error.
    Although the non-redundant scheme requires fewer items be stored in the filter and, therefore, has a lower underlying false positive rate (0.076 versus 0.
    159), in practice it incurs a much higher error rate (0.717) with many large errors.
