    Every day, a large number of news articles are created and reported, many of which are unique.
    But certain types of events, such as hurricanes or murders, are reported again and again throughout a year.
    The goal of Information Extraction, or IE, is to retrieve a certain type of news event from past articles and present the events as a table whose columns are filled with a name of a person or company, according to its role in the event.
    However, existing IE techniques require a lot of human labor.
    First, you have to specify the type of information you want and collect articles that include this information.
    Then, you have to analyze the articles and manually craft a set of patterns to capture these events.
    Most existing IE research focuses on reducing this burden by helping people create such patterns.
