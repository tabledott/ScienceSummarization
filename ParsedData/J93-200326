tations.
    If we wish, we can think of M as having some finite range.
    As long as this range encompasses everything that actually occurs in training data, no problems arise.
    We turn now to the problem of estimating the translation probabilities for Model 1.
    The joint likelihood of a French string and an alignment given an English string is We wish to adjust the translation probabilities so as to maximize Pr(fle) subject to the constraints that for each e, Following standard practice for constrained maximization, we introduce Lagrange multipliers A&#8222; and seek an unconstrained extremum of the auxiliary function An extremum occurs when all of the partial derivatives of h with respect to the components of t and A are zero.
    That the partial derivatives with respect to the components of A be zero is simply a restatement of the constraints on the translation probabilities.
    The partial derivative of h with respect to VI e) is where is the Kronecker delta function, equal to one when both of i
