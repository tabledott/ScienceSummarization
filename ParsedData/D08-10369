l components have the same value &#945; or &#945;0), but it is possible to estimate these as well (Goldwater and Griffiths, 2007).
    Informally, &#945; controls the sparsity of the state-to-state transition probabilities while &#945;0 controls the sparsity of the state-toword emission probabilities.
    As &#945;0 approaches zero the prior strongly prefers models in which each state emits as few words as possible, capturing the intuition that most word types only belong to one POS mentioned earlier.
    Expectation-Maximization is a procedure that iteratively re-estimates the model parameters (&#952;, &#966;), converging on a local maximum of the likelihood.
    Specifically, if the parameter estimate at iteration ` is (&#952;(`), &#966;(`)), then the re-estimated parameters at itwhere n0w,t is the number of times word w occurs with state t, nt,,t is the number of times state t0 follows t and nt is the number of occurences of state t; all expectations are taken with respect to the model (&#952;(`),&#966;(`)
