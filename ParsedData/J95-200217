 all states with terminals to the right of the dot can be scanned, not just those matching the input.
    (For completed states, the predecessor state is defined to be the complete state from the same state set contributing to the completion.)
    Note that the definition of path length is somewhat counterintuitive, but is motivated by the fact that only scanned states correspond directly to input symbols.
    Thus the length of a path is always the same as the length of the input string it generates.
    A constrained path starting with the initial state contains a sequence of states from state set 0 derived by repeated prediction, followed by a single state from set 1 produced by scanning the first symbol, followed by a sequence of states produced by completion, followed by a sequence of predicted states, followed by a state scanning the second symbol, and so on.
    The significance of Earley paths is that they are in a one-to-one correspondence with left-most derivations.
    This will allow us to talk ab
