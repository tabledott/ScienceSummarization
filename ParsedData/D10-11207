o dependency parsing, rather than to PCFGs, requiring a substantially different model formulation.
    While Liang et al. (2007) demonstrated empirical gains on a synthetic corpus, our experiments focus on unsupervised category refinement on real language data.
    Universal Rules in NLP Despite the recent surge of interest in multilingual learning (Kuhn, 2004; Cohen and Smith, 2009a; Snyder et al., 2009; BergKirkpatrick and Klein, 2010), there is surprisingly little computational work on linguistic universals.
    On the acquisition side, Daum&#180;e III and Campbell (2007) proposed a computational technique for discovering universal implications in typological features.
    More closely related to our work is the position paper by Bender (2009), which advocates the use of manually-encoded cross-lingual generalizations for the development of NLP systems.
    She argues that a system employing such knowledge could be easily adapted to a particular language by specializing this high level knowledge based on th
