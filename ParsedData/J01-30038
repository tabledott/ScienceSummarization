ification differs from Levin's, we draw on her hypothesis that semantic properties of verbs are reflected in their syntactic behavior.
    The behavior that Levin focuses on is the notion of diathesis alternation&#8212;an alternation in the expression of the arguments of a verb, such as the different mappings between transitive and intransitive that our verbs undergo.
    Whether a verb participates in a particular diathesis alternation or not is a key factor in Levin's approach to classification.
    We, like others in a computational framework, have extended this idea by showing that statistics over the altemants of a verb effectively capture information about its class (Lapata 1999; McCarthy 2000; Lapata and Brew 1999).
    In our specific task, we analyze the pattern of thematic assignments given in Table 2 to develop statistical indicators that are able to determine the class of an optionally intransitive verb by capturing information across its transitive and intransitive alternants.
    These indicator
