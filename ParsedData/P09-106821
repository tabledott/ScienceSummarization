ugh trade and rise are in different FrameNet frames, they do in fact have the narrative relation that our system discovered.
    Of the 17 misaligned events, we judged all but one to be correct in a narrative sense.
    Thus although not exactly aligned with FrameNet&#8217;s notion of event clusters, our induction algorithm seems to do very well.
    Linking structure Next, we compare a schema&#8217;s linking structure, the grammatical relation chosen for each verb event.
    We thus decide, e.g., if the object of the verb arrest (arrest B) plays the same role as the object of detain (detain B), or if the subject of detain (B detain) would have been more appropriate.
    We evaluated the clustering decisions of the 13 schemas (78 verbs) that mapped to frames.
    For each chain in a schema, we identified the frame element that could correctly fill the most verb arguments in the chain.
    The remaining arguments were considered incorrect.
    Because we assumed all verbs to be transitive, there were 156 argum
