s the total number of correct subjective assignments divided by the size of the data sets.
    There are two aspects of the sense subjectivity scoring algorithm that can influence the label assignment, and correspondingly their evaluation.
    First, as indicated above, after calculating the semantic similarity of the distributionally similar words with each sense, we can either use all the distributionally similar words for the calculation of the subjectivity score of each sense (similarityall), or we can use only those that lead to the highest similarity (similarity-selected).
    Interestingly, this aspect can drastically affect the algorithm accuracy.
    The setting where a distributionally similar word can belong only to one sense significantly improves the algorithm performance.
    Figure 1 plots the interpolated precision for eleven points of recall, for similarity-all, similarity-selected, and baseline.
    As shown in this figure, the precisionrecall curves for our algorithm are clearly above the &
