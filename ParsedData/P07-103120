mation we used in the unsupervised experiments.
    Table 7 shows the performance with: all features, followed by the individual features, and finally, after removing individual features.
    The feature set includes: lexical features for each n-gram in the noun compound; n-gram counts for unigrams, bigrams and trigrams; raw probability and association scores for all three bigrams in the compound; and the adjacency and dependency results for all three association measures.
    We discretised the non-binary features using an implementation of Fayyad and Irani&#8217;s (1993) algorithm, and classify using MegaM2.
    The results on Lauer&#8217;s set demonstrate that the dependency model performs well by itself but not with the other features.
    In fact, a better result comes from using every feature except those from the dependency and adjacency models.
    It is also impressive how good the performance is, considering the large differences between our data set and Lauer&#8217;s.
    These differences also acc
