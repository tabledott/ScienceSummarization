owing preprocessing steps are carried out: Categorization: We use some categorization, which consists of replacing a single word by a category.

    Word joining: Target language words are joined using a method similar to the one described in Och, Tillmann, and Ney (1999).

    During the search process several joined target language words may be generated by a sing
