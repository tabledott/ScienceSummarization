i and ML tagging result in very similar performance.
    Of course, the real tags have not been generated by a probabilistic model and, even if they had been, we would not be able to determine this model exactly because of practical limitations.
    Therefore the models that we construct will only be approximations of an ideal model that does not exist.
    It so happens that despite these assumptions and approximations, these models are still able to perform reasonably well.
  
  
    We have the mathematical expression: The triclass (or tri-POS Perouault 19861, or tri-Ggram Kodogno et al. 19871, or HK) model is based on the following approximations: (the name HK model comes from the notation chosen for these probabilities).
    In order to define the model completely we have to specify the values of all h and k probabilities.
    If Nw is the size of the vocabulary and NT the number of different tags, then there are: The total number of free parameters is then: Note that this number grows only linearly with
