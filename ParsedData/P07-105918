exing of fields, we adopted the settings that were reported to be optimal in Jijkoun and de Rijke (2005).
    These settings comprise the use of 8 question-answer pair fields, and a weight vector h0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.5, 0.5, 0.2, 0.3i for fields ordered as follows: (1) full FAQ document text, (2) question text, (3) answer text, (4) title text, (5)-(8) each of the above without stopwords.
    The second field thus takes takes wh-words, which would typically be filtered out, into account.
    All other fields are matched without stopwords, with higher weight assigned to document and question than to answer and title fields.
    We did not use phrase-matching or stemming in our experiments, similar to Jijkoun and de Rijke (2005), who could not find positive effects for these features in their experiments.
    Expansion terms are taken from those terms in the n-best translations of the query that have not been seen in the original query string.
    For paraphrasing-based query expansion, a 50-best list of parap
