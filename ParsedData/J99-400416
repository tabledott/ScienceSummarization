r 0, multiplicative operator 0, additive identity 0, and multiplicative identity 1.
    For parsers with loops, i.e., those in which an item can be used to derive itself, we will also require that sums of an infinite number of elements be well defined.
    In particular, we will require that the semirings be complete (Kuich 1997, 611).
    This means that sums of an infinite number of elements should be associative and commutative, just like finite sums, and that multiplication should distribute over infinite sums, just as it does over finite ones.
    All of the semirings we will deal with in this paper are complete.2 All of the semirings we discuss here are also co-continuous.
    Intuitively, this means that if any partial sum of an infinite sequence is less than or equal to some value, recognition string probability prob. of best derivation number of derivations set of derivations best derivation best n derivations then the infinite sum is also less than or equal to that value.3 This important property ma
