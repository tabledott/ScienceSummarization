d a set of symbols S. it produces a regular language notated as Ls and read as &amp;quot;L ignoring S.&amp;quot; The strings of Ls differ from those of L in that occurrences of symbols in S may be freely interspersed.
    This language is defined by the expression Ls = Range(Id(L) o Intro(S)).
    It includes only strings that would be in L if some occurrences of symbols in S were ignored.
    The third and fourth operators enable us to express if-then and if-and-only-if conditions on regular languages.
    These are the operators If-P-then-S (&amp;quot;if prefix then suffix&amp;quot;) and If-S-then-P (&amp;quot;if suffix then prefix&amp;quot;).
    Suppose Li and L2 are regular languages and consider the set of strings If-P-then-S(Li, L2) =- {x I for every partition xi x2 of x, if xi E L1, then x2 E 1,2} A string is in this set if each of its prefixes in Li is followed by a suffix in L2.
    This set is also a regular language: it excludes exactly those strings that have a prefix in Li followed by a suffix n
