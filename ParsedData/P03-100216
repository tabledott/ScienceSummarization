ned for argument constituent identification was 88.98% in the fifth iteration (a 0.76% improvement).
    The best accuracy for role assignment was 83.74% in the eight iteration (a 0.69% improvement)3.
    We further analyzed the boosted trees and noticed that phrasal verb collocation features were mainly responsible for the improvements.
    This is the rationale for including them in the FS2 set.
    We also were interested in comparing the results of the decision-tree-based method against the results obtained by the statistical approach reported in (Gildea and Palmer, 2002).
    Table 2 summarizes the results.
    (Gildea and Palmer, 2002) report the results listed on the first line of Table 2.
    Because no Fscores were reported for the argument identification task, we re-implemented the model and obtained the results listed on the second line.
    It looks like we had some implementation differences, and our results for the argument role classification task were slightly worse.
    However, we used our r
