    In addition to the Europarl test set, we also collected 29 editorials from the Project Syndicate website2, which are published in all the four languages of the shared task.
    We aligned the texts at a sentence level across all four languages, resulting in 1064 sentence per language.
    For statistics on this test set, refer to Figure 1.
    The out-of-domain test set differs from the Europarl data in various ways.
    The text type are editorials instead of speech transcripts.
    The domain is general politics, economics and science.
    However, it is also mostly political content (even if not focused on the internal workings of the European Union) and opinion.
    We received submissions from 14 groups from 11 institutions, as listed in Figure 2.
    Most of these groups follow a phrase-based statistical approach to machine translation.
    Microsoft&#8217;s approach uses dependency trees, others use hierarchical phrase models.
