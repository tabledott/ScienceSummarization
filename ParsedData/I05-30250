  Specifically, we evaluated our Chinese word segmenter in the open track, on all four corpora, namely Academia Sinica (AS), City University of Hong Kong (CITYU), Microsoft Re- search (MSR), and Peking University (PKU).
  Based on a maximum entropy approach, our word segmenter achieved the highest F measure for AS, CITYU, and PKU, and the second highest for MSR.
  We found that the use of an ex- ternal dictionary and additional training corpora of different segmentation stan- dards helped to further improve seg- mentation accuracy.
