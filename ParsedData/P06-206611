jective structures while maintaining good parsing efficiency in data-driven dependency parsing.2 Define the span of an edge (i, j) as the interval S((i, j)) W= [min(i, j),max(i, j)].
    Definition 9 Let G = (V I E) be a dependency forest, let e = (i, j) be an edge in E, and let Ge be the subgraph of G that is induced by the nodes contained in the span of e. &#8226; The degree of an edge e 2 E, ed(e), is the number of connected components c in Ge such that the root of c is not dominated by the head of e. &#8226; The edge degree of G, ed(G), is the maximum among the degrees of the edges in G. To illustrate the notion of edge degree, we return to Figure 3.
    Graph 3a has edge degree 0: the only edge that spans more nodes than its head and its dependent is (1, 5), but the root of the connected component f2, 3, 4g is dominated by 1.
    Both Graph 3b and 3c have edge degree 1: the edge (3, 6) in Graph 3b and the edges (2, 4), (3, 5) and (4, 6) in Graph 3c each span a single connected component that is not domin
