rovement that results from having knowledge of sense frequencies i apparent from the results summarized in Table 2, where the guessing heuristic is contrasted with the most- frequent and co-occurrence h uristics (with guessing removed).
  Table 2 Percent correct sense identifications for open-class words without and with information on sense frequencies.
  Monosemous Polysemous Heuristic and Polysemous only Guessing 45.0 26.8 Most frequent 69.0 58.2 Co-occuzrence 68.6 57.7 The similarity of the results obtained with the most-frequent and the co-occurrence heuristics is attributable to the fact that when co-occurrence data were indeterminate or lacking, the most- frequent heuristic was the default.
  With a large semantic oncor- dance, we would expect he co-occurrence h uristic to do better--it should be able to capture the topical context which, in other work [8], we have found to give scores as high as 70-75% for polysemous words.
  How representative are the percentages in Table 2?
  Obviously, they are spe
