    Developing a better TM is a fundamental issue for those applications.
    Researchers at IBM first described such a statistical TM in (Brown et al., 1988).
    Their models are based on a string-to-string noisy channel model.
    The channel converts a sequence of words in one language (such as English) into another (such as French).
    The channel operations are movements, duplications, and translations, applied to each word independently.
    The movement is conditioned only on word classes and positions in the string, and the duplication and translation are conditioned only on the word identity.
    Mathematical details are fully described in (Brown et al., 1993).
    One criticism of the IBM-style TM is that it does not model structural or syntactic aspects of the language.
    The TM was only demonstrated for a structurally similar language pair (English and French).
    It has been suspected that a language pair with very different word order such as English and Japanese would
