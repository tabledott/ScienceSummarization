is is a measure of how close the sentence is to the centroid of the cluster.
    Centroid-based summarization has given promising results in the past (Radev et al., 2001).
  
  
    In this section, we propose a new method to measure sentence centrality based on prestige in social networks, which has also inspired many ideas in the computer networks and information retrieval.
    A cluster of documents can be viewed as a network of sentences that are related to each other.
    Some sentences are more similar to each other while some others may share only a little information with the rest of the sentences.
    We hypothesize that the sentences that are similar to many of the other sentences in a cluster are more central (or prestigious) to the topic.
    There are two points to clarify in this definition of centrality.
    First is how to define similarity between two sentences.
    Second is how to compute the overall prestige of a sentence given its similarity to other sentences.
    For the similarity metr
