pe intbrmation in unification-based gram- mar formali,nns to enforce constraints described in a hierarchical way where types are partially or- dered with a subtype relation.
  Authors describe these extensions as "inheritance grammars", "in- heritance networks", :Ii;ature sorts", "typed t~ature structures",...[1, 3, 5, 13, 17, 15, 9, 11, 7, 8].
  These formalisms exhibit, to various degrees, one or several of the following properties, characteristic of the so-called object-oriented paradigm: a high level of abstraction, a capacity of inference, modularity and distributed control.
  Abstraction and modular- ity are needed when the linguist wants to describe a hierarchy of concepts (like a lexical hierarchy or the hierarchy of phrasal categories), and to describe linguistic data at different levels (e.g.
  morphology, syntax, semantics).
  At first glance it seems rather natural to develop separate modules for different lin- guistic levels, and to describe separately their inter- actions; however, great difficu
