  A New String-to-Dependency Machine Translation Algorithm with a Target Dependency Language Model
  
    In this paper, we propose a novel string-todependency algorithm for statistical machine translation.
    With this new framework, we employ a target dependency language model during decoding to exploit long distance word relations, which are unavailable with a traditional n-gram language model.
    Our experiments show that the string-to-dependency decoder achieves 1.48 point improvement in BLEU and 2.53 point improvement in TER compared to a standard hierarchical string-tostring system on the NIST 04 Chinese-English evaluation set.
  
  
    In recent years, hierarchical methods have been successfully applied to Statistical Machine Translation (Graehl and Knight, 2004; Chiang, 2005; Ding and Palmer, 2005; Quirk et al., 2005).
    In some language pairs, i.e.
    Chinese-to-English translation, state-ofthe-art hierarchical systems show significant advantage over phrasal systems in MT accuracy.
