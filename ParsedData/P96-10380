  A Prosodic Analysis Of Discourse Segments In Direction-Giving Monologues
  
    This paper reports on corpus-based research into the relationship between intonational variation and discourse structure.
    We examine the effects of speaking style (read versus spontaneous) and of discourse segmentation method (text-alone versus text-and-speech) on the nature of this relationship.
    We also compare the acoustic-prosodic features of initial, medial, and final utterances in a discourse segment.
  
  
    This paper presents empirical support for the assumption long held by computational linguists, that intonation can provide valuable cues for discourse processing.
    The relationship between intonational variation and discourse structure has been explored in a new corpus of direction-giving monologues.
    We examine the effects of speaking style (read versus spontaneous) and of discourse segmentation method (text-alone versus text-and-speech) on the nature of this relationship.
    We also compare the acou
