    Our assumption is that such data distribution makes entailment judgments based on mere surface features such as sentence length ineffective, thus encouraging the development of alternative, deeper processing strategies.
  
  
    Evaluation results have been automatically computed by comparing the entailment judgments returned by each system with those manually assigned by human annotators.
    The metric used for systems&#8217; ranking is accuracy over the whole test set, i.e. the number of correct judgments out of the total number of judgments in the test set.
    Additionally, we calculated precision, recall, and F1 measures for each of the four entailment judgment categories taken separately.
    These scores aim at giving participants the possibility to gain clearer insights into their system&#8217;s behavior on the entailment phenomena relevant to the task.
    For each language combination, two baselines considering the length difference between T1 and T2 have been calculated (besides the tr
