ticular bigram has occurred within approximately 50 words to the left or right of the word being disambiguated.
    We take this approach since surface lexical features like bigrams, collocations, and co&#8212;occurrences often contribute a great deal to disambiguation accuracy.
    It is not clear how much disambiguation accuracy is improved through the use of features that are identified by more complex pre&#8212;processing such as part&#8212;of&#8212;speech tagging, parsing, or anaphora resolution.
    One of our objectives is to establish a clear upper bounds on the accuracy of disambiguation using feature sets that do not impose substantial pre&#8212; processing requirements.
    This paper continues with a discussion of our methods for identifying the bigrams that should be included in the feature set for learning.
    Then the decision tree learning algorithm is described, as are some benchmark learning algorithms that are included for purposes of comparison.
    The experimental data is discussed, and
