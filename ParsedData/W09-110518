he prediction.
    An informed baseline system has been created by calculating the average length of the scope to the right of the negation signal in each corpus and tagging that number of tokens as scope tokens.
    We take the scope to the right for the baseline because it is much more frequent than the scope to the left, as is shown by the statistics contained in Table 1 of Section 3.
    Baseline results and inter-annotator agreement scores are presented in Table 4.
    The percentage of correct scopes has been measured in two ways: PCS measures the proportion of correctly classified tokens in the scope sequence, whereas PCS-2 measures the proportion of nouns and verbs that are correctly classifed in the scope sequence.
    This less strict way of computing correctness is motivated by the fact that being able to determine the concepts and relations that are negated (indicated by content words) is the most important use of the negation scope finder.
    The low PCS for the three subcorpora indicates that f
