ng (Riloff and Jones, 1999), which also uses extraction pattern contexts for semantic lexicon induction.
    Meta-bootstrapping identifies a single extraction pattern that is highly correlated with a semantic category and then assumes that all of its extracted noun phrases belong to the same category.
    However, this assumption is often violated, which allows incorrect terms to enter the lexicon.
    Riloff and Jones acknowledged this issue and used a second level of bootstrapping (the &#8220;Meta&#8221; bootstrapping level) to alleviate this problem.
    While meta-bootstrapping trusts individual extraction patterns to make unilateral decisions, Basilisk gathers collective evidence from a large set of extraction patterns.
    As we will demonstrate in Section 2.2, Basilisk&#8217;s approach produces better results than meta-bootstrapping and is also considerably more efficient because it uses only a single bootstrapping loop (meta-bootstrapping uses nested bootstrapping).
    However, meta-bootstrapping pro
