ion matrices that could have been generated in an evaluation of 100 complete dialogues with each of two train timetable agents A and B (perhaps using the confirmation strategies illustrated in Figures 2 and 3, respectively).6 The values in the matrix cells are based on comparisons between the dialogue and scenario key AVMs.
    Whenever an attribute value in a dialogue (i.e., data) AVM matches the value in its scenario key, the number in the appropriate diagonal cell of the matrix (boldface for clarity) is incremented by 1.
    The off diagonal cells represent misunderstandings that are not corrected in the dialogue.
    Note that depending on the strategy that a spoken dialogue agent uses, confusions across attributes are possible, e.g., &amp;quot;Milano&amp;quot; could be confused with &amp;quot;morning.&amp;quot; The effect of misunderstandings that are corrected during the course of the dialogue are reflected in the costs associated with the dialogue, as will be discussed below.
