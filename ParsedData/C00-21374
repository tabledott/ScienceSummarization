 independence.
  The first subsec- rio11 describes tests where this assumption ap- pears in estimating the standard deviation of the difference between the techniques results.
  The second subsection describes using contin- gency tables and the X 2 test.
  Following this is a section on methods that do not 1hake this inde- pendence assumption.
  Subsections in turn de- scribe some analytical tests, how they can apply to recall but not precision or the F-score, and how to use randomization tests to test preci- sion and F-score.
  We conclude with a discussion of dependencies within a test sets instances, a topic that we have yet to deal with.
  2 Tests  that  assume independence between compared  resu l ts 2.1 F ind ing  and using the variance of a result difference For each metric, after determining how well a new and current technique t)efforms on solne test set according to that metric, one takes the diflbrence between those results and asks "is that difference significant?"
  A way to test this is to expec
