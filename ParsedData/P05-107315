nt template that concatenates the local template and the node label.
    For example, for the local feature PATH, we define a joint feature template, that extracts PATH from every node in the candidate argument sequence and concatenates it with the label of the node.
    Both a feature with the specific argument label is created and a feature with the generic back-off ARG label.
    This is similar to adding features from identification and classification models.
    In the case of the example candidate argument sequence above, for the node NP1 we have When comparing a local and a joint model, we use the same set of local feature templates in the two models.
    Whole Label Sequence: As observed in previous work (Gildea and Jurafsky, 2002; Pradhan et al., 2004), including information about the set or sequence of labels assigned to argument nodes should be very helpful for disambiguation.
    For example, including such information will make the model less likely to pick multiple fillers for the same role or t
