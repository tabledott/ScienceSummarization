    (Inkpen and Hirst, 2003) also use gloss&#8211;based context vectors in their work on the disambiguation of near&#8211;synonyms &#8211; words whose senses are almost indistinguishable.
    They disambiguate near&#8211;synonyms in text using various indicators, one of which is context-vector-based.
    Context Vectors are created for the context of the target word and also for the glosses of each sense of the target word.
    Each gloss is considered as a bag of words, where each word has a corresponding Word Vector.
    These vectors for the words in a gloss are averaged to get a Context Vector corresponding to the gloss.
    The distance between the vector corresponding to the text and that corresponding to the gloss is measured (as the cosine of the angle between the vectors).
    The nearness of the vectors is used as an indicator to pick the correct sense of the target word.
  
  
    We introduced a new measure of semantic relatedness based on the idea of creating a Gloss Vecto
