rithms that allow the efficient estimation and searching of log-linear models from a packed parse representation without enumerating an exponential number of parses have been recently presented by Miyao and Tsujii (2002) and Geman and Johnson (2002).
    These algorithms can be readily applied to the packed and/or-forests of Maxwell and Kaplan (1993), provided that each conjunctive node is annotated with feature-values of the loglinear model.
    In the notation of Miyao and Tsujii (2002), such a feature forest &#934; is defined as a tuple (C, D, r, &#947;, S) where C is a set of conjunctive nodes, D is a set of disjunctive nodes, r E C is the root node, &#947; : D &#8594; 2C is a conjunctive daughter function, and S : C &#8594; 2D is a disjunctive daughter function.
    A dynamic-programming solution to the problem of finding most probable parses is to compute the weight Od of each disjunctive node as the maximum weight of its conjunctive daugher nodes, i.e., and to recursively define the weight Oc of a conj
