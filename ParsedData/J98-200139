    In addition, we observed a previously unreported (to our knowledge) correlation between discourse novelty and syntactic constructions such as appositions, copular constructions, and comparatives.
    The following examples from our corpus illustrate the correlations just mentioned: In addition, we observed a correlation between larger situation uses of definite descriptions (discourse-new, and often hearer-old) and certain syntactic expressions and lexical items.
    For example, we noticed that a large number of uses
