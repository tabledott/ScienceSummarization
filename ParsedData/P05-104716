r et al. (2000) developed an indirect method which allowed automatic evaluation.
    In addition to learning a set of patterns, their system also notes the relevance of documents based on the current set of accepted patterns.
    Assuming the subset of documents relevant to a particular IE scenario is known, it is possible to use these relevance judgements to determine how accurately a given set of patterns can discriminate the relevant documents from the irrelevant.
    This evaluation is similar to the &#8220;text-filtering&#8221; sub-task used in the sixth Message Understanding Conference (MUC-6) (1995) in which systems were evaluated according to their ability to identify the documents relevant to the extraction task.
    The document filtering evaluation technique was used to allow comparison with previous studies.
    Identifying the document containing relevant information can be considered as a preliminary stage of an IE task.
    A further step is to identify the sentences within those documents whic
