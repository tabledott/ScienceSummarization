  On the Complexity of Non-Projective Data-Driven Dependency Parsing
  
    In this paper we investigate several nonprojective parsing algorithms for dependency parsing, providing novel polynomial time solutions under the assumption that each dependency decision is independent of all the others, called here the edge-factored model.
    We also investigate algorithms for non-projective parsing that account for nonlocal information, and present several hardness results.
    This suggests that it is unlikely that exact non-projective dependency parsing is tractable for any model richer than the edge-factored model.
  
  
    Dependency representations of natural language are a simple yet flexible mechanism for encoding words and their syntactic dependencies through directed graphs.
    These representations have been thoroughly studied in descriptive linguistics (Tesni`ere, 1959; Hudson, 1984; Sgall et al., 1986; Me&#180;l&#711;cuk, 1988) and have been applied in numerous language processing tasks.
