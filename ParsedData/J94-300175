f a regular relation, and we observed above that the complement of a regular relation (as opposed to the complement of a regular language) is not necessarily regular.
    Second, even if the resulting relation itself turned out to be regular, the obvious way of entering it into our rule composition is to intersect it with the replacement relation, and we also know that intersection of relations leads to possibly nonregular results.
    Proving that obligatory rules do indeed define regular mappings requires an even more careful analysis of the roles that context-brackets can play on the various intermediate strings involved in the rule composition.
    A given left-context bracket can serve in the Replace relation in one of three ways.
    First, it can be the start of a rule application, provided it appears in front of an appropriate configuration of 0, and right-context brackets.
    Second, it can be ignored during the identity portions of the strings, the regions between the changes sanctioned by the repl
