ian product of u and v, then we generate a class of additive models: where A and B are matrices which determine the contributions made by u and v to the product p. In contrast, if we assume that f is a linear function of the tensor product of u and v, then we obtain multiplicative models: where C is a tensor of rank 3, which projects the tensor product of u and v onto the space of p. Further constraints can be introduced to reduce the free parameters in these models.
    So, if we assume that only the ith components of u and v contribute to the ith component of p, that these components are not dependent on i, and that the function is symmetric with regard to the interchange of u and v, we obtain a simpler instantiation of an additive model: Analogously, under the same assumptions, we obtain the following simpler multiplicative model: only the ith components of u and v contribute to the ith component of p. Another class of models can be derived by relaxing this constraint.
    To give a concrete example, circu
