with this solution, however.
    When proper names are represented as predicates and not as constants, the natural way to state the uniqueness of proper names is by means of axioms of the foilowing sort: But since from the axioms for rw-ifientical we can show that Evening-S tar( M S), it would follow that MS = ES.
    We must thus restate the axiom for the uniqueness of proper names as
  
  
    A similar modification must be made for functions.
    Since we are using only predicates, the uniqueness of the value of a function must be encoded with an axiom like (dz, y, z)father(z, z) A f ather(y, z) D z = y if: and y are both fathers of z, then z and y are the same.
    This would have to be replaced by the axiom ('dz, y, z)father(z, z)A f ather(y, z) D rw-identical(z, y) The very common problems involving reasoning about equality, which can be done efficiently, are thus translated into problems involving reasoning about the predicate rw-identical, which is very cumbersome.
    One way to view this second solu
