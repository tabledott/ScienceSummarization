    (6) d&#8712;N(&#710;y) The main objective function in Eq.
    3 includes a maximization over all possible trees max&#710;y&#8712;Y (x).
    Finding the global maximum, however, cannot be done efficiently for longer sentences nor can we use dynamic programming.
    This is due to the fact that the vectors break the independence assumptions of the base PCFG.
    A (category, vector) node representation is dependent on all the words in its span and hence to find the true global optimum, we would have to compute the scores for all binary trees.
    For a sentence of length n, there are Catalan(n) many possible binary trees which is very large even for moderately long sentences.
    One could use a bottom-up beam search, keeping a k-best list at every cell of the chart, possibly for each syntactic category.
    This beam search inference procedure is still considerably slower than using only the simplified base PCFG, especially since it has a small state space (see next se
