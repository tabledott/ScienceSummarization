 do.
    The interaction between different decisions may also be part of the explanation why MST benefits more from the feature-based integration than Malt, with significantly higher accuracy for MSTMalt than for MaltMST as a result.
    Since inference is global (or practically global) in the graph-based model, an improvement in one type of dependency has a good chance of influencing the accuracy of other dependencies, whereas in the transition-based model, where inference is greedy, some of these additional benefits will be lost because of error propagation.
    This is reflected in the error analysis in the following recurrent pattern: Where Malt does well, MaltMST does only slightly better.
    But where MST is good, MSTMalt is often significantly better.
    Another part of the explanation may have to do with the learning algorithms used by the systems.
    Although both Malt and MST use discriminative algorithms, Malt uses a batch learning algorithm (SVM) and MST uses an online learning algorithm (MIRA)
