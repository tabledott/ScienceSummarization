			Toensure coherent assignments, we add equality con straints ?i, Oi + O?i = 1.
			The weights woi and w?oi for Oi and O?i respectively, are computed as a negative conditional probability of the span of an entity to be extracted (or suppressed) given the labelings of the adjacent variables of the CRFs: woi def= ?P (xk, xk+1, ..., xl|xk?1, xl+1) where xk = ?B? &amp; xm = ?I? for m ? [k + 1, l] w?oi def= ?P (xk, xk+1, ..., xl|xk?1, xl+1) where xm = ?O? for m ? [k, l]where xi is the value assigned to the random vari able of the CRF corresponding to an entity Oi.Likewise, for each source entity, we add two vari ables Sj and
