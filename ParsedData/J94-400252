ontribute in a complexly interdependent way to the overall effectiveness of the algorithm.
    The results also support the view that attentional state plays a significant role in pronominal anaphora resolution and demonstrate that even a simple model of attentional state can be quite effective.
    The addition of statistically measured lexical preferences to the range of factors that the algorithm considers only marginally improved its performance on the blind test set.
    Analysis of the results indicates that lexical preference information can be useful in cases in which the syntactic salience ranking does not provide a clear decision among the top candidates, and there is a strong lexical preference for one of the less salient candidates.
    The relatively high success rate of the algorithm suggests the viability of a computational model of anaphora resolution in which the relative salience of an NP in discourse is determined, in large part, by structural factors.
    In this model, semantic and real-w
