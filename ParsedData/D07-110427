ch for a pattern, we use location infor mation from its parent node, which represents its maximal prefix.
			Assuming that the node representsphrase ?b, we find the node representing its max imal suffix by following the b-edge from the node pointed to by its parent node?s suffix link.
			If the node pointed to by this suffix link is inactive, we can mark the node inactive without running a search.
			When a node is marked inactive, we discontinue search for phrases that are prefixed by the path it represents.
			The algorithm is illustrated in Figure 2.
			5.4.4 Special Cases for Phrases with GapsA few subtleties arise in the extraction of hierarchical patterns.
			Gaps are allowed to occur at the be ginning or end of a phrase.
			For instance, we mayhave a source phrase Xu or uX or even XuX . Al though each of these phrases requires its own path in the prefix tree, they are lexically identical to phrase u. An analogous situation occurs with the patterns XuXv, uXvX , and uXv.
			There are two cases that we ar
