ginning of a segment, even if the specific intention that is the DSP cannot be determined until the end of the segment.
    Utterance (15) in the movies example illustrates this point.
    The author writes, &amp;quot;How can our young people drink in through their eyes a continuous spectacle of intense and strained activity and feeling without harmful effects?&amp;quot; The primary intention 12 is derived from this utterance, but this cannot be done until very late in the discourse segment [since (15) occurs at the end of DS2].
    Furthermore, the segment for which 12 is primary has complex embedding of other segments.
    Utterance (16), intention IO, and DSO constitute another example of the expression of a primary intention late in a discourse segment.
    In that case, 10 cannot be computed until (16) has been read, and (16) is not only the last utterance in DSO, but is one that covers the entire essay.
    If an OCP must recognize a DSP to understand a segment, then we ask: how does the OCP recognize a
