rvised disambiguation of nouns using WordNet.
    Like Cowie et al., his algorithm optimizes a measure of semantic coherence over an entire sentence, in this case pairwise semantic distance between nouns in the sentence as measured using the noun taxonomy.
    Comparison of results is somewhat difficult, however, for two reasons.
    First, Sussna used an earlier version of WordNet (version 1.2) having a significantly smaller noun taxonomy (35K nodes vs. 49K nodes).
    Second, and more significant, in creating the test data, Sussna's human sense-taggers (tagging articles from the Time IR test collection) were permitted to tag a noun with as many senses as they felt were &amp;quot;good,&amp;quot; rather than making a forced choice; Sussna develops a scoring metric based on that fact rather than requiring exact matches to a single best sense.
    This is quite a reasonable move (see discussion below), but unfortunately not an option in the present experiment.
    Nonetheless, some comparison is possible, since
