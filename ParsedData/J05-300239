6).
    As a large-scale linearizer used in many traditional semantic-to-text generation systems, FUF/SURGE could be an appealing solution to the task of surface realization.
    Because the input structure and the requirements on the linearizer are quite different in text-to-text generation, we had to design rules for mapping between dependency structures produced by the fusion component and FUF/SURGE input.
    For instance, FUF/SURGE requires that the input contain a semantic role for prepositional phrases, such as manner, purpose, or location, which is not present in our dependency representation; thus we had to augment the dependency representation with this information.
    In the case of inaccurate prediction or the lack of relevant semantic information, the linearizer scrambles the order of sentence constituents, selects wrong prepositions, or even fails to generate an output.
    Another feature of the FUF/SURGE system that negatively influences system performance is its limited ability to reuse phra
