a, the combination did substantially boost dependency accuracy over either single factor, but actually suffered a small drop in constituency.11 Overall, the combination is able to combine the individual factors in an effective way.
  
  
    We have presented a successful new dependencybased model for the unsupervised induction of syntactic structure, which picks up the key ideas that have made dependency models successful in supervised statistical parsing work.
    We proceeded to show that it works cross-linguistically.
    We then demonstrated how this model could be combined with the previous best constituent-induction model to produce a combination which, in general, substantially outperforms either individual model, on either metric.
    A key reason that these models are capable of recovering structure more accurately than previous work is that they minimize the amount of hidden structure that must be induced.
    In particular, neither model attempts to learn intermediate, recursive categories with no
