ation on the Labelled Recall Algorithm.
    Using this technique, along with other optimizations, we achieved a 500 times speedup.
    In future work we will show the surprising result that the last element of Table 3, maximizing the Bracketed Tree criterion, equivalent to maximizing performance on Consistent Brackets Tree (Zero Crossing Brackets) Rate in the binary branching case, is NP-complete.
    Furthermore, we will show that the two algorithms presented, the Labelled Recall Algorithm and the Bracketed Recall Algorithm, are both special cases of a more general algorithm, the General Recall Algorithm.
    Finally, we hope to extend this work to the n-ary branching case.
