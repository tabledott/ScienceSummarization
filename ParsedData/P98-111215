st our hypothesis, one which turned out to provide us with clearer and more robust results.
    Utilizing EVCA.
    A different approach to test the hypothesis was to use another semantic categorization method; we chose the semantic classes of Levin's EVCA as a basis for our next analysis.3 Levin's seminal work is based on the time-honored observation that verbs which participate in similar syntactic alternations tend to share semantic properties.
    Thus, the behavior of a verb with respect to the expression and interpretation of its arguments can be said to be, in large part, determined by its meaning.
    Levin has meticulously set out a list of syntactic tests (about 100 in all), which predict membership in no less than 48 classes, each of which is divided into numerous sub-classes.
    The rigor and thoroughness of Levin's study permitted us to encode our algorithm, EVCA-Verber, on a sub-set of the EVCA classes, ones which were frequent in our corpus.
    First, we manually categorized the 100 most freq
