attempts to parse the input and at the same time produce a &amp;quot;preferred&amp;quot; semantic interpretation for it.
    Since the preferred interpretation also fixes the preferred sense of each word, it is at this point that the text can be given semantic tags, thus allowing sense-based information retrieval.
    In the next few subsections we will describe in greater detail the processes that enable the system to identify semantic preferences: morphological analysis, tagging, collocation identification, cluster matching, and semantic interpretation.
    Afterward we will discuss how the system combines the preferences it identifies.
    The first step in processing an input text is to determine the root, syntactic features, and affixes of each word.
    This information is necessary both for retrieving the word's lexical entries and for the syntactic tagging of the text during preprocessing.
    Morphological analysis not only reduces the number of words and senses that must be in the lexicon, but it al
