le parses with lower posterior probability for the unigram and collocation adaptor grammars (but not for the collocation-syllable adaptor grammar).
    Figure 1 plots the posterior probabilities of the sample trees t at each iteration for the collocation adaptor grammar, showing that even after 2,000 iterations incremental initialization results in trees that are much less likely than those produced by batch initialization.
    It seems that with incremental initialization the Gibbs sampler gets stuck in a local optimum which it is extremely unlikely to move away from.
    It is interesting that incremental initialization results in more accurate word segmentation, even though the trees it produces have lower posterior probability.
    This seems to be because the most probable analyses produced by the unigram and, to a lesser extent, the collocation adaptor grammars tend to undersegment.
    Incremental initialization greedily searches for common substrings, and because such substrings are more likely to be
