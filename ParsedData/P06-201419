    These are the only features that can be active for nonterminal productions.
    A terminal production rl that corresponds to a link l is given that link&#8217;s features from the matching system: OT (rl) = O(l).
    Terminal productions ro corresponding to unaligned tokens are given blank feature vectors: OT(ro) = 0.
    The SVM requires complete IF vectors for the correct training structures.
    Unfortunately, our training set contains gold standard alignments, not ITG parse trees.
    The gold standard is divided into sure and possible link sets 5 and P (Och and Ney, 2003).
    Links in 5 must be included in a correct alignment, while P links are optional.
    We create ITG trees from the gold standard using the following sorted priorities during tree construction: This creates trees that represent high scoring alignments, using a minimal number of invalid spans.
    Only the span and inversion counts of these trees will be used in training, so we need not achieve a perfect tree stru
