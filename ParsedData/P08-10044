#8221; RE system to improve performance?
    This paper addresses the questions raised above and makes the following contributions: The remainder of this paper is organized as follows.
    Section 2 assesses the promise of relationindependent extraction for the English language by characterizing how a sample of relations is expressed in text.
    Section 3 describes O-CRF, a new Open IE system, as well as R1-CRF, a standard RE system; a hybrid RE system is then presented in Section 4.
    Section 5 reports on our experimental results.
    Section 6 considers related work, which is then followed by a discussion of future work.
  
  
    How are relationships expressed in English sentences?
    In this section, we show that many relationships are consistently expressed using a compact set of relation-independent lexico-syntactic patterns, and quantify their frequency based on a sample of 500 sentences selected at random from an IE training corpus developed by (Bunescu and Mooney, 2007).1 This observation helps
