ble 4 show that the best results are obtained by incorporating agreement information as well.
    The highest test-set result, 71.16%, is obtained by using a high-precision threshold to determine which agreement links to add.
    While the development-set results would induce us to utilize the standard threshold value of 0, which is sub-optimal on the test set, the Bagr = 0 agreement-link policy still achieves noticeable improvement over not using agreement links (test set: 70.81% vs. 67.21%).
    We use speech segments as the unit of classification because they represent natural discourse units.
    As a consequence, we are able to exploit relationships at the speech-segment level.
    However, it is interesting to consider whether we really need to consider relationships specifically between speech segments themselves, or whether it suffices to simply consider relationships between the speakers of the speech segments.
    In particular, as an alternative to using same-speaker links, we tried a speaker-based
