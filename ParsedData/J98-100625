 as either peine or phrase.
    They collected contexts of sentence translated as peine to build a corpus for the judicial sense, and collected contexts of sentence translated as phrase to build a corpus for the grammatical sense.
    One problem with relying on bilingual corpora for data collection is that bilingual corpora are rare, and aligned bilingual corpora are even rarer.
    Another is that since French and English are so closely related, different senses of polysemous English words often translate to the same French word.
    For example, line is equally polysemous in French and English&#8212;and most senses of line translate into French as ligne.
    Several artificial techniques have been used so that classifiers can be developed and tested without having to invest in manually tagging the data: Yarowsky (1993) and Schtitze (1995) have acquired training and testing materials by creating pseudowords from existing nonhomographic forms.
    For example, a pseudoword was created by combining abused/esc
