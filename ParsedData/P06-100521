addam&#8217;s wife got a Jordanian lawyer for her husband.&#8221; It is unlikely we would see &#8220;wife&#8217;s husband&#8221; in text; in other words, we would not know that husband:gen:wife is, in fact, semantically compatible and thereby we would discourage selection of &#8220;wife&#8221; as the antecedent at resolution time.
    However, because &#8220;Noun gets ... for pronoun&#8217;s husband&#8221; is a coreferent path, we could capture the above relationship by adding a parent:rel:node for every pronoun connected to a noun phrase along a coreferent path in text.
    We developed context models with and without these path enhancements, but ultimately we could find no subset of coreferent paths that improve the semantic compatibility&#8217;s contribution to training set accuracy.
    A mutual information model trained on 85 GB of text is fairly robust on its own, and any kind of bootstrapped extension seems to cause more damage by increased noise than can be compensated by increased coverage.
