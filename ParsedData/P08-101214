en state sequences and spans.
    This linear time algorithm allows us to compute span pruning in O(n3) time.
    The same algorithm may be performed using the backward figure of merit after transposing rows and columns.
    Having cast the problem in terms of finite state automata, we can use finite state algorithms for pruning.
    For instance, fixing a source span we can enumerate the target spans in decreasing order by score (Soong and Huang, 1991), stopping once we encounter the first span below threshold.
    In practice the overhead of maintaining the priority queue outweighs any benefit, as seen in Figure 2.
    An alternate approach that avoids this overhead is to enumerate spans by position.
    Note that S[m, R] &#183; Qna=m+1 O(a) is within threshold iff there is a span with right boundary m&#8242; &lt; m within threshold.
    Furthermore if S[m, M] &#183; Qna=m+1 O(a) is within threshold, then m is the right boundary within threshold.
    Using these facts, we can gradually sweep the right bound
