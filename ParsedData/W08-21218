nic mean of LMP and LMR.
    We used several additional evaluation measures to further analyze the performance of the participating systems.
    The first additional measure used is Exact Match, which reports the percentage of sentences that are completely correct, i.e., all the generated syntactic dependencies are correct and all the semantic propositions are present and correct.
    While this score is significantly lower than any of the official scores, it will award systems that performed joint learning or optimization for all subtasks.
    In the same spirit but focusing on the semantic subtasks, we report the Perfect Proposition F1 score, where we score entire semantic frames or propositions.
    This measure is similar to the PProps accuracy score from the 2005 shared task (Carreras and M`arquez, 2005), with the caveat that this year this score is implemented as an F1 measure, because predicates are not provided in the test data.
    Hence, propositions may be over or under generated at prediction time
