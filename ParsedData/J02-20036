ally construed (Resnik 1993; Ribas 1995; McCarthy 1997; Li and Abe 1998; Wagner 2000).
    The purpose of using a semantic hierarchy for generalization is to overcome the sparse data problem, rather than find a level of abstraction that best represents the selectional restrictions of some predicate.
    This point is considered further in Section 5.
    The next section describes the noun hierarchy from WordNet and gives a more precise description of the probabilities to be estimated.
    Section 3 shows how a class from WordNet can be used to estimate the probability of a noun sense.
    Section 4 shows how a chi-square test is used as part of the generalization procedure, and Section 5 describes the generalization procedure.
    Section 6 describes the alternative class-based estimation methods used in the pseudo-disambiguation experiments, and Section 7 presents those experiments.
  
  
    The noun hierarchy of WordNet consists of senses, or what Miller (1998) calls lexicalized concepts, organized accordi
