h, the best hypothesis, off the stack.
    If h is a complete sentence, output h and terminate.
    For each possible next word w, extend h by adding w and push the resulting hypothesis onto the stack.
    Return to the second step (pop).
    One crucial difference between the decoding process in speech recognition (SR) and machine translation (MT) is that speech is always produced in the same order as its transcription.
    Consequently, in SR decoding there is always a simple left-to-right correspondence between input and output sequences.
    By contrast, in MT the leftto-right relation rarely holds even for language pairs as similar as French and English.
    We address this problem by building the solution from left to right, but allowing the decoder to consume its input in any order.
    This change makes decoding significantly more complex in MT; instead of knowing the order of the input in advance, we must consider allpermutations of an-word input sentence.
    Another important difference between SR
