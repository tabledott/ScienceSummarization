    Tables 2 and 3 chart the NCC discovery process.
    The NCCs proposed for the V objective function were much more likely to be validated than those proposed for I, because the predictive value function v' is much easier to estimate a priori than the predictive value function i'.
    In 3 iterations on the English side of the bitext, 192 NCCs were validated for I and 1432 were validated for V. Of the 1432 NCCs validated for V, 84 NCCs consisted of 3 words, 3 consisted of 4 words and 2 consisted of 5 words.
    The French NCCs were longer on average, due to the frequent &amp;quot;N de N&amp;quot; construction for noun compounds.
    The first experiment on the Hansards involved the mutual information objective function I and its associated predictive value function in Equation 3.
    The first step in the experiment was the construction of 5 new versions of the test data, in addition to the original version.
    Version k of the test data was constructed by fusing all NC
