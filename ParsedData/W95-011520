cellent noise filter for the decision procedure.
    The Word Alignment Filter is particularly useful when oracle lists are available to identify a large number of translation pairs that can be used to partition sentences.
    Using a LCSR cut-off of 0.58 (optimized using BiBLE, of course), cognates were found for 23% of the source tokens in the training corpus (counting punctuation).
    47% of the source tokens were found in the MRBD.
    Although there was some overlap, an average of 63% of the words in each sentence were paired up with a cognate or with a translation found in the MRBD, leaving few candidate translations for the remaining 37%.
    The oracles lists often supplied more than one match per word.
    For instance, several determiners or prepositions in the French sentence often matched the same word in the English sentence.
    When this happened, the current implementation of the Word Alignment Filter used several heuristics to choose at most one partitioning locus per word.
    For example,
