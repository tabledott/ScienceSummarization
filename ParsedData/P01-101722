hile there is still some progress, it is our opinion that substantial improvement in the state-of-the-art precision/recall figures (around 90%) is unlikely in the near future.3 However, we are not dealing with standard tree-bank text.
    As pointed out above, the text in question has been &#8220;speechified&#8221; by removing punctuation and capitalization, and &#8220;simplified&#8221; by allowing only a fixed vocabulary of 10,000 words (replacing all the rest by the symbol &#8220;UNK&#8221;), and replacing all digits and symbols by the symbol &#8220;N&#8221;.

    For example, when run on standard text, the parser uses ending information to guess parts of speech [3].
    Even if we had never encountered the word &#8220;showboating&#8221;, the &#8220;ing&#8221; ending tells us th
