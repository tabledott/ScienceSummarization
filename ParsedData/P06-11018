ve some model for inferring P(Rij E T|ERij), i.e., the posterior probability of the event Rij E T given the corresponding evidence ERij for that relation.
    For example, evidence for the hypernym relation EHij might be the set of all observed lexico-syntactic patterns containing i and j in all sentences in some corpus.
    For simplicity we make the following independence assumptions: first, we assume that each item of observed evidence ERij is independent of all other observed evidence given the taxonomy T, i.e., P(E|T) = 11ERijEE P(ERij|T).
    Further, we assume that each item of observed evidence ERij depends on the taxonomy T only by way of the corresponding relation Rij, i.e., For example, if our evidence EHij is a set of observed lexico-syntactic patterns indicative of hypernymy between two words i and j, we assume that whatever dependence the relations in T have on our observations may be explained entirely by dependence on the existence or non-existence of the single hypernym relation H(i, j).
