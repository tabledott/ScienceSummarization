chanism introduced in section 6 does not significantly affect translation performance.
    Two sets of experiments were run.
    The first set, of which the results are shown in table 3, tests the effect of different forms of reordering knowledge.
    In all these tests only the top 10 reorderings of each clause are generated.
    The contrast between tests 1 and 2 shows that ME modeling of reordering outperforms reordering rules.
    Tests 3 and 4 show that phrase labels can achieve as good performance as the lexical features of mere leftmost and rightmost words.
    However, when more lexical features are added (tests 4 and 6), phrase labels can no longer compete with lexical features.
    Surprisingly, test 5 shows that the combination of phrase labels and lexical features is even worse than using either phrase labels or lexical features only.
    Apart from quantitative evaluation, let us consider the translation example of test 6 shown in table 4.
    To generate the correct translation, a phrasebased de
