aces, making it a good classifier for our approach where using all the levels of linguistic clues could result in a huge number of features.
    Given all the levels of features incorporated in kernels and training data with target examples labeled, an SVM can pick up the features that best separate the targets from other examples, no matter which level these features are from.
    In cases where an error occurs in one processing result (especially deep processing) and the features related to it become noisy, SVM may pick up clues from other sources which are not so noisy.
    This forms the basic idea of our approach.
    Therefore under this scheme we can overcome errors introduced by one processing level; more particularly, we expect accurate low level information to help with less accurate deep level information.
  
  
    Collins et al. (1997) and Miller et al.
    (2000) used statistical parsing models to extract relational facts from text, which avoided pipeline processing of data.
