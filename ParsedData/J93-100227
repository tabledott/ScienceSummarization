l way to obtain a finitestate representation of a non-finite&#8212;state grammar incorporating information about parse context.
    In the following sections, we introduce the LR parser and in Section 8 Ted Briscoe and John Carroll Generalized Probabilistic LR Parsing we demonstrate that LR parse tables do provide an appropriate amount of contextual information to solve the problems described above.
    The heart of the LR parsing technique is the parse table construction algorithm, which is the most complex and computationally expensive aspect of LR parsing.
    Much of the attraction of the technique stems from the fact that the real work takes place in a precompilation phase and the run time behavior of the resulting parser is relatively simple and directed.
    An LR parser finds the 'rightmost derivation in reverse,' for a given string and CF grammar.
    The precompilation process results in a parser control mechanism that enables the parser to identify the 'handle,' or appropriate substring in the inpu
