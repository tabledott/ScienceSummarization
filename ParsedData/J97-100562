out referential NPs.
    We refer to this algorithm as NP.
    Unlike the previous algorithms, in NP the potential boundaries are first computed as ordered pairs of adjacent functionally independent clauses (FICU,,FICU,&#177;1; see section 4.1.2) then normalized to ordered pairs of prosodic phrases (see note 10).
    NP operates on the principle that if an NP in the current FICU provides a referential link to the current segment, the current segment continues.
    However, NPs and pronouns are treated differently based on the assumption that the referent of a third person definite pronoun is more prominently in focus (cf.
    Passonneau [19941).
    A third person definite pronoun provides a referential link if its index occurs anywhere in the current segment.
    Any other NP type provides a referential link if its index occurs in the immediately preceding FICU.
    Figure 12 illustrates the two decisions made by NP for each pair of adjacent FICUs.
    As described in Section 4.1.2, the coref feature is -cor
