table for automatic summaries.
    Both salience and syntactic information contribute to the accuracy of the ranking model.
    The impact of each of these knowledge sources in isolation is not dramatic&#8212; dropping either of them yields some decrease in accuracy, but the difference is not statistically significant.
    However, eliminating both salience and syntactic information significantly decreases performance (compare Coreference&#8722;Syntax+Salience+ against Coreference+Syntax&#8722;Salience&#8722; and Coreference&#8722;Syntax&#8722;Salience&#8722; in Table 8).
    Figure 2 shows the learning curve for our best model Coreference&#8722;Syntax+ Salience+.
    Although the model performs poorly when trained on a small fraction of the data, it stabilizes relatively fast (with 80 pairwise rankings), and does not improve after Learning curve for the entity-based model Coreference&#8722;Syntax+Salience+ applied to the summary ranking task. a certain point.
    These results suggest that further improvemen
