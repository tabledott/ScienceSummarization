making direct use of marginal polytopes.
    In section 6 we will prove that the example algorithms solve these LP relaxations.
    For a finite set Y, define the set of all distributions over elements in Y as A = {a &#8712; R|Y |: ay &#8805; 0, Ey&#8712;Y ay = 1}.
    Each a &#8712; A gives a vector of marginals, &#181; = Ey&#8712;Y ayy, where &#181;r can be interpreted as the probability that yr = 1 for a y selected at random from the distribution a.
    The set of all possible marginal vectors, known as the marginal polytope, is defined as follows: M is also frequently referred to as the convex hull of Y, written as conv(Y).
    We use the notation conv(Y) in the remainder of this paper, instead of M. For an arbitrary set Y, the marginal polytope conv(Y) can be complex to describe.6 However, Martin et al. (1990) show that for a very general class of dynamic programming problems, the corresponding marginal polytope can be expressed as where A is a p &#215; m matrix, b is vector in Rp, and the value p is lin
