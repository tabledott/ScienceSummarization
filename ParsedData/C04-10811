 on find ing word boundaries in unsegmented sequences(see (Sproat and Shih, 2002) for a review).
			Un fortunately, building a Chinese word segmentation system is complicated by the fact that there is no standard definition of word boundaries in Chinese.
			Approaches to Chinese segmentation fall roughly into two categories: heuristic dictionary-based methods and statistical machine learning methods.In dictionary-based methods, a predefined dictio nary is used along with hand-generated rules for segmenting input sequence (Wu, 1999).
			Howeverthese approaches have been limited by the impossibility of creating a lexicon that includes all possible Chinese words and by the lack of robust statistical inference in the rules.
			Machine learning approaches are more desirable and have been successful in both unsupervised learning (Peng and Schuur mans, 2001) and supervised learning (Teahan et al, 2000).
			Many current approaches suffer from either lackof exact inference over sequences or difficulty in incorporating
