rase-based models are limited to se quences of words as their units with no access to additional linguistic knowledge.
			Factors allow for richer translation models, for example, the gender or tense of a word can be expressed.
			Factors also allow the model to generalise, for example, the lemma of a word could be used to generalise to unseen inflected forms.
			The factored translation model combines features in a log-linear fashion (Och, 2003).
			The most likely target sentence t?
			is calculated using the decision rule in Equation 1: t?
			= argmax t { M?
			m=1 ?mhm(s Fs 1 , t Ft 1 ) } (1) t?
			M? m=1 ?mhm(s Fs 1 , t Ft 1 ) (2) where M is the number of features, hm(s Fs 1 , t Ft 1 ) are the feature functions over the factors, and ? are the weights which combine the features which areoptimised using minimum error rate training (Venu gopal and Vogel, 2005).
			Each function depends on a vector sFs1 of source factors and a vector t Ft1 of tar get factors.
