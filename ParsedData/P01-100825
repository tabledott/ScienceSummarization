by our system, 354(70.8%) were single word pairs and 146(29.2%) were multi-word paraphrases, while the majority of pairs produced by Melamed&#8217;s system were single word pairs (90%).
    We mixed this output and gave the resulting, randomly ordered 1000 pairs to six evaluators, all of whom were native speakers.
    Each evaluator provided judgments on 500 pairs without context.
    Precision for our system was 71.6% and for Melamed&#8217;s was 52.7%.
    This increased precision is a clear advantage of our approach and shows that machine translation techniques cannot be used without modification for this task, particularly for producing multi-word paraphrases.
    There are three caveats that should be noted; Melamed&#8217;s system was run without changes for this new task of paraphrase extraction and his system does not use chunk segmentation, he ran the system for three days of computation and the result may be improved with more running time since it makes incremental improvements on subsequent rounds,
