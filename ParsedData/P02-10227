nt of annotations to the same text string. another optional module for the IE system.
    Its primary objective is to perform co-reference, or entity tracking, by recognising relations between entities.
    It also has a secondary role in improving named entity recognition by assigning annotations to previously unclassified names, based on relations with existing entities. identity relations between entities in the text.

    4.1 Implementation The implementation of the processing resources is centred on robustness, usability and the clear distinction between declarative data representations and finite state algorithms The behaviour of all the processors is completely controlled by external resources such as grammars or rule sets, which makes them easily modifiable by users who do not need to be familiar with programming languages.
    The fact that all processing resources use finite-state transducer technology makes them quite performant in terms of execution times.
