 path from the root of a trie to one of its terminals, inquiring of each node its associated one-letter entropy, based on the continuations from that node.)
    Let us refer to this as the prefix conditional entropy; clearly we may be equally interested in constructing a trie from the right edge of words, which then provides us with a suffix conditional entropy, in mirror-image fashion.
    Harris himself employed no probabilistic notions, and the inclusion of entropy in the formulation had to await Hafer and Weiss (1974); but allowing ourselves the anachronism, we may say that Harris proposed that local peaks of prefix (and suffix) conditional entropy should identify morpheme breaks.
    The method proposed in Harris (1955) appealed to what today we would call an oracle for information about the language under scrutiny, but in his 1967 article, Harris implemented a similar procedure on a computer and a fixed corpus, restricting his problem to that of finding morpheme boundaries within words.
