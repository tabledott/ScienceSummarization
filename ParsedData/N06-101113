ords.
    In each iteration, we used the current transliter= (powell, pauel).
    We build a feature vector from this example in the following manner: First, we split both words into all possible substrings of up to size two: ation model to find a list of 30 best transliteration equivalence classes for each NE.
    We then computed time sequence similarity score between NE and each class from its list to find the one with the best matching time sequence.
    If its similarity score surpassed a set threshold, it was added to the list of positive examples for the next round of training.
    Positive examples were constructed by pairing each English NE with each of the transliterations from the best equivalence class that surpasses the threshold.
    We used the same number of positive and negative examples.
    For evaluation, random 727 of the total of 978 NE pairs matched by the algorithm were selected and checked by a language expert.
    Accuracy was computed as the percentage of those NEs correctly discove
