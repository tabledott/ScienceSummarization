 annotated data, we experiment with two different classifiers, Naive Bayes and support vector machines (SVM), selected for their performance and diversity of learning methodology.
    For Naive Bayes, we use the multinomial model (McCallum and Nigam, 1998) with a threshold of 0.3.
    For SVM (Joachims, 1998), we use the LibSVM implementation (Fan et al., 2005) with a linear kernel.
    The automatic translation of the MPQA and of the SemCor corpus was performed using Language Weaver,1 a commercial statistical machine translation software.
    The resulting text was post-processed by removing diacritics, stopwords and numbers.
    For training, we experimented with a series of weighting schemes, yet we only report the results obtained for binary weighting, as it had the most consistent behavior.
    The results obtained by running the three experiments on Romanian are shown in Table 2.
    The baseline on this data set is 54.16%, represented by the percentage of sentences in the corpus that are subjective, an
