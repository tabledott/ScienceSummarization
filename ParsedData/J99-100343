 improvement was not universal: the RMS error of the basic SIMR was 19 for the &amp;quot;other technical report&amp;quot; on which the enhanced SIMR scored 21.
    The expected value of the enhancements is difficult to predict, because each enhancement is aimed at solving a particular pattern recognition problem, and each problem may or may not occur in a given bitext.
    The relationship between geometric patterns in TPC chains and syntactic properties of bitexts is a ripe research topic.
  
  
    SIMR has no idea that words are often used to make sentences.
    It just outputs a series of corresponding token positions, leaving users free to draw their own conclusions about how the texts' larger units correspond.
    However, many existing translators' tools and machine translation strategies depend on aligned sentences or other aligned text segments.
    What can SIMR do for them?
    Formally, an alignment is a correspondence relation that does not permit crossing correspondences.
