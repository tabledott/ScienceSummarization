  Forest-Based Translation
  
    Among syntax-based translation models, the which takes as input a parse tree of the source sentence, is a promising direction being faster and simpler than its string-based counterpart.
    However, current tree-based systems suffer from a major drawback: they only use the 1-best parse to direct the translation, which potentially introduces translation mistakes due to parsing errors.
    We a that translates a packed forest of exponentially many parses, which encodes many more alternatives standard lists.
    Large-scale experiments show an absolute improvement of 1.7 BLEU points over the 1-best baseline.
    This result is also 0.8 points higher than decoding with 30-best parses, and takes even less time.
  
  
    Syntax-based machine translation has witnessed promising improvements in recent years.
    Depending on the type of input, these efforts can be divided into two broad categories: the string-based systems whose input is a string to be simultaneously parsed and tra
