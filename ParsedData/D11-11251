ers of a statistical machine translation (MT) system.
    MERT is well-understood, easy to implement, and runs quickly, but can behave erratically and does not scale beyond a handful of features.
    This lack of scalability is a significant weakness, as it inhibits systems from using more than a couple dozen features to discriminate between candidate translations and stymies feature development innovation.
    Several researchers have attempted to address this weakness.
    Recently, Watanabe et al. (2007) and Chiang et al.
    (2008b) have developed tuning methods using the MIRA algorithm (Crammer and Singer, 2003) as a nucleus.
    The MIRA technique of Chiang et al. has been shown to perform well on large-scale tasks with hundreds or thousands of features (2009).
    However, the technique is complex and architecturally quite different from MERT.
    Tellingly, in the entire proceedings of ACL 2010 (Haji&#711;c et al., 2010), only one paper describing a statistical MT system cited the use of MIRA for tuni
