e corpora from the Web that could then be mined for parallel sentences using our method.
  
  
    The most important feature of our parallel sentence selection approach is its robustness.
    Comparable corpora are inherently noisy environments, where even similar content may be expressed in very different ways.
    Moreover, out-of-domain corpora introduce additional difficulties related to limited dictionary coverage.
    Therefore, the ability to reliably judge sentence pairs in isolation is crucial.
    Comparable corpora of interest are usually of large size; thus, processing them requires efficient algorithms.
    The computational processes involved in our system are quite modest.
    All the operations necessary for the classification of a sentence pair (filter, word alignment computation, and feature extraction) can be implemented efficiently and scaled up to very large amounts of data.
    The task can be easily parallelized for increased speed.
    For example, extracting data from 600k English do
