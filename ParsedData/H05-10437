tAll instantiates relation-specific generic extrac tion patterns into extraction rules which find candidate facts.
			KnowItAll?s Assessor then assigns a probability to each candidate.
			The Assessor uses a form of Point-wiseMutual Information (PMI) between phrases that is esti mated from Web search engine hit counts (Turney, 2001).
			It computes the PMI between each fact and automatically generated discriminator phrases (e.g., ?is a scanner?
			for the isA() relationship in the context of the Scanner class).
			Given fact f and discriminator d, the computed PMI score is: PMI(f, d) = Hits(d+ f )Hits(d)?Hits(f ) The PMI scores are converted to binary features for aNaive Bayes Classifier, which outputs a probability asso ciated with each fact (Etzioni et al, 2005).
			3.1 Finding Explicit Features.
			OPINE extracts explicit features for the given productclass from parsed review data.
			First, the system recur sively identifies both the parts and the properties of the given product class and their parts and
