 that the word pairs good &#8211; fails and embargo &#8211; legally are good indicators of CONTRAST relations.
    The extraction patterns described in Table 2 enable us to solve this problem.1 Second, given vast amounts of training material, we need a means to learn which pairs of lexical items are likely to co-occur in conjunction with each discourse relation and a means to apply the learned parameters to any pair of text spans in order to determine the discourse relation that holds between them.
    We solve the second problem in a Bayesian probabilistic framework.
    We assume that a discourse relation that holds between two text spans, , is determined by the word pairs in the cartesian product defined over the words in the two text spans .
    In general, a word pair can &#8220;signal&#8221; any relation .
    We determine the most likely discourse relation that holds between two text spans and by taking the maximum over , which according to Bayes rule, amounts to taking the maximum over .
    If we ass
