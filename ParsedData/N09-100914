 a shared logistic normal distribution with N &#8220;experts&#8221; over a collection of K multinomial distributions.
    Let &#951;n &#8212; Normal(&#181;n, En) be a set of multivariate normal variables for n E 1:N, where the length of &#951;n is denoted `n. Let In = {In,j}Ln j=1 be a partition of 1:`n into Ln sets, such that ULn j=1In,j = 1:`n and In,j n In,j, = 0 for j =&#65533; j'.
    Let Jk for k E 1:K be a collection of (disjoint) subsets of {In,j I n E 1:N, j E 1:`n, IIn,j = Nk}, such that all sets in Jk are of the same size, Nk.
    Let &#951;k =|Jk |F-In,j&#8712;Jk &#951;n,In,j, and &#952;k i = exp(&#732;&#951;k,i) /Ei, exp(&#732;&#951;k,i,).
    We then say &#952; distributes according to the shared logistic normal distribution with partition structure S = ({In}N n=1, {Jk}Kk=1) and normal experts {(&#181;n, En)}Nn=1 and denote it by &#952; &#8212; SLN(&#181;, E, S).
    The partitioned LN distribution in Aitchison (1986) can be formulated as a shared LN distribution where N = 1.
