 various categories of performance for their system.
    The performance of our system on those sentences appeared rather better than theirs.
    On a set of 11 sentence fragments&#8212;the A set&#8212;where they reported 100% recall and precision for name identification, we had 73% recall and 80% precision.
    However, they list two sets, one consisting of 28 fragments and the other of 22 fragments, in which they had 0% recall and precision.
    On the first of these&#8212;the B set&#8212;our system had 64% recall and 86% precision; on the second&#8212;the C set&#8212;it had 33% recall and 19% precision.
    Note that it is in precision that our overall performance would appear to be poorer than the reported performance of Chang et al., yet based on their published examples, our system appears to be doing better precisionwise.
    Thus we have some confidence that our own performance is at least as good as that of Chang et al. (1992).
    In a more recent study than Chang et al., Wang, Li, and Chang (1992)
