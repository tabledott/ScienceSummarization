    When [subject] reaches the top of the queue, it activates units such as [noun phrase], [gerund], and [noun clause].
    Each node, after instantiating first-children, becomes inactive, pending the return of a successful subparse from a sequence of children.
    Eventually, the cascade of first-children reaches a terminal node such as [article], Stephanie Seneff TINA: A Natural Language System for Spoken Language Applications which proposes a set of words to be compared with the input stream.
    If a match with an appropriate word is found, then the terminal node fills its subparse slot with an entry such as ([article] &amp;quot;the&amp;quot;), and activates all of its possible right-siblings.
