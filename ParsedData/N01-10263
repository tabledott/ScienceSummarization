erformance degradation when either the word alignment or translation faithfulness in these pairs are weak.
    This further motivates the noise-robust training and stand-alone application of our current work.
    In a related framework, Jones and Havrilla (1998) investigated the use of twisted-pair grammars for syntactic transfer.
    Given an existing Hindi/Urdu sentence parse, English output was generated by rotating subtrees using the constraints and preferences of the transduction grammar.
    The ability to generate candidate target-language orderings in this manner offers great potential to productively constrain search in a statistical MT system.
    Yet the assumption of existing syntactic analyses for each source language further motivates the need to induce such analyses.
  
  
    The data used in our experiments are the EnglishFrench Canadian Hansards and English-Chinese Hong Kong Hansards, parallel records of parliamentary proceedings and publications.
    Both corpora were word-aligned by the no
