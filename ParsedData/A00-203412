shold on the similarity scores as the decision point for participation to determine a level of accuracy.
    We experimented with both the mean and median of the scores as a threshold.
    Seven of the negative causative candidates were randomly chosen and removed to ensure an even split between positive and negative candidates for determining accuracy using the mean and median as thresholds.
    The following subsection describes the results of the experiments using the method described in section 3 above.
    Subsection 4.2 describes an experiment on the same data to determine participation using a similarity measure based on the intersection of the lemmas at the target slots.
    The results for the causative alternation are displayed in table 1 for both the RBC and the UBC.
    The relationship between participation and asp is highly significant in both cases, with values of p well below 0.01.
    Accuracy for the mean and median thresholds are displayed in the fourth and fifth columns.
