nce sequences is close to random.
    Therefore, we opt to resolve coreference within the original text.
    Although this design has an oracle feel to it, it is not uncommon in practical applications.
    For instance, in text generation systems, content planners often operate over fully specified semantic representations, and can thus take advantage of coreference information during sentence ordering.
    Besides variations in the underlying linguistic representation, our model is also specified by two free parameters: the frequency threshold used to identify salient entities and the length of the transition sequence.
    These parameters were tuned separately for each data set on the corresponding held-out development set.
    Optimal saliencebased models were obtained for entities with frequency &gt;2.
    The optimal transition length was &lt;3.6 In our ordering experiments, we used Joachims&#8217;s (2002) SVMlight package for training and testing with all parameters set to their default values.
