9,097) The instances of this schema are lexical items together with the categories of E of their immediate ancestor nodes, where E is a schema parameter (E = 2 or E = 3 here).
    This feature was inspired by a similar feature in Klein and Manning (2003).
    HeadTree (72,171) The instances of this schema are tree fragments consisting of the local trees consisting of the projections of a preterminal node and the siblings of such projections.
    This schema is parameterized by the head type (lexical or functional) used to determine the projections of a preterminal, and whether the head preterminal is lexicalized.
    NGramTree (291,909) The instances of this schema are subtrees rooted in the least common ancestor of E contiguous preterminal nodes.
    This schema is parameterized by the number E of contiguous preterminals (E = 2 or E = 3 here) and whether these preterminals are lexicalized.
