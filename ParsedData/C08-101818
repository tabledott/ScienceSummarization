			lection we incorporate a ngram language model(LM) as a feature.
			This requires adapting the scor ing function, ?, in (2) to allow features over target ngrams: ?(y) = ? r?y ??(r, S(y)), ??+ ? m?T (y) ??(m,S(y)), ??
			(5)where m are the ngrams and ? is a new fea ture function over these ngrams (we use only one ngram feature: the trigram log-probability).
			Sadly, the scoring function in (5) renders the chart-based search used for training and decoding intractable.In order to pr
