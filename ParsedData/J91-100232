 this chain with chain 1, which runs through the entire example and consists of these words and others: {city, suburbs, traffic, community}.
    Fortunately, this was a rare occurrence.
    But note that there will be cases in which lexical chains should be merged as a result of the intentional merging of ideas or concepts in the text.
    Conversely, there were a few cases of unfortunate chain returns occurring where they were definitely counter intuitive.
    In chain 3, word 4, wife, was taken as a oneword return to the chain {married, wife, wife}.
    However, there is no intuitive reason for this.
  
  
    This section describes how lexical chains formed by the algorithm given in Section 3.2.3 can be used as a tool.
    Any structural theory of text must be concerned with identifying units of text that are about the same thing.
    When a unit of text is about the same thing there is a strong tendency for semantically related words to be used within that unit.
    By definition, lexical chains are chain
