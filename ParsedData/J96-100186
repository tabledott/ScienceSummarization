 summarization of Japanese.
    In addition, we are planning to add a second language for the summaries.
    While the output is not a direct translation of input articles, collocations that appear frequently in the news articles will also appear in summaries.
    Thus, a list of bilingual collocations would be useful for the summarization process.
    Information retrieval is another prospective application.
    As shown in Maarek and Smadja (1989) and more recently in Broglio et al. (1995), the precision of information retrieval systems can be improved through the use of collocations in addition to the more traditional single word indexing units.
    A collocation gives the context in which a given word was used, which will help retrieve documents using the word with the same sense and thus improve precision.
    The well-known New Mexico example in information retrieval describes an oft-encountered problem when single word searches are employed: searching for new and Mexico independently will retrieve a mu
