nly the 24,115 token test corpus for EM estimation (shown within parenthesis in second column of the table in Figure 9).
    We find that our performance does not degrade when the parameter estimation is done using less data, and our model still achieves a high accuracy of 96.8%.
    The literature also includes results reported in a different setting for the tagging problem.
    In some scenarios, a complete dictionary with entries for all word types may not be readily available to us and instead, we might be provided with an incomplete dictionary that contains entries for only frequent word types.
    In such cases, any word not appearing in the dictionary will be treated as an unknown word, and can be labeled with any of the tags from given tagset (i.e., for every unknown word, there are 17 tag possibilities).
    Some previous approaches (Toutanova and Johnson, 2008; Goldberg et al., 2008) handle unknown words explicitly using ambiguity class components conditioned on various morphological features, and t
