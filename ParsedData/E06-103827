ribed a new system for sentence compression.
    This system uses discriminative large-margin learning techniques coupled with a decoding algorithm that searches the space of all compressions.
    In addition we defined a rich feature set of bigrams in the compression and dropped words and phrases from the original sentence.
    The model also incorporates soft syntactic evidence in the form of features over dependency and phrase-structure trees for each sentence.
    This system has many advantages over previous approaches.
    First of all its discriminative nature allows us to use a rich dependent feature set and to optimize a function directly related to compresThe fi rst new product, ATF Protype , is a line of digital postscript typefaces that will be sold in packages of up to six fonts.
