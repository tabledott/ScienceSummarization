  CONCLUSION We are now beginning annotation using this new scheme.
  We believe that this revised form of annotation will provide a cor- pus of annotated material that is useful for training stochastic parsers on surface syntax, for training stochastic parsers that work at one level of analysis beyond surface syntax, and at the same time provide a consistent database for use in lin- guistic research.
