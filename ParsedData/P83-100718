 phrase can be a center.
    For the sake of concreteness in many of the examples in the preceding discussion, we have relied on the situation semantics of Barwise and Perry.
    The theory we are developing does not depend on this particular semantical treatment of definite noun phrases, but it does require several of the distinctions that treatment provides.
    In particular, our theory requires a semantical treatment that accommodates the distinction between interpretations of definite noun phrases that contribute their content to the propositions expressed by sentences in which they occur and interpretations that contribute only their denotation&#8212;in other words, the distinction between value-free and value-loaded interpretations.
    As noted, a distinction of this sort can be effected within the framework of 'possible-worlds' approaches to the semantics of natural language.
    In addition, we see the need for interpretations of definite noun phrases to be dependent on their discourse context.
