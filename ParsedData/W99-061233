ue to the increased number of examples of each, their classification is more accurate).
    This is a very encouraging trend, as the web and other online sources provides virtually unlimited raw text in most major languages, and substantial on-line text for virtually all languages.
    So extrapolating far beyond the 10K word level is relatively low cost and very feasible.
    The second graph shows that F-measure performance also increases roughly logrithmically with the total length of the seed wordlists in the range 40300.
    This increase is due entirely to improved recall, which doubles over this small range.
    This trend suggests that there is considerable benefit to be gained by additional human annotation, or seed wordlist acquisition from existing online lexicons.
    However, relative to case of raw text acquisition, such additional annotations tend to be much costlier, and there is a clear cost-benefit tradeoff to further investment in annotation.
    In summary, however, these evaluation result
