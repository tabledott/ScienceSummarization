e a version that is augmented with two simple heuristics that attempt to alleviate some of these shortcomings.
    One possible improvement concerns English words that appear more than once in a sentence.
    According to the model, a foreign word that prefers to be aligned with such an English word could be equally well aligned with any instance of that word.
    In such situations, instead of arbitrarily choosing the first instance or a random instance, we attempt to make a &#8221;smarter&#8221; decision.
    First, we create links only for those English words that appear exactly once; next, for words that appear more than once, we choose which instance to link with so that we minimize the number of crossings with already existing links.
    The second heuristic attempts to improve the choice of the most likely English translation of a foreign word.
    Our translation probabilities are automatically learned from parallel data, and we learn values for both t(fj|ei) and t(ei|fj).
    We can therefore decide
