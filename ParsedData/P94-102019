    The Bayesian network representation of a decomposable model embodies an explicit ordering of the n variables in the model such that variable i may be considered a response to some or all of variables {i + 1, , n}, but is not thought of as a response to any one of the variables {1, , i &#8212; 1}.
    In all models presented in this paper, the sense tag of the ambiguous word causes or influences the values of all other variables in the model.
    The Bayesian network representation of Model 4 is presented in Figure 2.
    In Model 4, the variables in and percent are treated as influencing the values of rate, short, and pursue in order to achieve an ordering of variables as described above.
  
  
    Many researchers have avoided characterizing the interactions among multiple contextual features by considering only one feature in determining the sense of an ambiguous word.
    Techniques for identifying the optimum feature to use in disambiguating a word are presented in
