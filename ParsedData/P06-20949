 in the proposed method, the slots of the final table will be filled in only with instances of these extended Named Entities.
    Most common nouns, verbs or sentences can&#8217;t be entries in the table.
    This is obviously a limitation of the proposed method; however, as the categories are designed to provide good coverage for a factoid type QA system, most interesting types of entities are covered by the categories.
    Basically the table construction is done by applying the discovered patterns to the original corpus.
    The discovered patterns are grouped into pattern set using discovered paraphrase knowledge.
    Once the pattern sets are built, a table is created for each pattern set.
    We gather all NE instances matched by one of the patterns in the set.
    These instances are put in the same column of the table for the pattern set.
    When creating tables, we impose some restrictions in order to reduce the number of meaningless tables and to gather the same relations in one table.
    We requi
