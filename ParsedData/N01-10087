this case, all words from the synsets containing w receive the disjunct of the gender attributes corresponding to each sense of w. Mining semantic information from WordNet We used the WordNet knowledge base to mine patterns of WordNet paths that connect pairs of coreferring nouns from the annotated chains.
    The paths are combinations of any of the following WordNet 6A polysemous noun has multiple semantic senses and therefore has multiple entries in the WordNet dictionary.
    To determine the confidence of the path we consider three factors: *Factor fi has only two values.
    It is set to 1 when another coreference chain contains elements in the same NPs as the anaphor and the anetcedent.
    For example, if NPi is &amp;quot;the professor's son&amp;quot; and NP2 is &amp;quot;his father&amp;quot;, the semantic consistency between father and professor is more likely, given that his and son corefer.
    Otherwise, fi is set to 0.
    *Factor f2 favors (a) relations that are considered &amp;quot;stronger&amp
