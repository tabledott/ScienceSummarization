ond time in the same unit of text.
    Function words also deviate from the binomial, though for different reasons (e.g., stylistic factors mentioned in Biber's paper).
    These bursts might serve a useful purpose.
    People seem to be able to use these bursts to speed up reaction times in various tasks.
    Psycholinguists use the term priming to refer to this effect.
    Bursts might also be useful in a number of practical applications such as Information Retrieval (IR) (Salton 1989; Frakes and Baeza-Yates 1992).
    There have been a number of attempts over the years to model these bursts.
    The negative binomial distribution, for example, was explored in considerable detail in the classic study of the authorship of the Federalist Papers, Mosteller and Wallace (1964), a mustread for anyone interested in statistical analyses of large corpora.
    We can show that the distribution of Kennedy is very bursty in the Brown Corpus by dividing the corpus into k segments and showing that the probability varies
