 in the increase of incorrect assignments by the default strategy.
    There were three types of mistaggings on unknown words detected in our experiments.
    Mistagging of the first type occurred when a guesser provided a broader POS-class for an unknown word than a lexicon would, and the tagger had difficulties with its disambiguation.
    This was especially the case with the words that were guessed as noun/adjective (NN 11) but, in fact, act only as one of them (as do, for example, many hyphenated words).
    Another highly ambiguous group is the ing words, which, in general, can act as nouns, adjectives, and gerunds and only direct lexicalization can restrict the search-space, as in the case of the word seeing, which cannot act as an adjective.
    The second type of mistagging was caused by incorrect assignments by the guesser.
    Usually this was the case with irregular words such as cattle or data, which were wrongly guessed to be singular nouns (NN) but in fact were plural nouns (NNs).
    We also d
