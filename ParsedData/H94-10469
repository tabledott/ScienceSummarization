m a novel that was classified by Francis and Ku~era [3] as "Imaginative Prose: Romance and Love Story") was semantically tagged to use as the test material.
  The ~aining material was the 103 other passages from the Brown Corpus (not including P7) that made up the semantic concordance.
  The seman- tic tags assigned by a human reader were then compared, one word at a time, with the sense assigned by the most-frequent heuristic.
  For this particular passage, only 62.5% of the open-class words were correctly tagged by the most-frequent heuristic.
  This estimate is generous, however, since 24% of the open-class words were monosemous.
  When the average is taken solely over polysemous words, the most frequent sense was right only 50.8% of the time.
  These results were lower than expected, so we asked whether pas- sage P7 might be unusual in some way.
  For example, the sentences were relatively short and there were fewer monosemous words than in an average passage in the training material.
  However, an inspec
