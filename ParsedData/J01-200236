otation Ao.
    In Ao, each known word is tagged with its most likely tag in the training set, and each unknown word is tagged as a noun (or proper noun if capitalized).
    The system then searches through a space of transformation rules (defined by rule templates) in order to reduce the discrepancy between its current annotation and the provided correct one.
    There are separate templates for known words (mainly based on local word and tag context), and for unknown words (based on suffix, prefix, and other lexical information).
    The exact features used by this tagger are shown in Table 1.
    The learner for the unknown words is trained and applied first.
    Based on its output, the rules for context disambiguation are learned.
    In each learning step, all instantiations of the rule templates that are present in the corpus are generated and receive a score.
    The rule that corrects the highest number of errors at step n is selected and applied to the corpus to yield an annotation An, which is then
