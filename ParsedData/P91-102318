ments with a score above this threshold.
    Figure 2 examines this trade-off in more detail.
    The program made 36 errors out of 621 total alignments (5.8%) for English-French, and 19 errors out of 695 (2.7%) alignments for EnglishGerman.
    Overall, there were 55 errors out of a total of 1316 alignments (4.2%). times the error rate for 1-1.
    The 2-2 alignments are harder still, but a majority of the alignments are found.
    The 3-1 and 3-2 alignments are not even considered by the algorithm, so naturally all three are counted as errors.
    The most embarrassing category is 1-0, which was never good predictor of performance can be used to extract a large subcorpus which has a much smaller error rate.
    In general, we can trade-off the size of the subcorpus and the accuracy by setting a threshold, and rejecting alignments with a score above this threshold.
    The horizontal axis shows the size of the subcorpus, and the vertical axis shows the corresponding error rate.
    An error rate of about 2/3
