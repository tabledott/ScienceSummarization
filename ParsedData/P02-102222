    In recent years, the emphasis on multilinguality has grown, and important advances have been witnessed on the software scene with the emergence of Unicode as a universal standard for representing textual data.
    GATE supports multilingual data processing using Unicode as its default text encoding.
    It also provides a means of entering text in various languages, using virtual keyboards where the language is not supported by the underlying operating platform.
    (Note that although Java represents characters as Unicode, it doesn't support input in many of the languages covered by Unicode.)
    Currently 28 languages are supported, and more are planned for future releases.
    Because GATE is an open architecture, new virtual keyboards can be defined by the users and added to the system as needed.
    For displaying the text, GATE relies on the rendering facilities offered by the Java implementation for the platform it runs on.
