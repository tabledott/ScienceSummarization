nerates it (Maruyama 1990).
    An assignment given to a sentence &amp;quot;a.aba.ab&amp;quot; is shown in Figure 10.
    On the other hand, any context-free language can be generated by a degree=2 CDG.
    This can be proved by constructing a constraint dependency grammar GC DG from an arbitrary context-free grammar GeFG in Greibach Normal Form, and by showing that the two grammars generate exactly the same language.
    Since GeFa is in Greibach Normal Form, it is easy to make one-to-one correspondence between a word in a sentence and a rule application in a phrase-structure tree.
    The details of the proof are given in Maruyama (1990).
    This, combined with the fact that Gww generates Lww, means that the weak generative capacity of CDG with degree=2 is strictly greater than that of CFG.
    Let us consider a constraint dependency grammar G =&lt; E, R, L,C &gt; with arity=2 and degree=k.
    Let be the length of the input sentence.
    Consider the space complexity of the constraint network first.
