 co-occur is called a direct association.
    Now, suppose that nods and head often co-occur in English.
    Then hoche and head will also co-occur more often than expected by chance.
    The dashed arrow between hoche and head in Figure 1 represents an indirect association, since the association between hoche and head arises only by virtue of the association between each of them and nods.
    Models of translational equivalence that are ignorant of indirect associations have &amp;quot;a tendency ... to be confused by collocates&amp;quot; (Dagan, Church, and Gale 1993,5).
    Paradoxically, the irregularities (noise) in text and in translation mitigate the problem.
    If noise in the data reduces the strength of a direct association, then the same noise will reduce the strengths of any indirect associations that are based on this direct the two halves of the bitext a pair of aligned text segments in (U, V) the unigram frequency of u in U the unigram frequency of v in V the number of times that u and v co-occ
