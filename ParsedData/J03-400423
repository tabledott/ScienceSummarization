ems.9 We have also plotted the results of the supervised systems and the precision and recall achieved by using the most frequent sense (as listed in WordNet).10 In the work reported here, we attempted disambiguation for head nouns and verbs in subject and direct object relationships, and for adjectives and nouns in adjectivenoun relationships.
    For each test instance, we applied subject preferences before direct object preferences, and direct object preferences before adjective&#8211;noun preferences.
    We also propagated sense tags to test instances not in these relationships by applying the one-sense-per-discourse heuristic.
    We did not use the SENSEVAL-2 coarse-grained classification, as this was not available at the time when we were acquiring the selectional preferences.
    We therefore do not include in the following the coarse-grained results; they are just slightly better than the fine-grained results, which seems to be typical of other systems.
    Our latest overall results are shown in Ta
