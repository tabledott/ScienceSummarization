the same token at another location in the string as one single movement error (M).
    This is in addition to the remaining insertions (I') and deletions (D').
    In our example sentence (2), we see that the insertion and deletion of no can be collapsed into one move.
    However, the wrong positions of cost and of phase are not analyzed as two moves, since one takes the place of the other, and these two tokens still result in one deletion, one substitution, and one insertion.5 Thus, the generation string accuracy depenalizes simple moves, but still treats complex moves (involving more than one token) harshly.
    Overall, the scores for the two metrics introduced so far are shown in the first two columns of Table 1.
    While the string-based metrics are very easy to apply, they have the disadvantage that they do not reflect the intuition that all token moves are not equally &amp;quot;bad&amp;quot;.
    Consider the subphrase estimate for phase the second of the sentence in (2).
