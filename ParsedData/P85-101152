  It is worth emphasising that the main point of this exercise wU to show the ~imilarities between He~J Grammars and Tree Adjoining Grammars.
  We have shown how a HG G (using our extended definitions) can be obtained in a systematic fashion from a TAG G. It is our belief that the extension of the definition may not necessar/.
  Yet, this conversion process hould help us understand the similarities between the two formalisms.
