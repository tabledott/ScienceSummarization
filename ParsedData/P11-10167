rds.
    Finally, a review is classified based on the average semantic orientation of the sentimental phrases in the review.
    In contrast, (Pang et al., 2002) treat the sentiment classification of movie reviews simply as a special case of a topic-based text categorization problem and investigate three classification algorithms: Naive Bayes, Maximum Entropy, and Support Vector Machines.
    According to the experimental results, machine learning based classifiers outperform the unsupervised approach, where the best performance is achieved by the SVM classifier with unigram presences as features.
    Besides the above mentioned work for targetindependent sentiment classification, there are also several approaches proposed for target-dependent classification, such as (Nasukawa and Yi, 2003; Hu and Liu, 2004; Ding and Liu, 2007).
    (Nasukawa and Yi, 2003) adopt a rule based approach, where rules are created by humans for adjectives, verbs, nouns, and so on.
    Given a sentiment target and its context, part-
