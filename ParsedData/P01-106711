    To experiment, we trained our model on a small English-Japanese corpus.
    To evaluate performance, we examined alignments produced by the learned model.
    For comparison, we also trained IBM Model 5 on the same corpus.
    We extracted 2121 translation sentence pairs from a Japanese-English dictionary.
    These sentences were mostly short ones.
    The average sentence length was 6.9 for English and 9.7 for Japanese.
    However, many rare words were used, which made the task difficult.
    The vocabulary size was 3463 tokens for English, and 3983 tokens for Japanese, with 2029 tokens for English and 2507 tokens for Japanese occurring only once in the corpus.
    Brill&#8217;s part-of-speech (POS) tagger (Brill, 1995) and Collins&#8217; parser (Collins, 1999) were used to obtain parse trees for the English side of the corpus.
    The output of Collins&#8217; parser was 3Note that the algorithm performs full EM counting, whereas the IBM models only permit
