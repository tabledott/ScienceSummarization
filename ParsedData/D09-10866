ver, could result in invalid trees on the target side, with cycles or disconnected words.
    Instead, our models learn the necessary transformations that align and transform a source tree into a target tree by means of quasisynchronous grammar (QG) features.
    Figure 2 shows an example of bitext helping disambiguation when a parser is trained with only a small number of Chinese trees.
    With the help of the English tree and alignment, the parser is able to recover the correct Chinese dependencies using QG features.
    Incorrect edges from the monolingual parser are shown with dashed lines.
    (The bilingual parser corrects additional errors in the second half of this sentence, which has been removed to improve legibility.)
    The parser is able to recover the long-distance dependency from the first Chinese word (China) to the last (begun), while skipping over the intervening noun phrase that confused the undertrained monolingual parser.
    Although, due to the auxiliary verb, &#8220;China&#8221; and
