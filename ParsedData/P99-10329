ed from a population described by the model).
    Bias of one judge relative to another is evidenced as a discrepancy between the marginal totals for the two judges (i.e., ni+ and n+j in Table 1).
    Bias is measured by testing the fit of the model for marginal homogeneity: = 25+i for all i.
    The larger the G2 value, the greater the bias.
    The fit of the model can be evaluated as described on pages 293-294 of Bishop et al. (1975).
    Judges who show a relative bias do not always agree, but their judgments may still be correlated.
    As an extreme example, judge 1 may assign the subjective tag whenever judge 2 assigns the objective tag.
    In this example, there is a kind of symmetry in the judges' responses, but their agreement would be low.
    Patterns of symmetric disagreement can be identified using the model for quasi-symmetry.
    This model constrains the off-diagonal counts, i.e., the counts that correspond to disagreement.
    It states that these counts are the product of a table for indep
