    AND (y is one of the hypernyms of x) AND AND (z is SYNONYM of y) AND AND (z is SYNONYM of anaphor) then Cast_in_Chain(Anaphor,antecedent) (Riloff and Jones 1999) note that the performance of the mutual bootstrapping algorithm can deteriorate rapidly if erroneous rules are entered.
    To make the algorithm more robust we use the same solution by introducing a second level of bootrapping. outer level, called most reliable based on semantic consistency and discard all the others before restarting the mutual bootstrapping loop again.
    In our experiments we have retained only those rules for which the new performance, given by the F-measure was larger than the median of the past four loops.
    The formula for the van Rijsbergen's F-measure combines precision the recall = 6 Evaluation To measure the performance of COCKTAIL we have trained the system on 30 MUC-6 and MUC-7 texts and tested it on the remaining 30 documents.
    computed the the Fperfo
