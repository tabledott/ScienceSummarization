 NP1 P NP2.
    The problem is cast as a classification task, and the sentence is reduced to a 4-tuple containing the preposition and the non-inflected base forms of the head words of the verb phrase VP and the two noun phrases NP1 and NP2.
    For example, the tuple corresponding to the two above sentences would be: Many approaches to solving this this problem have been proposed, most of them using standard machine learning techniques, including transformationbased learning, decision trees, maximum entropy and backoff estimation.
    The transformation-based learning system was originally developed by Brill and Resnik (1994).
    The data used in the experiment consists of approximately 13,000 quadruples (VP NP1 P NP2) extracted from Penn Treebank parses.
    The set is split into a test set of 500 samples and a training set of 12,500 samples.
    The templates used to generate rules are similar to the ones used by Brill and Resnik (1994) and some include WordNet features.
    All the systems were trained un
