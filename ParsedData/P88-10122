sing this knowledge for the interpretation of discourse.
    In the latter effort, we have concentrated on problems in local pragmatics, specifically, the problems of reference resolution, the interpretation of compound nominals, the resolution of some kinds of syntactic ambiguity, and metonymy resolution.
    Our approach to these problems is the focus of this paper.
    In the framework we have developed, what the interpretation of a sentence is can be described very concisely: 1Charniak (1986) and Norvig (1987) have also applied abductive inference techniques to discourse interpretation.

    By the first line we mean &amp;quot;derive in the logical sense, or prove from the predicate calculus axioms in the knowledge base, the logical form that has been produced by syntactic analysis and semantic translation of the sentence.&amp;qu
