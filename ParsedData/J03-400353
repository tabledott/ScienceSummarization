ch the verb condition is important in differentiating the probability of two structures.
    In both cases an adjunct can attach either high or low, but high attachment results in a dependency&#8217;s crossing a verb and has lower probability.
    An alternative to the surface string feature would be a predicate such as were any of the previous modifiers in X, where X is a set of nonterminals that are likely to contain a verb, such as VP, SBAR, S, or SG.
    This would allow the model to handle cases like the first example in Figure 15 correctly.
    The second example shows why it is preferable to condition on the surface string.
    In this case the verb is &#8220;invisible&#8221; to the top level, as it is generated recursively below the NP object.
    7.2.5 Structural versus Semantic Preferences.
    One hypothesis would be that lexical statistics are really what is important in parsing: that arriving at a correct interpretation for a sentence is simply a matter of finding the most semantically plausible
