er in a rule instantiation in Sections 2&#8211;21 of CCGbank; and second, we applied the Eisner constraints described in Section 3.
    We conclude this section by noting that it is only through the use of the supertagger that we are able to perform the discriminative estimation at all; without it the memory requirements would be prohibitive, even when using the cluster.
    This section gives accuracy figures on the predicate&#8211;argument dependencies in CCGbank.
    Overall results are given, as well as results broken down by relation type, as in Clark, Hockenmaier, and Steedman (2002).
    Because the purpose of this article is to demonstrate the feasibility of wide-coverage parsing with CCG, we do not give an evaluation targeted specifically at long-range dependencies; such an evaluation was presented in Clark, Steedman, and Curran (2004).
    For evaluation purposes, the threshold parameter which limits the size of the charts was set at 1,000,000 individual entries.
    This value was chosen to maximiz
