p;quot; variables).
    The two regressions for understanding and writing show very similar results.
    Normalized understanding was best modeled as: Normalized understanding = 1.4728*simple tree accuracy - 0.1015*substitutions 0.0228 * length - 0.2127.
    This model was significant: F(3,19) = 6.62, p &lt; 0.005.
    The model is plotted in Figure 3. with the data point representing the removed outlier at the top of the diagram.
    This model is also intuitively plausible.
    The simple tree metric was designed to measure the quality of a sentence and it has a positive coefficient.
    A substitution represents a case in the string metrics in which not only a word is in the wrong place, but the word that should have been in that place is somewhere else.
    Therefore, substitutions,..more than moves or insertions or deletions, represent grave cases of word order anomalies.
    Thus, it is plausible to penalize them separately.
    (Note that the simple tree accuracy is bounded by 1, while the number of su
