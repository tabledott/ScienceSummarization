IFT onto a new entity in the next utterance and is signalling this by realizing the current center in a lower ranked position on the Cf (examples follow below).
  If (1) doesnt  hold then we are in one of the SHIFT states depending on whether or not (2) holds.
  This definition of transition states is summar ized in Figure 1 (Brennan, Friedman, and Pollard 1987).
  We will use the notation of Cb(Ui-1) = [?]
  for cases where there is no Cb(Ui-1).
  Section 4 will discuss center instantiation.
  The combination of the constraints, rules, and transition states makes a set of testable predictions about which interpretations hearers will prefer because they re- quire less processing.
  For example, maximal ly coherent segments are those that require less processing time.
  A sequence of a CONTINUE followed by another CONTINUE should only require the hearer to keep track of one main discourse entity, which is currently both the Cb and the Cp.
  A single pronoun in an utterance is the current Cb (by Rule 1) and can
