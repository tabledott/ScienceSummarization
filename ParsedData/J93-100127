to Chomsky's introduction of the competence approximation (Chomsky 1957, pp.
    15-17).
    Recall that Chomsky was concerned that approximations, such as Shannon's n-gram approximation, which was very much in vogue at the time, were inappropriate for his needs, and therefore, he introduced an alternative with complementary strengths and weaknesses.
    The competence approximation is more appropriate for modeling long-distance dependences such as agreement constraints and wh-movement, but at the cost of missing certain crucial local constraints, especially the kinds of preferences that are extremely important for part-of-speech tagging.
    2.3 Using Statistics to Fit Probabilistic Models to Data Probabilistic models provide a theoretical abstraction of language, very much like Chomsky's competence model.
    They are designed to capture the more important aspects of language and ignore the less important aspects, where what counts as important depends on the application.
    Statistics are often used to es
