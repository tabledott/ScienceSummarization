    From a machine-readable version of the dictionary, we extracted a list of 1535 nouns associated with a particular preposition, and of 1193 verbs associated with a particular preposition after an object noun phrase.
    These 2728 associations are many fewer than the number of associations found in the AP sample.
    (see Table 5.)
    Of course, most of the preposition association pairs from the AP sample end up being nonsignificant; of the 88,860 pairs, fewer than half (40,869) occur with a frequency greater than 1, and only 8337 have a t-score greater than 1.65.
    So our sample gives about three times as many significant preposition associations as the COBUILD dictionary.
    Note however, as Table 5 shows, the overlap is remarkably good, considering the large space of possible bigrams.
    (In our bigram table there are over 20,000 nouns, over 5000 verbs, and over 90 prepositions.)
    On the other hand, the lack of overlap for so many cases &#8212; assuming that the dictionary and the significan
