a coreference resolver can produce substantially different results when applied to the resulting three sets of NPs, with gold NPs yielding the best results and NPs extracted from a parser yielding the worst (Nicolae and Nicolae, 2006).
    While researchers who evaluate their resolvers on gold NPs point out that the results can more accurately reflect the performance of their coreference algorithm, Stoyanov et al. (2009) argue that such evaluations are unrealistic, as NP extraction is an integral part of an end-to-end fully-automatic resolver.
    Whichever NP extraction method is employed, it is clear that the use of gold NPs can considerably simplify the coreference task, and hence resolvers employing different extraction methods should not be compared against each other.
    The MUC scorer (Vilain et al., 1995) is the first program developed for scoring coreference partitions.
    It has two often-cited weaknesses.
    As a linkbased measure, it does not reward correctly identified singleton clusters since
