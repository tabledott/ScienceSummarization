me- ters ?i, j for each rule Ai ?
  j in the corresponding con- text free grammar.3 In our application, the nonterminals in the PCFG Ai are rules of the HPSG grammar used to build the parses (such as HEAD-COMPL or HEAD-ADJ).
  We set the parameters to maximize the likelihood of the set of derivation trees for the preferred parses of the sen- tences in a training set.
  As noted above, estimating prob- abilities from local tree counts in the treebank does not provide a maximum likelihood estimate of the observed data, as the grammar rules further constrain the possible derivations.
  Essentially, we are making an assumption of context-freeness of rule application that does not hold in the case of the HPSG grammar.
  Nonetheless, we can still build the model and use it to rank parses.

  As previously noted by other researchers (Charniak &amp; Caroll, 1994), extending a PCFG with grandparent an- notation improves the accurac
