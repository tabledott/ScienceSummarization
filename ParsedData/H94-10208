analyses must be unified.
  In the original annotation scheme, adjective phrases that serve as sentential predicates have a different structure than VPs, causing sentential adverbs which occur after auxiliaries introducing the ADJP to attach under VP, while sentential dverbs occurring after auxiliaries introduc- ing VPs occur under S. In the current reebank, copular be is treated as a main verb, with predicate adjective or prepo- sitional phrases treated as complements to that verb.
  In the new stylebook, the predicate is either the lowest (right- most branching) VP or the phrasal structure immediately under copular BE.
  In cases when the predicate cannot be identified by those criteria (e.g.
  in "small clauses" and some inversion structures), the predicate phrase is tagged -PRD (PReDicate).
  (s (NP-SBJ I) (VP consider (S (I~P-SBJ Kris) (NP-PRD a fool)))) (SQ Was (NP-SBJ he) (ADVP-TMP ever) (ADJP-PRD successfu l ) ?)
  Note that the surface subject is always tagged -SBJ (SuB- Ject), even though this is us
