 lexicons contributed to the model identifying these low frequency terms more accurately.
    Also of note is that, in both experiments, the CRF framework achieves somewhat comparable performance across all entities.
    In a previous attempt to use a Hidden Markov Model to simultaneously recognize multiple biomedical entities (Collier et al., 2000), HMM performance for a particular entity seemed more or less proportional to its frequency in the data.
    The advantage of the CRF here may be due to the fact that HMMs are generative models trained to learn the joint probability P(o, l) &#8212; where data for l may be sparse &#8212; and use Bayes rule to predict the best label.
    CRFs are discriminative models trained to maximize P(l|o) directly.
  
  
    In short, I have presented in detail a framework for recognizing multiple entity classes in biomedical abstracts with Conditional Random Fields.
    I have shown that a CRF-based model with only simple orthographic features can achieve performance near the
