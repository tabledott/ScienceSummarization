ed the ACE 2002 corpus, including 422 documents, which is known to have many inconsistencies than the 2003 version.
    Culotta and Sorensen (2004) used a generic ACE corpus including about 800 documents (no corpus version is specified).
    Since the testing corpora are in different sizes and versions, strictly speaking, it is not ready to compare these methods exactly and fairly.
    Therefore Table 3 is only for reference purpose.
    We just hope that we can get a few clues from this table. not restricted by the two constraints of the two dependency kernels (identical layer and ancestors for the matchable nodes and identical length of two shortest paths, as discussed in Section 2).
    The above experiments verify the effectiveness of our composite kernels for relation extraction.
    They suggest that the parse tree kernel can effectively explore the syntactic features which are critical for relation extraction. both the 2003 and 2004 data for the composite kernel by polynomial expansion (4) Error Analys
