er, these methods do not enable distinguishing between events with the same frequency, such as the ash-cigarette and ash-room example given in footnote 15.
    Church and Gale (1991) have proposed a means to improve methods for the estimation of bigrams, which could be extended to co-occurrences: they take into account the frequency of the individual words that compose the bigram and make the hypothesis that each word appears independently of the others.
    However, this hypothesis contradicts hypotheses of disambiguation based on co-occurrence, which rightly assume that some associations are more probable than others.
    Class-based models attempt to obtain the best estimates by combining observations of classes of words considered to belong to a common category.
    Brown et al. (1992), Pereira and Tishby (1992), and Pereira, Tishby, and Lee (1993) propose methods that derive classes from the distributional properties of the corpus itself, while other authors use external information sources to define cla
