e form adjective:noun::adjective:noun, such as Christian:church::Muslim:mosque.
    A measure of relational similarity is applicable to this task.
    Given a pair of words, A and B, the task is to return another pair of words, X and Y, such that there is high relational similarity between the pair A:X and the pair Y:B.
    For example, given A = Muslim and B = church, return X = mosque and Y = Christian.
    (The pair Muslim:mosque has a high relational similarity to the pair Christian:church.)
    Marx et al. (2002) developed an unsupervised algorithm for discovering analogies by clustering words from two different corpora.
    Each cluster of words in one corpus is coupled one-to-one with a cluster in the other corpus.
    For example, one experiment used a corpus of Buddhist documents and a corpus of Christian documents.
    A cluster of words such as {Hindu, Mahayana, Zen, ...} from the Buddhist corpus was coupled with a cluster of words such as {Catholic, Protestant, ...} from the Christian corpus.
