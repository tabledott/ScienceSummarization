    Among manual resources used for this task are WordNet (Fellbaum 1998) and Cyc (Lenat 1995).
    Although important and useful, these resources primarily contain prescriptive inference rules such as &#8220;X divorces Y &#8658; X married Y&#8221;.
    In practical NLP applications, however, plausible inference rules such as &#8220;X married Y&#8221; &#8658; &#8220;X dated Y&#8221; are very useful.
    This, along with the difficulty and labor-intensiveness of generating exhaustive lists of rules, has led researchers to focus on automatic methods for building inference resources such as inference rule collections (Lin and Pantel 2001; Szpektor et al. 2004) and paraphrase collections (Barzilay and McKeown 2001).
    Using these resources in applications has been hindered by the large amount of incorrect inferences they generate, either because of altogether incorrect rules or because of blind application of plausible rules without considering the context of the relations or the senses of the words.
