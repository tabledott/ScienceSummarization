 In other work, Yarowsky (1993) has shown that local collocational information, including selectional constraints, can be used to great effect in sense disambiguation, though his algorithm requires supervised training.
    The present work can be viewed as an attempt to take advantage of the same kind of information, but in an unsupervised setting.
  
  
    Although the definition of selectional preference strength is motivated by the use of relative entropy in information theory, selectional association is not; the approach would benefit from experimentation with alternative statistical association measures, particularly a comparison with simple mutual information and with the likelihood ratio.
    Combining information about selectional preference could also be helpful, e.g., where a noun is both the object of a verb and modified by an adjective, though such cases are rarer than one might expect.
    More important is information beyond selectional preference, notably the wider context utilized by Yarowsky
