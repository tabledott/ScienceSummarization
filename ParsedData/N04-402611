eutral orientation , and only two components, the block unigram model and the block bigram score are used.
    Experimental results are reported in Table 1: three BLEU results are presented for both devtest set and blind test set.
    Two scaling parameters are set on the devtest set and copied for use on the blind test set.
    The second column shows the model name, the third column presents the optimal weighting as obtained from the devtest set by carrying out an exhaustive grid search.
    The fourth column shows BLEU results together with confidence intervals (Here, the word casing is ignored).
    The block swapping model obtains a statistical significant improvement over the baseline model.
    Interestingly, the swapping model without orientation performs worse than the baseline model: the word-based trigram language model alone is too weak to control the block swapping: the model is too unrestrictive to handle the block swapping reliably.
    Additionally, Table 2 presents devtest set example blocks
