synonyms and paraphrases.
    For example, we can use an existing thesaurus such as WordNet (Miller 1990) or creating a customized one by applying automated synonym set discovery methods (Pantel and Lin 2002) to identify potential synonyms.
    Paraphrases can also be automatically acquired using statistical methods as shown by Barzilay and Lee (2003).
    Once we have acquired synonym and paraphrase data, we then need to design a soft matching function that assigns partial credits to these approximate matches.
    In this scenario, statistically generated data has the advantage of being able to provide scores reflecting the strength of similarity between synonyms and paraphrased.
    ROUGE-L, ROUGE-W, and ROUGE-S have also been applied in automatic evaluation of summarization and achieved very promising results (Lin 2004).
    In Lin and Och (2004), we proposed a framework that automatically evaluated automatic MT evaluation metrics using only manual translations without further human involvement.
