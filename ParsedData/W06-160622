xample, when comparing the phrasebased baseline against the combined system, the improvement in human scores was significant at P = 4.04e&#8722;6(t = 4.67, df = 413).
    The results also show that the LDC reference translations are far from being perfect.
    Although we selected from the four references the second best according to the Bleu metric, this human reference was judged to be at a quality level of only 4.67 on a scale from 1 to 5.
    Most of the translation errors were iuency errors.
    Although the human outputs had most of the time the right meaning, the syntax was sometimes incorrect.
    In order to give readers a iavor of the types of re-orderings enabled by the SPMT models, we present in Table 3, several translation outputs produced by the phrase-based baseline and the combined SPMT system.
    The outputs were selected to reflect both positive and negative effects of largescale re-orderings.
  
  
    The SPMT models are similar to the models proposed by Chiang (2005) and Galley et al. (2
