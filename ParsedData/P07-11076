ndom variables Z to refer to (indices of) entities.
    We will use 0z to denote the parameters for an entity z, and 0 to refer to the concatenation of all such 0z.
    X will refer somewhat loosely to the collection of variables associated with a mention in our model (such as the head or gender).
    We will be explicit about X and 0z shortly.
    Our goal will be to find the setting of the entity indices which maximize the posterior probability: where Z, X, and 0 denote all the entity indices, observed values, and parameters of the model.
    Note that we take a Bayesian approach in which all parameters are integrated out (or sampled).
    The inference task is thus primarily a search problem over the index labels Z.
