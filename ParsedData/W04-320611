ific setting, so that entailment would hold between its different occurrences.
    On the other hand, it should be sufficiently frequent to appear with different entailing templates.
    Finding good anchor sets based on just the input pivot is a hard task.
    Most methods identify good repeated anchors &#8220;in retrospect&#8221;, that is after processing a full corpus, while previous Web-based methods require at least one good anchor set as input.
    Given our minimal input, we needed refined criteria that identify a priori the relatively few promising anchor sets within a sample of pivot occurrences.
    The ASE algorithm (presented in Figure 1) performs 4 main steps.
    STEP (1) creates a complete template, called the pivot template and denoted Tp, for the input pivot, denoted P. Variable slots are added for the major types of syntactic relations that interact with P, based on its syntactic type.
    These slots enable us to later match Tp with other templates.
    For verbs, we add slots for a subject
