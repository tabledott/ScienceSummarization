, which counts the number of tail nodes in e. The arity of a hypergraph is the maximum arity over all hyperedges.
    A CKY forest has an arity of 2, since the input grammar is required to be binary branching (cf.
    Chomsky Normal Form) to ensure cubic time parsing complexity.
    However, in this work, we use forests from a Treebank parser (Charniak, 2000) whose grammar is often flat in many productions.
    For example, the arity of the forest in Figure 1 is 3.
    Such a Treebank-style forest is easier to work with for reranking, since many features can be directly expressed in it.
    There is also a distinguished root node TOP in each forest, denoting the goal item in parsing, which is simply S0,l where S is the start symbol and l is the sentence length.
  
  
    We first establish a unified framework for parse reranking with both n-best lists and packed forests.
    For a given sentence s, a generic reranker selects the best parse y&#65533; among the set of candidates cand(s) according to some scorin
