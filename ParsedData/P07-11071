rence is canonically, though of course not always, accomplished with pronouns, and is governed by linguistic and cognitive constraints.
    In this paper, we present a nonparametric generative model of a document corpus which naturally connects these two processes.
    Most recent coreference resolution work has focused on the task of deciding which mentions (noun phrases) in a document are coreferent.
    The dominant approach is to decompose the task into a collection of pairwise coreference decisions.
    One then applies discriminative learning methods to pairs of mentions, using features which encode properties such as distance, syntactic environment, and so on (Soon et al., 2001; Ng and Cardie, 2002).
    Although such approaches have been successful, they have several liabilities.
    First, rich features require plentiful labeled data, which we do not have for coreference tasks in most domains and languages.
    Second, coreference is inherently a clustering or partitioning task.
