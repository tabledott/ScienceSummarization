 for the Automatic Labeling of Semantic Roles.
    We considered 18 of the most frequent roles and we mapped together those having the same name.
    Only verbs are selected to be predicates in our evaluations.
    Moreover, as it does not exist a fixed split between training and testing, we selected randomly 30% of sentences for testing and 70% for training.
    Additionally, 30% of training was used as a validation-set.
    The sentences were processed using Collins&#8217; parser (Collins, 1997) to generate parse-trees automatically.
    The classifier evaluations were carried out using the SVM-light software (Joachims, 1999) available at svmlight.joachims.org with the default polynomial kernel for standard feature evaluations.
    To process PAF and SCF, we implemented our own kernels and we used them inside SVM-light.
    The classification performances were evaluated using the f1 measure7 for single arguments and the accuracy for the final multi-class classifier.
    This latter choice allows us to compa
