tence.
    However, the extended algorithm performs better when bracketing information is provided, because it does not need to consider all possible spans for constituents, but only those compatible with the training set bracketing.
    In the limit, when the bracketing of each training sentence comes from a complete binary-branching analysis of the sentence (a full binary bracketing), the time of each step reduces to 0(1w1).
    This can be seen from the following three facts about any full binary bracketing B of a string w: Thus, in equation (2) for instance, the number of spans (i, k) for which e(i,k) 0 0 is O(Icl), and there is a single j between i and k for which e(i, j) 0 0 and&amp;quot;d(j, k) 0 0.
    Therefore, the total time to compute all the k) is 0(1c1).
    A similar argument applies to equations (4) and (5).
    Note that to achieve the above bound as well as to take advantage of whatever bracketing is available to improve performance, the implementation must preprocess the training set approp
