ible word order choices.
    However, in our experiments we show that the language model is not reliable enough to make the choices that lead to a better MT quality.
    This observation is also reported by (Xia and McCord, 2004).We argue that the distortion model we propose leads to a better translation as measured by BLEU.
    Distortion models were first proposed by (Brown et al., 1993) in the so-called IBM Models.
    IBM Models 2 and 3 define the distortion parameters in terms of the word positions in the sentence pair, not the actual words at those positions.
    Distortion probability is also conditioned on the source and target sentence lengths.
    These models do not generalize well since their parameters are tied to absolute word position within sentences which tend to be different for the same words across sentences.
    IBM Models 4 and 5 alleviate this limitation by replacing absolute word positions with relative positions.
    The latter models define the distortion parameters for a cept (one o
