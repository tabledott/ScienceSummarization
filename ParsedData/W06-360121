re doing larger-scale experiments.
    We are also investigating more principled algorithms for integrating n-gram language models during the search, rather than k-best rescoring.
    Besides, we will extend this work to translating the top k parse trees, instead of committing to the 1-best tree, as parsing errors certainly affect translation quality.
