;&amp;quot; (e.g., &amp;quot;the 12 men&amp;quot;) have an antecedent, so we classified them as referential.
    Also, if the head noun of the NP appeared earlier in the text, we classified the NP as referential.
    This method, then, consists of two groups of syntactic heuristics.
    The first group, which we refer to as the rule-in heuristics, contains seven heuristics that identify restrictive premodification or postmodification, thus targeting existential NPs.
    The second group, referred to as the rule-out heuristics, contains two heuristics that identify referential NPs.
    Most referential NPs have antecedents that precede them in the text.
    This observation is the basis of our first method for identifying semantically independent NPs.
    If a definite NP occurs in the first sentence4 of a text, we assume the NP is existential.
    Using a training corpus, we create a list of presumably existential NPs by collecting the first sentence of every text and extracting all definite NPs that were not
