r accuracy- vs. error-based metrics correctly, counts of concordant vs. discordant pairs were calculated specific to these two metric types.
    The possible values of T range between 1 (where all pairs are concordant) and &#8722;1 (where all pairs are discordant).
    Thus an automatic evaluation metric with a higher value for T is making predictions that are more similar to the human judgments than an automatic evaluation metric with a lower T. We did not include cases where the human ranking was tied for two systems.
    As the metrics produce absolute scores, compared to five relative ranks in the human assessment, it would be potentially unfair to the metric to count a slightly different metric score as discordant with a tie in the relative human rankings.
    A tie in automatic metric rank for two translations was counted as discordant with two corresponding non-tied human judgments.
    The correlations are shown in Table 9 for translations into English, and Table 10 out of English, sorted by average c
