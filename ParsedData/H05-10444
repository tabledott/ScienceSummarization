nning with a large stable of clues marked with prior polarity, we identify the contextual polarity of the phrases that contain instances of those clues in the corpus.
			We use a two-step process that employs machine learning and a variety of features.
			The first step classifies each phrase containing a clue as neutral or polar.
			The second step takes all phrases marked in step one as polar and disambiguates theircontextual polarity (positive, negative, both, or neutral).
			With this approach, the system is able to auto matically identify the contextual polarity for a large subset of sentiment expressions, achieving resultsthat are significantly better than baseline.
			In addition, we describe new manual annotations of contextual polarity and a successful inter-annotator agree ment study.
