rs in Garside, Leech, and Sampson 1987).
    However, the development of wide-coverage declarative and computationally tractable grammars makes this assumption questionable.
    For example, the ANLT word and sentence grammar (Grover et al. 1989; Carroll and Grover 1989) consists of an English lexicon of approximately 40,000 lexemes and a 'compiled' fixed-arity term unification grammar containing around 700 phrase structure rules.
    Taylor, Grover, and Briscoe (1989) demonstrate that an earlier version of this grammar was capable of assigning the correct analysis to 96.8% of a corpus of 10,000 noun phrases extracted (without regard for their internal form) from a variety of corpora.
    However, although Taylor, Grover, and Briscoe show that the ANLT grammar has very wide coverage, they abstract away from issues of lexical idiosyncrasy by formimg equivalence classes of noun phrases and parsing a single token of each class, and they do not address the issues of 1) tuning a grammar to a particular corpus or s
