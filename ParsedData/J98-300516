    The DARPA message understanding systems (MUC 1992), which process news articles in specific domains to extract specified types of information, also fall within this category.
    As output, work of this type produces templates that identify important pieces of information in the text, representing them as attribute-value pairs that could be part of a database entry.
    The message understanding systems, in particular, have been developed over a long period, have undergone repeated evaluation and development, including moves to new domains, and as a result, are quite robust.
    They are impressive in their ability to handle large quantities of free-form text as input.
    As stand-alone systems, however, they do not address the task of summarization since they do not combine and rephrase extracted information as part of a textual summary.
    A recent approach to symbolic summarization is being carried out at Cambridge University on identifying strategies for summarization (Sparck J
