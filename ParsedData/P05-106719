    In comparison, we deployed the GIZA++ MT modeling tool kit, which is an implementation of the IBM Models 1 to 4 (Brown et al., 1993; AlOnaizan et al., 1999; Och and Ney, 2003).
    The IBM models were trained on the same training data as our system.
    We used the ISI Rewrite decoder (Germann et al. 2001) to decode the IBM models.
    The results are shown in Figure 9.
    The score types &#8220;I&#8221; and &#8220;C&#8221; stand for individual and cumulative n-gram scores.
    The final NIST and Bleu scores are marked with bold fonts.
    The evaluation results show that the NIST score achieved a 97.3% increase, while the Bleu score increased by 21.1%.
    In terms of decoding speed, the Rewrite decoder took 8102 seconds to decode the test sentences on a Xeon 1.2GHz 2GB memory machine.
    On the same machine, the SDIG decoder took 3 seconds to decode, excluding the parsing time.
    The recent advances in parsing have achieved parsers with 3 O(n ) time complexity without the grammar constant (McDon
