of (Riloff and Wiebe, 2003) to assign an S, O, or B label to all the training and test examples pertaining to these ambiguous words.
    This subjectivity annotation tool targets sentences, rather than words or paragraphs, and therefore the tool is fed with sentences.
    We also include a surrounding context of two additional sentences, because the classifier considers some contextual information.
    Our hypothesis motivating the use of a sentence-level subjectivity classifier is that instances of subjective senses are more likely to be in subjective sentences, and thus that sentence subjectivity is an informative feature for the disambiguation of words having both subjective and objective senses.
    For each ambiguous word, we perform two separate runs: one using the basic disambiguation system described earlier, and another using the subjectivity-aware system that includes the additional subjectivity feature.
    Table 3 shows the results obtained for these 20 nouns, including word sense disambiguation a
