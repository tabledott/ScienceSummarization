 only slightly superior to the 65.3% accuracy of Hobbs at finding correct referents.
    It might have been hoped that the statistics would make things considerably more accurate.
    In fact, the statistics do make things considerably more accurate.
    Figure 2 shows average accuracy as a function of number of references for a given referent.
    It can be seen that there is a significant improvement with increased referent count.
    The reason that the average over all referents is so low is that the counts on referents obey Zipf's law, so that the mode -Of the distribution on counts is one.
    Thus the 70.3% overall accuracy is a mix of relatively high accuracy for referents with counts greater than one, and relatively low accuracy for referents with counts of exactly one.
  
  
    The literature on pronoun anaphora is too extensive to summarize, so we concentrate here on corpus-based anaphora research.
    Aone and Bennett (1996) present an approach to an automatically trainable anaphora resolution sy
