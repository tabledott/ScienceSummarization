 capture ending-guessing rules if the /-class is set to be &amp;quot;void.&amp;quot; This indicates that no stem lookup is required.
    Naturally, the mutative segment of such rules is always set to an empty string.
    For example, an endingguessing rule e[&#8211;ing +&amp;quot; ?&#8212; &#8211;(JJ NN VBG)} says that if a word ends with ing it can be an adjective, a noun, or a gerund.
    Unlike a morphological rule, this rule does not check whether the substring preceding the ing-ending is listed in the lexicon with a particular Pos-class.
    The proposed guessing-rule schemata is in fact quite similar to the set of generic transformations for unknown-word guessing developed by Brill (1995).
    There are, however, three major differences: Brill's system has two transformations that our schemata do not capture: when a particular character appears in a word and when a word appears in a particular context.
    The latter transformation is, in fact, due to the peculiarities of Brill's tagging algorithm and,
