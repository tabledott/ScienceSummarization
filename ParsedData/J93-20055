similar to Zernik's (1989) work on extracting verb semantics from corpora using lexical categories.
    Our research, however, differs in two respects: first, we employ a more expressive lexical semantics; second, our focus is on all major categories in the language, and not just verbs.
    This is important since for full-text information retrieval, information about nominals is paramount, as most queries tend to be expressed as conjunctions of nouns.
    From a theoretical perspective, we believe that the contribution of the lexical semantics of nominals to the overall structure of the lexicon has been somewhat neglected, relative to that of verbs.
    While Zernik (1989) presents ambiguity and metonymy as a potential obstacle to effective corpus analysis, we believe that the existence of motivated metonymic structures actually provides valuable clues for semantic analysis of nouns in a corpus.
    We will assume, for this paper, the general framework of a generative lexicon as outlined in Pustejovsky (1991
