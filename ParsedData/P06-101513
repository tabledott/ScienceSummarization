 instances are r&#953;(i) = 1.
    The pointwise mutual information between instance i = {x, y} and pattern p is estimated using the following formula: where |x, p, y |is the frequency of pattern p instantiated with terms x and y and where the asterisk (*) represents a wildcard.
    A well-known problem is that pointwise mutual information is biased towards infrequent events.
    We thus multiply pmi(i, p) with the discounting factor suggested in (Pantel and Ravichandran 2004).
    Estimating the reliability of an instance is similar to estimating the reliability of a pattern.
    Intuitively, a reliable instance is one that is highly associated with as many reliable patterns as possible (i.e., we have more confidence in an instance when multiple reliable patterns instantiate it.)
    Hence, analogous to our pattern reliability measure, we define the reliability of an instance i, r&#953;(i), as: where r&#960;(p) is the reliability of pattern p (defined earlier) and maxpmi is as before.
    Note that r&#953;(i
