s a distribution over topics for each relation while simultaneously grouping related words into these topics.
    This approach is capable of producing human interpretable classes, however, avoids the drawbacks of traditional class-based approaches (poor lexical coverage and ambiguity).
    LDA-SP achieves state-of-the-art performance on predictive tasks such as pseudo-disambiguation, and filtering incorrect inferences.
    Because LDA-SP generates a complete probabilistic model for our relation data, its results are easily applicable to many other tasks such as identifying similar relations, ranking inference rules, etc.
    In the future, we wish to apply our model to automatically discover new inference rules and paraphrases.
    Finally, our repository of selectional preferences for 10,000 relations is available at http://www.cs.washington.edu/ research/ldasp.
