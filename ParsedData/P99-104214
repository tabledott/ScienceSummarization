so created a filtering module that ranks sentences higher if they contain the appropriate class identifier, even though they may have fewer matching words, e.g., if the bag representation of a sentence does not contain :PERSON, it is ranked lower as an answer to a who question than sentences which do contain :PERSON.
    Finally, the system contains an extension which substitutes the referent of personal pronouns for the pronoun in the bag representation.
    For example, if the system were to choose the sentence He gave books to the library, the answer returned and scored would be Thomas Jefferson gave books to the library, if He were resolved to Thomas Jefferson.
    The current system uses a very simplistic pronoun resolution system which
  
  
    Our modular architecture and automated scoring metrics have allowed us to explore the effect of various linguistic sources of information on overall system performance.
    We report here on three sets of findings: the value added from the various linguistic mod
