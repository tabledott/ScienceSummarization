lections for a variety of specific subject domains (GE, ID, BB an BI) and a task (EPI) whose scope is not defined through a domain but rather event types.
    In terms of the target event types, ID targets a superset of GE events and EPI extends on the representation for PHOSPHORYLATION events of GE.
    The two bacteria track tasks represent an independent perspective relatively far from other tasks in terms of their target information.
  
  
    BioNLP-ST 2011 includes three supporting tasks designed to assist in primary the extraction tasks.
    Other supporting resources made available to participants are presented in (Stenetorp et al., 2011).
    The CO task (Nguyen et al., 2011) concerns the recognition of coreferences to protein references.
    It is motivated from a finding from BioNLP-ST 2009 result analysis: coreference structures in biomedical text hinder the extraction results of fine-grained IE systems.
    While finding connections between event triggers and protein references is a major part of
