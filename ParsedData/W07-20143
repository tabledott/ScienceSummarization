fied by TIMEX3; (3) all events as specifiedin TimeML; (4) selected instances of temporal re lations, as relevant to the given task.
			For tasks A and B a restricted set of event terms were identified ? those whose stems occurred twenty times or more in TimeBank.
			This set is referred to as the Event Target List or ETL.TASK A This task addresses only the temporal re lations holding between time and event expressions that occur within the same sentence.
			Furthermore only event expressions that occur within the ETL areconsidered.
			In the training and test data, TLINK an notations for these temporal relations are provided, the difference being that in the test data the relation type is withheld.
			The task is to supply this label.
			TASK B This task addresses only the temporal relations holding between the Document Creation Time (DCT) and event expressions.
			Again onlyevent expressions that occur within the ETL are con sidered.
			As in Task A, TLINK annotations for these temporal relations are provide
