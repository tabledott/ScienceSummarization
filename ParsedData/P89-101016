 of how much set and off attract each other is to compare the probability with what actually happens... Set off occurs nearly 70 times in the 7.3 million word corpus [P(x,y).0701(7.3 106) &gt;&gt; P(x) P(y)].
    That is enough to show its main patterning and it suggests that in currently-held corpora there will be found sufficient evidence for the descliption of a substantial collection of phrases... [Sinclair (1987)e. pp.
    151-152] It happens that set ... off was found 177 times in the 1987 AP Corpus of approximately 15 million words, about the same number of occurrences per million as Sinclair found in his (mainly British) corpus.
    Quantitatively, 1( set ,o ff ) = 5.9982, indicating that the probability of set ... off is almost 64 times greater than chance.
    This association is relatively strong; the other particles that Sinclair mentions have association ratios of: about (1.4), in (2.9), up (6.9), out (4.5), on (3.3)in the 1987 AP Corpus.
    As Sinclair suggests, the approach is well suited for
