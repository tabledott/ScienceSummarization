onreferring NPs can enter anaphoric relations.
    (For example, the NP a solution is the (bound) anaphoric antecedent to it in (1b).)
    But if they do not refer, the coreference relation as defined in Section 1 (which presupposes that Referent(cli) and Referent(a2) are defined) is not applicable to them.
    Even so, the MUC TD asks annotators to treat them as if it was applicable.
    It acknowledges (page 10) that &amp;quot;one may argue that [a bound anaphor and its antecedent] are not coreferential in the usual sense,&amp;quot; but falls short of explaining explicitly what types of anaphora are to be annotated and how (Hirschman and Chinchor 1997).2 The annotation of bound anaphora merits some further elaboration.
    Consider, for example, quantifying NPs such as Every TV network (or, even more problematic, Most computational linguists [Hirschman and Chinchor 19971, see also Section 3).
    If Every TV network refers at all, then presumably it refers to the set of all TV networks (relevant to a certai
