n F makes on the training set.
    The ranking error rate is the number of times a lower-scoring parse is (incorrectly) ranked above the best parse: where again, gp&#196; is one if p is true, zero otherwise.
    In the ranking problem we define the margin for each example xi,j such that i = 1,. .
    .
    , n, j = 2,. .
    .
    , ni, as Thus Mij(&#175;a) is the difference in ranking score between the correct parse of a sentence and a competing parse xi,j.
    It follows that The ranking error is zero if all margins are positive.
    The loss functions we discuss all turn out to be direct functions of the margins on training examples.
    4.2.2 Log-Likelihood.
    The first loss function is that suggested by Markov random fields.
    As suggested by Ratnaparkhi, Roukos, and Ward (1994) and Johnson et al. (1999), the conditional probability of xi,q being the correct parse for the ith sentence is defined as Hence once the parameters are trained, the ranking function is used to order candidate trees for test e
