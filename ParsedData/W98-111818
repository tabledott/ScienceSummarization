the classes we want included in our model are put into a &amp;quot;feature pool&amp;quot;.
    For instance, if we want lexical features in our model which activate on a range of token_2 . token2, our vocabulary has a size of V, and we have 29 futures, we will add (5.
    (V +1) &#8226; 29) lexical features to the pool.
    The V + 1 term comes from the fact that we include all words in the vocabulary plus the unknown word.
    From this pool, we then select all features which fire at least three times on the training corpus.
    Note that this algorithm is entirely free of human intervention.
    Once the modeler has selected the classes of features, MENE will both select all the relevant features and train the features to have the proper weightings.
    We deviate from this basic algorithm in three ways: 1.
    We exclude features which activate on some sort of &amp;quot;default&amp;quot; value of a history view.
    Many history views have some sort of default value which they display for the vast majority
