antecedent binder for a lexical anaphor (i.e., reciprocal or reflexive pronoun) A iff N and A do not have incompatible agreement features, and one of the following five conditions holds.
    2.1.4 Salience Weighting.
    Salience weighting is accomplished using salience factors.
    A given salience factor is associated with one or more discourse referents.
    These discourse referents are said to be in the factor's scope.
    A weight is associated with each factor, reflecting its relative contribution to the total salience of individual discourse referents.
    Initial weights are degraded in the course of processing.
    The use of salience factors in our algorithm is based on Alshawi's (1987) context mechanism.
    Other than sentence recency, the factors used in RAP differ from Alshawi's and are more specific to the task of pronominal anaphora resolution.
    Alshawi's framework is designed to deal with a broad class of language interpretation problems, including reference resolution, word sense disambi
