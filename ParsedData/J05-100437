 approximately one-third of the treebank and served as the initial focus of annotation.
  The treebank as a whole contains 3,185 unique verb lemmas, while the financial subcorpus contains 1,826.
  These verbs are arrayed in a classic Zipfian distribution, with a few verbs occurring very often (say, for example, is the most common verb, with over 10,000 instances in its various inflectional forms) and most verbs occurring two or fewer times.
  As with the distribution of the lexical items themselves, the framesets also display a Zipfian distribution: A small number of verbs have many framesets ( go has 20 when including phrasal variants, and come, get, make, pass, take, and turn each have more than a dozen) while the majority of verbs (2581/3342) have only one frameset.
  For polysemous verbs annotators had to determine which frameset was appropriate for a given usage in order to assign the correct argument structure, although this information was explicitly marked only during a separate pass.
