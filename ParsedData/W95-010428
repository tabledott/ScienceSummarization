, decision lists score only 0.659, compared with 0.759 for context words and 0.730 for collocations.7 We believe that the problem lies in the strength metric: because decision lists make their judgements based on a single piece of evidence, their performance is very sensitive to the metric used to select that piece of evidence.
    But as the reliability and U(x ly) metrics indicate, it is not completely clear how the metric should be defined.
    This problem is addressed in the next section.
    The previous section confirmed that decision lists are effective at combining two complementary methods &#8212; context words and collocations.
    In doing the combination, however, decision lists look only at the single strongest piece of evidence for a given problem.
    We hypothesize that even better performance can be obtained by taking into account all available evidence.
    This section presents a method of doing this based on Bayesian classifiers.
    Like decision lists, the Bayesian method starts with a
