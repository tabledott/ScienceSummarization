    To exploit richer data sets, we will also seek to address the monotone limitation of our decoder that further limits the complexity of our paraphrase output.
    We will be experimenting with more sophisticated decoder models designed to handle reordering and mappings to discontinuous elements.
    We also plan to pursue better (automated) metrics for paraphrase evaluation.
  
  
    We presented a novel approach to the problem of generating sentence-level paraphrases in a broad semantic domain.
    We accomplished this by using methods from the field of SMT, which is oriented toward learning and generating exactly the sorts of alternations encountered in monolingual paraphrase.
    We showed that this approach can be used to generate paraphrases that are preferred by humans to sentence-level paraphrases produced by other techniques.
    While the alternations our system produces are currently limited in character, the field of SMT offers a host of possible enhancements&#8212;inc
