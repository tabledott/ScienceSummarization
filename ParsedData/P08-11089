tations.
    MSTParser favors the former at the expense of the latter and MaltParser the opposite.
    This difference was highlighted in the study of McDonald and Nivre (2007), which showed that the difference is reflected directly in the error distributions of the parsers.
    Thus, MaltParser is less accurate than MSTParser for long dependencies and those closer to the root of the graph, but more accurate for short dependencies and those farthest away from the root.
    Furthermore, MaltParser is more accurate for dependents that are nouns and pronouns, whereas MSTParser is more accurate for verbs, adjectives, adverbs, adpositions, and conjunctions.
    Given that there is a strong negative correlation between dependency length and tree depth, and given that nouns and pronouns tend to be more deeply embedded than (at least) verbs and conjunctions, these patterns can all be explained by the same underlying factors.
    Simply put, MaltParser has an advantage in its richer feature representations, but this a
