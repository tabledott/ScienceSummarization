  Generation is more cumbersome and less eff ic ient than analysis.
  Because the information about morphological cate- gories is available only on the leaf nodes of the trees, many paths through the struc- ture may have to be tried before the right one is found.
  Some ways around this problem have been invented (Barton [5]) but in practice their use is limited.
  Annotated letter trees cannot be min imized .
  Although letter trees, anno- tated with morphological information, are a kind of finite-state network, they cannot be minimized because all the information associated with the leaf nodes would get lost when the branching tails are merged.
  The approach that we describe in this paper overcomes these problems and al- lows a representation f morphological in- formation that maps more easily to the
