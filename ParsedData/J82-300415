s of algebra (e.g., assuming distributivity, associativity,5 identity element, and zero element).
    4 This needs a qualification.
    It is true that the power series provides a complete description of the ambiguity response to any input sentence.
    However, the power series representation may be losing some information that would be useful for parsing.
    In particular, there might be some cases where it is impossible to recover the parse trees exactly, as we will see, though this may not be too serious a problem for many practical applications.
    That is, it is often possible to recover most (if not all) of the structure, which may be adequate for many applications.
    5 The careful reader may correctly object to this assumption.
    We include it here for expository convenience, as it greatly simplifies the derivations though it should be noted that many of the results could be derived without the assumption.
    Furthermore, this assumption is valid for counting ambiguity.
    That is, IA &#8226;
