 results for the two which perform the best.
    We briefly summarise the two measures here; for a more detailed summary see (Patwardhan et al., 2003).
    The measures provide a similarity score between two WordNet senses ( and ), these being synsets within WordNet. lesk (Banerjee and Pedersen, 2002) This score maximises the number of overlapping words in the gloss, or definition, of the senses.
    It uses the glosses of semantically related (according to WordNet) senses too. jcn (Jiang and Conrath, 1997) This score uses corpus data to populate classes (synsets) in the WordNet hierarchy with frequency counts.
    Each 2We use this version of WordNet since it allows us to map information to WordNets of other languages more accurately.
    We are of course able to apply the method to other versions of WordNet. synset, is incremented with the frequency counts from the corpus of all words belonging to that synset, directly or via the hyponymy relation.
    The frequency data is used to calculate the &#8220;info
