    This is done in Section 7.2.
    We also take advantage of the environment that we have set up to perform other experiments, described in Section 7.3, that have some theoretical interest, but did not bring any improvement in practice.
    One concerns the difference between Viterbi and ML tagging, and the other concerns the use of constraints during training.
    We shall begin by describing the textual data that we are using, before presenting the different tagging experiments using these various training and tagging methods.
    We use the &amp;quot;treebank&amp;quot; data described in Beale (1988).
    It contains 42,186 sentences (about one million words) from the Associated Press.

    In fact, these sentences are not only tagged but also parsed.
