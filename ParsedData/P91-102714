ives within his mutual information framework.
    Mutual information, as applied by Church, is a measure of the tendency of two items to appear near one-another &#8212; their observed frequency in nearby positions is divided by the expectation of that frequency if their positions were random and independent.
    To measure the tendency of a verb to be followed within a few words by an infinitive, Church uses his statistical disambiguator 'Error rates computed by hand verification of 200 examples for each SF using the tagged mode.
    These are estimated independently of the error rates for verb detection.
    (Church, 1988) to distinguish between to as an infinitive marker and to as a preposition.
    Then he measures the mutual information between occurrences of the verb and occurrences of infinitives following within a certain number of words.
    Unlike our system, Church's approach does not aim to decide whether or not a verb occurs with an infinitival complement &#8212; example (1) showed that being foll
