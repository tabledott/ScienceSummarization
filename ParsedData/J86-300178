    It is not necessary to relate these two; indeed, from an intuitive point of view, they are not related.
    The focusing structure for true interruptions is different from that for the normal embedding of segments, because the focusing boundary between the interrupted discourse and the interruption is impenetrable.12 (This is depicted in the figure by a line with intersecting hash marks between focus spaces).
    The impenetrable boundary between the focus spaces prevents entities in the spaces below the boundary from being available to the spaces above it.
    Because the second discourse shifts attention totally to a new purpose (and may also shift the identity of the intended hearers), the speaker cannot use any
  
  
    referential expressions during it that depend on the accessibility of entities from the first discourse.
    Since the boundary between the focus space for D1 and the one for D2 is impenetrable, if D2 were to include an uttera
