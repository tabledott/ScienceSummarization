re generally employed when an unknown source word is encountered.
    Either the source word is simply omitted when producing the translation, or alternatively it is passed through untranslated, which is a reasonable strategy if the unknown word happens to be a name (assuming that no transliteration need be done).
    Neither of these strategies is satisfying.
    When a system is trained using 10,000 sentence pairs (roughly 200,000 words) there will be a number of words and phrases in a test sentence which it has not learned the translation of.
    For example, the Spanish sentence Es positivo llegar a un acuerdo sobre los procedimientos, pero debemos encargarnos de que este sistema no sea susceptible de ser usado como arma politica. may translate as It is good reach an agreement on procedures, but we must encargarnos that this system is not susceptible to be usado as political weapon. what is more, the relevant cost dynamic is completely under control im &#376;brigen ist die diesbez&#376;gliche kostenentwic
