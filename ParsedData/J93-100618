xt with a translation of it in another language is, in the terminology of this paper, to show which of its parts are translated by what parts of the second text.
    The result takes the form of a list of pairs of items&#8212;words, sentences, paragraphs, or whatever&#8212;from the two texts.
    A pair (a, b) is on the list if a is translated, in whole or in part, by b.
    If (a, 17} and (a, c) are on the list, it is because a is translated partly by b, and partly by c. We say that the alignment is partial if only some of the items of the chosen kind from one or other of the texts are represented in the pairs.
    Otherwise, it is complete.
    It is notoriously difficult to align good translations on the basis of words, because it is often difficult to decide just which words in an original are responsible for a given one in a translation and, in any case, some words apparently translate morphological or syntactic phenomena rather than other words.
    However, it is relatively easy to establish correspond
