e system was run on.
    Assuming that each of the documents in the data set was about a single John Smith, the cross-document coreference chains produced by the system could now be evaluated by scoring the corresponding within-document coreference chains in the meta document.
    We used two different scoring algorithms for scoring the output.
    The first was the standard algorithm for within-document coreference chains which was used for the evaluation of the systems participating in the MUC-6 and the MUC-7 coreference tasks.
    The shortcomings of the MUC scoring algorithm when used for the cross-document coreference task forced us to develop a second algorithm.
    Details about both these algorithms follow.
  
  
    The MUC algorithm computes precision and recall statistics by looking at the number of links identified by a system compared to the links in an answer key.
    In the model-theoretic description of the algorithm that follows, the term &amp;quot;key&amp;quot; refers to the manually annotat
