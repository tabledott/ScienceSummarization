mate the true distribution by a cruder distribution , and then find the tree with the highest in polynomial time.
    We first create a packed representation of for a given sentence .2 Then, the approximate distribution is created using the packed forest, and the parameters in are adjusted so that approximates as closely as possible.
    The form of is that of a product of the parameters, just like the form of a PCFG model, and it enables us to use a Viterbi algorithm to select the tree with the highest .
    A packed forest is defined as a tuple of , which can be obtained by parsing with beam thresholding, for instance.
    An approximate distribution on such subsets can be derived in almost the same way as one for from the-th to-th word in .
    The second component, , is a function on that represents dominance relations among the chart items in ; is a set of possible daughters of if is not a pre-terminal node, and if is a pre-terminal node above .
