lable in the future, it would be helpful if we could relax the constraint for aligned data.
    Bilingual corpora in the same domain, which are not necessarily translations of each other, are more easily available.
    For example, news agencies such as the Associated Press and Reuters publish in several languages.
    News stories often relate similar facts but they are not direct translations of one another.
    Even though the stories probably use equivalent terminology, totally different techniques would be necessary to be able to use such &amp;quot;nonalignable&amp;quot; corpora as databases.
    Ultimately, such techniques would be more useful than those currently used, because they would be able to extract knowledge from noisy data.
    While this is definitely a large research problem, our research team at Columbia University has begun work in this area (Fung and McKeown 1994) that shows promise for noisy parallel corpora (in which the target corpus may contain either additional or deleted paragraphs
