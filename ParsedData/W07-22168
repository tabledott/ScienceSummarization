elated to probabilistic dependency parsing formalisms and the problems we address here.
  
  
    Let L = {l1, ... ,l|L|} be a set of permissible syntactic edge labels and x = x0x1 &#183; &#183; &#183; x,,, be a sentence such that x0=root.
    From this sentence we construct a complete labeled directed graph (digraph) Gx = (Vx, Ex) such that, Gx is a graph where each word in the sentence is a node, and there is a directed edge between every pair of nodes for every possible label.
    By its definition, Gx is a multi-digraph, which is a digraph that may have more than one edge between any two nodes.
    Let (i, j)k represent the kth edge from i to j. Gx encodes all possible labeled dependencies between the words of x.
    Thus every possible dependency graph of x must be a subgraph of Gx.
    Let i &#8594;+ j be a relation that is true if and only if there is a non-empty directed path from node i to node j in some graph under consideration.
