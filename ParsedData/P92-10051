uch as reference and quantifier scope resolution, are often realised by non-monotonic operations involving loss of information and destructive manipulation of semantic representations.
    A 'twolevel' approach to semantic interpretation tends to result (Bronneberg et al. 1980), where an initial, underspecified representation is transformed into a separate, specified, representation.
    The goal of the work described here is to provide a model for semantic interpretation that is fully monotonic in both linguistic and contextual aspects of interpretation, and which employs just one level of semantic representation &#8212; Quasi Logical Form (QLF).
    Contextual resolution of underspecified QLF expressions involves the instantiation of QLF meta-variables.
    The semantics for the QLF formalism makes the denotation of a QLF formula a partial function to truth-values, with resolution leading to a monotonic extension of the denotation function.
    We believe that there are several advantages to the approach ta
