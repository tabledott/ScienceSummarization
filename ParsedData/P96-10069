sense i of word w are selected over those co-occurring less frequently.
    Condition 1 ensures that a selected keyword is indicative of some sense i of w since cp(ijk) is at least some minimum probability M1.
    Condition 2 reduces the possibility of selecting a keyword based on spurious occurrence.
    Condition 3 prefers keywords that co-occur more frequently if there is a large number of eligible keywords.
    For example, M1 = 0.8, M2 7= 5, M3 := 5 when LEXAS was tested on the common data set reported in Section 4.1.
    To illustrate, when disambiguating the noun &amp;quot;interest&amp;quot;, some of the selected keywords are: expressed, acquiring, great, attracted, expressions, pursue, best, conflict, served, short, minority, rates, rate, bonds, lower, payments.
    Local collocations are common expressions containing the word to be disambiguated.
    For our purpose, the term collocation does not imply idiomatic usage, just words that are frequently adjacent to the word to be disambiguated.
