 distribution of headline words for the second set shown in Figure 2.
    Although humans do not always select headline words from the first sentence, we observe that a large percentage of headline words are often found in the first sentence.
  
  
    The input to Hedge is a story, whose first sentence is immediately passed through the BBN parser.
    The parse-tree result serves as input to a linguisticallymotivated module that selects story words to form headlines based on key insights gained from our observations of human-constructed headlines.
    That is, we conducted a human inspection of the 73 TIPSTER stories mentioned in Section 3 for the purpose of developing the Hedge Trimmer algorithm.
    Based on our observations of human-produced headlines, we developed the following algorithm for parse-tree trimming: More recently, we conducted an automatic analysis of the human-generated headlines that supports several of the insights gleaned from this initial study.
    We parsed 218 human-produced headline
