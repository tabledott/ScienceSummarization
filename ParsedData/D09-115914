 of the classifier.
    In phrase dependency tree, local words in a same phrase are compacted, therefore it provides a way to treat &#8220;local dependencies&#8221; and &#8220;global dependencies&#8221; differently (Fig.
    3).
    As a consequence, these two kinds of dependencies will not disturb each other in measuring similarity.
    Later experiments prove the validity of this statement.
    We generalize the definition by (Culotta and Sorensen, 2004) to fit the phrase dependency tree.
    Use the symbols in Section 2.1.2, 9 i and 9j are two trees with root Ri and Rj, K(9 i, Jj) is the kernel function for them.
    Firstly, each tree node Tk E 9i is augmented with a set of features F, and an instance of F for Tk is Fk = {fk}.
    A match function m(Ti, Tj) is defined on comparing a subset of nodes&#8217; features M C_ F. And in the same way, a similarity function s(Ti, Tj) are defined on 5 C F where i 1 if fis = fs C(fs, fl 0 otherwise (3) For the given phrase dependency parsing trees, the kernel functio
