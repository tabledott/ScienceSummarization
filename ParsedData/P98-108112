rom the set proposed by these taggers.
    In this and the following sections we examine a number of them.
    The accuracy measurements for all of them are listed in Table 2.5 The most straightforward selection method is an n-way vote.
    Each tagger is allowed to vote for the tag of its choice and the tag with the highest number of votes is selected.6 The question is how large a vote we allow each tagger.
    The most democratic option is to give each tagger one vote (Majority).
    However, it appears more useful to give more weight to taggers which have proved their quality.
    This can be general quality, e.g. each tagger votes its overall precision (TotPrecision), or quality in relation to the current situation, e.g. each tagger votes its precision on the suggested tag (TagPrecision).
    The information about each tagger's quality is derived from an inspection of its results on Tune.
    5For any tag X, precision measures which percentage of the tokens tagged X by the tagger are also tagged X in the
