    Another situation that arises is when a feature or construction is syntactically encoded in one language, but not another.
    In such cases, the information is only encoded in the languages that need it.
    The equivalence captured by parallel analyses is not, for example, translational equivalence.
    Rather, parallelism involves equivalence with respect to grammatical properties, e.g. construction types.
    One consequence of this is that a typologically consistent use of grammatical terms, embodied in the feature names, is enforced.
