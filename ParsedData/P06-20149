 sentence that interrupt the phrases established by the provided dependency tree.
    To put this notion formally, we first define some terms: given a subtree T[Z,k], where i is the left index of the leftmost leaf in T[Z,k] and k is the right index of its rightmost leaf, we say any index j E (i, k) is internal to T[Z,k].
    Similarly, any index x E/ [i, k] is external to T[Z,k].
    An invalid span is any span for which our provided tree has a subtree T[Z,k] such that one endpoint of the span is internal to T[Z k] while the other is external to it.
    Figure 3 illustrates this definition, while Figure 4 shows the invalid spans induced by a simple dependency tree.
    With these invalid spans in place, the ITG can no longer merge part of a dependency subtree with anything other than another part of the same subtree.
    Since all ITG movement can be explained by inversions, this constrained ITG cannot interrupt one dependency phrase with part of another.
    Therefore, the phrasal cohesion of the input depen
