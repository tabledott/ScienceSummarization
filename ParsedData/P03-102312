Markov Model (HMM) based engine with error-driven learning capability (Zhou and Su, 2000 &amp; 2002).
    The named entity recognition component recognizes various types of MUC-style named entities, i.e., organization, location, person, date, time, money and percentage.
    For our study, in this paper we only select those features that can be obtained with low annotation cost and high reliability.
    All features are listed in Table 1 together with their respective possible values.
    For a NP under consideration, all of its preceding NPs could be the antecedent candidates.
    Nevertheless, since in the twin-candidate model the number of instances for a given anaphor is about the square of the number of its antecedent candidates, the computational cost would be prohibitively large if we include all the NPs in the candidate set.
    Moreover, many of the preceding NPs are irrelevant or even invalid with regard to the anaphor.
    These data noises may hamper the training of a goodperformanced classifier, a
