Cs validated up to iteration k on the training data.
    The second step was to induce a translation model from each version of the test data.
    There was no opportunity to measure the impact of NCC recognition under the objective function I on any real application, but Figure 3 shows that the mutual information of successive test translation models rose as desired.
    The second experiment was based on the simpler objective function V and its associated predictive value function in Equation 16.
    The impact of NCC recognition on the bag-of-words translation task was measured directly, using Bitext-Based Lexicon Evaluation (BiBLE: Melamed, 1995).
    BiBLE is a family of evaluation algorithms for comparing different translation methods objectively and automatically.
    The algorithms are based on the observation that if translation method A is better than translation method B, and each method produces a translation from one half of a held-out test bitext, then the other half of that bitext will be more
