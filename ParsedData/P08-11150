  Generalizing Word Lattice Translation
  
    Word lattice decoding has proven useful in spoken language translation; we argue that it provides a compelling model for translation of text genres, as well.
    We show that prior work in translating lattices using finite state techniques can be naturally extended to more expressive synchronous context-free grammarbased models.
    Additionally, we resolve a significant complication that non-linear word lattice inputs introduce in reordering models.
    Our experiments evaluating the approach demonstrate substantial gains for Chinese- English and Arabic-English translation.
  
  
    When Brown and colleagues introduced statistical machine translation in the early 1990s, their key insight &#8211; harkening back to Weaver in the late 1940s &#8211; was that translation could be viewed as an instance of noisy channel modeling (Brown et al., 1990).
    They introduced a now standard decomposition that distinguishes modeling sentences in the target language (languag
