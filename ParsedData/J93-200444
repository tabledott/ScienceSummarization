cted files were then carefully adjudicated; we estimate the error rate of the adjudicated version at well under 1%.
  Using a version of PARTS retrained on the entire preliminary corpus and adjudicating between the output of the retrained version and the preliminary version of the corpus, we plan to reduce the error rate of the final version of the corpus to approximately 1%.
  All the skeletally parsed materials have been corrected once, except for the Brown materials, which have been quickly proofread an additional time for gross parsing errors.
  5.2 Future Direct ions A large number of research efforts, both at the University of Pennsylvania nd else- where, have relied on the output of the Penn Treebank Project o date.
  A few examples already in print: a number of projects investigating stochastic parsing have used either the POS-tagged materials (Magerman and Marcus 1990; Brill et al.
  1990; Brill 1991) or the skeletally parsed corpus (Weischedel et al.
  1991; Pereira and Schabes 1992).
