 &#183; &#183; &#183; U Vn takes precedence over W1 U &#183; &#183; &#183; U Wn whenever there are more negative Values among V1, ... , Vn than among W1, ... , Wn.
    Then the preference ordering between Attributes may be taken into account if the number of negative Values is the same in both unions; in case of a tie, the number of distractors removed by each of the two unions may decide; if all this fails to tip the balance, the relative specificity of Attributes may be used.
    The situation resembles that of D&amp;RAtt but, in the case of the new algorithm, D&amp;RBoolean,Att, there is more scope for choice, because it compares combinations (i.e., unions) of properties: when the preference order of individual Attributes has been decided, it can happen that [[Vi]] is more preferred than [[Wj]], while [[Wk]] is more preferred than [[Vl]], in which case it is unclear whether V1 U &#183; &#183; &#183; U Vn should be more preferred or W1 U &#183; &#183; &#183; U Wn.
