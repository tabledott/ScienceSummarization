		We want to know whether the distribution of numbers in Table 1 is similar to those in Table 2, and if so, we will suspect hat fisheries and p~ches are translations of one another.
			A quick look at the two tables suggests that the two distributions are probably very similar, though not quite identical.
			2 We use a simple representation f the distribution of fisheries and p~ches.
			The English text and the French text were each split into K pieces.
			Then we determine whether or not the word in question appears in each of the K pieces.
			Thus, we denote the distribution of fisheries in the English text with a K-dimensional binary vector, VU, and similarly, we denote the distribution of p~ches in the French text with a K-dimensional binary vector, Vp.
			The i th bit of Vf indicates whether or not Fisheries occurs in the i th piece of the English text, and similarly, the ith bit of Vp indicates whether or not p~ches occurs in the i th piece of the French text.
			If we take K be 10, the first three inst
