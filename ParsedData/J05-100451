osition Bank a grammatical function tag expressing the frame element?s syntactic relation to the predicate.
  A Quantitative Analysis of the Semantic-Role Labels The stated aim of PropBank is the training of statistical systems.
  It also provides a rich resource for a distributional analysis of semantic features of language that have hitherto been somewhat inaccessible.
  We begin this section with an overview of general characteristics of the syntactic realization of the different semantic-role labels and then attempt to measure the frequency of syntactic alternations with respect to verb class membership.
  We base this analysis on previous work by Merlo and Stevenson (2001).
  In the following section we discuss the performance of a system trained to automatically assign the semantic-role labels.
  6.1 Associating Role Labels with Specific Syntactic Constructions We begin by simply counting the frequency of occurrence of roles in specific syntactic positions.
  In all the statistics given in this section,
