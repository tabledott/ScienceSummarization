 of the complexity of the structure intervening between the focus and the verb.
    The more complex this structure, the lower the probability that the focus and the verb are related.
    Context further away is less important than near context.
    To test the effects of the chunking steps from Section 3.1 on this task, we will now construct instances based on more structured input text, like that in Figure 2.
    This time, the focus is described by five features instead of two, for the additional information: which type of chunk it is in, what, the preposition is if it is in a PP chunk, and what the adverbial function is, if any.
    We still have a context of two elements left, one right, but elements are now defined to be either chunks, or words outside any chunk, or punctuation.
    Each chunk in the context is represented by its last word (which is the semantically most important word in most cases), by the POS of the last word, and by the type of chunk.
    The distance feature is adapted to the new d
