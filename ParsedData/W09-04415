is, of a foreign language text, the source, against a translation of the source text that was created by a human translator, called a reference translation.
    The set of possible correct translations is very large&#8212;possibly infinite&#8212; and any single reference translation is just a single point in that space.
    Usually multiple reference translations, typically 4, are provided to give broader sampling of the space of correct translations.
    Automatic MT evaluation metrics compare the hypothesis against this set of reference translations and assign a score to the similarity; higher scores are given to hypotheses that are more similar to the references.
    In addition to assigning a score to a hypothesis, the TER metric also provides an alignment between the hypothesis and the reference, enabling it to be useful beyond general translation evaluation.
    While TER has been shown to correlate well with human judgments of translation quality, it has several flaws, including the use of only a singl
