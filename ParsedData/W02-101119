o improve our sentiment categorization results; these experiments are reported below.
    Feature frequency vs. presence Recall that we represent each document d by a feature-count vector (n1(d), ... , n,.(d)).
    However, the definition of the 9Joachims (1998) used stemming and stoplists; in some of their experiments, Nigam et al. (1999), like us, did not.
    10We could not perform the natural experiment of attempting topic-based categorization on our data because the only obvious topics would be the film being reviewed; unfortunately, in our data, the maximum number of reviews per movie is 27, too small for meaningful results.
    MaxEnt feature/class functions Fi,c only reflects the presence or absence of a feature, rather than directly incorporating feature frequency.
    In order to investigate whether reliance on frequency information could account for the higher accuracies of Naive Bayes and SVMs, we binarized the document vectors, setting ni(d) to 1 if and only feature fi appears in d, and reran Nai
