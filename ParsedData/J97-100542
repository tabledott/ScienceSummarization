ndaries greatly outnumber boundaries.
    These figures compare with other studies (74% to 95% in Grosz and Hirschberg [19921, depending upon discourse feature, and greater than 80% in Hearst [1993]).
    3.2.5 Discussion.
    We have shown that an atheoretical notion of speaker intention is understood sufficiently uniformly by naive subjects to yield highly significant agreement across subjects on segment boundaries in a corpus of spoken narratives.
    Probabilities of the observed distributions range from .6 x 10-9 to .1 x 10-6 as given by Cochran's Q.
    The result is all the more striking given that we used naive coders on a loosely defined task.
    Subjects were free to assign any number of boundaries, and to label their segments with anything they judged to be the narrator's communicative intention.
    Partitioning Cochran's Q shows that the proportion of boundaries identified by at least three subjects was significant across all 20 narratives (p &lt; .02).
    Significance increases exponentially a
