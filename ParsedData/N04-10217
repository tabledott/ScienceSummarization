    We worked with the Chinese-English data from the recent evaluations, as both large amounts of sentence-aligned training corpora and multiple gold standard reference translations are available.
    This is a standard data set, making it possible to compare results with other systems.
    In addition, working on Chinese allows us to use the existing Chinese syntactic treebank and parsers based on it.
    For the baseline MT system, we distinguish the following three different sentence- or chunk-aligned parallel training corpora: most experiments described in this report this corpus consists of 993 sentences (about 25K words) in both languages.
    For development and test data, we have four English (reference) translations for each Chinese sentence.
    For each sentence in the development, test, and the blind test corpus a set of 16,384 different alternative translations has been produced using the baseline system.
    For extracting the n-best candidate translations, an A* search is used.
