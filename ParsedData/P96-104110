at the new bucketing scheme results in a much tighter plot, indicating that it is better at grouping together distributions with similar behavior.
    This technique combines two intuitions.
    First, MacKay and Peto (1995) argue that a reasonable form for a smoothed distribution is The parameter a can be thought of as the number of counts being added to the given distribution, where the new counts are distributed as in the lowerorder distribution.
    Secondly, the Good-Turing estimate can be interpreted as stating that the number of these extra counts should be proportional to the number of words with exactly one count in the given distribution.
    We have found that taking is the number of words with one count, and where )3 and -y are constants.
  
  
    We used the Penn treebank and TIPSTER corpora distributed by the Linguistic Data Consortium.
    From the treebank, we extracted text from the tagged Brown corpus, yielding about one million words.
    From TIPSTER, we used the Associated Press (AP), Wa
