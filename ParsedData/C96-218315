  Other differences are in the areas of modifier at- tachment and rule generality.
  In contrast o the /)SM approach, the FSG output does not have all modifiers attached, so the bulk of attachment de- cisions must be made by the simplification rules.
  The FSG approach is forced to enumerate all pos- sible variants of the LHS of each simplification rule (eg.
  Subject versus Object relatives, singular versus plural NPs) whereas in the DSM approach, the rules, encoded in supertags and the associated constituent types, are more genera
