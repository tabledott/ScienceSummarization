ented with various syntactic filters, including: all open class words, nouns and verbs only, etc., with best results observed for nouns and adjectives only, as detailed in section 3.2.
    The TextRank keyword extraction algorithm is fully unsupervised, and proceeds as follows.
    First, Compatibility of systems of linear constraints over the set of natural numbers.
    Criteria of compatibility of a system of linear Diophantine equations, strict inequations, and nonstrict inequations are considered.
    Upper bounds for components of a minimal set of solutions and algorithms of construction of minimal generating sets of solutions for all types of systems are given.
    These criteria and the corresponding algorithms for constructing a minimal supporting set of solutions can be used in solving all the considered types systems and systems of mixed types. the text is tokenized, and annotated with part of speech tags &#8211; a preprocessing step required to enable the application of syntactic filters.
