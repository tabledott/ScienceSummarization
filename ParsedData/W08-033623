RF segmenter&#8212;i.e., to adjust the rate of word boundary predictions (yt = +1), we apply a relatively simple technique (Minkov et al., 2006) originally devised for adjusting the precision/recall tradeoff of any sequential classifier.
    Specifically, the weight vector w and feature vector of a trained linear sequence classifier are augmented at test time to include new class-conditional feature functions to bias the classifier towards particular class labels.
    In our case, since we wish to increase the frequency of word boundaries, we add a feature function: Its weight 1,0 controls the extent of which the classifier will make positive predictions, with very large positive 4 values causing only positive predictions (i.e., character-based segmentation) and large negative values effectively disabling segmentation boundaries.
    Table 5 displays how changes of the bias parameter &#955;0 affect segmentation granularity.4 Since we are interested in analyzing the different regimes of MT performance between
