  Exploring Content Models for Multi-Document Summarization
  
    We present an exploration of generative probabilistic models for multi-document summarization.
    Beginning with a simple word frequency based model (Nenkova and Vanderwende, 2005), we construct a sequence of models each injecting more structure into the representation of document set content and exhibiting ROUGE gains along the way.
    Our model, utilizes a hierarchical LDA-style model (Blei et al., 2004) to represent content specificity as a hierarchy of topic vocabulary distributions.
    At the task of producing generic DUC-style summaries, state-of-the-art ROUGE performance and in pairwise user evaluation strongly outperforms Toutanova et al. (2007)&#8217;s state-of-the-art discriminative system.
    We explore capacity to produce multiple &#8216;topical summaries&#8217; in order to facilitate content discovery and navigation.
  
  
    Over the past several years, there has been much interest in the task of multi-document summarizatio
