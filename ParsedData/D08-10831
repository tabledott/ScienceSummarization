mining expression-level polarity.
    Finally, in contrast to conventional wisdom, we find that expression-level classification accuracy additional, potentially disambiguating, context is considered.
  
  
    Determining the polarity of sentiment-bearing expressions at or below the sentence level requires more than a simple bag-of-words approach.
    One of the difficulties is that words or constituents within the expression can interact with each other to yield a particular overall polarity.
    To facilitate our discussion, consider the following examples: In the first example, &#8220;doubt&#8221; in isolation carries a negative sentiment, but the overall polarity of the sentence is positive because there is a negator &#8220;not&#8221;, which flips the polarity.
    In the second example, both &#8220;eliminated&#8221; and &#8220;doubt&#8221; carry negative sentiment in isolation, but the overall polarity of the sentence is positive because &#8220;eliminated&#8221; acts as a negator for its argument &#8220;
