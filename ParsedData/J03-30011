   The mode of work has increased dramatically from a standing start seven years ago with the Web being used as a data source in a wide range of research activities: The papers in this special issue form a sample of the best of it.
    This introduction to the issue aims to survey the activities and explore recurring themes.
    We first consider whether the Web is indeed a corpus, then present a history of the theme in which we view the Web as a development of the empiricist turn that has brought corpora center stage in the course of the 1990s.
    We briefly survey the range of Web-based NLP research, then present estimates of the size of the Web, for English and for other languages, and a simple method for translating phrases.
    Next we open the Pandora&#8217;s box of representativeness (concluding that the Web is not representative of anything other than itself, but then neither are other corpora, and that more work needs to be done on text types).
    We then introduce the articles in the special issue
