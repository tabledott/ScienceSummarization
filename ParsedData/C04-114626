mpositionality of collocations.
			We saw that in this ap plication we achieve significantly better resultsusing a measure that tends to select higher frequency words as neighbours rather than a mea sure that tends to select neighbours of a similar frequency to the target word.
			There are a variety of ways in which this workmight be extended.
			First, we could use the ob servations about distributional generality andrelative frequency to aid the process of organising distributionally similar words into hierar chies.
			Second, we could consider the impact of frequency characteristics in other applications.Third, for the general application of distribu tional similarity measures, it would be usefulto find other characteristics by which distribu tional similarity measures might be classified.
