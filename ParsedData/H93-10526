he left or right hav- ing a certain part-of-speech.
  We also consider certain direct syntactic relationships, uch as verb/object, subject/verb, and adjective/noun pairs.
  It appears that content words (nouns, verbs, adjectives, and adverbs) behave quite differently from function words (other parts of speech); we make use of this distinction in several definitions of collocation.
  We will attempt to quantify the validity of the one-sense-per- collocation hypothesis for these different collocation types.
  EXPERIMENTS In the experiments, we ask two central, related questions: For each definition of sense and collocation, ?
  What is the mean entropy of the distribution Pr(Sense[Collocation)?
  What is the performance of a disambiguation algorithm which uses only that collocation type as evidence?
  We examine several permutations for each, and are interested in how the results of these questions differ when applied to polysemous nouns, verbs, and adjectives.
  To limit the already very large number of parame
