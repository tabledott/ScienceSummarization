e nonterminal subsumes some portion of the semantic component of the left-hand-side.
    The semantic monotonicity constraint itself is quite restrictive.
    As stated in the original Earley generation paper (Shieber 1988), &amp;quot;perhaps the most immediate problem raised by [Earley generation] is the strong requirement of semantic monotonicity.

    Finding a weaker constraint on grammars that still allows efficient processing is thus an important research objective.&amp;quot; Although it is intuitively plausible that the semantic content of subconstituents ought to play a role in the semantics of their combination&#8212;this is just a kind of compositionality claim&#8212;there are certain cases in which reasonable linguistic analyses might violate this intuition.
    In general, these cases arise when a particular lexical item is stipulated to occur, the stipulation being either lexical (as in the case of particles or idioms) or grammatical (as in the case of expletive expressions).
