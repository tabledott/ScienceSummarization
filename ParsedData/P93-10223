should be estimated by a smoothing method that takes into account the frequencies of the individual words.
    Relying on this result, we will use frequency based estimation (using word frequencies) as representative for smoothing estimates of unobserved cooccurrences, for comparison purposes.
    As will be shown later, the problem with smoothing estimates is that they ignore the expected degree of association between the specific words of the cooccurrence.
    For example, we would not like to estimate the same probability for two cooccurrences like 'eat bread' and 'eat cars', despite the fact that both 'bread' and 'cars' may have the same frequency.
    Class based models (Brown et al., ; Pereira et al., 1993; Hirschman, 1986; Resnik, 1992) distinguish between unobserved cooccurrences using classes of &amp;quot;similar&amp;quot; words.
    The probability of a specific cooccurrence is determined using generalized parameters about the probability of class cooccurrence.
    This approach, which follows long
