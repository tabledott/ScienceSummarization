is carried out by summing the scores from each knowledge source for all candidate senses and choosing the one with the highest overall score.
    In a sample of 25,000 words from the Wall Street Journal, the system covered 98% of word-occurrences that were not proper nouns and were not abbreviated, demonstrating the impressive coverage of the hand-crafted lexicons.
    No quantitative evaluation of the disambiguation quality was carried out due to the difficulty in obtaining annotated test data, a problem made more acute by the use of a custom-built lexicon.
    In addition, comparison of system output against manually annotated text had yet to become a standard evaluation strategy in WSD research.
    The Cambridge International Dictionary of English (CIDE) (Procter 1995) is a learners' dictionary which consists of definitions written using a 2,000 word controlled vocabulary.
    (This lexicon is similar to LDOCE, which we use for experiments presented later in this paper; it is described in Section 3.1.)
