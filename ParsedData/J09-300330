    This simple classifier has an accuracy of 48%.
    From the confusion matrix given in Table 6, we see that 76% of the errors result from words with non-neutral prior polarity appearing in phrases with neutral contextual polarity.
    Only 12% of the errors result from words with neutral prior polarity appearing in expressions with non-neutral contextual polarity, and only 11% of the errors come from words with a positive or negative prior polarity appearing in expressions with the opposite contextual polarity.
    Table 6 also shows that positive clues tend to be used in negative expressions far more often than negative clues tend to be used in positive expressions.
    Given that by far the largest number of errors come from clues with positive, negative, or both prior polarity appearing in neutral contexts, we were motivated to try a two-step approach to the problem of sentiment classification.
    The first step, Neutral&#8211; Polar Classification, tries to determine if an instance is neutra
