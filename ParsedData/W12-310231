 and a baseline system.
    The goals of this shared task are: The task provides datasets for a single language pair, text domain and MT system: English-Spanish news texts produced by a phrase-based SMT system (Moses) trained on Europarl and News Commentaries corpora provided in the WMT10 translation task.
    As training data, translations were manually annotated for quality in terms of post-editing effort (1-5 scores) and were provided together with their source sentences, reference translations, and post-edited translations (Section 6.1).
    The sharedtask consisted on automatically producing qualityestimations for a blind test-set, where English source sentences and their MT-translations were used as inputs.
    Hidden (and subsequently publicly-released) manual effort-annotations of those translations (obtained in the same fashion as for the training data) were used as reference labels to evaluate the performance of the participating systems (Section 6.1).
    Participants also had full access to the tr
