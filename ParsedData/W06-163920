ereas false negatives mean only that agreement-based information about other speech segments is not employed.
    As described above, we can raise agreement precision by increasing the threshold Bagr, which specifies the required confidence for the addition of an agreement link.
    Indeed, Table 3 shows that we can improve agreement precision by setting Bagr to the (positive) mean agreement score &#181; assigned by the SVM agreement-classifier over all references in the given debate12.
    However, this comes at the cost of greatly reducing agreement accuracy (development: 64.38%; test: 66.18%) due to lowered recall levels.
    Whether or not better speech-segment classification is ultimately achieved is discussed in the next sections.
    Baselines The first two data rows of Table 4 depict baseline performance results.
    The #(&#8220;support&#8221;) &#8722; #(&#8220;oppos&#8221;) baseline is meant to explore whether the speech-segment classification task can be reduced to simple lexical checks.
