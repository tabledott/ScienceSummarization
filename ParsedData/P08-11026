.
    To compare with others conveniently, we excluded the ones forbidden by the close test regulation of SIGHAN, for example, Pu(C0), indicating whether character C0 is a punctuation.
    All feature templates and their instances are shown in Table 1.
    C represents a Chinese character while the subscript of C indicates its position in the sentence relative to the current character (it has the subscript 0).
    Templates immediately borrowed from Ng and Low (2004) are listed in the upper column named non-lexical-target.
    We called them non-lexical-target because predications derived from them can predicate without considering the current character C0.
    Templates in the column below are expanded from the upper ones.
    We add a field C0 to each template in the upper column, so that it can carry out predication according to not only the context but also the current character itself.
    As predications generated from such templates depend on the current character, we name these templates lexical-targe
