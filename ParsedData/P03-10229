 the sentence in which it was contained.
    This was intended to be a rough approximation of the concept of the right frontier (Webber, 1991).
    The remaining expressions were then combined with the potential anaphor.
    Finally, the resulting pairs were labelled P or N and added to the instances generated with NP-antecedents.
  
  
    We distinguish two classes of features: NP-level features specify e.g. the grammatical function, NP form, morpho-syntax, grammatical case and the depth of embedding in the syntactical structure.
    For these features, each instance contains one value for the antecedent and one for the anaphor.
    Coreference-level features, on the other hand, describe the relation between antecedent and anaphor in terms of e.g. distance (in words, markables and sentences), compatibility in terms of agreement and identity of syntactic function.
    For these features, each instance contains only one value.
    In addition, we introduce a set of features which is partly tailored to the pro
