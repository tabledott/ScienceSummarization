 orthographic indicators and part of speech as predictors of the discourse/sentential distinction, we achieve only slightly better prediction than with orthographic cues alone.
    That is, if we consider both an item's part-of-speech tag and adjacent orthographic indicators, we model the RJB86 data only marginally more accurately.
    Table 13 models correctly 677 (80.3%) transcribed, classified tokens in RJB86 from orthographic and part-of-speech information.
    For example, given a coordinating conjunction, our model would predict that it would be a discourse use if preceded by orthography, and a sentential use otherwise.
    In fact, the only difference from orthography alone is the way succeeding orthography can signal a discourse use for a singular or mass noun, and a sentential use for adverbs.
    While the use of orthographic and part-of-speech data represents only a fractional improvement over orthographic information alone, it is possible that, since the latter is not subject to transcriber idiosy
