ue that leads to the best performance could be chosen.
    Note that this approach sets no constraints on the value of &#945;: The value could be as high as 0.995 or as low as 0.0005, depending on the particular application.
    There may be cases in which the conditions for the appropriate application of a chisquare test are not met.
    One condition that is likely to be violated is the requirement that expected values in the contingency table not be too small.
    (A rule of thumb often found in textbooks is that the expected values should be greater than five.)
    One response to this problem is to apply some kind of thresholding and either ignore counts below the threshold, or apply the test only to tables that do not contain low counts.
    Ribas (1995), Li and Abe (1998), McCarthy (2000), and Wagner (2000) all use some kind of thresholding when dealing with counts in the hierarchy (although not in the context of a chi-square test).
    Another approach would be to use Fisher&#8217;s exact test (Agrest
