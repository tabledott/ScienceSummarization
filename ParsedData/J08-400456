erpreting the values of correlation coefficients, and in the area of medical diagnosis, the best known conventions concerning the value of kappa-like coefficients, those proposed by Landis and Koch (1977) and reported in Figure 1, are indeed similar to those used for correlation coefficients, where values above 0.4 are also generally considered adequate (Marion 2004).
    Many medical researchers feel that these conventions are appropriate, and in language studies, a similar interpretation of the values has been proposed by Rietveld and van Hout (1993).
    In CL, however, most researchers follow the more stringent conventions from content analysis proposed by Krippendorff (1980, page 147), as reported by Carletta (1996, page 252): &#8220;content analysis researchers generally think of K &gt; .8 as good reliability, with .67 &lt; K &lt; .8 allowing tentative conclusions to be drawn&#8221; (Krippendorff was discussing values of &#945; rather than K, but the coefficients are nearly equivalent for categorical la
