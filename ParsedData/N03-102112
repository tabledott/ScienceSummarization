 its signatures, and the number INIof nonterminals in the grammar.
    The maximum number of required boundaries is exactly twice the cardinality of the MTG, and each of the boundaries can range over positions.
    Thus, the space complexity Parser A for an MTG in 0(1Ni (G) is bilexical, then the number of possible nonterminals a factor of , the space complexity of A to +2C (G)) The time complexity of Parser A depends on how many boundaries are shared between antecedent items in A.0 rules.
    In the best case, all the boundaries are shared except the two outermost boundaries in each dimension, and the inferred item is contiguous.
    In the worst case, no boundaries are shared, and the inferred item stores all the boundaries of antecedent items.
    In any case, if cardinalities of the composed items, and the cardinality of the inferred item, then the number of boundaries in an A.0 inference is + z.
    Thus, in the worst case, the number of free boundinvolved in an A.0 inference is beeach boundary can range
