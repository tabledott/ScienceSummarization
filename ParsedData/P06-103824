ectly accessed the word graph, which may be an advantage in some applications.
    The Russian evaluation posed a bit of a problem because the Russian WordNet is not readily available and its coverage is rather small.
    Fortunately, the subject list is such that WordNet words could be translated unambiguously to Russian and words in our discovered categories could be translated unambiguously into English.
    This was the methodology taken.
    For each found category C containing N words, we computed the following (see Table 2): (1) Precision: the number of words present in both C and WN divided by N; (2) Precision*: the number of correct words divided by N.
