    Section 3 discusses the data used in our experiment, which is aimed at repairing a common type of ESL error that is not well-handled by current grammar checking technology: mass/count noun confusions.
    Section 4 presents experimental results, along with an analysis of errors produced by the system.
    Finally we present discussion and some future directions for investigation.
  
  
    A major difficulty for ESL proofing is that errors of grammar, lexical choice, idiomaticity, and style rarely occur in isolation.
    Instead, any given sentence produced by an ESL learner may involve a complex combination of all these error types.

    Consider the following example, written by a Korean speaker and found on the World Wide Web, which involves the misapplicatio
