i PPs, the parser would return: (CAT-TABLE i).
    We now extend the indexing scheme so that the parser implements a series connection of two Catalan grammars by returning one higher index than it would for a simple Catalan grammar.
    That is, if there were n PPs, the parser would return (CAT-TABLE (-4- n 1)).
    Series connections of Catalan grammars are very common in every day natural language, as illustrated by the following two sentences, which have received considerable attention in the literature because the parser cannot separate the direct object from the prepositional complement.
    Both examples have a Catalan number of ambiguities because the auto-convolution of a Catalan series yields another Catalan series.13 This result can improve parsing performance because it suggests ways to reorganize (compile) the grammar so that there will be fewer references to quantities that are not readily available.
    This re-organization will reap benefits that chart parsers (e.g., Earley's algorithm) do not
