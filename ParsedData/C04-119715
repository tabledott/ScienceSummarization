raints derived from linguistic information and structural considerations,our system seeks for a legitimate labeling that max imizes the score.
			Specifically, it can be viewed asthe solution space is limited through the use of a filter function, F , that eliminates many argument labelings from consideration.
			It is interesting to con trast this with previous work that filters individual phrases (see (Carreras and Ma`rquez, 2003)).
			Here, we are concerned with global constraints as well as constraints on the arguments.
			Therefore, the final labeling becomes c?1:M = argmax c1:M?F(PM ) M?
			i=1 score(Si = ci) (2)The filter function used considers the following con straints: 1.
			Arguments cannot cover the predicate except.
			those that contain only the verb or the verb and the following word.
			2.
			Arguments cannot overlap with the clauses.
			(they can be embedded in one another).
			3.
			If a predicate is outside a clause, its arguments.
			cannot be embedded in that clause.
			4.
			No overlappi
