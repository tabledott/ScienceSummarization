at one can sample from the models' posterior distribution, at least approximately.
    To illustrate the generation of committeemembers, consider a model containing a single binomial parameter a (the probability of a success), with estimated value a.
    The statistics S for such a model are given by N, the number of trials, and x, the number of successes in those trials.
    Given N and x, the 'best' parameter value may be estimated by one of several estimation methods.
    For example, the maximum likelihood estimate for a is a = k, giving the model M = {a} = {kJ.
    When generating a committee of models, however, we are not interested in the 'best' model, but rather in sampling the distribution of models given the statistics.
    For our example, we need to sample the posterior density of estimates for a, namely P(a = a I S)&#8226; Sampling this distribution yields a set of estimates scattered around ff (assuming a uniform prior), whose variance decreases as N increases.
    In other words, the more stati
