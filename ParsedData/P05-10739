    These features are a subset of features used in previous work.
    The standard features at the top of the table were defined by (Gildea and Jurafsky, 2002), and the rest are other useful lexical and structural features identified in more recent work (Pradhan et al., 2004; Surdeanu et al., 2003; Xue and Palmer, 2004).
    The most direct way to use trained local identification and classification models in testing is to select a labeling L of the parse tree that maximizes the product of the probabilities according to the two models as in Equation 1.
    Since these models are local, this is equivalent to independently maximizing the product of the probabilities of the two models for the label li of each parse tree node ni as shown below in Equation 2. a product of local identification and classification models.
    We use the local models in conjunction with this search procedure to select a most likely labeling in testing.
    Test set results for our local model PsRL are given in Table 2.
