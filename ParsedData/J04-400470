the PM parameters dependent on headwords would capture such preferences.
    As for effects involving dependence on the head tag th, observe that moving from Model Mtw,t to Model Mtw,&#966; results in a small drop in both recall and precision, whereas making an analogous move from Model Mt,t to Model Mt,&#966; results in a drop in recall, but a slight gain in precision (the two moves are analogous in that in both cases, th is dropped from the context of PMw).
    It is not evident why these two moves do not produce similar performance losses, but in both cases, the performance drops are small relative to those observed when eliminating wh from the conditioning contexts, indicating that headwords matter far more than parts of speech for determining structural preferences, as one would expect.
  
  
    We have documented what we believe is the complete set of heretofore unpublished details Collins used in his parser, such that, along with Collins&#8217; (1999) thesis, thi s article contains all information nec
