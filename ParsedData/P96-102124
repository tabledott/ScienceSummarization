erformed on a random sample drawn from Chinese sentences of fewer than 20 words from the parallel corpus, the results of which are shown in Figure 3.
    We have judged only whether the correct meaning (as determined by the corresponding English sentence in the parallel corpus) is conveyed by the translation, paying particular attention to word order, but otherwise ignoring morphological and function word choices.
    For comparison, the accuracies from the A*-based systems are also shown.
    There is no significant difference in the accuracy.
    Some examples of the output are shown in Figure 4.
    On the other hand, the new algorithm has indeed proven to be much faster.
    At present we are unable to use direct measurement to compare the speed of the systems meaningfully, because of vast implementational differences between the systems.
    However, the order-of-magnitude improvements are immediately apparent.
    In the earlier system, translation of single sentences required on the order of hours (Sun
