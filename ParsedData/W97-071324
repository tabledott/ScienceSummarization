various sizes 3 Relations can be partitioned into two classes paratactic and hypotactic Paratactic relations are those that hold between spans of equal importance Hypotactic relations are those that hold between a span that is essential for the writer's purpose, i e, a nucleus, and a span that increases the understanding of the nucleus but is not essential for the writer's purpose, i a, a satellite 4 The abstract structure of most texts is a binary, tree-like structure 5 If a relation holds between two textual spans of the tree structure of a text, that relation also holds between the most important units of the constituent subspans The most important units of a textual span are determined recursively they correspond to the most important units of the unmediate subspans when the relation that holds between these subspans is paratactic, and to the most important units of the nucleus subspan when the relation that holds between the immediate subspans is hypotacuc The rhetoncal parsing algorithm, which is outlin
