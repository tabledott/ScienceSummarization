ples, we do well on the whole sample space.
    In our case, as long as we do well on the relevant set, the decoder will perform well.
    Since the relevant set depends on the decoder parameter , and the decoder parameter is optimized on the relevant set, it is necessary to estimate them jointly using an iterative algorithm.
    The basic idea is to start with a decoding parameter , and estimate the corresponding relevant set; we then update based on the relevant set, and iterate this process.
    The procedure is outlined in Table 1.
    We intentionally leave the implementation details of the (*) step and (**) step open.
    Moreover, in this general algorithm, we do not have to assume that has the form of Eq.
    1.
    A natural question concerning the procedure is its convergence behavior.
    It can be shown that under mild assumptions, if we pick in (*) an alternative for each ( ) such that then the procedure converges to the solution of Eq.

    Moreover, the rate of convergence depends only on
