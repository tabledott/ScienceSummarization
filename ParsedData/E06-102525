on, with Tro = Tr3o for the .676 SO-accuracy result and Tro = Tr4o for the .660 PNO-accuracy result); this contrasts sharply with the accuracy obtained in (Esuli and Sebastiani, 2005) on discriminating Positive from Negative (where the best run obtained .830 accuracy), on the same benchmarks and essentially the same algorithms.
    This suggests that good performance at orientation detection (as e.g. in (Esuli and Sebastiani, 2005; Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown, 1997; Turney and Littman, 2003)) may not be a cE{cl,...,cm}, fE{fk,fk} guarantee of good performance at subjectivity detection, quite evidently a harder (and, as we have suggested, more realistic) task.
    This hypothesis is confirmed by an experiment performed by Kim and Hovy (2004) on testing the agreement of two human coders at tagging words with the Positive, Negative, and Objective labels.
    The authors define two measures of such agreement: strict agreement, equivalent to our PNO-accuracy, and lenient agreement, which measures the accuracy at
