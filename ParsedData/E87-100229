ore than one lexical tape.
    However, the idea that the vocalic material associated with a root should appear on a special tape, reserved for it alone, breaks the clean lines of the system as so far presented in two ways.
    First, it spearates material onto two tapes, specifically the new one and the vocalism, on purely lexical grounds, having nothing to do with their phonetic or phonological constitution, and this runs counter to the idea of tapes as records of activity on phonetically specialized receptors.
    It is also at least slightly troublesome in that that newly introduced tape fills no function except in the generation of the first row of the table.
    Neither of these arguments is conclusive, and they could diminish considerably in force as a wider range of data was considered.
    Representing the vocalic contribution of the root on the same tape as the vacalism would avoid both of these objections, but would require that vocalic contribution to be recorded either before or after the vocalis
