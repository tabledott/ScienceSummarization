   Resnik's model was trained on the primary corpus (59,608 sentences).
  
  
    In this section we describe experiments comparing the similarity-based model for selectional preferences to Resnik's WordNet-based model and to an EM-based clustering model3.
    For the similarity-based model we test the five similarity metrics and three weighting schemes listed in section 3.
    Like Rooth et al. (1999) we evaluate selectional preference induction approaches in a pseudodisambiguation task.
    In a test set of pairs (rp, w), each headword w is paired with a confounder w' chosen randomly from the BNC according to its frequency4.
    Noun headwords are paired with noun confounders in order not to disadvantage Resnik's model, which only works with nouns.
    The headword/confounder pairs are only computed once and reused in all crossvalidation runs.
    The task is to choose the more likely role headword from the pair (w, w').
    In the main part of the experiment, we count a pair as covered if both w and w' are
