 winner; each value of did best for certain confusion sets.
    Table 5 gives examples of the collocations learned for {peace, piece} with = 2.
    A good deal of redundancy can be seen among the collocations.
    There is also some redundancy between the collocations and the context words of the previous section (e.g., for corps).
    Many of the collocations at the end of the list appear to be overgeneral and irrelevant.
    Yarowsky [1994] pointed out the complementarity between context words and collocations: context words pick up those generalities that are best expressed in an order-independent way, while collocations capture order-dependent generalities.
    Yarowsky proposed decision lists as a way to get the best of both methods.
    The idea is to make one big list of all features &#8212; in this case, context words and collocations.
    The features are sorted in order of decreasing strength, where the strength of a feature reflects its reliability for decision-making.
