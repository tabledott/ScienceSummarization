		I~IUNCIPAII, then uses the minimum weight and a predetermined number called BIGWEIGHT, which is currently arbitraryly de- fined to be 20, to prune the parse forest.
			Only 486 the parse trees whose weights are less than (minimum weiglit -F BIGWEIGHT/2) are spared and output.
			The weights of the links and word senses are determined as follows: e 'I'he links fi'om Xbar to an ad,imlct YP have weight=nlGWEIglIW and all the~ other links have weight=l.0.
			? The words in the lexicon ma,y have an attribute rar% which takes wdues from {very, very-very}.
			If a word sense has the attribute value (rare very), its weight is BIGWEIGIIT.
			I fa word sense has the attribute value (rare very-very), its weight is 2?BIGWEIGIIT.
			Otherwise, the weight is 0, Note that the att;ribute rare is used to indicate the relative frequency among different stmses of the same word.
