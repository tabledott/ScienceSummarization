ts), in conjuction with introduction of new auxiliary nonterminals where needed.
    For instance, even messy alignments such as that in Figure 3 can be handled by interleaving orientations: This bracketing is of course linguistically implausible, so whether such parses are acceptable depends on one's objective.
    Moreover, it may even remain possible to align constituents for phenomena whose underlying structure is not context-free&#8212;say, ellipsis or coordination&#8212;as long as the surface structures of the two languages fortuitously parallel each other (though again the bracketing would be linguistically implausible).
    We will return to the subject of ITGs' ordering flexibility in Section 4.
    We stress again that the primary purpose of ITGs is to maximize robustness for parallel corpus analysis rather than to verify grammaticality, and therefore writing grammars is made much easier since the grammars can be minimal and very leaky.
    We consider elsewhere an extreme special case of leaky ITGs
