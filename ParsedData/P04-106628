model.
    However, it is not clear that AER as defined by Och and Ney (2003) is always the appropriate way to evaluate the quality of the model, since the Viterbi word alignment that AER is based on is seldom used in applications of Model 1.5 Moreover, it is notable that while the versions of Model 1 having the lowest AER have dramatically higher precision than the standard version, they also have quite a bit lower recall.
    If AER does not reflect the optimal balance between precision and recall for a particular application, then optimizing AER may not produce the best task-based performance for that application.
    Thus the next step in this research must be to test whether the improvements in AER we have demonstrated for Model 1 lead to improvements on task-based performance measures.
