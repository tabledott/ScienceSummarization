elieve p. This relationship plays a role in the recognition of DSPs.
    An analogous situation holds for a discourse segment comprising utterances intended to get the OCP to perform some set of actions directed at achieving some overall task (e.g., some segments in the task-oriented dialogue of Section 3.2).
    The full specification of the DP/DSP contains a generates relation that is derived from a relation defined by Goldman (1970).
    For this case, the DP/DSPs are of the following form: Generates(A, a.,A...Aan)))) Each intention to act represented in the second conjunct corresponds to the primary intention of some discourse segment.
    Like supports, the generates relation is partial (its partiality distinguishes it in part from Goldman's relation), Thus, the OCP is not intended to believe that the ICP believes that performance of a, alone is sufficient for performance of A, but rather that doing all of the ai and other actions that the OCP can be expected to know or figure out constitutes a performan
