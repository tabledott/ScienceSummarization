used.
    For order 3 models, most words are segmented with the same error rate as for order 5 models, though some words are missed when order 2 models are used.
    Figure 10 shows some cases where the order 3 and order 5 models produce different results.
    Some order 5 errors are corrected by the order 3 model, though others appear even with the lower-order model.
    For example, both results in the first row are incorrect: no space should be inserted in this case, and the four characters should stand together.
    However, the order 3 result is to be preferred to the order 5 result because both two-character words do at least make sense individually, whereas the initial three characters in the order 5 version do not represent a word at all.
    In the second row, the order 5 result is incorrect because the second component does not represent a word.
    In the order 3 result, the first word, containing two characters, is a person's name.
    The second word could also be correct as it stands, though it
