.adopt. less &#8226; of ar, theoreti-7. cal and more of an engineering perspective, focusing on morphological generation in the context of wide-coverage practical NLG applications.
    There are also parallels to research in the two-level morphology framework (Koskenniemi, 1983), although in contrast to our approach this framework has required exhaustive lexica and hand-crafted morphological (unification) grammars in addition to orthographic descriptions (van Noord, 1991; Ritchie et al., 1992).
    The SRI Core Language Engine (Alshawi, 1992) uses a set of declarative segmentation rules which are similar in content to our rules and are used in reverse to generate word forms.
    The system, however, is not freely available, again requires an exhaustive stem lexicon, and the rules are not compiled into an efficiently executable finite-state machine but are only interpreted.
    The work that is perhaps the most similar in spirit to ours is that of the LADL group, in their compilation of large lexicons of infle
