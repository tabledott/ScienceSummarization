and thereby learn from all these translation fragments.
    This situation is illustrated in Figure 2 where the non-translated adjective red means neither segmentation is &#8216;correct&#8217;, although both together present positive evidence for the two lexical translations.
    We present efficient methods for training and prediction, demonstrating their scaling properties by training on more than a hundred thousand training sentences.
    Finally, we stress that our main findings are general ones.
    These results could &#8211; and should &#8211; be applied to other models, discriminative and generative, phrase- and syntax-based, to further progress the state-of-the-art in machine translation.
  
  
    A synchronous context free grammar (SCFG) consists of paired CFG rules with co-indexed nonterminals (Lewis II and Stearns, 1968).
    By assigning the source and target languages to the respective sides of a SCFG it is possible to describe translation as the process of parsing the source sentence using a C
