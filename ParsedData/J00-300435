all spaces, and randomly chose five segments as test files.
    The results show an error rate varying from 1.2% to 6.6%.
    The resulting F-measures indicate that the new algorithm performs better than the one described in Hockenmaier and Brew (1998), who report an F-measure of 87.9 using trigram rules.
    This is particularly significant because the two algorithms use training and test data from the same source.
    The results were also verified by checking them manually.
    This produces slightly different results, for two reasons.
    Firstly, human judgment sometimes accepts a segmentation as correct even though it does not correspond exactly with the corpus version.
    For example, the last word in K. is counted as correct even though in the corpus it is written *.
    Pt:tt K. Secondly, improper segmentations such as and g occur in the corpus.
    When the program makes the same mistakes, it counts as correct in automatic checking, but incorrect in manual checking.
    These two kinds of error vir
