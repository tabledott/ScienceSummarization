s is not statistically significant, and choosing the first alternative can be wrong in many of the cases (as seen in the five cases that were observed in the corpus).
    As mentioned above, our motivation was to find a criterion that depends on a dynamic threshold for 151 //52 (or alternatively ni /n2), so that the threshold will be higher when ni and n2 are smaller.
    Our criterion indeed satisfies this requirement.
    If we substitute B, in Equation 4, we get the following equivalent criterion: The above inequality clarifies the roles of the two parameters, a and 0: 0 specifies a lower bound on ln(ni /n2), which is independent of the sample size; a reflects the statistical significance.
    If a is decreased (i.e., we require more confidence), Zl_a will increase, and therefore, the component dependent on the sample size will increase.
    Since this component is in inverse relation to n1 and n2, the penalty for decreasing a increases when the sample size decreases.
    From this analysis we can derive t
