e extent that that node, or one of its descendants, is more likely to appear in that case slot than it is to appear at random.
    An overall measure of the choosiness of a case slot is selectional-preference strength, SR(p), defined as the relative entropy of the posterior probability P(c|p) and the prior probability P(c) (where P(c) is the a priori probability of the appearance of a WordNet node c, or one of its descendants, and P(c|p) is the probability of that node or one of its descendants appearing in a case slot p.) Recall that the relative entropy of two distributions X and Y, D(X||Y), is the inefficiency incurred by using an encoding optimal for Y to encode X.
    The degree to which a case slot selects for a particular node is measured by selectional association.
    In effect, the selectional associations divide up the selectional preference strength for a case slot among that slot&#8217;s possible fillers.
    Selectional association is defined as To compute &#923;R(p, c), what is needed is a dist
