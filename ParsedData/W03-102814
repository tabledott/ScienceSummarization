 frequency and the collection frequency were not weighted together, but kept as two distinct features.
    In addition, the real values were not discretised, only rounded off to two decimals, thus more decisionmaking was handed over to the algorithm.
    The collection frequency was calculated for the three data sets separately.
    In addition, experiments with a fourth feature were performed.
    This is the POS tag or tags assigned to the term by the same partial parser used for finding the chunks and the tag patterns.
    When a term consists of several tokens, the tags are treated like a sequence.
    As an example, an extracted phrase like random JJ excitations NNS gets the atomic feature value JJ NNS.
    In case a term occurs more than once in the document, the tag or tag sequence assigned is the most frequently occurring one for that term in the entire document.
    In case of a draw, the first occurring one is assigned.
    As usual in machine learning, the input to the learning algorithm consists o
