    There are many different approaches to parser adaptation.
    Steedman et al. (2003) apply cotraining to parser adaptation and find that cotraining can work across domains.
    The need to parse biomedical literature inspires (Clegg and Shepherd, 2005; Lease and Charniak, 2005).
    Clegg and Shepherd (2005) provide an extensive side-by-side performance analysis of several modern statistical parsers when faced with such data.
    They find that techniques which combine differBrown test corpora using different WSJ and Brown training sets.
    Gildea evaluates on sentences of length &#8804; 40, Bacchiani on all sentences. ent parsers such as voting schemes and parse selection can improve performance on biomedical data.
    Lease and Charniak (2005) use the Charniak parser for biomedical data and find that the use of out-of-domain trees and in-domain vocabulary information can considerably improve performance.
    However, the work which is most dir
