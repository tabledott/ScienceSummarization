ssification-based approaches used features derived from a window of the token in question, thus, they exploited the relationship among the tokens and their contexts) can be utilized while Wikipedia weasels have a diverse nature.
    Another observation is that the top systems in both Task1B and Task1W are the ones which did not derive features from syntactic parsing.
    Each Task2 system was built upon a Task1 system, i.e.
    they attempted to recognize the scopes for the predicted cue phrases (however, Zhang et al. (2010) have argued that the objective functions of Task1 and Task2 cue detection problems are different because of sentences containing multiple hedge spans).
    Most systems regarded multiple cues in a sentence to be independent from each other and formed different classification instances from them.
    There were three systems which incorporated information about other hedge cues (e.g.
    their distance) of the sentence into the feature space and Zhang et al. (2010) constructed a cascade sy
