the longest substring matching 0 is preferred over shorter overlapping matches: The operators can be redefined and combined in different ways to model other regimes for overlap resolution.
    A rule contains the special boundary marker # when the rewriting it describes is conditioned by the beginning or end of the string.
    The boundary marker only makes sense when it appears in the context parts of the rule; specifically, when it occurs at the left end of a left-context string or the right end of a right-context string.
    No special treatment for the boundary marker would be required if # appeared as the first and last character of every input and output string and nowhere else.
    If this were the case, the compositional cascades above would model exactly the intended interpretation wherein the application of the rule is edge-sensitive.
    Ordinary input and output strings do not have this characteristic, but a simple modification of the Prologue relation can simulate this situation.
