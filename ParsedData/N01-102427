en X and Z according to Figure 5: graphs, we will follow our earlier approach and only function BranchProbBetween(X,Z) prob=0 foreach independent path &#338;j return prob If the returned probability exceeds T5, we declare X and Z to be morphological variants of each other.
  
  
    We compare this improved algorithm to our former algorithm (Schone and Jurafsky (2000)) as well as to Goldsmith's Linguistica (2000).
    We use as input to our system 6.7 million words of English newswire, 2.3 million of German, and 6.7 million of Dutch.
    Our gold standards are the hand-tagged morphologically-analyzed CELEX lexicon in each of these languages (Baayen, et al., 1993).
    We apply the algorithms only to those words of our corpora with frequencies of 10 or more.
    Obviously this cutoff slightly limits the generality of our results, but it also greatly decreases processing time for all of compare induced conflation sets to those of CELEX.
    To evaluate, we compute the number of correct (C), inserted (I), and de
