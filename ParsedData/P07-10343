n this paper, we study the domain adaptation problem from the instance weighting perspective.
    In general, the domain adaptation problem arises when the source instances and the target instances are from two different, but related distributions.
    We formally analyze and characterize the domain adaptation problem from this distributional view.
    Such an analysis reveals that there are two distinct needs for adaptation, corresponding to the different distributions of instances and the different classification functions in the source and the target domains.
    Based on this analysis, we propose a general instance weighting method for domain adaptation, which can be regarded as a generalization of an existing approach to semi-supervised learning.
    The proposed method implements several adaptation heuristics with a unified objective function: (1) removing misleading training instances in the source domain; (2) assigning more weights to labeled target instances than labeled source instances; (3) augment
