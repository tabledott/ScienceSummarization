    The feasibility and usefulness of our approach has been investigated in a preliminary way by analyzing a small corpus of 26 Ted Briscoe and John Carroll Generalized Probabilistic LR Parsing definitions drawn from the Dictionary of Contemporary English (Procter 1978).
    This corpus was chosen because the vocabulary employed is restricted (to approximately 2,000 morphemes), average definition length is about 10 words (with a maximum of around 30), and each definition is independent, allowing us to ignore phenomena such as ellipsis.
    In addition, the language of definitions represents a recognizable sublanguage, allowing us to explore the task of tuning a general purpose grammar.
    The results reported below suggest that probabilistic information concerning the frequency of occurrence of syntactic rules correlates in a useful (though not absolute) way with the semantically and pragmatically mos
