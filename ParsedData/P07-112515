 learner returns a labelled data set for each class, from which a classifier can be trained.
    We can easily derive a classifier using the estimates from our learning model by: where a is an arbitrary threshold used to control the precision/recall balance.
    For comparison purposes, we also use Joachims&#8217; SVMlight (Joachims, 1999).
  
  
    To examine the practical efficacy of the learning and classification models we have presented, we use the following experimental method: The batch size for each iteration is set to 0.001 * |U|.
    After each learning iteration, we compute the precision/recall BEP for the spec class using both classifiers trained on the current labelled data.
    We use BEP because it helps to mitigate against misleading results due to discrepancies in classification threshold placement.
    Disadvantageously, BEP does not measure a classifier&#8217;s performance across the whole of the recall/precision spectrum (as can be obtained, for instance, from receiver-operating character
