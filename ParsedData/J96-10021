 based on maximum entropy.
    We present a maximum-likelihood approach for automatically constructing maximum entropy models and describe how to implement this approach efficiently, using as examples several problems in natural language processing.
  
  
    Statistical modeling addresses the problem of constructing a stochastic model to predict the behavior of a random process.
    In constructing this model, we typically have at our disposal a sample of output from the process.
    Given this sample, which represents an incomplete state of knowledge about the process, the modeling problem is to parlay this knowledge into a representation of the process.
    We can then use this representation to make predictions about the future behavior about the process.
    Baseball managers (who rank among the better paid statistical modelers) employ batting averages, compiled from a history of at-bats, to gauge the likelihood that a player will succeed in his next appearance at the plate.
    Thus informed, they manip
