ought of as having two levels, the illocutionary level and the surface level.
    Acts at the illocutionary level model the intentions motivating an utterance independently of the syntactic forms used to indicate those intentions.
    Acts at the surface level are realized by utterances having specific illocutionary force indicators.
    The first illocutionary level act is one by which a speaker informs a hearer that some proposition is true.
    For A to sincerely inform S that P is true, A must believe A knows that P is true and want to inform S that P (the preconditions), and must intend to get S to know that P is true (the effect), which is done by constructing a plan that will achieve S's recognition of this intention (i.e. that Bs(WA(KNOW(S,P)))).
    A then must depend on S to bring about the efiect: S must decide to believe what A said.
    This is made explicit by introducing an admittedly simplistic DECIDE TO BELIEVE act: DECIDE TO BELIEVE(agent, other, P) prec: B(agent,W(other,KNOW(agent,P))) effe
