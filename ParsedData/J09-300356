ng all the polarity features under condition 2, automatic recognition of the polar instances.
    As before, we use the development data to select the parameter settings for each algorithm.
    The settings for polarity classification are given in Table 14.
    They were selected based on the performance of the word+priorpol baseline classifier under condition 2.
    8.2.1 Classification Results: Condition 1.
    The results for polarity classification using all the polarity features, assuming perfect neutral&#8211;polar recognition for step one, are given in Table 15.
    For each algorithm, we give the results for the two baseline classifiers, followed by the results for the classifier trained using all the polarity features.
    For the metrics where the polarity features perform statistically better than both baselines (two-sided t-test, p &#8804; 0.05), the results are given in bold.
    How well do the polarity features perform working all together?
    For all algorithms, the polarity classifier using
