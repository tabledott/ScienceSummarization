    In &#167;3, we will provide a compact representation of an outer polytope &#175;Z(x) &#8839; Z(x) whose integer vertices correspond to dependency trees.
    Hence, the problem of finding the dependency tree that maximizes some linear function of the inci1The general case where A C_ V 2 is also of interest; it arises whenever a constraint or a lexicon forbids some arcs from appearing in dependency tree.
    It may also arise as a consequence of a first-stage pruning step where some candidate arcs are eliminated; this will be further discussed in &#167;4. where only the backbone structure (i.e., the arcs without the labels depicted in Fig.

    A similar idea was aplied to word alignment by Lacoste-Julien that dependency graphs must be trees.
