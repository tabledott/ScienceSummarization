resentations developed for English were straightforwardly applicable to Japanese.
    This section provides a brief overview of those cases where the Japanese constructions we encountered led to innovations in the semantic representations and/or the correspondence between syntactic and semantic structures.
    Due to space limitations, we discuss these analyses in general terms and omit technical details.
    2.l Nominalization and Verbal Nouns Nominalization is of course attested in English and across languages.
