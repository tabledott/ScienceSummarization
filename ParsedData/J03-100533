    We now compare the new word reordering approach with the approach used in Berger et al. (1996).
    In the approach presented in this article, source sentence words are aligned with hypothesized target sentence words.3 When a source sentence word is aligned, we say its position is covered.
    During the search process, a partial hypothesis is extended by choosing an uncovered source sentence position, and this choice is restricted.
    Only one of the first n uncovered positions in a coverage set may be chosen, where n is set to 4.
    This choice is illustrated in Figure 9.
    In the figure, covered positions are marked by a filled circle, and uncovered positions are marked by an unfilled circle.
    Positions that may be covered next are marked by an unfilled square.
    The restrictions for a coverage set C can be expressed in terms of the expression u(C) defined in the previous section: The number of uncovered source sentence positions to the left of the rightmost covered position.
