    In a text about a basketball game, for example, we might find &amp;quot;the score,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;the hoop&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;the bleachers.&amp;quot; Although they may that our independent existentials roughly equate to her new class, our associative existentials to her inferable class, and our referentials to her evoked class. not have direct antecedents in the text, we understand what they mean because they are all associated with basketball games.
    In isolation, a reader would not necessarily understand the meaning of &amp;quot;the score&amp;quot; because context is needed to disambiguate the intended word sense and provide a complete specification.
    Because associative NPs represent less than 10% of the existential NPs in our corpus, our efforts were directed at automatically identifying independent existentials.
