ion of methods that exploit structure in complex problems, using methods such as dual decomposition or Lagrangian relaxation (Lemar&#180;echal, 2001).
    Thus far, however, these methods are not widely used in NLP.
    This paper introduces algorithms for nonprojective parsing based on dual decomposition.
    We focus on parsing algorithms for non-projective head automata, a generalization of the head-automata models of Eisner (2000) and Alshawi (1996) to nonprojective structures.
    These models include nonprojective dependency parsing models with higherorder (e.g., sibling and/or grandparent) dependency relations as a special case.
    Although decoding of full parse structures with non-projective head automata is intractable, we leverage the observation that key components of the decoding can be efficiently computed using combinatorial algorithms.
    In particular, In this paper we first give the definition for nonprojective head automata, and describe the parsing algorithm.
    The algorithm can be vie
