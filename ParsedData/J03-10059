|e0) is trained along with the regular translation probabilities.
    Fertilities: A single target word e may be aligned to n = 0,1 or more source words.
    This is explicitly modeled by the fertility parameter &#966;(n  |e): the probability that the target word e is translated by n source words is &#966;(n  |e).
    The fertility for the &#8220;null&#8221; word is treated specially (for details see Brown et al. [1993]).
    Berger et al. (1996) describes the extension of a partial hypothesis by a pair of target words (e', e), where e' is not connected to any source word f. In this case, the so-called spontaneous target word e' is accounted for with the fertility.
    Here, the translation probability &#966;(0  |e') and notranslation probability p(f  |e').
    Class-based distortion probabilities: When covering a source sentence position j, we use distortion probabilities that depend on the previously covered source sentence positions (we say that a source sentence position j is covered for a partial hypothe
