 engines, these features are immediately available for quality prediction from the internal trace of the MT decoder (in a glass-box prediction scenario), and its contribution is significant.
    These features, which reflect the &#8220;confidence&#8221; of the SMT system on the translations it produces, have been shown to be complementary to other, system-independent (black-box) features.
    For example, the &#8220;SDLLW&#8221; submissions incorporate these features, and their feature selection strategy consistently favored this feature set.
    The power of this set of features alone is enough to yield (when used with an M5P model) outputs that would have been placed 4th in the ranking task and 5th in the scoring task, a remarkable achievement.
    Another interesting feature used by the &#8220;SDLLW&#8221; submissions rely on pseudo-references, i.e., translations produced by other MT systems for the same input sentence.
