of (Faust, made a deal with, the devil).
    This type of error is caused by improper handling of relation phrases that are expressed by a combination of a verb with a noun, such as light verb constructions (LVCs).
    An LVC is a multi-word expression composed of a verb and a noun, with the noun carrying the semantic content of the predicate (Grefenstette and Teufel, 1995; Stevenson et al., 2004; Allerton, 2002).
    Table 2 illustrates the wide range of relations expressed this way, which are not captured by existing open extractors.
    Our syntactic constraint leads the extractor to include nouns in the relation phrase, solving this problem.
    Although the syntactic constraint significantly reduces incoherent and uninformative extractions, it allows overly-specific relation phrases such as is offering only modest greenhouse gas reduction targets at.
    To avoid overly-specific relation phrases, we introduce an intuitive lexical constraint: a binary relation phrase ought to appear with at least a minima
