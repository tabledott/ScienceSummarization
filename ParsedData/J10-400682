  Again, the TypeDM model has an excellent performance.
    On the ESSLLI 2008 set, it outperforms the best configuration of the best shared task system among those that did three-level categorization (Katrenko&#8217;s), despite the fact that the latter uses the full Web as a corpus and manually crafted patterns to improve feature extraction.
    TypeDM&#8217;s performance is equally impressive on the AP set, where it outperforms AttrValue-05, the best unsupervised model by the data set proponents, trained on the full Web.
    Interestingly, the DepPath model of Rothenh&#168;ausler and Sch&#168;utze (2009), which is the only one outperforming TypeDM on the AP set, is another structured model with dependency-based link-mediated features, which would fit well into the DM framework.
    TypeDM&#8217;s purity is extremely high with the Battig set as well, although here it is outperformed by the unstructured Win model.
    Our top two performances are higher than Strudel, the best model by the proponents of the ta
