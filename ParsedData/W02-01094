ges, we believe that Python offers an especially good fit to the above requirements.
    Python is an object-oriented scripting language developed by Guido van Rossum and available on all platforms (www.python.org).
    Python offers a shallow learning curve; it was designed to be easily learnt by children (van Rossum, 1999).
    As an interpreted language, Python is suitable for rapid prototyping.
    Python code is exceptionally readable, and it has been praised as &#8220;executable pseudocode.&#8221; Python is an object-oriented language, but not punitively so, and it is easy to encapsulate data and methods inside Python classes.
    Finally, Python has an interface to the Tk graphics toolkit (Lundh, 1999), and writing graphical interfaces is straightforward.
  
  
    Several criteria were considered in the design and implementation of the toolkit.
    These design criteria are listed in the order of their importance.
    It was also important to decide what goals the toolkit would not attempt to accompli
