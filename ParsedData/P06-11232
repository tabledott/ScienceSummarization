  The word alignments that are the least complex on our measure coincide with those that can be generated by an inversion transduction grammar (ITG).
    Following Wu (1997), the prevailing opinion in the research community has been that more complex patterns of word alignment in real bitexts are mostly attributable to alignment errors.
    However, the experiments in Section 3 show that more complex patterns occur surprisingly often even in highly reliable alignments in relatively simple bitexts.
    As discussed in Section 4, these findings shed new light on why &#8220;syntactic&#8221; constraints have not yet helped to improve the accuracy of statistical machine translation.
    Our study used two kinds of data, each controlling a different confounding variable.
    First, we wanted to study alignments that contained as few errors as possible.
    So unlike some other studies (Zens and Ney, 2003; Zhang et al., 2006), we used manually annotated alignments instead of automatically generated ones.
