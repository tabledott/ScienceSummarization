English words getting substituted with French ones, though not one-for-one and not without changing their order.
    These are important departures from the two applications discussed earlier.
    In the main channel model of Brown et al. (1993), each English word token e, in a source sentence is assigned a &amp;quot;fertility&amp;quot; 0&#8222; which dictates how many French words it will produce.
    These assignments are made stochastically according to a table n(01 e).
    Then actual French words are produced according to s(f le) and permuted into new positions according to a distortion table d(j1i, m, I).
    Here, j and i are absolute target/source word positions within a sentence, and m and I are target/source sentence lengths.
    Inducing n, s, and d parameter estimates is easy if we are given annotations in the form of word alignments.
    An alignment is a set of connections between English and French words in a sentence pair.
    In Brown et al. (1993), alignments are asymmetric&#8212; each Frenc
