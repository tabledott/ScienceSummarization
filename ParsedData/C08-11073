he-art similar ity measures for unary rule learning, we propose a new measure, termed Balanced-Inclusion, which balances the notion of directionality in entailment with the common notion of symmetric semantic similarity.
			In a second approach, unary rules arederived from binary rules learned by state-of-the art binary rule learning methods.
			We tested the various unsupervised unary rule 849learning methods, as well as a binary rule learn ing method, on a test set derived from a standard IE benchmark.
			This provides the first comparisonbetween the performance of unary and binary rule sets.
			Several results rise from our evaluation: (a) while most work on unsupervised learning ignored unary rules, all tested unary methods outperformed the binary method; (b) it is better to learn unary rules directly than to derive them from a binary rule-base; (c) our proposed Balanced-Inclusion measure outperformed all other tested methods interms of F1 measure.
			Moreover, only BalancedInclusion improved F1 score ove
