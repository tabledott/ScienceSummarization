ll the other words being mapped to e, with no constraints on the monolingual head mappings h and g. (This is the approach we take to compound lexical pairings, discussed in Section 4.4.)
    In the hierarchical alignments produced by the training method described here, the source and target strings of a bitext are decomposed into three aligned regions, as shown in Figure 7: a head region consisting of headword w in the source and its corresponding target f(w) in the target string, a left substring region consisting of the source substring to the left of w and its projection under f on the target string, and a right substring region consisting of the source substring to the right of w and its projection under f on the target string.
    The decomposition is recursive in that the left substring region is decomposed around a left headword w1, and the right substring region is decomposed around a right headword w&#8222; This process of decomposition continues for each left and right substring until it only contai
