    Our results suggest that researchers may find it useful to augment standard measures such as BLEU and ROUGE with paraphrasing information thereby taking more semantic knowledge into account.
    In the following section, we provide an overview of existing work on automatic paraphrasing.
    We then describe our paraphrasing algorithm and explain how it can be used in an automatic evaluation setting.
    Next, we present our experimental framework and data and conclude by presenting and discussing our results.
  
  
    Automatic Paraphrasing and Entailment Our work is closely related to research in automatic paraphrasing, in particular, to sentence level paraphrasing (Barzilay and Lee, 2003; Pang et al., 2003; Quirk et al., 2004).
    Most of these approaches learn paraphrases from a parallel or comparable monolingual corpora.
    Instances of such corpora include multiple English translations of the same source text written in a foreign language, and different news articles about the same event.
