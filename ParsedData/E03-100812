Treebank.
    Evaluation was in terms of Parseval (Black et al., 1991), using a balanced F-score over labelled constituents from section 0 of the Treebank.
    I The Fscore values are reported for each iteration of cotraining on the development set (section 0 of the Treebank).
    Since we need to parse all sentences in section 0 at each iteration, in the experiments reported in this paper we only evaluated one of the parsers, the Collins-CFG parser, at each iteration.
    All results we mention (unless stated otherwise) are F-scores for the Collins-CFG parser.
    Self-training experiments were conducted in which each parser was retrained on its own output.
    Self-training provides a useful comparison with co-training because any difference in the results indicates how much the parsers are benefiting from being trained on the output of another parser.
    This experiment also gives us some insight into the differences between the two parsing models.
    Self-training was used by Charniak (1997), where a mo
