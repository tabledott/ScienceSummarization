    Two essential properties of the focusing structure are now clear.
    First, the focusing structure is parasitic upon the intentional structure, in the sense that the relationships among DSPs determine pushes and pops.
    Note however, that the relevant operation may sometimes be indicated in the language itself.
    For example, the cue word first often indicates the start of a segment whose DSP contributes to the DSP of the preceding segment.
    Second, the focusing structure, like the intentional and linguistic structures, evolves as the discourse proceeds.
    None of them exists a priori.
    Even in those rare cases in which an ICP has a complete plan for the discourse prior to uttering a single word, the intentional structure is constructed by the CPs as the discourse progresses.
    This discourse-time construction of the intentional structure may be more obviously true for speakers and hearers of spoken discourse than for readers and writers of texts, but, even for the writer,
