f sophisticated knowledge sources and inference procedures (Charniak, 1972).
    Computational theories of discourse, in particular focusing (see Grosz (1977) and Sidner (1979)) and centering (Grosz et al. (1983; 1995)), have heavily influenced coreference research in the 1970s and 1980s, leading to the development of numerous centering algorithms (see Walker et al.
    (1998)).
    The focus of coreference research underwent a gradual shift from heuristic approaches to machine learning approaches in the 1990s.
    This shift can be attributed in part to the advent of the statistical NLP era, and in part to the public availability of annotated coreference corpora produced as part of the MUC-6 (1995) and MUC-7 (1998) conferences.
    Learning-based coreference research has remained vibrant since then, with results regularly published not only in general NLP conferences, but also in specialized conferences (e.g., the biennial Discourse Anaphora and Anaphor Resolution Colloquium (DAARC)) and workshops (e.g., the
