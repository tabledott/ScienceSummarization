    We adapted the information extraction pattern generation techniques described above to multiple languages.
    In particular, the methodology proposed by Ravichandran and Hovy (2002) requires no parsing or other language specific resources, so is an ideal candidate for multilingual use.
    In this paper, we conducted an initial test test of the viability of inducing these information extraction patterns across languages.
    To test, we constructed a initial database of 5 people and their birthdays, and used this to induce the English patterns.
    We then increased the database to 50 people and birthdays and induced patterns for Spanish, presenting the results above.
    Figure 2 shows the top precision patterns extracted for English and for Spanish.
    It can be seen that the Spanish patterns are of the same length, with similar estimated precision, as well as similar word and punctuation distribution as the English ones.
    In fact, the purely syntactic patterns look ident
