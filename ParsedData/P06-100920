between the two tasks is probably a result of the different proportions of word- to sentencealigned data.
    For the French data, where a very large lexicon can be estimated from the million sentence alignments, the sparse word pairs learnt on the word aligned sentences appear to lead to overfitting.
    In contrast, for Romanian, where more word alignments are used to learn the translation pair features and much less sentence aligned data are available, these features have a significant impact on the model.
    Suprisingly the orthographic features actually worsen the performance in the tasks (incidentally, these features help the trial set).
    Our explanation is that the other features (eg.
    Model 1) already adequately model these correspondences, and therefore the orthographic features do not add much additional modelling power.
    We expect that with further careful feature engineering, and a larger trial set, these orthographic features could be much improved.
