inal grammar had obfiptory constraint we wifl re tm the obfiptory constraint.
  NaB constraint in the original grammar will force us to use null constraint ud  not consider the cases where it is not the case that qt I p and q4 m s. If the label of Y is ?
  terminal a then we chouse r such that 6*(p,a) m r. If the constraint at X is s nuU adjoining constraint, hen ?
  (q t ,a )  - r. Case 3: This corresponds to the cue  where ?either the left child V nor the right child Z of the node X is the ancestor of the foot node of a or if a is a initial tree.
  Then qs ~ q8 I q.
  We will ammeiate with Y and 7. the quadruples (p,r,r,q) and (q,u,t) reap.
  The constraints are assigned as before , in this cuse it is dictated by the quadruple (ql,P,t,qt).
  [f it is not the cue  that ql " P and q4 um t, then it becomes an OA constraint.
  The OA and NA constraints at X are treated similar to the previous eMes, and so is the cue  if either Y o1 Z is labelled by a terminal symbol.
  Cuss 4: If (ql,qt,q~bqt) is assort?ted wit
