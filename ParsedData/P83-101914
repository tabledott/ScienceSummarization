rt of the syntactic structure, are to be removed from the syntactic analysis.
    The status of the material that is corrected by selfcorrection and is expunged by the editing rules is somewhat odd.
    I use the term expunction to mean that it is removed from any further syntactic analysis.
    This does not mean however that a self-corrected string is unavailable for semantic processing.
    Although the self-corrected string is edited from the syntactic analysis, it is nevertheless available for semantic interpretation.
    Jefferson (1974) discusses the example (5) ... (thuh] [thiy] officer ... where the initial, self-corrected string (with the preconsonantal form of the rather than the pre-vocalic form) makes it clear that the speaker originally intended to refer to the police by some word other than officer.
    I should also note that the problems addressed by the self-correction component that I am concerned with are only part of the kind of deviance that occurs in natural language use.
