nal function tags, such as -SBJ (subject) or -TMP (temporal modifier), truly problematic cases such as prepositional phrases are often marked with tags such as -CLR (&#8220;closely related&#8221;) or -DIR (&#8220;direction&#8221;), which are not always reliable or consistent indicators that a constituent is a modifier or an argument.
    The Treebank uses various types of null elements and traces to encode non-local dependencies.
    These are essential for our algorithm since they make it possible to obtain correct CCG derivations for relative clauses, wh-questions, and coordinate constructions such as right node raising.
    Their treatment is discussed in Sections 6.2 and 6.3.
  
  
    In order to obtain CCG derivations from the Penn Treebank, we need to define a mapping from phrase structure trees to CCG derivations, including a treatment of the null elements in the Treebank.
    We also need to modify the Treebank where its syntactic analyses differ from CCG, and clean up certain sources of noise that w
