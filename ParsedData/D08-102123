raining paraphrases to have the same syntactic type as the original phrase.
    A thorough manual evaluation found an absolute improvement in quality of 19% using strict criteria about paraphrase accuracy when comparing against a strong baseline.
    The syntactically enhanced paraphrases are judged to be grammatically correct over two thirds of the time, as opposed to the baseline method which was grammatically correct under half of the time.
    This paper proposed constraints on paraphrases at two stages: when deriving them from parsed parallel corpora and when substituting them into parsed test sentences.
    These constraints produce paraphrases that are better than the baseline and which are less commonly affected by problems due to unaligned words.
    Furthermore, by introducing complex syntactic labels instead of solely relying on non-terminal symbols in the parse trees, we are able to keep the broad coverage of the baseline method.
    Syntactic constraints significantly improve the quality of this
