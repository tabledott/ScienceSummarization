    The &#8220;A&#8221; column shows circumfixing performance using the augmented CELEX.
    Space limitations required that we illustrate &#8220;A&#8221; scores for one language only, but performance in the other two language is similarly degraded.
    Boxes are shaded out for algorithms not designed to produce circumfixes.
    Note that each of our additions resulted in an overall improvement which held true across each of the three languages.
    Furthermore, using ten-fold cross validation on the English data, we find that Fscore differences of the S column are each statistically significant at least at the 95% level.
  
  
    We have illustrated three extensions to our earlier morphology induction work (Schone and Jurafsky (2000)).
    In addition to induced semantics, we incorporated induced orthographic, syntactic, and transitive information resulting in almost a 20% relative reduction in overall induction error.
    We have also extended the work by illustrating performance in German and Dutch wher
