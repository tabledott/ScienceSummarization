bcategorization information, that is, the number and directionality of expected arguments.
    English intransitive verbs and verb phrases have the category S\NP: they take a (subject) NP to their left as argument and yield a sentence.
    English transitive verbs have the category (S\NP)/NP: they take an (object) NP to their right to yield a verb phrase (S\NP), which in turn takes a (subject) NP to its left to form a sentence S. Each syntactic category also has a corresponding semantic interpretation (here given as a A-expression).
    Hence, the lexical entry for ditransitive give can be written as follows:3 In our translation algorithm, we use simple word&#8211;word dependency structures to approximate the underlying semantic interpretation.
    A universal set of syntactic combinatory rules defines how constituents can be combined.
    All variants of categorial grammar since Ajdukiewicz (1935) and Bar-Hillel (1953) include function application, where a functor X/Y or X\Y is applied to an argument Y: Thes
