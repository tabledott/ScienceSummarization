    The driving force behind this disambiguation algorithm is the uneven distribution of collocations4 with respect to the ambiguous token being classified.
    Certain collocations will indicate one accent pattern, while different collocations will tend to indicate another.
    The goal of this stage of the algorithm is to measure a large number of collocational distributions to select those which are most useful in identifying the accent pattern of the ambiguous word.
    The following are the initial types of collocations considered: For the two major accent patterns of the French word cote, below is a small sample of these distributions for several types of collocations: Position Collocation cote cote -1 w du cote 0 536 la cote 766 1 un cote 0 216 notre cote 10 70 +1 W cote ouest 288 1 cote est 174 3 cote du 55 156 -1-1W,+2W cote du gouvernement 0 62 -2w ,-lw cote a cote 23 0 &#177;k w poisson (in &#177;k words) 20 0 &#177;k w ports (in &#177;k
