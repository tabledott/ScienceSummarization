 case when the subject or the object are present in the gloss, they share the corresponding arguments with the action/state/event predicate For example, the LFT of (a person who backs a politician) the gloss of {supporter, protagonist, champion, admirer, booster, friend} is LFT = [person n#1(2,1) Sz back v#1(e1,114)) politician n#2(x2) (4) The role of complements within a phrase is replicated in the LFTs Predicates geneiated from modifiers share the same arguments with the predicates corresponding to the phrase heads Adjective piedicates share the same argument as the predicate corresponding to the noun they modify An exemplification is the LFT of the gloss of {art if act , artefact}, which maps (a man-made object) into [ object n#1(xi) Sc man-made a#1(x1)] Similarly, the argument of adverbial predicate is the argument marking the eventuality of the event/state/action they modify For example, the gloss of the verb synset {hare} is (run quickly), producing the LFT = [run(ei,a,i,x2) &amp; quickly(e&amp;quot;)]
