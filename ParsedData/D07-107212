mple tree.
			Node 1 has two children, 2 and 3, each of which has one observed terminal child.
			We use L(i) and R(i) to denote the left and right children of node i. In the HMM, the transition parameters of a statespecify a distribution over single next states; similarly, the binary production parameters of a gram mar symbol must specify a distribution over pairs of grammar symbols for its children.
			We adapt theHDP machinery to tie these binary production distri butions together.
			The key difference is that now wemust tie distributions over pairs of grammar sym bols together via distributions over single grammar symbols.
			Another difference is that in the HMM, at each time step, both a transition and a emission are made, whereas in the PCFG either a binary production or an emission is chosen.
			Therefore, each grammar symbol must also have a distribution over the type of rule to apply.
			In a CNF PCFG, there are only two types of rules, but this can be easily generalized to include unary production
