			details.
			For TempEval however, the tasks are defined in a such a way that a simple pairwise comparison is possible since we do not aim to create a full temporal graph and judgements are made in isolation.
			Recall that there are three basic temporal relations (BEFORE, OVERLAP, and AFTER) as well as three disjunctions over this set (BEFORE-OR-OVERLAP, OVERLAP-OR-AFTER and VAGUE).
			The addition of these disjunctions raises the question of how to score a response of, for example, BEFORE given akey of BEFORE-OR-OVERLAP.
			We use two scor ing schemes: strict and relaxed.
			The strict scoring scheme only counts exact matches as success.
			For example, if the key is OVERLAP and the responseBEFORE-OR-OVERLAP than this is counted as fail ure.
