;by interposing an arbitrary, sortally compatible relation between an argument place of the predicate and the actual argument&amp;quot; (ibid., p. 182).
    Stallard notes that &amp;quot;in any usage of the metonomy (sic) operation there is a choice about which of two clashing elements to extend&amp;quot; (ibid.).
    Stallard's work has not yet been implemented (ibid., p. 184).
    Stallard (1987) also briefly discusses anaphora resolution.
    Brown (1990) is beginning research on metonymy and reference resolution, particularly pronouns.
    This should prove a promising line of investigation because metonymy and anaphora share the function of allowing one entity to refer to another entity.
    &amp;quot;The ham sandwich is waiting for his check&amp;quot; (= the male person who ordered the ham sandwich).
    &amp;quot;He is waiting for his check&amp;quot; (= the male person).
    This similarity of function can be seen in comparing (2), which is metonymic, with (14), which is anaphoric.
    Both metonymy an
