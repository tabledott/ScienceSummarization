2 NUMB) = sg in the f-structure description language.
    Given the illustrated correspondence, we also know that fi =4)(ni) and f2=4)(n2).
    Taking all these propositions together, we can infer first that (4)(n SuBJ) = 4)(n2) and then that (4)(M(n2)) SuBJ)=4)(n2).
    This equation identifies the subject in the f-structure in terms of the mother-daughter relation in the tree.
    In LFG the f-structure assigned to a sentence is the smallest one that satisfies the conjunction of equations in its functional description.
    The functional description is determined from the trees that the c-structure grammar provides for the string by a simple matching process.
    A given tree is analyzed with respect to the c-structure rules to identify particular nodes of interest.
    Equations about the f-structure corresponding to those nodes (via 4)) are then derived by substituting those nodes into equation-patterns or schemata.
    Thus, still following Kaplan (1987), if * appears in a schema to stand for the node ma
