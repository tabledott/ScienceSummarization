hrase q yielded by a non-binary node, there is only one &#8216;reordering&#8217; of q, viz. q itself, thus Pr(q &#8212;*q) = 1.
    For a phrase p yielded by a binary node N, whose left child N1 has reorderings pi1 and right child N2 has the reorderings p&#65533;2 (1 G i, j G n), p' has the form pi1pe or p&#65533;2pi1.
    Therefore, Pr(p&#8212;*p') = The figures Pr(IN-ORDER) and Pr(INVERTED) are obtained from the learned reordering knowledge.
    If reordering knowledge is represented as rules, then the required probability is the probability associated with the rule that can apply to N. If reordering knowledge is represented as an ME model, then the required probability is: where r2lIN-ORDER, INVERTED}, and fi&#8217;s are features used in the ME model.
    Let us turn to the computation of the n-best reordering list.
    Let R(N) be the number of reorderings of the phrase yielded by N, then: It is easily seen that the number of S's increases exponentially.
    Fortunately, what we need is merely an n-best l
