	SemEval-2007 Task 15: TempEval Temporal Relation Identification
		The TempEval task proposes a simple way to evaluate automatic extraction of temporalrelations.
		It avoids the pitfalls of evaluating a graph of inter-related labels by defining three sub tasks that allow pairwise eval uation of temporal relations.
		The task not only allows straightforward evaluation, italso avoids the complexities of full tempo ral parsing.
	
	
			Newspaper texts, narratives and other texts describe events that occur in time and specify the temporallocation and order of these events.
			Text comprehen sion, amongst other capabilities, clearly requires the capability to identify the events described in a text and locate these in time.
			This capability is crucial to a wide range of NLP applications, from document summarization and question answering to machine translation.Recent work on the annotation of events and temporal relations has resulted in both a de-facto stan dard for expressing these relations and a hand-builtgo
