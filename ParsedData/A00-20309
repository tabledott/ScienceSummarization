s designed to jointly perform part-of-speech tagging, name finding, syntactic parsing, and relation finding in a single process.
    For each constituent, the head is generated first, followed by the modifiers, which are generated from the head outward.
    Head words, along with their part-of-speech tags and features, are generated for each modifier as soon as the modifier is created.
    Word features are introduced primarily to help with unknown words, as in (Weischedel et al. 1993).
    We illustrate the generation process by walking through a few of the steps of the parse shown in Figure 3.
    At each step in the process, a choice is made from a statistical distribution, with the probability of each possible selection dependent on particular features of previously generated elements.
    We pick up the derivation just after the topmost S and its head word, said, have been produced.
    The next steps are to generate in order: In this case, there are none.
