 those that appear just once in the corpus, that is, hapax legomena.
    The first row of Table 2 gives the frequency of unique words in WSJ-SE, followed by the percentage-point improvements in precision over baseline for unique words in subjective elements marked by two annotators (denoted as D and M in the table).
    The second row gives baseline frequency and precisions.
    Baseline frequency is the total number of words in WSJ-SE.
    Baseline precision for an annotator is the proportion of words included in subjective elements by that annotator.
    Specifically, consider annotator M. The baseline precision of words in subjective elements marked by M is 0.08, Frequencies and increases in precision for words that appear exactly once in the data sets composing OP1.
    For each data set, baseline frequency is the total number of words, and baseline precision is the proportion of words in opinion pieces.
