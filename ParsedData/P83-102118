    [NP Det N n(2,3).
    [There is an N between points 2 and 3 in the input) This example shows that the class of parsing strategies allowed in the deductive approach is broader than what is possible in the chart parsing approach.
    It remains to be shown which of those strategies will have practical importance as well.
  
  
    To implement Earley Deduction with an efficiency comparable, say, to Prolog, presents some challenging problems.
    The main issues are needed and space can be recovered.
    There are two basic methods for representing derived clauses in resolution systems: the more direct copying method, in which substitutions are applied explicitly; the structure-sharing method of Boyer and Moore, which avoids copying by representing derived clauses implicitly with the aid of variable binding environments.
    A promising strategy for Earley Deduction might be to use copying for derived unit c
