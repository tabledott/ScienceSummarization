			TwitterSA(maxconf) was followed by TwitterSA(weights) and TwitterSA(single), both cre 41 ated from a single training data.
			This result shows that computing the prior polarity of the words based on the training data TwitterSA(weights)brings some improvement for this task.
			Twit terSA(voting) obtained the highest error rate among the TwitterSA approaches.
			This implies that, in our scenario, the best way of combining the merits of the individual classifiers is by using a confidence score approach.Unigrams also achieved comparable perfor mances.
			However, when reducing the size of thetraining data, the performance gap between Twit terSA and Unigrams is much wider.
			Figure 3shows the error rate of both approaches3 in function of the training size.
			Similar to subjectivity detection, the training size does not have much influ ence in the error rate for TwitterSA.
			However forUnigrams, it decreased significantly as the train ing size increased.
			For instance, for a training size w
