tical relations between pairs of specific words in the corpus, without the use of any external knowledge or semantic representation.
    We extracted verb&#8211;direct object relations from an automatically parsed version of the British National Corpus, using the parser of Carroll and Rooth (1998).4 Clustering was performed using the probabilistic model of co-occurrence described in detail by Hofmann and Puzicha (1998).
    (For other natural language processing [NLP] applications of the probabilistic clustering algorithm, see, e.g., Rooth [1995], Rooth et al. [1999]; for application to language modeling, see Gildea and Hofmann [1999].
    According to this model, the two observed variables, in this case the verb and the head noun of its object, can be considered independent given the value of a hidden cluster variable, c: One begins by setting a priori the number of values that c can take and using the EM algorithm to estimate the distributions P(c), P(n  |c), and P(v  |c).
