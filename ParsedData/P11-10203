isons to measure the degree of novelty of automatically generated paraphrases.
    We believe that this metric, along with the sentence-level paraphrases provided by our data collection approach, will make it possible for researchers working on paraphrasing to compare system performance and exploit the kind of automated, rapid training-test cycle that has driven work on Statistical Machine Translation.
    In addition to describing a mechanism for collecting large-scale sentence-level paraphrases, we are also making available to the research community 85K parallel English sentences as part of the Microsoft Research Video Description Corpus 1.
    The rest of the paper is organized as follows.
    We first review relevant work in Section 2.
    Section 3 then describes our data collection framework and the resulting data.
    Section 4 discusses automatic evaluations of paraphrases and introduces the novel metric PINC.
    Section 5 presents experimental results establishing a correlation between our automatic
