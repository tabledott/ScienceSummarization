nts that match its boundaries.
    In experiments reported by Hacioglu (Hacioglu, 2004), a mismatch of about 8% was introduced in the transformation from handcorrected constituent trees to dependency trees.
    Using an errorful automatically generated tree, a still higher mismatch would be expected.
    In case of the CCG parses, as reported by Gildea and Hockenmaier (2003), the mismatch was about 23%.
    A more realistic way to score the performance is to score tags assigned to head words of constituents, rather than considering the exact boundaries of the constituents as reported by Gildea and Hockenmaier (2003).
    The results for this system are shown in Table 9. on the PropBank training data.
    Table 10 lists the features used by this classifier.
    For each token (base phrase) to be tagged, a set of features is created from a fixed size context that surrounds each token.
    In addition to the above features, it also uses previous semantic tags that have already been assigned to the tokens contain
