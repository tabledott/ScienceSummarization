ndeau's formalism in a way that captures their efficiency.
    There are some similarities between our work and the work of Koller, McAllester, and Pfeffer (1997), who create a general formalism for handling stochastic programs that makes it easy to compute inside and outside probabilities.
    While their formalism is more general than item-based descriptions, in that it is a good way to express any stochastic program, it is also less compact than ours for expressing most dynamic programming algorithms.
    Our formalism also has advantages for approximating infinite sums, which we can do efficiently, and in some cases exactly.
    It would be interesting to try to extend item-based descriptions to capture some of the formalisms covered by Koller, McAllester, and Pfeffer, including Bayes' nets.
  
  
    In this paper, we have given a simple item-based description format that can be used to describe a very wide variety of parsers.
    These parsers include the CKY algorithm, Earley's algorithm, prefix probab
