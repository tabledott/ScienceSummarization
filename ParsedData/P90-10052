g method based on constraint propagation, using a step-bystep example.
    Formal properties of CDG are discussed in Section 4.
  
  
    Let a sentence s w1w2 wn be a finite string on a finite alphabet E. Let R =-- {r1,r2, ,Tk} be a finite set of rale-ids.
    Suppose that each word i in a sentences has k-different roles ri(i), T2 (i) &#8226; &#8226; &#8226; r (i) &#8226; Roles are like variables, and each role can have a pair &lt;a, d&gt; as its value, where the label a is a member of a finite set L = fat, a2, &#8226; &#8226; &#8226; , ail and the modifies d is either 1 &lt; d &lt; n or a special symbol nil.
    An analysis of the sentence s is obtained by assigning appropriate values to the n x k roles (we can regard this situation as one in which each word has a. frame with k Slots, as shown in Figure 1).
    An assignment A of a sentence s is a function that assigns values to the roles.
    Given an assignment A, the label and the modifiee of a role x are determined.
    We define the following four func
