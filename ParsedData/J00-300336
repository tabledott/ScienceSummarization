t be approximated; in our experiments we summed over the (up to) 2,500 best hypotheses generated by the recognizer for each utterance.
    Care must be taken to scale the recognizer acoustic scores properly, i.e., to exponentiate the recognizer acoustic scores by 1/A, where A is the language model weight of the recognizer.5 5 In a standard recognizer the total log score of a hypothesis Wi is computed as log P(A, IW) + A log P(Wi) &#8212; Wil, where I Wil is the number of words in the hypothesis, and both A and A are parameters optimized to minimize the word error rate.
    The word insertion penalty p, represents a correction to the language model that allows balancing insertion and deletion errors.
    The language model weight A compensates for acoustic score variances that are effectively too large due to severe independence assumptions in the recognizer acoustic model.
    According to this rationale, it is more appropriate to divide all score components by A.
    Thus, in all our experiments, we computed
