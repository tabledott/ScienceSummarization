en the quadriliteral forms would have to be generated on a different base.
    It is in cases like this, of which there in fact many, that the finite-state transducers play a substantive role.
    What is required in this case is a transducer that allows the root tape to remain stationary while the template tape moves over a &amp;quot;G&amp;quot;, provided no spreading will be allowed to occur later to fill consonantal slots that would Given a triliteral and a quadriliteral root, otherwise he unclaimed.
    If extra consonants are the first pair are exactly as one would expect&#8212;the final root consonant is spread to fill the final required, then the first priority must he to let them occupy the slots marked with a &amp;quot;0&amp;quot; in the template.
    Fig.
    1 shows a schema for the transition diagram of a transducer that has this effect.
    I call it a &amp;quot;schema&amp;quot; only because each of the edges shown does duty for a number of actual transitions.
    The machine begins in the &amp;q
