ar to k-best list generation.
    The four rules to the left of the grid can be thought of like a 4-best list for a single &#8722;LM rule item (X --&#65533; cong X); the three items above the grid, like a 3-best list for the single &#8722;LM item [X, 6,8]; and the new items to be deduced, like a k-best list for [X, 5, 8], except that we don&#8217;t know what k is in advance.
    If we could use MERGEPRODUCTS to enumerate the new items best-first, then we could enumerate them until one of them was pruned from the new cell; then the rest of items, which would have a worse score than the pruned item, could be preemptively pruned.
    MERGEPRODUCTS expects its input lists to be sorted best-first, and the &#174; operator to be monotonic in each of its arguments.
    For cube pruning, we sort items (both in the inputs to MERGEPRODUCTS and in the priority queue inside MERGEPRODUCTS) according to their +LM score, including the heuristic function h. The &#174; operator we use takes one or more antecedent items and for
