    Semantic class information has proven to be useful for many natural language processing tasks, including information extraction (Riloff and Schmelzenbach, 1998; Soderland et al., 1995), anaphora resolution (Aone and Bennett, 1996), question answering (Moldovan et al., 1999; Hirschman et al., 1999), and prepositional phrase attachment (Brill and Resnik, 1994).
    Although some semantic dictionaries do exist (e.g., WordNet (Miller, 1990)), these resources often do not contain the specialized vocabulary and jargon that is needed for specific domains.
    Even for relatively general texts, such as the Wall Street Journal (Marcus et al., 1993) or terrorism articles (MUC4 Proceedings, 1992), Roark and Charniak (Roark and Charniak, 1998) reported that 3 of every 5 terms generated by their semantic lexicon learner were not present in WordNet.
    These results suggest that automatic semantic lexicon acquisition could be used to enhance exi
