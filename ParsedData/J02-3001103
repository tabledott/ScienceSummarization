ys that result in similar argument structure, as the semantically based theories of linking advocated by Levin (1993) and Levin and Rappaport Hovav (1996) would predict.
    We hope that corpus-based systems such as ours can provide a way of testing and elaborating such theories in the future.
    We believe that some level of skeletal representation of the relevant aspects of a word&#8217;s meaning, along the lines of Kipper et al. (2000) and of the frame hierarchy being developed by the FrameNet project, could be used in the future to help a statistical system generalize from similar words for which training data are available.
  
  
    Our system is able to label semantic roles automatically with fairly high accuracy, indicating promise for applications in various natural language tasks.
    Semantic roles do not seem to be simple functions of a sentence&#8217;s syntactic tree structure, and lexical statistics were found to be extremely valuable, as has been the case in other natural language processing a
