    Apart from proposals for structural constraints relaxing projectivity, there are dependency frameworks that in principle allow unrestricted graphs, but provide mechanisms to control the actually permitted forms of non-projectivity in the grammar.
    The non-projective dependency grammar of Kahane et al. (1998) is based on an operation on dependency trees called lifting: a &#8216;lift&#8217; of a tree T is the new tree that is obtained when one replaces one 2We use the term edge degree instead of the original simple term degree from Nivre (2006) to mark the distinction from the notion of gap degree. or more edges (i, k) in T by edges (j, k), where j !
    * i.
    The exact conditions under which a certain lifting may take place are specified in the rules of the grammar.
    A dependency tree is acceptable, if it can be lifted to form a projective graph.3 A similar design is pursued in Topological Dependency Grammar (Duchier and Debusmann, 2001), where a dependency analy
