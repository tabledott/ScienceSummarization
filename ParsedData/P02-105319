upervised classification system.
    A limitation of PMI-IR is the time required to send queries to AltaVista.
    Inspection of Equation (3) shows that it takes four queries to calculate the semantic orientation of a phrase.
    However, I cached all query results, and since there is no need to recalculate hits(&#8220;poor&#8221;) and hits(&#8220;excellent&#8221;) for every phrase, each phrase requires an average of slightly less than two queries.
    As a courtesy to AltaVista, I used a five second delay between queries.8 The 410 reviews yielded 10,658 phrases, so the total time required to process the corpus was roughly 106,580 seconds, or about 30 hours.
    This might appear to be a significant limitation, but extrapolation of current trends in computer memory capacity suggests that, in about ten years, the average desktop computer will be able to easily store and search AltaVista&#8217;s 350 million Web pages.
    This will reduce the processing time to less than one second per review.
