 expansion algorithm requires a random sample from the universe of all entity sets that may ever be expanded, where a set represents some concept such as Stage Actors.
    An approximation of this universe can be extracted from the &#8220;List of&#8221; pages in Wikipedia2.
    Upon inspection of a random sample of the &#8220;List of&#8221; pages, we found that several lists were compositions or joins of concepts, for example &#8220;List of World War II aces from Denmark&#8221; and &#8220;List of people who claimed to be God&#8221;.
    We addressed this issue by constructing a quasi-random sample as follows.

    Then, for each noun we verified whether or not it existed in a Wikipedia list, and if so we extracted this list.
    If a noun belonged to multiple lists, the authors chose the list that seemed most appropriate.
    Although this does not generate a perfect random sample, diversity is ensured by the random selection of nouns and r
