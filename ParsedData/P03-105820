 0.088 of the accuracy difference between the two approaches.
    That domain dependence is an important issue affecting the performance of WSD programs has been pointed out by (Escudero et al., 2000).
    Our work confirms the importance of domain dependence in WSD.
    As to the problem of insufficient sense coverage, with the steady increase and availability of parallel corpora, we believe that getting sufficient sense coverage from larger parallel corpora should not be a problem in the near future for most of the commonly occurring words in a language.
  
  
    The difference between the accuracy figures of M2 and P2 averaged over the set of all difficult nouns is 0.140.
    This is smaller than the difference of 0.189 between the accuracy figures of M1 and P1 averaged over the set of all difficult nouns.
    This confirms our hypothesis that eliminating the possibility that training and test examples come from the same document would result in a fairer comparison.
    In addition, the difference between
