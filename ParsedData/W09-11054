generate a finite state machine, and a parser.
    The reported results are 95.70% recall and 91.80% precision.
    Sanchez-Graillet and Poesio (2007) present an analysis of negated interactions in 50 biomedical articles and a heuristics-based system that extracts such information.
    The preliminary results reported range from 54.32% F-score to 76.68%, depending on the method applied.
    Elkin et al. (2005) describe a rule-based system that assigns to concepts a level of certainty as part of the generation of a dyadic parse tree in two phases: First a preprocessor breaks each sentence into text and operators.
    Then, a rule based system is used to decide if a concept has been positively, negatively, or uncertainly asserted.
    The system achieves 97.20% recall and 98.80% precision.
    The systems mentioned above are essentially based on lexical information.
    Huang and Lowe (2007) propose a classification scheme of negations based on syntactic categories and patterns in order to locate negated concep
