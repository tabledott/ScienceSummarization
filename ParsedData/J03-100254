t of the time in this procedure is spent on calculating the probability Pr(a'  |e, f) of an alignment a'.
    In general, this takes about (I + J) operations.
    Brown, Della Pietra, Della Pietra, and Mercer (1993) describe a method for obtaining Pr(a' | e, f) incrementally from Pr(a  |e, f) if alignment a differs only by moves or swaps from alignment a'.
    This method results in a constant number of operations that is sufficient to calculate the score of a move or the score of a swap.
  
  
    Analyzing the training program reveals that most of the time is spent on the computation of the costs of moves and swaps.
    To reduce the number of operations required in such computation, these values are cached in two matrices.
    We use one matrix for the scores of a move aj := i: and an additional matrix for the scores of a swap of aj and aj&#65533;: During the hill climbing, it is sufficient, after making a move or a swap, to update only those rows or columns in the matrix that are affected by the move or s
