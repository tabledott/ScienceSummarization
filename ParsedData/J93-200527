    The database of partially parsed sentences provides the raw material for a number of sublanguage analyses.
    This begins the second phase of analysis: querying and thesaurus browsing.
    We construct bracketed noun compounds from our database of partial parses in a two-step process.
    The first simply searches the corpus for (recurring) contiguous seque
