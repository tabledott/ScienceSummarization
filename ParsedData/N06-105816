at projects a word co-occurrence matrix to lower dimensions.
    This lower dimensional representation is then used with standard similarity measures to cluster the data.
    Two words are considered to be a paraphrase pair if they appear in the same cluster.
    We construct 1000 clusters employing the Brown method on 112 million words from the North American New York Times corpus.
    We keep the top 20 most frequent words for each cluster as paraphrases.
    To generate LSA paraphrases, we used the Infomap software4 on a 34 million word collection of articles from the American News Text corpus.
    We used the default parameter settings: a 20,000 word vocabulary, the 1000 most frequent words (minus a stoplist) for features, a 15 word context window on either side of a word, a 100 feature reduced representation, and the 20 most similar words as paraphrases.
    While we experimented with several parameter settings for LSA and Brown methods, we do not claim that the selected settings are necessarily optimal.
