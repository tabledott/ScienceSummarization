ence summaries created by human authors (models).
    Zhou et al. (2006) propose a new metric called ParaEval that leverages an automatically extracted database of phrasal paraphrases to inform the computation of n-gram overlap between peer summaries and multiple model summaries.
    1.3.3 Machine Translation.
    Besides being used in evaluation of machine translation systems, paraphrasing has also been applied to directly improve the translation process.
    Callison-Burch, Koehn, and Osborne (2006) use automatically induced paraphrases to improve a statistical phrase-based machine translation system.
    Such a system works by dividing the given sentence into phrases and translating each phrase individually by looking up its translation in a table.
    The coverage of the translation system is improved by allowing any source phrase that does not have a translation in the table to use the translation of one of its paraphrases.
    For example, if a given Spanish sentence contains the phrase presidente de Br
