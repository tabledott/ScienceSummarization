rom section 7.1.
    The legend indicates the kinds of features used in the target domain (in addition to the standard features).
    For example, &#8220;40k-SCL&#8221; means that the tagger uses features on the outputs of an SCL source tagger trained on forty thousand sentences of WSJ data.
    &#8220;nosource&#8221; indicates a target tagger that did not use any tagger trained on the source domain.
    With 1000 source domain sentences and 50 target domain sentences, using SCL tagger features gives a 20.4% relative reduction in error over using supervised tagger features and a 39.9% relative reduction in error over using no source features.
    Figure 6(b) is a table of accuracies for 500 target domain training sentences, and Figure 6(c) gives corresponding significance scores.
    With 1000 source domain sentences and 500 target domain sentences, using supervised tagger features gives no improvement over using no source features.
    Using SCL features still does, however.
    We emphasize the importance o
