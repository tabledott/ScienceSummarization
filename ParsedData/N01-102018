   Table 6 presents results for different choices of word coverage: the subset of existing pairs for English-Spanish, the union over all languages, and the intersection of all languages.
    Trends across subsets are relatively consistent.
    As an illustration, Table 7 shows consensus formation on English-Norweigian and English-Portuguese translation mappings via multiple bridge languages.
    Note that the English-French dictionary used here has no entry for &amp;quot;bait&amp;quot;, preventing its use as a bridge language for this word.
    As can be seen in Table 6, the distance-based combination methods are more successful at combining the different proposals than the rank-N combinations.
    One possible explanation for this is that rankbased classifiers pick the candidate with the best allaround distance, while distance-based combinations choose the single best candidate.
    Choosing the best all-around performer is detrimental when cognates exist for some languages but not for others.
