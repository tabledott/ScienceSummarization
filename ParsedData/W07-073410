ure in order to avoid over-fitting.
    When n systems were available for a particular language, we train the parameters n times, leaving one system out in each training, and pooling the segments from all other systems.
    The final parameter values are calculated as the mean of the n sets of trained parameters that were obtained.
    When evaluating a set of parameters on test data, we compute segment-level correlation with human judgments for each of the systems in the test set and then report the mean over all systems.
    The optimal parameter values found are somewhat different than our previous metric parameters (lower values for all three parameters).
    The new parameters result in moderate but noticeable improvements in correlation with human judgments on both training and testing data.
    Tests for statistical significance using bootstrap sampling indicate that the differences in correlation levels are all significant at the 95% level.
    Another interesting observation is that precision receive
