nce improvement, but those rules consisting of more than three sub-trees have almost no contribution.
    The rest of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 reviews previous work.
    Section 3 elaborates the modelling process while Sections 4 and 5 discuss the training and decoding algorithms.
    The experimental results are reported in Section 6.
    Finally, we conclude our work in Section 7.
  
  
    Many techniques on linguistically syntax-based SMT have been proposed in literature.
    Yamada and Knight (2001) use noisy-channel model to transfer a target parse tree into a source sentence.
    Eisner (2003) studies how to learn non-isomorphic tree-to-tree/string mappings using a STSG.
    Ding and Palmer (2005) propose a syntax-based translation model based on a probabilistic synchronous dependency insertion grammar.
    Quirk et al. (2005) propose a dependency treelet-based translation model.
    Cowan et al. (2006) propose a featurebased discriminative model for target language syntactic struc
