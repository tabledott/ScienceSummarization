nd-order clusters (i.e., clusters of clusters) per domain.
    In the LAB domain there are 54 second-order clusters, and in the FINANCE domain there are 67.
    The time complexity of searching for metaphorical interconcept mappings between two domains is proportional to the number of pairs of salient domain objects, so it is more efficient to search over pairs of salient clusters than over the more numerous individual salient nodes.
    Table 2 shows a MILITARY cluster.
    These clusters are helpful for finding verbs with similar, but not identical, selectional preferences.
    Although attack, for instance, does not select for fortification, it does select for other elements of fortification&#8217;s cluster, such as building and defensive structure.
    The fundamental limitation of WordNet with respect to selectional-preference learning is that it fails to exhaust all possible lexical relationships.
    WordNet can hardly be blamed: The task of recording all possible relationships between all English word
