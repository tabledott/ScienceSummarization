			2.2 Other Components.
			While the ME classifier constitutes the core of thesystem, it is only one of several processing com ponents that refines or blocks the system?s output.
			Since the goal of an error detection system is to provide diagnostic feedback to a student, typically a system?s output is heavily constrained so that it minimizes false positives (i.e., the system tries toavoid saying a writer?s preposition is used incor rectly when it is actually right), and thus does not mislead the writer.Pre-Processing Filter: A pre-processing pro gram skips over preposition contexts that contain spelling errors.
			Classifier performance is poor in such cases because the classifier was trained on well-e
