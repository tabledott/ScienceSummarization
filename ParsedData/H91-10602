appears to us that a solution to it is now at hand.
  We propose an evaluation pro- cedure with these characteristics: it judges a parse based only on the constituent boundaries it stipulates (and not the names it assigns to these constituents); it compares the parse to a "hand-parse" of the same sentence from the University of Pennsylvania Tree- bank; and it yields two principal measures for each parse submitted.
  The procedure has three steps.
  For each parse to be evaluated: (1) erase from the fully-parsed sentence all instances of: auxiliaries, "not", pre-infinitival "to", null categories, possessive ndings (% and ), and all word-external punctuation (e.g. "
  , ; - ) ;  (2) recur- sively erase all parenthesis pairs enclosing either a sin- gle constituent or word, or nothing at all; (3) compute goodness cores (Crossing Parentheses, and Recall) for the input parse, by comparing it to a similarly- reduced version of the Penn Treebank parse of the same sentence.
  For example, for the Brown Corpus sentence
