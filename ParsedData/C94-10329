  In the forward search, we use a table called parse-list, whose key is the end position of the parse  structure, and wlm,se value is a list of parse structures that have the best partial path scores for each combined state at the end position.
  Function reg is ter - to -parse - l i s t  registers a parse  structure against the parse-list and maintains the best par- tim parses.
  Function get -parse - l i s t  returns a list of parse  structnres at the specified position.
  We also use the fimetion l e l tmost -subst r ings  which returns a list of word  structures in the dictionary whose lexical form matches the substrings tarting at the.
