any subrules) that rewrites a string x to y just in case the pair (x, y) belongs to the relation.
    We remark that there are alternative but perhaps less intuitive proofs of this theorem framed only in terms of simple nonbatch rules.
    But this result cannot be established without making use of boundary-context rules.
    Without such rules we can only simulate a proper subclass of the regular relations, those that permit identity prefixes and suffixes of unbounded length to surround any nonidentity correspondences.
    It is interesting to note that for much the same reason, Ritchie (1992) also made crucial use of two-level boundary-context rules to prove that the relations denoted by Koskenniemi's (1985) two-level grammars are also coextensive with the regular relations.
    Moreover, putting Ritchie's result together with ours gives the following: Ordered rewriting grammars with boundaries and two-level constraint grammars with boundaries are equivalent in their expressive power.
    Although there may
