990) that lacks the adjunction operation.
    (It is also equivalent to top-down tree transducers.)
    What, then, is new here?
    First, we know of no previous attempt to learn the &#8220;chunk-to-chunk&#8221; mappings.
    That is, we do not know at training time how the tree pair of section 1 was derived, or even what it was derived from.
    Our approach is to reconstruct all possible derivations, using dynamic programming to decompose the tree pair into aligned pairs of elementary trees in all possible ways.
    This produces a packed forest of derivations, some more probable than others.
    We use an efficient inside-outside algorithm to do Expectation-Maximization, reestimating the model by training on all derivations in proportion to their probabilities.
    The runtime is quite low when the training trees are fully specified and elementary trees are bounded in size.1 Second, it is not a priori obvious that one can reasonably use STSG instead of the slower but more powerful STAG.
    TSG can be par
