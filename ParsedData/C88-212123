anner  allows lexical items to be recognized.
  Move dot  down and Move dot  up perform a tree traversal that allow the parser to scan the input from left to right.
  The Left P red ic tor  predicts an adjunetion if it is possible.
  Suppose that the auxiliary tree that we left-predicted has been recognized as far as its foot, then the Left Completor  tries to recognize what was pushed under the foot.
  Once the subtree pushed under the foot has been rec- ognized, the R ight  P red ic tor  tries to recognize the other half of the auxiliary tree.
  If the auxiliary tree has been totally recognized, the Right  Completor  tries to recognize the rest of the tree in which the auxiliary tree has been adjoined.
  The Subst i tu t ion  Pred ic tor  performs the same op- erations as Earleys original predictor.
  It predicts for substitution (when appropriate) all lexical trees or ini- tial trees that could be substituted.
  If the tree that we predicted for substitution has been totally recognized, the Subst i tu t io
