    1996, Vossen 1995), and even general coverage syntactic parsers (e.g., Briscoe and Carroll 1993).
    However, none of these has succeeded in producing the breadth of semantic relations across entire dictionaries that has been produced for MindNet.
    Vanderwende (1996) describes in detail the methodology used in the extraction of the semantic relations comprising MindNet.
    A truly broad-coverage parser is an essential component of this process, and it is the basis for extending it to other sources of information such as encyclopedias and text corpora.
  
  
    The different types of labeled, semantic relations extracted by parsing for inclusion in MindNet are given in the table below: These relation types may be contrasted with simple co-occurrence statistics used to create network structures from dictionaries by researchers including Veronis and Ide (1990), Kozima and Furugori (1993), and Wilks et al. (1996).
