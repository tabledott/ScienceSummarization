and &#8216;lex&#8217; datasets are examples of stochastic attribute value grammars, one with a small set of SCFG-like features, and with a very large set of fine-grained lexical features (Bouma et al., 2001).
    The &#8216;summary&#8217; dataset is part of a sentence extraction task (Osborne, to appear), and the &#8216;shallow&#8217; dataset is drawn from a text chunking application (Osborne, 2002).
    These datasets vary widely in their size and composition, and are representative of the kinds of datasets typically encountered in applying ME models to NLP classification tasks.
    The results of applying each of the parameter estimation algorithms to each of the datasets is summarized in Table 2.
    For each run, we report the KL divergence between the fitted model and the training data at convergence, the prediction accuracy of fitted model on a held-out test set (the fraction of contexts for which the event with the highest probability under the model also had the highest probability under the reference
