 Nevertheless, the analysis of these corpora highlights two important points: Suppose we train a PCFG on a corpus f1 consisting only of two different tree structures: the NP attachment structure labeled (A1) and the VP attachment tree labeled (BO depicted in Figure 3.
    These trees are called the &amp;quot;Penn II&amp;quot; tree representations here because these are the representations used to encode PP modification in version II of the WSJ corpus constructed at the University of Pennsylvania.
    Suppose that (A1) The training corpus&amp;quot;fi.
    This corpus, which uses Penn II tree representations, consists of the trees (Al) with relative frequency f and the trees (Bi) with relative frequency 1 &#8212; f. The PCFG P1 is estimated from this corpus. occurs in the corpus with relative frequency f and (Bi) occurs with relative frequency In fact, in the WSJ corpus, structure (A1) occurs 7,033 times in sections 2-21 and 279 times in section 22, while structure (Bi) occurs 7,717 times in sections 2-21 and 2
