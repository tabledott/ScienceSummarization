lities of the original user input and the suggested correction.
    We then vary that difference across all observed values in small increments, which affects precision and recall: the higher the difference, the fewer instances we find, but the higher the reliability of these instances is.
    This evaluation differs from many of the evaluations reported in the error detection/correction literature in several respects.
    First, the test set is a broad random sample across all proficiency levels in the CLC data.
    Second, it is far larger than any sets that have been so far to report results of preposition/article correction on learner data.
    Finally, we are only considering cases in which the system suggests a correction.
    In other words, we do not count as correct instances where the system's prediction matches a correct preposition/article.
    This evaluation scheme, however, ignores one aspect of a real user scenario.
    Of all the suggested changes that are counted as wrong in our evaluation b
