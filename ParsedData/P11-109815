ng verb-specific roles, starting with seed examples (Swier and Stevenson, 2004; He and Gildea, 2006) and/or knowing the number of roles (Grenager and Manning, 2006; Lang and Lapata, 2010).
    Our previous work (Chambers and Jurafsky, 2009) learned situation-specific roles over narrative schemas, similar to frame roles in FrameNet (Baker et al., 1998).
    Schemas link the syntactic relations of verbs by clustering them based on observing coreferring arguments in those positions.
    This paper extends this intuition by introducing a new vectorbased approach to coreference similarity.
    We learn the roles of cluster C by clustering the syntactic relations RC of its words.
    Consider the following example: where verb:s is the verb&#8217;s subject, :o the object, and p in a preposition.
    We ideally want to cluster RC as: We want to cluster all subjects, objects, and prepositions.
    Passive voice is normalized to active2.
    We adopt two views of relation similarity: coreferring arguments and selection
