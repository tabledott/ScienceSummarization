 that the distribution of entities in locally coherent texts exhibits certain regularities.
    This assumption is not arbitrary&#8212;some of these regularities have been recognized in Centering Theory (Grosz, Joshi, and Weinstein 1995) and other entity-based theories of discourse (e.g., Givon 1987; Prince 1981).
    The algorithm introduced in the article automatically abstracts a text into a set of entity transition sequences, a representation that reflects distributional, syntactic, and referential information about discourse entities.
    We argue that the proposed entity-based representation of discourse allows us to learn the properties of coherent texts from a corpus, without recourse to manual annotation or a predefined knowledge base.
    We demonstrate the usefulness of this representation by testing its predictive power in three applications: text ordering, automatic evaluation of summary coherence, and readability assessment.
    We formulate the first two problems&#8212;text ordering and summary
