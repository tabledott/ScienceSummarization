ased on the Genia corpus (Kim et al., 2008), restricting the community-wide effort to resources developed by a single group for a small subdomain of molecular biology.
    BioNLPST 2011 is organized as a joint effort of several groups preparing various tasks and resources, in which variability is pursued in three primary directions: text types, event types, and subject domains.
    Consequently, generalization of fine grained bio-IE in these directions is emphasized as the main theme of the second event.
    This paper summarizes the entire BioNLP-ST 2011, covering the relationships between tasks and similar broad issues.
    Each task is presented in detail in separate overview papers and extraction systems in papers by participants.
  
  
    BioNLP-ST 2011 includes four main tracks (with five tasks) representing fine-grained bio-IE.
    The GE task (Kim et al., 2011) preserves the task definition of BioNLP-ST 2009, arranged based on the Genia corpus (Kim et al., 2008).
    The data represents a focused dom
