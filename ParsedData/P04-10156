8221; representation described above, the arg max in the set enumerated by the CFG can be found efficiently, using dynamic programming algorithms, without having to explicitly enumerate all members of GEN(x).
    However in many cases we may be interested in representations which do not allow efficient dynamic programming solutions.
    One way around this problem is to adopt a two-pass approach, where GEN(x) is the top N analyses under some initial model, as in the reranking approach of Collins (2000).
    In the current paper we explore alternatives to reranking approaches, namely heuristic methods for finding the arg max, specifically incremental beam-search strategies related to the parsers of Roark (2001a) and Ratnaparkhi (1999).
    We now consider the problem of setting the parameters, &#175;&#945;, given training examples (xi, yi).
    We will briefly review the perceptron algorithm, and its convergence properties &#8211; see Collins (2002) for a full description.
