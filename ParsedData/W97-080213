  The concept of cross-classification is of great importance in the verbal domain as well, where most concepts have several meaning components according to which they could be classified.
    However, relevant information would be lost if only one particular aspect was chosen with respect to hyponymy.
    Verbs of sound for example form a distinct semantic class (Levin et at., in press), the members of which differ with respect to additional verb classes with which they cross-classify, in English as in German.
    According to Levin (in press, 7), some can be used as verbs of motion accompanied by sound (A train rumbled across the loopline bridge.
    ), others as verbs of introducing direct speech (Annabel squeaked, &amp;quot;Why can't you stay with us?&amp;quot;) or verbs expressing the causation of the emission of a sound (He crackled the newspaper, folding it carelessly).
    Systematic crossclassification allows to capture this fine-grained distinction easily and in a principle-based way.
