 ~ be sn anxilinry tree in G with root labelled Y and let "r E D(B).
  We claim that the~ is a B in Gt with the same structure u 0, such that there is n ~, in D(beta~))) where q hu  the same structure as % such that there is no OA constraint in ~.
  le t  X be a node in ~t which wu used in deriving ~,.
  there is n node X in ~ such that X belo ?p to the anxilliary tree 0 f  (with the same structure as 01- There are several rMes to consider - Case 1: X is the ancestor of the foot node of 01, such that the fro?tier of the subtree of 0t rooted at X is wsYw 4 and the fro?tier of the subtree or 7 rooted at X is W|WlZW~W t. Let 6~(qt,w|) an q, 6*(q,wt) - -  q,, 6*(qa,w2) n r, and 6*(r,wt) --  q4.
  Then X will have (ql,q,r,qt) aseocinted with it, and there will be no OA constraint in Case 2: X is the ancestor of the foot node o( Of  and the frontier of the subtree of 0t rooted at X is wsYw 4. let  the frontier of the subtree of "I rooted at X is WsWlW=W t. Then we claim that X in 7 will have amucinted with it the q
