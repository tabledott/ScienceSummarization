cialised generation algorithmfinds the best scoring compression using the grammar rules.
			Cohn and Lapata apply this model to ex tractive compression with state-of-the-art results.
			This model is appealing for our task for severalreasons.
			Firstly, the synchronous grammar provides expressive power to model consistent syntactic effects such as reordering, changes in nonterminal categories and lexical substitution.
			Sec ondly, it is discriminatively trained, which allowsfor the incorporation of all manner of powerful features.
			Thirdly, the learning framework can be tai lored to the task by choosing an appropriate loss function.
			In the following we describe their model in more detail with emphasis on the synchronous grammar, the model structure, and the predictionand training algorithms.
			Section 4 presents our ex tensions and modifications.
