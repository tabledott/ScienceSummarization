ow that parse disambigua- tion using information beyond the lexical type sequence slightly improves tag selection performance.
  Note that in these experiments, the models are used to rank the tag sequences of the possible parses and not to find the most probable tag sequence.
  Therefore tagging accuracy re- sults are higher than they would be in the latter case.
  Since our corpus has relatively short sentences and low ambiguity it is interesting to see how much the perfor- mance degrades as we move to longer and more highly ambiguous sentences.
  For this purpose, we report in Ta- ble 3 the parse ranking accuracy of the Combined model as a function of the number of possible analyses for sen- tences.
  Each row corresponds to a set of sentences with number of possible analyses greater or equal to the bound shown in the first column.
  For example, the first row con- tains information for the sentences with ambiguity ?
  2, which is all ambiguous sentences.
  The columns show the total number of sentences in
