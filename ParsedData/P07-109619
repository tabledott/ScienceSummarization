    In (Daum&#180;e III and Marcu, 2005), the search is resumed after some gold standard compatible hypotheses are inserted into a queue for future expansion, and the weights are updated correspondingly.
    However, there is no guarantee that the updated weights assign a higher score to those inserted gold standard compatible hypotheses.
    In our algorithm, the gold standard compatible hypotheses are used for weight update only.
    As a result, after each sentence is processed, the weight vector can usually successfully predict the gold standard parse.
    Therefore our learning algorithm is aggressive on weight update.
    As far as this aspect is concerned, our algorithm is similar to the MIRA algorithm in (Crammer and Singer, 2003).
    In MIRA, one always knows the correct hypothesis.
    In our case, we do not know the correct order of operations.
    So we use our form of weight update to implement aggressive learning.
  
  
    We apply our guided learning algorithm to POS tagging.
