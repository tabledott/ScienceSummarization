    Implicit Alignments Note that nowhere do we explicitly assign probabilities to morpheme alignments between parallel phrases.
    However, our model allows morphemes to be generated in precisely one of two ways: as a lone stray morpheme or as part of a bilingual abstract morpheme pair.
    Thus, our model implicitly assumes that each morpheme is either unaligned, or aligned to exactly one morpheme in the opposing language.
    If we are given a parallel phrase with already segmented morphemes we can easily induce the distribution over alignments implied by our model.
    As we will describe in the next section, drawing from these induced alignment distributions plays a crucial role in our inference procedure.
    Inference Given our corpus of short parallel bilingual phrases, we wish to make segmentation decisions which yield a set of morphemes with high joint probability.
    To assess the probability of a potential morpheme set, we need to marginalize over all possible ali
