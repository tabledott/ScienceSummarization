able-free logical representations shown in examples throughout this paper.
    For example, Kate &amp; Mooney (2006) present a method (KRISP) that extends an existing SVM learning algorithm to recover logical representations.
    The 1This computation can be performed efficiently by incrementally updating the parse chart used to find y*.
    Inputs: Training set {(xi, zi) : i = 1... n} where each example is a sentence xi paired with a logical form zi.
    Set of NP lexical items ANP.
    Number of iterations T. Learning rate parameter &#945;0 and cooling rate parameter c. Definitions: The function NEW-LEX(y) takes a parse y and returns a set of new lexical items found by splitting and merging categories in y, as described in Section 5.
    The distributions p(y|x, z; B, A) and p(y, z|x; B, A) are defined by the log-linear model, as described in Section 3.3.
    Initialization: WASP system (Wong &amp; Mooney, 2006) uses statistical machine translation techniques to learn synchronous context free grammars conta
