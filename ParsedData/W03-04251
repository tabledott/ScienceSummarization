lassifier (henceforth HMM), similar to the one described in Bikel et al. (1999), a robust risk minimization classifier, based on a regularized winnow method (Zhang et al., 2002) (henceforth RRM) and a maximum entropy classifier (Darroch and Ratcliff, 1972; Berger et al., 1996; Borthwick, 1999) (henceforth MaxEnt).
    This particular set of classifiers is diverse across multiple dimensions, making it suitable for combination: decision arbitrary feature types, while HMM is dependent on a prespecified back-off path.
    The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 describes the features used by the classifiers, Section 3 briefly describes the algorithms used by each classifier, and Section 4 analyzes in detail the results obtained by each classifier and their combination.
  
  
    All algorithms described in this paper identify the named entities in the text by labeling each word with a tag corresponding to its position relative to a named entity: whether it starts/continues/ends a specific na
