 den Bosch, and Weijters 19971), and during tagging, new cases are classified by matching cases with those in memory going from the most important feature to the least important.
    The order of feature relevance is determined by Information Gain.
    For known words, the system used here has access to information about the focus word and its potential tags, the disambiguated tags in the two preceding positions, and the undisambiguated tags in the two following positions.
    For unknown words, only one preceding and following position, three suffix letters and information about capitalization and presence of a hyphen or a digit are used as features.
    The case base for unknown words is constructed from only those words in the training set that occur five times or less. tropy modeling (see Section 2.4): a maximum entropy tagger, called MXPOST, was developed by Ratnaparkhi (1996) (we will refer to this tagger as MXP below).19 This system uses a number of word and context features rather similar to system MB
