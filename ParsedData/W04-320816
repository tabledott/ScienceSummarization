    The results are described in the following sub-sections.
    Since previous works were carried out on different corpora, in different language pairs, we cannot directly compare our method against them.
    However, we implement a baseline method that follows the same &#8220;find-topic-extract-sentence&#8221; principle as in earlier work.
    The baseline method shares the same preprocessing, document matching and sentence matching steps with our proposed method.
    However, it does not iterate to update the comparable document set, the parallel sentence set, or the bilingual lexicon.
    Human evaluators manually check whether the matched sentence pairs are indeed parallel.
    The precision of the parallel sentences extracted is 42.8% for the top 2,500 pairs, ranked by sentence similarity scores.
    There are 110,000 Chinese sentences and 290,000 English sentences in TDT3, which lead to more than 30 billion possible sentence pairs.
    Few of the sentence pairs turn out to be exact translati
