member) has a salience weight associated with it.
    This weight is the sum of the current weight of all salience factors in whose scope at least one member of the equivalence class lies.
    Equivalence classes, along with the sentence recency factor and the salience degradation mechanism, constitute a dynamic system for computing the relative attentional prominence of denotational NPs in text.
    RAP's procedure for identifying antecedents of pronouns is as follows.
    Shalom Lappin and Herbert J. Leass An Algorithm for Pronominal Anaphora Resolution sentence, attempt to identify their antecedents.
    Resolution is attempted in the order of pronoun occurrence in the sentence.
    In the case of lexical anaphors (reflexive or reciprocal pronouns), the possible antecedent binders were identified by the anaphor binding algorithm.
    If more than one candidate was found, the one with the highest salience weight was chosen (see second example of Section 3.1).
    In the case of third person pronouns, resolu
