rts have helped to bring about this change in the speech community, especially the Texas Instruments' Digit Corpus (Leonard 1984), TIMIT and the DARPA Resource Management (RM) Database (Price et al. 1988).
    According to the Linguistic Data Consortium (LDC), the RM database was used by every paper that reported speech recognition results in the 1988 Proceedings of IEEE ICASSP, the major technical society meeting where speech recognition results are reported.
    This is especially significant given that abstracts for this meeting were due just a few months after the release of the corpus, attesting to the speech recognition community's hunger for standard corpora for development and evaluation.
    Back in the 1970s, the more data-intensive methods were probably beyond the means of many researchers, especially those working in universities.
    Perhaps some of these researchers turned to the knowledge-based approach because they couldn't afford the alternative.
    It is an interesting fact that most of the
