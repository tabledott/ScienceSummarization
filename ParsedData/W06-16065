 (7r, F, A) triplets are generated by a stochastic process similar to that used in Data Oriented Parsing models (Bonnema, 2002).
    For example, if we assume that the generative process has already produced the top NP node in Figure 2, then the corresponding partial English parse tree, foreign/source string, and word-level alignment could be generated by the rule derivation r4(r1, r3(r2)), where each rule is assumed to have some probability.
    The extended tree to string transducers introduced by Knight and Graehl (2005) provide a natural framework for expressing the tree to string transformations specific to our SPMT models.
    The transformation rules we plan to exploit are equivalent to one-state xRS top-down transducers with look ahead, which map subtree patterns to strings.
    For example, rule r3 in Figure 1 can be applied only when one is in a state that has a VP as its syntactic constituent and the tree pattern VP(VBG(coming) PP(IN(from) NP)) immediately underneath.
    The rule application outpu
