instead in this paper (more details in section 4). arg max log (  |) Then we assume conditional probability word sequence and F1n = f 1 f2 ... fn is the word-feature sequence.
    In the meantime, NE-chunk tag ti is structural and consists of three parts: Obviously, there exist some constraints between ti &#8722;1 and ti on the boundary and entity categories, as shown in Table 1, where &amp;quot;valid&amp;quot; / &amp;quot;invalid&amp;quot; means the tag sequence ti&#8722;1ti is valid / invalid while &amp;quot;valid on&amp;quot; means ti&#8722;1ti is valid with an additional condition ECi &#8722;1 = ECi .
    Such constraints have been used in Viterbi decoding algorithm to ensure valid NE chunking.
  
  
    As stated above, token is denoted as ordered pairs of word-feature and word itself: gi =&lt; fi , wi &gt; .
    Here, the word-feature is a simple deterministic computation performed on the word and/or word string with appropriate consideration of context as looked up in the lexicon or added to the contex
