ion, which should be possible to find out if we get a good balance of both.
    For the present, we will make the training and test data for the bakeoff available via http://www. sighan.org/bakeoff2003 (subject to the restrictions of the content providers), so that others can better study the results of this contest.
  
  
    First and foremost we wish to thank the following institutions for providing the training and testing data for this bakeoff: Institute of Linguistics, Academia Sinica.
    Institute of Computational Linguistics, Beijing University.
    Language Information Sciences Research Centre, City University of Hong Kong.
    The Chinese Treebank Project, University of Pennsylvania, and the Linguistic Data Consortium.
    Without the generous contribution of these resources, this competition would not have been possible.
    We would also like to thank Martha Palmer for making funds available to pay for translations of the detailed bakeoff instructions, and to Fu-Dong Chiou, Susan Converse and Nia
