rd 'point' itself, and it is easy to identify in them 5 occurrences of the term 'starting point', which is missing from the candidate list (because 'starting' is tagged as a verb).
    To facilitate scanning, concordance lines are sorted so that all occurrences of identical preceding contexts of the head word, like 'starting', are grouped together.
    Since all the words of the document, except for stop list words, appear in the candidate list as single-word terms it is guaranteed that every term that was missed by the automatic procedure will appear in the concordance lines.
    In summary, our algorithm performs the following steps: Using the monolingual component, a terminologist at AT&amp;T Business Translation Services constructs terminology lists at the impressive rate of 150-200 terms per hour.
    For example, it took about 10 hours to construct a list of 1700 terms extracted from a 300,000 word document.
    The tool has at least doubled the rate of constructing terminology lists, which was previous
