 thesaurus are words themselves, rather than senses.
    In order to associate the neighbours with senses we make use of another notion of similarity, &#8220;semantic similarity&#8221;, which exists between senses, rather than words.
    We experiment with several WordNet Similarity measures (Patwardhan and Pedersen, 2003) which aim to capture semantic relatedness within
  
  
    In order to find the predominant sense of a target word we use a thesaurus acquired from automatically parsed text based on the method of Lin (1998).
    This provides the nearest neighbours to each target word, along with the distributional similarity score between the target word and its neighbour.
    We then use the WordNet similarity package (Patwardhan and Pedersen, 2003) to give us a semantic similarity measure (hereafter referred to as the WordNet similarity measure) to weight the contribution that each neighbour makes to the various senses of the target word.
    To find the first sense of a word ( ) we take each sense in t
