    Ravichandran also explored a similar method for question answering (Ravichandran and Hovy, 2002).
    These approaches, however, need a small set of initial seeds.
    It is also unclear how initial seeds should be selected and how many seeds are required.
    Also their methods were only tried on functional relations, and this was an important constraint on their bootstrapping.
    The variety of expressions conveying the same relation can be considered an example of paraphrases, and so some of the prior work on paraphrase acquisition is pertinent to relation discovery.
    Lin proposed another weakly supervised approach for discovering paraphrase (Lin and Pantel, 2001).
    Firstly Lin focused on verb phrases and their fillers as subj
