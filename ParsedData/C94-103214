 last element, equals that of tile previous parse, ignoring the first element.
  The state transition cost of the backward search is the product of the part of speech trigram probability and the word output probability.
  Tile score estimate of the remaining portion of a path is obtained from the parse .prob-so -~ar  slot in the parse structure.
  The backward search generates the N best hypothe- ses sequentially and there is no need to preset N. The complexity of the backward search is significantly less than that of the forward search.
  4 Word  Mode l To handle open text, we have to cope with unknown words.
  Since Japanese do not put spaces between words, we have to identify unknown words at first.
  To do this, we can look at the spelling (character sequence) that may constitute a word, or look at the context o identify words that are acceptable in this context.
  Once word hypotheses for unknown words are gener- ated, the proposed N-best algorithm will find tile most likely word segmentation a d part of
