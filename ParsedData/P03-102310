 of ana, {C1, C2,...,Ck} for i = 1 to K do Score[ i ] = 0; for i = K downto 2 do for j = i &#8211; 1 downto 1 do if CR( inst( ci , cj, ana )) = = positive then While the realization and the structure of the twincandidate model are significantly different from the single-candidate model, the single-candidate model in fact can be regarded as a special case of the twin-candidate model.
    To illustrate this, just consider a virtual &#8220;blank&#8221; candidate C0 such that we could convert an instance inst(ci, ana ) in the single-candidate model to an instance inst(ci , c0, ana) in the twin-candidate model.
    Let inst(ci , c0, ana) have the same class label as inst(ci , ana) , that is, inst(ci , c0, ana) is positive if Ci is the antecedent of ana; or negative if not.
    Apparently, the classifier trained on the instance set { inst(ci , ana) }, T1, is equivalent to that trained on { inst(ci , c0, ana) }, T2.
    T1 and T2 would assign the same class label for the test instances inst(ci, ana ) and inst(ci, c0
