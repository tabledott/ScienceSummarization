ve will, however, only have its full impact when we also widen the issue to reference to sets of objects.
    In the new setting, it will be useful to generalize our earlier notion of intersective completeness (Section 3), calling a GRE algorithm Boolean complete iff it finds a Boolean description of a set whenever one can be given on the basis of the properties in the KB.
    Generating descriptions is even more important if the target is a set than if it is a single object: even if the objects in the set have proper names, the set as a whole may lack a name (and enumerating the objects may be cumbersome).
    Yet, reference to sets has long been disregarded in NLG.
    In this section, we sketch generalizations of D&amp;R that produce descriptions of sets.
    To begin with, the algorithm D&amp;RPlural finds intersections P1 n&#183; &#183; &#183;nPn of atomic properties P1,.

    , Pn whose extension equals a given target set S (van Deemter 2000).
    Since S may or may not be a singleton, D&amp;
