stion parse matches a KB one iff the former is subsumed by the latter).
    When a match occurs, our system then looks for arguments of type in accordance with the question.
    For example, if the question is &#8220;What regulates MIP-1alpha?&#8221;, it searches for the argument type of the relation that contains the argument form &#8220;nsubj&#8221; for subject.
    If such an argument exists for the relation part, it will be returned as the answer.
    Table 1 shows the results for all systems.
    USP extracted the highest number of answers, almost doubling that of the second highest (RS-SUB).
    It obtained the highest accuracy at 88%, and the number of correct answers it extracted is three times that of the second highest system.
    The informed baseline (KW-SYN) did surprisingly well compared to systems other than USP, in terms of accuracy and number of correct answers.
    TextRunner achieved good accuracy when exact match is used (TR-EXACT), but only obtained a fraction of the answers compared to U
