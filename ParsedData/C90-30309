e syntactic constraints in section 7.
  Context-dependent disambiguation constraints The CG formalism will first be illustrated by con- text-dependent disambiguation constraints.
  Sets of grammatical features are needed in the constraints for the purpose of geneialization.
  Each set declara- tion consists of a set name followed by the elements of that set.
  The elements are (strings of) features and/or base-forms occurring in readings: (DET "DET") (N "N") (TO "to") (PREMOD "A" "DET") (NOMHEAD "N NOM" "PRON NOM") (VFIN "V PRES" "V PAST" "V IMP" "V SUBJUNC- TIVE") Each constraint is a quadruple consisting of do- main, operator, target, and context condition(s).
  An example: (@w =0 "PREP" (-1 DET)) other readings.
  The operators are here defined in the procedural mode as performing operations.
  Con- ceptually they just express constraints.
  The context conditions are defined relative to the target reading in position 0.
  Position 1 is one word to the right of 0,-3 three words to the left of 0, etc.
