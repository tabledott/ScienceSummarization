 suspect (and will finish in the future work) that using manual alignments would result in a better correlation, though for the main parsing results (see below) we can only afford automatic alignments in order for our approach to be widely applicable to any bitext.
  
  
    We incorporate the three bilingual features (again, with automatic alignments) into the baseline parser, retrain it, and test its performance on the English dev set, with varying beam size.
    Table 8 shows that bilingual constraints help more with larger beams, from almost no improvement with the deterministic mode (k=1) to +0.5% better with the largest beam (k=16).
    This could be explained by the fact that beam-search is more robust than the deterministic mode, where in the latter, if our bilingual features misled the parser into a mistake, there is no chance of getting back, while in the former multiple configurations are being pursued in parallel.
    In terms of speed, both parsers run proportionally slower with larger beams, as
