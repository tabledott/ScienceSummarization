common in the pattern recognition and speech Table 3: Effect of different error criteria used in training on the test corpus.
    Note that better results correspond to larger BLEU and NIST scores and to smaller error rates.
    Italic numbers refer to results for which the difference to the best result (indicated in bold) is not statistically significant. recognition community (Duda and Hart, 1973; Juang et al., 1995; Schl&#168;uter and Ney, 2001).
    Paciorek and Rosenfeld (2000) use minimum classification error training for optimizing parameters of a whole-sentence maximum entropy language model.
    A technically very different approach that has a similar goal is the minimum Bayes risk approach, in which an optimal decision rule with respect to an application specific risk/loss function is used, which will normally differ from Eq.
    3.
    The loss function is either identical or closely related to the final evaluation criterion.
    In contrast to the approach presented in this paper, the training cri
