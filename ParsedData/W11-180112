e resources for the advancement of fine-grained IE in biology and biomedicine, and demonstrated that event extraction methods can successfully generalize to new text types, event types, and domains.
    However, the goal to observe the capacity of supporting tasks to assist the main tasks was not met.
    The entire shared task period was very long, more than 6 months, and the complexity of the task was high, which could be an excessive burden for participants, limiting the application of novel resources.
    There have been ongoing efforts since BioNLP-ST 2009 to develop IE systems based on the task resources, and we hope to see continued efforts also following BioNLP-ST 2011, especially exploring the use of supporting task resources for main tasks.
