 have been shown to improve the accuracy of a Chinese POS tagger (Tseng et al., 2005).
    In the joint model, these features also represent segmentation information, since they concern the starting and ending characters of a word.
    Development tests showed that the overall tagging F-score of the joint model increased from 84.54% to 84.93% using the character category features.
    In the development test, the use of the tag dictionary improves the decoding speed of the joint model, reducing the decoding time from 416 seconds to 256 seconds.
    The overall tagging accuracy also increased slightly, consistent with observations from the pure POS tagger.
    The error analysis for the development test is shown in Table 3.
    Here an error is counted when a word in the standard output is not produced by the decoder, due to incorrect segmentation or tag assignment.
    Statistics about the six most frequently mistaken tags are shown in the table, where each row presents the analysis of one tag from the standa
