hrases such as NP &#8594; NP CC or NP &#8594; NP CC NP NP.
    For this reason we alter the generative process to allow generation of both the coordinator and the following phrase in one step; instead of just generating a nonterminal at each step, a nonterminal and a binary-valued coord flag are generated. coord = 1 if there is a coordination relationship.
    In the generative process, generation of a coord = 1 flag along with a modifier triggers an additional step in the generative (a) The generic way of annotating coordination in the treebank.
    (b) and (c) show specific examples (with base-NPs added as described in section 4.1).
    Note that the first item of the conjunct is taken as the head of the phrase. process, namely, the generation of the coordinator tag/word pair, parameterized by the P,, parameter.
    For the preceding example this would give probability Note the new type of parameter, P,,, for the generation of the coordinator word and POS tag.
