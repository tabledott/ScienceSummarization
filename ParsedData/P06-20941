in most types of text are regularities of information structure - events which are reported many times, about different individuals, in different forms, such as layoffs or mergers and acquisitions in news articles.
    The goal of information extraction (IE) is to extract such information: to make these regular structures explicit, in forms such as tabular databases.
    Once the information structures are explicit, they can be processed in many ways: to mine information, to search for specific information, to generate graphical displays and other summaries.
    However, at present, a great deal of knowledge for automatic Information Extraction must be coded by hand to move a system to a new topic.
    For example, at the later MUC evaluations, system developers spent one month for the knowledge engineering to customize the system to the given test topic.
    Research over the last decade has shown how some of this knowledge can be obtained from annotated corpora, but this still requires a large amount of ann
