 and I(x,y| t2) are the temporal mutual information in time t1 and t2, respectively.

			Event Detection.
			Event detection aims to identify the collocations resulting in events and then retrieve the description of events.
			Figure 1 sketches an example of event detection.
			The weblog is parsed into a set of collocations.
			All collocations are processed and monitored to identify the plausible events.
			Here, a regular event ?Mother?s day?
			and an irregular event ?Typhoon Chanchu?
			are detected.
			The event ?Typhoon Chanchu?
			is described by the words Figure 1: An Example of Event Detection ?Typhoon?, ?Chanchu?, ?2k?, ?Eye?, ?Path?
			and ?chinaphillippine?.
			The architecture of an event detection system includes a preprocessing phase for parsing the weblogs and retrieving the collocations; an event detection phase detecting the unusual peak of the change of temporal mutual information and identifying the set of collocations which may result in an event in a specific time duration; and an
