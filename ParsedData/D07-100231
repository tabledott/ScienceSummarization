d,our job is done; if no answer is returned, the ques tion is passed on to SynMatch.
			Our results are givenin Table 3.
			+SemMatch and +SemParse are ensem ble systems using SynMatch together with the QAspecific role labeling method proposed in this pa per and Shalmaneser, respectively.
			We also compare these systems against SynMatch on its own.We can now attempt to answer our third ques tion concerning our model?s performance on theTREC data.
			Our experiments show that a FrameNet enhanced answer extraction module significantlyoutperforms a similar module that uses only syntactic information (compare SynMatch and +Sem Match in Table 3).
			Another interesting finding is that 19 the shallow semantic parser performs considerably worse in comparison to our graph-based models and the syntax-based system.
			Inspection of the parser?s output highlights two explanations for this.
			First, theshallow semantic parser has difficulty assigning ac curate semantic roles to questions (even when theyare reformulated
