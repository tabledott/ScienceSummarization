 is associated with each vertex, which represents the &#8220;importance&#8221; of the vertex within the graph.
    Notice that the final values obtained after TextRank runs to completion are not affected by the choice of the initial value, only the number of iterations to convergence may be different.
    It is important to notice that although the TextRank applications described in this paper rely on an algorithm derived from Google&#8217;s PageRank (Brin and Page, 1998), other graph-based ranking algorithms such as e.g.
    HITS (Kleinberg, 1999) or Positional Function (Herings et al., 2001) can be easily integrated into the TextRank model (Mihalcea, 2004).
    Although traditionally applied on directed graphs, a recursive graph-based ranking algorithm can be also applied to undirected graphs, in which case the outdegree of a vertex is equal to the in-degree of the vertex.
    For loosely connected graphs, with the number of edges proportional with the number of vertices, undirected graphs tend to have more
