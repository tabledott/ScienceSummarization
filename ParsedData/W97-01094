e rules are then used for PP attachment and therefore, unlike the statistical methods, it is unnecessary to store huge frequency tables.
    Brill and Resnik had reported 81.8% success of this method on 500 randomly-selected sentences.
    The current statistical state-of-the art method is the backed-off model proposed by Collins and Brooks in [C&amp;B95] which performs with 84.5% accuracy on stand-alone quadruples.
    Most of the methods, however, suffer from a sparse data problem.
    All are based on matching the words from the analysed sentence against the words in the training set.
    The problem is that only exact matches are allowed.
    The back-off model showed an overall accuracy of 84.5%, but the accuracy of full quadruple matches was 92.6%!
    Due to the sparse data problem, however, the full quadruple matches were quite rare, and contributed to the result in only 4.8% of cases.
    The accuracy for a match on three words was also still relatively high (90.1%), while for doubles and singles it
