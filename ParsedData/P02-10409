ore, it must distinguish between two human translations of differing quality.
    This latter requirement ensures the continued validity of the metric as MT approaches human translation quality.
    To this end, we obtained a human translation by someone lacking native proficiency in both the source (Chinese) and the target language (English).
    For comparison, we acquired human translations of the same documents by a native English speaker.
    We also obtained machine translations by three commercial systems.
    These five &#8220;systems&#8221; &#8212; two humans and three machines &#8212; are scored against two reference professional human translations.
    The average modified n-gram precision results are shown in Figure 2.
    Each of these n-gram statistics implies the same Phrase (n -gram) Length ranking: H2 (Human-2) is better than H1 (Human1), and there is a big drop in quality between H1 and S3 (Machine/System-3).
    S3 appears better than S2 which in turn appears better than S1.
    Remarkably,
