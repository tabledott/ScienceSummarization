ut results in Figure 2 suggest that the combination of syntactic and lexical features provides better performance than either feature set on its own.
    In order to understand the role of syntactic features, we examine Table 5, the human evaluation of the most frequent 10 relations.
    For the topranking 100 instances of each relation, most of the best results use syntactic features, either alone or in combination with lexical features.
    For the topranking 1000 instances of each relation, the results are more mixed, but syntactic features still helped in most classifications.
    We then examine those relations for which syntactic features seem to help.
    For example, syntactic features consistently outperform lexical features for the director-film and writer-film relations.
    As discussed in section 4, these two relations are particularly ambiguous, suggesting that syntactic features may help tease apart difficult relations.
    Perhaps more telling, we noticed many examples with a long string of wo
