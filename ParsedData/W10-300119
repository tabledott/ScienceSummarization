ccurrences of typical weasel words in non-weasel contexts.
    Each sentence was annotated manually for weasel cues.
    Sentences were treated as uncertain if they contained at least one weasel cue, i.e. the scope of weasel words was the entire sentence (which is supposed to be rewritten by Wikipedia editors).
    Unannotated but pre-processed full biological articles (150 articles from the publicly available PubMedCentral database) and 1 million paragraphs from Wikipedia were offered to the participants as well.
    These datasets did not contain any manual annotation for uncertainty, but their usage permitted data sampling from a large pool of in-domain texts without time-wasting pre-processing tasks (cleaning and sentence splitting).
    Both training and evaluation data were released in a custom XML format.
    For each task, a separate XML file was made available containing the whole document set for the given task.
    Evaluation datasets were available in the same format as training data without any s
