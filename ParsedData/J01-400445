otated training data.
    Their clustering method achieved a balanced Fmeasure of only 53.6% on MUC-6 test data.
    This is to be expected: supervised learning in general outperforms unsupervised learning since a supervised learning algorithm has access to a richer set of annotated data to learn from.
    Since our supervised learning approach requires only a modest number of annotated training documents to achieve good performance (as can be seen from the learning curves), we argue that the better accuracy achieved more than justifies the annotation effort incurred.
  
  
    In this paper, we presented a learning approach to coreference resolution of noun phrases in unrestricted text.
    The approach learns from a small, annotated corpus and the task includes resolving not just pronouns but general noun phrases.
    We evaluated our approach on common data sets, namely, the MUC-6 and MUC-7 coreference corpora.
    We obtained encouraging results, indicating that on the general noun phrase coreference task
