equential transducer can be constructed in such a way that these ambiguities can then be resolved from right to left.
    Figures 7 and 8 give a decomposition of the nonsequential transducer T of Figure 6.
    The symbols of the alphabet Q = {xl, x2} store information about the size of the input string w. The output of L ends with x1 iff I wl is odd.
    The right sequential function R is then easy to construct.
    Mohri Transducers in Language and Speech Sequential transducers offer other theoretical advantages.
    In particular, while several important tests, such as equivalence, are undecidable with general transducers, sequential transducers have the following decidability property Theorem 5 Let T be a transducer mapping E* to A*.
    It is decidable whether T is sequential.
    A constructive proof of this theorem was given by Choffrut (1978).
    An efficient polynomial algorithm for testing the sequentiability of transducers based on this proof was given by Weber and Klemm (1995).
