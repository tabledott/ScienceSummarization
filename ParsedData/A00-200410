).
    Equation 7, 8 and 9 gives the general form of p(samelk), B(r,?) and Berm, respectively'.
    Table 2 presents the experimental results.
    The values in row two and three, four and five are not actually the same.
    However, their differences are insignificant according to the Kolmogorov-Smirnov, or KS-test (Press et al., 1992).
    We compare three versions of the TextTiling algorithm (Hearst, 1994).
    H94(c,d) is Hearst's C implementation with default parameters.
    H94(e.7.) uses the recommended parameters k = 6, w = 20.
    H94(3,,,) is my implementation of the algorithm.
    Experimental result (table 3) shows H94(,,d) and H94(,,) are more accurate than H94(j,,,).
    We suspect this is due to the use of a different stopword list and stemming algorithm.
    Five versions of Reynar's optimisation algorithm (Reynar, 1998) were evaluated.
    R98 and R98(7-&#8222;rn) are exact implementations of his maximisation and minimisation algorithm.
    R98(8,,08) is my version of the maximisation algorit
