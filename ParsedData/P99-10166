 of hypernyms by adding together the vectors of its children.
    We then assign a hypernym to this node by simply choosing the hypernym with the largest value in this vector; that is, the hypernym which appeared with the largest number of the node's descendant nouns.
    (In case of ties, the hypernyms are ordered arbitrarily.)
    We also list the second- and third-best hypernyms, to account for cases where a single word does not describe the cluster adequately, or cases where there are a few good hypernyms which tend to alternate, such as &amp;quot;country&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;nation&amp;quot;.
    (There may or may not be any kind of semantic relationship among the hypernyms listed.
    Because of the method of selecting hypernyms, the hypernyms may be synonyms of each other, have hypernym-hyponym relationships of their own, or be completely unrelated.)
    If a hypernym has occurred with only one of the descendant nouns, it is not listed as one of the best hypernyms, since we have insufficient evidenc
