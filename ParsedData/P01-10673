nced the IBM models by introducing phrases, and Och et al. (1999) used templates to capture phrasal sequences in a sentence.
    Both also tried to incorporate structural aspects of the language, however, neither handles nested structures.
    Wu (1997) and Alshawi et al. (2000) showed statistical models based on syntactic structure.
    The way we handle syntactic parse trees is inspired by their work, although their approach is not to model the translation process, but to formalize a model that generates two languages at the same time.
    Our channel operations are also similar to the mechanism in Twisted Pair Grammar (Jones and Havrilla, 1998) used in their knowledge-based system.
    Following (Brown et al., 1993) and the other literature in TM, this paper only focuses the details of TM.
    Applications of our TM, such as machine translation or dictionary construction, will be described in a separate paper.
    Section 2 describes our model in detail.
    Section 3 shows experimental results.
    We con
