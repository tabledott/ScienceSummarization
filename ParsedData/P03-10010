  Offline Strategies For Online Question Answering: Answering Questions Before They Are Asked
  
    Recent work in Question Answering has focused on web-based systems that answers using simple lexicosyntactic patterns.
    We present an alternative strategy in which patterns are used to extract highly precise relational information offline, creating a data repository that is used to efficiently answer questions.
    We evaluate our strategy on a challenging subset of questions, i.e.
    &#8220;Who is ...&#8221; questions, against a state of the art web-based Question Answering system.
    Results indicate that the extracted relations answer 25% more questions correctly and do so three orders of magnitude faster than the state of the art system.
  
  
    Many of the recent advances in Question Answering have followed from the insight that systems can benefit by exploiting the redundancy of information in large corpora.
