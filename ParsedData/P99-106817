or this reason, and because the human-judged set included only a sample of the full set evaluated by STRAND, it was necessary to extrapolate from the judged (by both judges) set to the full set in order to compute recall/precision figures; hence these figures are reported as estimates.
    Precision is estimated as the proportion of pages judged GOOD by STRAND that were also judged to be good (i.e.
    &amp;quot;yes&amp;quot;) by both judges &#8212; this figure is 92.1% Recall is estimated as the number of pairs that should have been judged GOOD by STRAND (i.e. that recieved a &amp;quot;yes&amp;quot; from both judges) that STRAND indeed marked GOOD &#8212; this figure is 47.3%.
    These results can be read as saying that of every 10 document pairs included by STRAND in a parallel corpus acquired fully automatically from the Web, fewer than 1 pair on average was included in error.
    Equivalently, one could say that the resulting corpus contains only about 8% noise.
    Moreover, at least for the confidently
