unc tions, this requires the true positive counts to be clipped to the number of occurrences of each type in the reference.
			The edit distance is given by: ? edit (y ? ,y) = p+ q ? 2 ? i min(p i , q i ) (7) where p and q denote the number of target tokensin the predicted and reference derivation, respec tively, and p i and q i are the counts for type i. 141 ?ADJP,NP?

			In this section we present our experimental set up for assessing the performance of our model.
			We give details on the corpora and grammars we used, model parameters and features, 6 the baselineused for comparison with our approach, and ex plain how our system out
