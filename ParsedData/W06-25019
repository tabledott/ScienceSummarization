221; in another context.
    The first order context vectors for eat and cutlery are very close to food, since they do not have a sense that is related to tennis.
    The gloss for the word fork, &#8220;cutlery used to serve and eat food&#8221;, contains the words cutlery, serve, eat and food.
    The Gloss Vector for fork is formed by adding the first order context vectors of cutlery, serve, eat and food.
    Thus, fork has a Gloss Vector which is heavily weighted towards food.
    The concept of food, therefore, is in the same semantic space as and is related to the concept of fork.
    Similarly, we expect that in a high dimensional space, the Gloss Vector of fork would be heavily weighted towards all concepts that are semantically related to the concept of fork.
    Additionally, the previous demonstration involved a small gloss for representing fork.
    Using augmented glosses, described in section 3.2, we achieve better representations of concepts to build Gloss Vectors upon.
