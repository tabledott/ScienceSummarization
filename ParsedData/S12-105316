larity metrics.
    Binary entailment decisions are then heuristically combined into single decisions.
    Sagan [pivoting, multi-class] (Castillo and Cardenas, 2012) adopts a pivoting method using Google Translate, and trains a monolingual system based on a SVM multi-class classifier.
    A CLTE corpus derived from the RTE-3 dataset is also used as a source of additional training material.
    SoftCard [pivoting, multi-class] (Jimenez et al., 2012) after automatic translation with Google Translate, uses SVMs to learn entailment decisions based on information about the cardinality of: T1, T2, their intersection and their union.
    Cardinalities are computed in different ways, considering tokens in T1 and T2, their IDF, and their similarity (computed with edit-distance) UAlacant [pivoting, multi-class] (Espl`a-Gomis et al., 2012) exploits translations obtained from Google Translate, Microsoft Bing translator, and the Apertium open-source MT platform (Forcada et al., 2011).8 Then, a multi-class SVM classifier
