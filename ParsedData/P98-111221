 For verbs, we plan to (1) increase the verbs that we cover to include phrasal verbs; (2) increase coverage of verbs by categorizing additional high frequency verbs into EVCA classes; (3) examine the effects of increased coverage on determining article type.
    For articles, we plan to explore a general parser so we can test our hypothesis on additional texts and examine how our conclusions scale up.
    Finally, we would like to combine our techniques with other indicators to form a more robust system, such as that envisioned in Biber (1989) or suggested in Kessler et al. (1997).
    Conclusion.
    We have outlined a novel approach to document analysis for news articles which permits discrimination of the event profile of news articles.
    The goal of this research is to determine the role of verbs in document analysis, keeping in mind that event profile is one of many factors in determining text type.
    Our results show that Levin's EVCA verb classes provide reliable indicators of article type within t
