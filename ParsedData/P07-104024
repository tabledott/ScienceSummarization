cores significantly.
    The combination weights were tuned to optimize three automatic evaluation metrics: TER, BLEU and METEOR.
    The TER tuning seems to yield very good results on Arabic - the BLEU tuning seems to be better on Chinese.
    It also seems like METEOR should not be used in tuning due to high insertion rate and low precision.
    It would be interesting to know which tuning metric results in the best translations in terms of human judgment.
    However, this would require time consuming evaluations such as human mediated TER post-editing (Snover et al., 2006).
    The improved confusion network decoding approach allows arbitrary features to be used in the combination.
    New features may be added in the future.
    Hypothesis alignment is also very important in confusion network generation.
    Better alignment methods which take synonymy into account should be investigated.
    This method could also benefit from more sophisticated word posterior estimation.
