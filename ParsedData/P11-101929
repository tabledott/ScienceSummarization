del is trained where the initial score of a text changes iteratively based on its similarity with the rest of the texts as well as their Zscores.
    The approach might be better described as weakly supervised as the distribution of text grades in the training data is used to fit the final Z-scores to grades.
    The system uses a bag-of-words representation of text, so would be easy to subvert.
    Nevertheless, exploration of the trade-offs between degree of supervision required in training and grading accuracy is an important area for future research.
  
  
    Finally, we hope that the release of the training and test dataset described here will facilitate further research on the AA task for ESOL free text and, in particular, precise comparison of different systems, feature types, and grade fitting methods.
    Though many of the systems described in Section 6 have been shown to correlate well with examiners&#8217; marks on test data in many experimental contexts, no cross-system comparisons are available
