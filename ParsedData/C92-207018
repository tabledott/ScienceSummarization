acy of their systems.
  Direct comparisons of performance between researchers is difficult, compounded by variances in corpora nd grading criteria; using the same words is an attempt o minimize these differences.
  Regrettably, most authors have reported their results in qualitative terms.
  The exceptions include Zemik (1990) who cited "recall and precision of over 70%" for one word (interest) and observed that results for other words, including /ssue, were "less positive."
  Clear (1989) reported results for two words (65% and 67%), apparently at 85% recall.
  Leak (1986) claimed overall "50-70%" accuracies, although it is unclear under which parameters and constraints.
  In a 5 word test set, Black (1988) observed 75% mean accuracy using his optimal method on high entropy, 4-way sense distinctions.
  Hearst (1991) achieved 84% on simpler 2-way distinctions, editing out additional senses from the test set.
  Gale, Church and Yarowsky (1992) reported 92% accuracy, also on 2-way distinctions.
