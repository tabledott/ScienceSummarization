 selection techniques to avoid overfitting.
    Structured learning techniques were successfully used by the &#8220;UU&#8221; submissions &#8211; the second best performing team &#8211; to represent parse trees.
    This seems an interesting direction to encode other sorts of linguistic information about source and translation texts.
    Other interesting learning techniques have been tried, such as Neural Networks, Partial Least Squares Regression, or multivariate adaptive regression splines, but their performance does not suggest they are strong candidates for learning highly-performing quality-estimation models.
    Test the suitability of evaluation metrics for quality estimation DeltaAvg, our proposed metric for measuring ranking performance, proved suitable for scoring the ranking subtask.
    Its high correlation with the Spearman ranking metric, coupled with its extrinsic interpretability, makes it a preferred choice for future measurements.
    It is also versatile, in the sense that the its valuatio
