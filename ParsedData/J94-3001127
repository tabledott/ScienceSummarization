nly p appears.
    These exclude all strings where an instance of the relevant context is followed by paired substrings not in r, either because the appropriate number of lexical O's were not (freely) introduced or because those O's correspond to unacceptable surface material.
    These two prescriptions can be brought together into the single formula 7r*AT-p7r* for all one-context rules, since whichever context is missing is treated as the identity pair &#8364;: &#8364;.
    We can bring out the similarity between this formula and the original Coerce relation by observing that this one is equivalent to 71-*A[Id(Dom(71-*)) o T-1p7r* because Id(Dom(e)) o 7T- and T- are the same relation.
    We now give a general statement of the Coerce relation that models surface coercions whether they are epenthetic or non-epenthetic: and neither A nor p contains &#8364;: E; X = 7r* if T has only epenthetic pairs and one of A or p does contain &#8364;:&#8364;.
    This definition assumes that T is homogeneous in that either
