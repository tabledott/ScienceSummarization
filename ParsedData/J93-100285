les in the training data.
    However, it is also clear that this approach will not succeed in all cases; for example, in the experiment the system appears to have developed a preference for local attachment of prepositional phrases (PPs), which is inappropriate in a significant number of cases.
    It is not surprising that probabilities based solely on the frequency of syntactic rules are not capable of resolving this type of ambiguity; in an example such as John saw the man on Monday again it is the temporal interpretation of Monday that favors the adverbial interpretation (and thus nonlocal attachment).
    Such examples are syntactically identical to ones such as John saw the man on the bus again, in which the possibility of a locative interpretation creates a mild preference for the adjectival reading and local attachment.
    To select the correct analysis in such cases it will be necessary to integrate information concerning word sense collocations into the probabilistic analysis.
    In this case, we
