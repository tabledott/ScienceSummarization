erb in the French.
    In the example in Figure 6, &#8220;will be&#8221; is aligned to &#8220;sera&#8221; (indicated by the solid lines) and because of the constituent structure of the English parse there is a crossing.
    As with negation, this type of crossing is quite regular, resulting uniquely from only two different syntactic structures.
  
  
    Many of the causes listed above are related to verb phrases.
    In particular, some of the adverb-related crossings (e.g.
    Figure 1) and all of the modal-related crossings (e.g.
    Figure 6) are artifacts of the nested verb phrase structure of our parser.
    This nesting usually does not provide any extra information beyond what could be gleaned from word order.
    Therefore, we surmised that flattening verb phrases would eliminate some types of crossings without reducing the utility of the parse.
    The flattening operation consists of identifying all nested verb phrases and splicing the children of the nested phrase into the parent phrase in its pla
