fact can be intuitively understood by observing that the algorithm searches for the maximum of a function whose number of local maxima grows with the number of nonterminals.
    Finally, while SCFGs do provide a hierarchical model of the language, that structure is undetermined by raw text and only by chance will the inferred grammar agree with qualitative linguistic judgments of sentence structure.
    For example, since in English texts pronouns are very likely to immediately precede a verb, a grammar inferred from raw text will tend to make a constituent of a subject pronoun and the following verb.
    We describe here an extension of the inside-outside algorithm that infers the parameters of a stochastic context-free grammar from a partially parsed corpus, thus providing a tighter connection between the hierarchical structure of the inferred SCFG and that of the training corpus.
    The algorithm takes advantage of whatever constituent information is provided by the training corpus bracketing, ranging fro
