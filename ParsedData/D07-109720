ighest labeled attachment score for five lan guages (Arabic, Basque, Catalan, Hungarian, and 9A fragmented parse is a dependency forest, rather than a tree, and is automatically converted to a tree by attaching all (other) roots to the artificial root node.
			Hence, children of the root node in the final output may not have been predicted as such by the treebank-induced classifier.
			10This conclusion is further supported by the observation that the single most frequent ?frame confusion?
