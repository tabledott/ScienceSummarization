    The next three major boundaries occur after paragraphs 5, 9, 12, and 13.
    There is some contention in the later paragraphs; three readers marked both 16 and 18, two marked 18 alone, and two marked 17 alone.
    The outline in the Introduction gives an idea of what each segment is about.
    Passonneau &amp; Litman (1993) discuss at length considerations about evaluating segmentation algorithms according to reader judgment information.
    As Figure 3 shows, agreement among judges is imperfect, but trends can be discerned.
    In Passonneau &amp; Litman's (1993) data, if 4 or more out of 7 judges mark a boundary, the segmentation is found to be significant using a variation of the Q-test (Cochran 1950).
    My data showed similar results.
    However, it isn't clear how useful this significance information is, since a simple majority does not provide overwhelming proof about the objective reality of the subtopic break.
    Since readers often disagree about where to draw a boundary marking for a
