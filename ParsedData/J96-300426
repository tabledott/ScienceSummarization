    For instance, for TTS it is necessary to know that a particular sequence of hanzi is of a particular category because that knowledge could affect the pronunciation; consider, for example the issues surrounding the pronunciation of e gani / qian2 discussed in Section 1.
    Following Sproat and Shih (1990), performance for Chinese segmentation systems is generally reported in terms of the dual measures of precision and recall.'
    It is fairly standard to report precision and recall scores in the mid to high 90% range.
    However, it is almost universally the case that no clear definition of what constitutes a &amp;quot;correct&amp;quot; segmentation is given, so these performance measures are hard to evaluate.
    Indeed, as we shall show in Section 5, even human judges differ when presented with the task of segmenting a text into words, so a d
