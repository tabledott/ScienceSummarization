    Dzeroski and Erjavec's goal is the development of rules couched in traditional linguistic terms; the categories of analysis are decided upon ahead of time by the programmer (or, more specifically, by the tagger of the corpus), and each individual word is identified with regard to what morphosyntactic features it bears.

    Gaussier (1999) approaches a very similar task to that which we consider, and takes some similar steps.
    His goal is to acquire derivational rules from an inflectional lexicon, thus insuring that his algorithm has access to the lexical category of the words it deals with (unlike the present study, which is allowed no such access).
    Using the terminology of the present paper, Gaussier considers cand
