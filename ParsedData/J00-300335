mework is modified such that the recognizer's acoustic information (spectral features) A appear as the evidence.
    We compute P(A I U) by decomposing it into an acoustic likelihood P(A I W) and a word-based likelihood P(WI U), and summing over all word sequences: poi = poi w, u)p(wl u) = E poi w)p(wi (6) The second line is justified under the assumption that the recognizer acoustics (typically, cepstral coefficients) are invariant to DA type once the words are fixed.
    Note that this is another approximation in our modeling.
    For example, different DAs with common words may be realized by different word pronunciations.
    Figure 2 shows the Bayes network resulting from modeling recognizer acoustics through word hypotheses under this independence assumption; note the added W, variables (that have to be summed over) in comparison to Figure 1.
    The acoustic likelihoods P(A I W) correspond to the acoustic scores the recognizer outputs for every hypothesized word sequence W. The summation over all W mus
