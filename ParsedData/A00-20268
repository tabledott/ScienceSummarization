from the Improved Iterative Scaling algorithm (Berger et al., 1996), are set to maximize the likelihood of the training data.
    The probability of the sequence W = wn, given the attribute set A, (and also given that its length is n) is: The feature patterns, used in NLG2 are shown in Table 3.
    The actual features are created by matching the patterns over the training data, e.g., an actual feature derived from the word hi-gram template might be: f(w1,tvi-1,w2-2,attri).
