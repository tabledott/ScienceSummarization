lingua comprised of fundamental language concepts; sense distinctions are implicitly made by choosing representations that reflect groups of closely related nodes in the network.
    She developed a set of 100 primitive concept types (THING, DO, etc.
    ), in terms of which her group built a 15,000-entry concept dictionary, where concept types are organized in a lattice with inheritance of properties from superconcepts to subconcepts.
    Building on this and on work on semantic networks by Richens (1958), Quillian (1961, 1962a, 1962b, 1967, 1968, 1969) built a network that includes links among words (tokens) and concepts (types), in which links are labeled with various semantic relations or simply indicate associations between words.
    The network is created starting from dictionary definitions, but is enhanced by human knowledge that is hand-encoded.
    When two words are presented to the network, Quillian's program simulates the gradual activation of concept nodes along a path of links originating from
