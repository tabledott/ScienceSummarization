sentences and uses language generation to reformulate them as a coherent summary.
    The use of generation to merge similar information is a new approach that significantly improves the quality of the resulting summaries, reducing repetition and increasing fluency.
    The system we have developed serves as a point of departure for research in a variety of directions.
    First is the need to use learning techniques to identify paraphrasing patterns in corpus data.
    As a first pass, we found paraphrasing rules manually.
    This initial set might allow us to automatically identify more rules and increase the performance of our comparison algorithm.
    From the generation side, our main goal is to make the generated summary more concise, primarily by combining clauses together.
    We will be investigating what factors influence the combination process and how they can be computed from input articles.
    Part of combination will involve increasing coherence of the generated text through the use of connec
