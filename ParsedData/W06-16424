olar atoms.
    Our assumption is intuitively reasonable, but there are many non-polar (neutral) clauses adjacent to polar clauses.
    Errors in sentence delimitation or syntactic parsing also result in false candidate atoms.
    Thus, to adopt a candidate polar atom for the new lexicon, some threshold values for the frequencies or ratios are required, but they depend on the type of the corpus, the size of the initial lexicon, etc.
    Our algorithm is fully automatic in the sense that the criteria for the adoption of polar atoms are set automatically by statistical estimation based on the distributions of coherency: coherent precision and coherent density.
    No manual tuning process is required, so the algorithm only needs unannotated domain corpora and the initial lexicon.
    Thus our learning method can be used not only by the developers of the system, but also by endusers.
