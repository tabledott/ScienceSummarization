    When set to its default value of 0.5, first 1000, some of the bags can be relatively small. false-negative errors and false positive errors have As described in Section 5.1, the word-argument the same impact on the objective function.
    As excorrelations are modeled through the quantity pected, setting cp to a smaller value (0.1) resulted P(wla) = C(w, a)/C(a), estimated as the ratio be- in better performance.
    Tests with even lower values tween the number of sentences containing w and a, did not improve the results. and the number of sentences containing a.
