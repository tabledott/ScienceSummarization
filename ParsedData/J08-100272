ponential explosion; in fact, training sets in these studies were very small and consisted only of short sentences.
    A possible approach to avoid this problem is to develop a fully restrictive grammar that never causes an exponential explosion, although the development of such a grammar requires considerable effort and it cannot be acquired from treebanks using existing approaches.
    We think that exponential explosion is inevitable, particularly with the large-scale wide-coverage grammars required to analyze real-world texts.
    In such cases, these methods of model estimation are intractable.
    Another approach to estimating log-linear models for HPSG was to extract a small informative sample from the original set T(w) (Osborne 2000).
    The method was successfully applied to Dutch HPSG parsing (Malouf and van Noord 2004).
    A possible problem with this method is in the approximation of exponentially many parse trees by a polynomial-size sample.
    However, their method has an advantage in that
