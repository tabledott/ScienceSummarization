oses the LCS for a pair of concepts that has the highest information content, getLCSbyDepth() selects the LCS with the greatest depth, and getLCSbyPath() selects the LCS that results in the shortest path.
  
  
    Our work with measures of semantic similarity and relatedness began while adapting the Lesk Algorithm for word sense disambiguation to WordNet (Banerjee and Pedersen, 2002).
    That evolved in a generalized approach to disambiguation based on semantic relatedness (Patwardhan et al., 2003) that is implemented in the SenseRelate package (http://senserelate.sourceforge.net), which utilizes WordNet::Similarity.
    The premise behind this algorithm is that the sense of a word can be determined by finding which of its senses is most related to the possible senses of its neighbors.
    WordNet::Similarity has been used by a number of other researchers in an interesting array of domains.
    (Zhang et al., 2003) use it as a source of semantic features for identifying cross&#8211;document structural relat
