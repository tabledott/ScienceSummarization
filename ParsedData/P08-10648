luding both syntactic and non-syntactic phrases) with syntactic structure information and allow any tree node operations in a longer span.
    We expect that these properties can well address the issues of non-isomorphic structure alignments, structure reordering, non-syntactic phrases and discontinuous phrases translations.
    Given the source and target sentences f1J and e; and their parse trees (1 ) sequence-to-tree sequence translation model is formulated as: In our implementation, we have: By Eq.
    (2), translation becomes a tree structure mapping issue.
    We model it using our tree sequence-based translation rules.
    Given the source parse tree (1 ) that could lead to the same target tree T(e;) , the mapping probability Pr (T (e;)  |T (f J )) is obtained by summing over the probabilities of all derivations.
    The probability of each derivation&#952; is given as the product of the probabilities of all the rules p(ri ) used in the derivation (here we assume that Eq.
    (3) formulates the tree se
