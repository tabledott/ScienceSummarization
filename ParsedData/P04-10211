 need to translate out-of-vocabulary words from one language to another, especially from alphabet language to Chinese, Japanese or Korean.
    Proper names of English, French, German, Russian, Spanish and Arabic origins constitute a good portion of out-of-vocabulary words.
    They are translated through transliteration, the method of translating into another language by preserving how words sound in their original languages.
    For writing foreign names in Chinese, transliteration always follows the original romanization.
    Therefore, any foreign name will have only one Pinyin (romanization of Chinese) and thus in Chinese characters.
    In this paper, we focus on automatic Chinese transliteration of foreign alphabet names.
    Because some alphabet writing systems use various diacritical marks, we find it more practical to write names containing such diacriticals as they are rendered in English.
    Therefore, we refer all foreign-Chinese transliteration to English-Chinese transliteration, or E2C.
