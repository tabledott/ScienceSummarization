, domain- or language-specific categories are automatically discovered.
    There are a number of approaches to derive syntactic categories.
    All of them employ a syntactic version of Harris&#8217; distributional hypothesis: Words of similar parts of speech can be observed in the same syntactic contexts.
    Contexts in that sense are often restricted to the most frequent words.
    The words used to describe syntactic contexts will be called feature words in the remainder.
    Target words, as opposed to this, are the words that are to be grouped into syntactic clusters.
    The general methodology (Finch and Chater, 1992; Sch&#252;tze, 1995; inter al.) for inducing word class information can be outlined as follows: Throughout, feature words are the 150-250 words with the highest frequency.
    Contexts are the feature words appearing in the immediate neighbourhood of a word.
    The word&#8217;s global context is the sum of all its contexts.
    For clustering, a similarity measure has to be defined and
