 corpora have been prepared in which human readers have annotated what has been called the coreference relation.
    These annotated corpora are then used as a gold standard against which the program's achievements can be compared.
    The relation of coreference has been defined as holding between two noun phrases if they &amp;quot;refer to the same entity&amp;quot; (Hirschman et al. 1997).
    More precisely, let us assume that ai and a2 are occurrences of noun phrases (NPs) and let us assume that both have a unique referent in the context in which they occur (i.e., their context in the corpus makes them unambiguous).
    Under these assumptions we can use a functional notation, e.g.
    Referent(a), as short for &amp;quot;the entity referred to by a&amp;quot; and define (suppressing the role of context):
  
  
    al and a2 corefer if and only if Referent(ai) = Referent(a2).
    Putting it simply: to determine whether ai and a2 corefer, first determine Referent(a1) and Referent(a2), then see if they are eq
