			Based on these resources (Cahill et al, 2002) de veloped two parsing architectures.
			Both generate PCFG-based approximations of LFG grammars.
			In the pipeline architecture a standard PCFG is extracted from the ?raw?
			treebank to parse unseen text.
			The resulting parse-trees are then annotated by the automatic f-structure annotation algorithm and resolved into f-structures.
			In the integrated architecture the treebank is first annotated with f-structure equations.
			An annotated PCFG is then extracted where each non-terminal symbol in the grammar has been augmented wi
