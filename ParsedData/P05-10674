    However, few of the above mentioned formalisms have large scale implementations.
    And to the best of our knowledge, the advantages of syntax based statistical MT systems over pure statistical MT systems have yet to be empirically verified.
    We believe difficulties in inducing a synchronous grammar or a set of tree transduction rules from large scale parallel corpora are caused by: Hajic et al. (2002) limited non-isomorphism by n-to-m matching of nodes in the two trees.
    However, even after extending this model by allowing cloning operations on subtrees, Gildea (2003) found that parallel trees over-constrained the alignment problem, and achieved better results with a tree-to-string model than with a tree-to-tree model using two trees.
    In a different approach, Hwa et al. (2002) aligned the parallel sentences using phrase based statistical MT models and then projected the alignments back to the parse trees.
    This motivated us to look for a more efficient and effective way to induce a sy
