CoNLL-2003 named entity data consists of eight files covering two languages: English and German1.
    For each of the languages there is a training file, a development file, a test file and a large file with unannotated data.
    The learning methods were trained with the training data.
    The development data could be used for tuning the parameters of the learning methods.
    The challenge of this year&#8217;s shared task was to incorporate the unannotated data in the learning process in one way or another.
    When the best parameters were found, the method could be trained on the training data and tested on the test data.
    The results of the different learning methods on the test sets are compared in the evaluation of the shared task.
    The split between development data and test data was chosen to avoid systems being tuned to the test data.
    The English data was taken from the Reuters Corpus2.
    This corpus consists of Reuters news stories between August 1996 and August 1997.
