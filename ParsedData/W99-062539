simplex noun phrases (i.e., sharing the same head), and two verbs must match according to the rule for verbs (i.e., sharing the same semantic class); see Figure 4.1 This particular combination loosely approximates grammatical relations, e.g., matching subject-verb pairs.
    Since these restrictions can be combined, many different composite features can be defined, although our empirical results indicate that the most successful tend to include a distance constraint.
    As we put more restrictions on a composite feature, the fewer times it occurs in the corpus; however, some of the more restrictive features are most effective in determining similarity.
    Hence, there is a balance between the discriminatory power of these features and their applicability to a large number of cases.
    Composite features are normalized as primitive features are (i.e., for text unit length and for frequency of occurrence).
    This type of normalization also uses equation (2) but averages the normalization values of each pri
