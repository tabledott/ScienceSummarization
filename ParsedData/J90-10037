mployed in Palermo and Jenkins (1964).
    The association ratio can be scaled up to provide robust estimates of word association norms for a large portion of the language.
    Using the association ratio measure, the five most associated words are, in order: dentists, nurses, treating, treat, and hospitals.
    What is &amp;quot;mutual information?&amp;quot; According to Fano (1961), if two points (words), x and y, have probabilities P(x) and P(y), then their mutual information, I(x,y), is defined to be Informally, mutual information compares the probability of observing x and y together (the joint probability) with the probabilities of observing x and y independently (chance).
    If there is a genuine association between x and y, then the joint probability P(x,y) will be much larger than chance P(x) P(y), and consequently I(x,y) &#187; 0.
    If there is no interesting relationship between x and y, then P(x,y) P(x) P(y), and thus, I(x,y) 0.
    If x and y are in complementary distribution, then P(x,y) will
