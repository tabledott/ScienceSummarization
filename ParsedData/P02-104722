a machine learning perspective.
    From a linguistic perspective though, this analysis is not very useful.
    If no cue phrases are used to signal the relation between two elementary discourse units, an automatic discourse labeler can at best guess that an ELABORATION relation holds between the units, because ELABORATION relations are the most frequently used relations (Carlson et al., 2001).
    Fortunately, with the classifiers described here, one can label some of the unmarked discourse relations correctly.
    For example, the RST-annotated corpus of Carlson et al. (2001) contains 238 CONTRAST relations that hold between two adjacent elementary discourse units.
    Of these, only 61 are marked by a cue phrase, which means that a program trained only on Carlson et al.&#8217;s corpus could identify at most 61/238 of the CONTRAST relations correctly.
    Because Carlson et al.&#8217;s corpus is small, all unmarked relations will be likely labeled as ELABORATIONs.
    However, when we run our CONTRAST vs. E
