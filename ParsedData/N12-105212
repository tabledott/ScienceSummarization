while the reductions for ORG (19%), LOC (17%) and MISC (10%) are more modest, but still significant.
    Although our results are below the best reported results for EN and DE (Lin and Wu, 2009; Faruqui and Pad&#180;o, 2010), the relative improvements of adding word clusters are inline with previous results on NER for EN (Miller et al., 2004; Turian et al., 2010), who report error reductions of approximately 25% from adding word cluster features.
    Slightly higher reductions where achieved for DE by Faruqui and Pad&#180;o (2010), who report a reduction of 22%.
    Note that we did not tune hyper-parameters of the supervised learning methods and of the clustering method, such as the number of clusters (Turian et al., 2010; Faruqui and Pad&#180;o, 2010), and that we did not apply any heuristic for data cleaning such as that used by Turian et al. (2010).
  
  
    All results of the previous section rely on the availability of large quantities of language specific annotations for each task.
