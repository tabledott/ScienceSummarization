inadequate (Fox, 2002; Galley et al., 2004).
    Similarly, in the tree-transducer terminology, Graehl and Knight (2004) define extended tree transducers that have multi-level trees on the source-side.
    Since an SD translator separates the sourcelanguage analysis from the recursive transformation, the domains of locality in these two modules are orthogonal to each other: in this work, we use a CFGbased Treebank parser but focuses on the extended domain in the recursive converter.
    Following Galley et al. (2004), we use a special class of extended tree-to-string transducer (zRs for short) with multilevel left-hand-side (LHS) trees.1 Since the righthand-side (RHS) string can be viewed as a flat onelevel tree with the same nonterminal root from LHS (Fig.
    2), this framework is closely related to STSGs: they both have extended domain of locality on the source-side, while our framework remains as a CFG on the target-side.
    For instance, an equivalent zRs rule for the complex reordering in Fig.
