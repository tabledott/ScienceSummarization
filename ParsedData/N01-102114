    The debate over the form grammar takes in the mind is clearly a fundamental one for cognitive science.
    Much recent psycholinguistic work has generated a wealth of evidence that frequency of exposure to linguistic elements can affect our processing (Mitchell et al., 1995) (MacDonald et al., 1994).
    However, there is no clear consensus as to the size of the e
