hase of the system, and that finding hedge cues is a domain dependent task.
    The cues that are not present in the training data cannot be learned in the test data and the same applies to their scope.
    This observation is consistent with the observation that the portability of hedge classifiers is limited, made by Szarvas (Szarvas, 2008).
  
  
    In this paper we have presented a metalearning approach to processing the scope of hedge cues, based on a system that finds the scope of negation cues.
    We have shown that the same system can find both the scope of negation and hedge cues.
    The performance of the system is evaluated in terms of percentage of correct scopes on three text types.
    In the hedge finding phase, the system achieves an F1 of 84.77% in the abstracts subcorpus.
    Existing systems that classify sentences as speculative or not reach an 85.00 BEP.
    Although the tasks are different, we consider that the results of our system are competitive.
    In the scope finding phase, the
