our system on the GeoQuery datasets, which contain naturallanguage queries of a geographical database paired with logical representations of each query&#8217;s meaning.
    The full Geo880 dataset contains 880 (Englishsentence, logical-form) pairs, which we split into a development set of 600 pairs and a test set of 280 pairs, following Zettlemoyer &amp; Collins (2005).
    The Geo250 dataset is a subset of Geo880 containing 250 sentences that have been translated into Turkish, Spanish and Japanese as well as the original English.
    Due to the small size of this dataset we use 10-fold cross validation for evaluation.
    We use the same folds as Wong &amp; Mooney (2006, 2007) and Lu et al. (2008), allowing a direct comparison.
    The GeoQuery data is annotated with both lambda-calculus and variable-free meaning representations, which we have seen examples of throughout the paper.
    We report results for both representations, using the standard measures of Recall (percentage of test sentences assigned cor
