focusing structure, the theory predicts that this decision will be a local one with respect to attentional state.
    Because two focus spaces may be close to each other in the attentional structure without the discourse segments they arise from necessarily being close to one another and vice versa, this prediction corresponds to a claim that locality in the focusing structure is what matters to determination of the intentional structure.
    A second role of the focusing structure is to constrain the OCP's search for possible referents of definite noun phrases and pronouns.
    To illustrate this role, we will consider the phrase the screw in the center in utterance (25) of the task-oriented dialogue of Section 3.
    The focus stack configuration when utterance (25) is spoken is shown in Figure 7.
    The stack contains (in bottom-totop order) focus spaces FS1, FS4, and FS5 for segments DS1, DS4, and DS5, respectively.
    For DS5 the wheelpuller is a focused entity, while for D54 the two setscrews are (bec
