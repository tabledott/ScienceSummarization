 85%.
    The simple lemmas model obtains an average score of 84% and the simple unigrams model obtains 79.75%.
  
  
    The main development presented here is the incorporation of several new information sources as features into SVMs which previously relied entirely on the effective but limited &#8220;bag of words&#8221; approach.
    The ability of SVMs to handle real-valued features makes this possible, and the information sources introduced in the work Turney and Kamps and Marx provide sensible places to start.
    The intuition that topic relations and proximity should also yield gains also appears to be borne out in the present experiments.
    The various sources of information appear to be best combined by integrating several distinct SVMs.
    At the level of the phrasal SO assignment, it would seem that some improvement could be gained by adding domain context to the AltaVista Search.
    Many&#8212;perhaps most&#8212;terms&#8217; favorability content depends to some extent on their context.
