ment with each sentence before a pass: the fourth column gives the number of true sentence alignments relative to the total number of candidates in the AST.
    Recall that the final alignment is always a subset of the hypotheses in the AST in every preceding pass.
    Figure 5 shows the true sentence alignment for the first 50 sentences (dots), and how the algorithm discovered them: in the first pass, only a few sentences are set into correspondence (circles); after the second pass (crosses) already almost half of the correspondences are found.
    Note that there are no wrong alignments in the first two passes.
    In the third pass, almost all of the remaining alignments are found (for the first 50 sentences in the figure: all), and a final pass usually completes the alignment.
    Our algorithm produces very favorable results when allowed to converge gradually.
    Processing time in the original LISP implementation was high, typically several hours for each pass.
