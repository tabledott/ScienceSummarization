    Despite these difficulties, some work has shown it worthwhile to minimize error directly (Och, 2003; Bahl et al., 1988).
    We show improvements over previous work on error minimization by minimizing the risk or expected error&#8212;a continuous function that can be derived by combining the likelihood with any evaluation metric (&#167;2).
    Seeking to avoid local minima, deterministic annealing (Rose, 1998) gradually changes the objective function from a convex entropy surface to the more complex risk surface (&#167;3).
    We also discuss regularizing
