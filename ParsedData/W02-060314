    Due to the online learning, as the number of processed words increases, the quality of the set of morphs in the codebook gradually improves.
    Consequently, words encountered in the beginning of the input data, and not observed since, may have a sub-optimal segmentation in the new model, since at some point more suitable morphs have emerged in the codebook.
    We have therefore introduced a &#8217;dreaming&#8217; stage: At regular intervals the system stops reading words from the input, and instead iterates over the words already encountered in random order.
    These words are resegmented and thus compressed further, if possible.
    Dreaming continues for a limited time or until no considerable decrease in the total cost can be observed.
    Figure 2 shows the development of the average cost per word as a function of the increasing amount of source text.
