 indicative mood utterances, and S.REQUEST produces imperative utterances, or interrogative utterances, if the requested act is an INFORM.
    These acts have no preconditions, and serve solely to signal the immediate intention of the speaker, the starting point for all the hearer's inferencing.
    S.INFORM(speaker, hearer, P) effect: B(hearer,W(speaker,KNOW(hearer,P))) S.REQUEST(speaker, hearer, action) effect: B(hearer,W(speaker,action(hearer))) The effects of S.INFORM match the body of the INFORM act, reflecting the fact that it is a standard way of executing an INFORM.
    It is important, however, that S.INFORM is only one way of executing an INFORM.
    The same relationship holds between the S.REQUEST and REQUEST actions.
