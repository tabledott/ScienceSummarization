these clusters based on more relaxed keyword-overlap criteria.
  
  
    We proposed an unsupervised method for relation discovery from large corpora.
    The key idea was clustering of pairs of named entities according to the similarity of the context words intervening between the named entities.
    The experiments using one year&#8217;s newspapers revealed not only that the relations among named entities could be detected with high recall and precision, but also that appropriate labels could be automatically provided to the relations.
    In the future, we are planning to discover less frequent pairs of named entities by combining our method with bootstrapping as well as to improve our method by tuning parameters.
