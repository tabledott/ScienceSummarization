it would be very useful to explain the motivation behind distributional similarity, an extremely popular technique that can be used for paraphrase generation with several different types of corpora.
    We devote the following section to such an explanation.
    The idea that a language possesses distributional structure was first discussed at length by Harris (1954).
    The term represents the notion that one can describe a language in terms of relationships between the occurrences of its elements (words, morphemes, phonemes) relative to the occurrence of other elements.
    The name for the phenomenon is derived from an element&#8217;s distribution&#8212;sets of elements in particular positions that the element occurs with to produce an utterance or a sentence.
    More specifically, Harris presents several empirical observations to support the hypothesis that such a structure exists naturally for language.
    Here, we closely quote these observations: Given these observations, it is relatively easy to ch
