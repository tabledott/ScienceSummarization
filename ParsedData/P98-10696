    We found that the contexts of flu and 'MI Iliougan share 233 &amp;quot;common&amp;quot; context words, whereas the contexts of Africa and W&#8222;Iff Iliougan share only 121 common words, even though the context of flu has 491 unique words and the context of Africa has 328 words.
    In the vector space model, W[flu] and W[liougan] has 233 overlapping dimensions, whereas there are 121 overlapping dimensions between W[flu] and W [Africa].
    The flu example illustrates that the actual ranking of the context word frequencies provides a second clue to the similarity between a bilingual word pair.
    For example, virus ranks very high for both flu and ME Iliougan and is a strong &amp;quot;bridge&amp;quot; between this bilingual word pair.
    This leads us to use the term frequency(TF) measure.
    The TF of a context word is defined as the frequency of the word in the context of W. (e.g.
    TF of virus in flu is 26, in MM. is 147).
    However, the TF of a word is not independent of its general usage f
