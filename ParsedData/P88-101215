    We want to get more bang for the buck, where q(A) is bang, and p(A) is buck.
    There is a property of natural language discourse, noticed by a number of linguists (e.g., Joos (1972), Wilks (1972)), that suggests a role for simplicity and consilience in its interpretation&#8212;its high degree of redundancy.
    Consider Inspection of oil filter revealed metal particles.
    An inspection is a looking at that causes one to learn a property relevant to the function of the inspected object.
    The function of a filter is to capture particles from a fluid.
    To reveal is to cause one to learn.
    If we assume the two causings to learn are identical, the two sets of particles are identical, and the two functions are identical, then we have explained the sentence in a minimal fashion.
    A small number of inferences and assumptions have explained a large number of syntactically independent propositions in the sentence.
    As a byproduct, we have moreover shown that the inspector is the one to whom t
