indicates that they have successfully distilled and modeled the signal present in the very noisy projection data, and are able to perform as respectable standalone monolingual tools with absolutely no humansupervised training data in the target language.
    These results also show considerable potential for further improvement by co-training with monolingually induced morphological analyzers.
    The standalone monolingual POS taggers and bracketers induced from word-aligned data also show potential for improving their initial alignments.
    NP bracketings for both the source and target language can improve the IBM MT distortion model, by boosting the probabilities of word alignments consistent with cohesive NP structure, and penalizing alignments that break NP cohesion.
    A stand-alone POS tagger applicable to new data can be used to improve statistical MT translation models, both by supporting finer translation model granularity (e.g. wind/NN modeled distinctly from wind/VB), and by serving as a source
