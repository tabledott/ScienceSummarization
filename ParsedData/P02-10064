8220;&lt;ANSWER&gt;&#8221;.
    This procedure is repeated for different examples of the same question type.
    For BIRTHDATE we also use &#8220;Gandhi 1869&#8221;, &#8220;Newton 1642&#8221;, etc.
    For BIRTHDATE, the above steps produce the following output: ...
    These are some of the most common substrings of the extracted sentences that contain both &lt;NAME&gt; and &lt;ANSWER&gt;.
    Since the suffix tree records all substrings, partly overlapping strings such as c and d are separately saved, which allows us to obtain separate counts of their occurrence frequencies.
    As will be seen later, this allows us to differentiate patterns such as d (which records a still living person, and is quite precise) from its more general substring c (which is less precise).
    In our example, for the pattern &#8220;&lt;NAME&gt; was born in &lt;ANSWER&gt;&#8221; we check the presence of the following strings in the answer sentence i) Mozart was born in &lt;ANY_WORD&gt; ii) Mozart was born in 1756 Calculate the pr
