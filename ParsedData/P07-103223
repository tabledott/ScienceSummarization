ienced some unexpected difficulties, since some of the tokenisation is different between DepBank and CCGbank and there are some sentences in DepBank which have been significantly shortened compared to the original Penn Treebank sentences.
    We modified the CCGbank sentences &#8212; and the CCGbank analyses since these were used for the oracle experiments &#8212; to be as close to the DepBank sentences as possible.
    All the results were obtained using the RASP evaluation scripts, with the results for the RASP parser taken from Briscoe et al. (2006).
    The results for CCGbank were obtained using the oracle method described above.
    The CCG parser results are based on automatically assigned POS tags, using the Curran and Clark (2003) tagger.
    The coverage of the parser on DepBank is 100%.
    For a GR in the parser output to be correct, it has to match the gold-standard GR exactly, including any subtype slots; however, it is possible for a GR to be incorrect at one level but correct at a subsuming le
