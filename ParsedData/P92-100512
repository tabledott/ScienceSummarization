es an interpretation function / for mapping constants and predicates into domain individuals and relations.
    Also left implicit is a function assigning values to variables, which is required for the evaluation of lambda abstracts as characteristic functions.
    Constructs in the 'standard' predicate logic subset of QLF receive their semantics with the usual evaluation rules, for example: The evaluation rule for a formula F with a scoping variable instantiated to [1,3, .] and containing a term T=term(I,C,R,Q,A) is as follows: &#8226; [[[1)3,...] :F]]=1 iff [[Q(R' ,F')]]=1, and 0 otherwise, where Ft' is X-(and(R(X),X=A))[X/I], and F' is X&amp;quot;( [3, ..
    .
    ]:and(F,X=A))[X/T, X/I] This evaluation rule states that a formula with a scoping constraint list may be evaluated by 'discharging' the term for the first index on the list with respect to a formula with a reduced scoping constraint.
    The rule discharges the term by abstracting over occurrences of the term and its index, and applying the gene
