l different algorithms to the task of identifying parts of speech.
    We have demonstrated that the use of morphological information can improve the performance of the algorithm with rare words quite substantially.
    We have also demonstrated that a very simple use of frequency can provide further improvements.
    Additionally we have tested this on a wide range of languages.
    Intuitively we have used all of the different types of information available - when we encounter a new word, we know three things about it: first, the context that it has appeared in, secondly the string of characters that it is made of, and thirdly that it is a new word and therefore rare.
  
  
    We have so far used only a limited form of morphological information that relies on properties of individual strings, and does not relate particular strings to each other.
    We plan to use this stronger form of information using Pair Hidden Markov Models as described in (Clark, 2001).
