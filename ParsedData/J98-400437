assumptions that these transformations induce more than outweighs any associated increase in variance.
    The various adjunction transformations only had minimal effect on labeled precision and recall.
    Perhaps this is because PP attachment ambiguities, despite their important role in linguistic and parsing theory, are just one source of ambiguity among many in real language, and the effect of the alternative representations is only minor.
    Indeed, moving to the purportedly linguistically more realistic Chomsky adjunction representations did not improve performance on these measures.
    On reflection, perhaps this should not be surprising.
    The Chomsky adjunction representations are motivated within the theoretical framework of Transformational Grammar, which explicitly argues for nonlocal, indeed, non-context-free, dependencies.
    Thus its poor performance when used as input to a statistical model that is insensitive to such dependencies is perhaps to be expected.
    Indeed, it might be the cas
