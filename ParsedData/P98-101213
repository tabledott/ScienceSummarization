the desired goal in such settings.
    As a result we wanted to model the accuracy of the system on a per-document basis and then build a more global score based on the sum of the user's experiences.
    Consider the case where the user selects document 6 in Figure 8.
    This a good outcome with all the relevant documents being found by the system and no extraneous documents.
    If the user selected document 1, then there are 5 irrelevant documents in the systems output &#8212; precision is quite low then.
    The goal of our scoring algorithm then is to model the precision and recall on average when looking for more documents about the same person based on selecting a single document.
    Instead of looking at the links produced by a system, our algorithm looks at the presence/absence of entities from the chains produced.
    Therefore, we compute the precision and recall numbers for each entity in the document.
    The numbers computed with respect to each entity in the document are then combined to produ
