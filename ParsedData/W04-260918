 classification problem since the output can be one of the semantic relations in the set.
    We cast this as a supervised learning problem where input/ output pairs are available as training data.
    An important first step is to map the characteristics of each NP construction (usually not numerical) into feature vectors.
    Let&#8217;s define with the feature vector of an instance and let be the space of all instances; ie .
    The multi-class classification is performed by a function that maps the feature space into a semantic space , , where is the set of semantic relations from Table 1, ie .
    Let be the training set of examples or instances where is the number of examples each accompanied by its semantic relation label .
    The problem is to decide which semantic relation to assign to a new, unseen example .
    In order to classify a given set of examples (members of ), one needs some kind of measure of the similarity (or the difference) between any two given members of .
