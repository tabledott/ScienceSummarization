parsing paradigm (Nivre, 2008).
    For all languages and settings, we use an arc-eager decoding strategy, with a beam of eight hypotheses, and perform ten epochs of the averaged structured perceptron algorithm (Zhang and Clark, 2008).
    We extend the state-of-the-art feature model recently introduced by Zhang and Nivre (2011) by adding an additional word cluster based feature template for each word based template.
    Additionally, we add templates where one or more partof-speech feature is replaced with the corresponding cluster feature.
    The resulting set of additional feature templates are shown in Table 1.
    The expanded feature model includes all of the feature templates defined by Zhang and Nivre (2011), which we also use as the baseline model, whereas Table 1 only shows our new templates due to space limitations.
    For all NER experiments, we use a sequential firstorder conditional random field (CRF) with a unit variance Normal prior, trained with L-BFGS until c-convergence (c = 0.0001, typic
