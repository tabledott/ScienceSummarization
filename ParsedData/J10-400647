nition, be tackled by the current version of PairClass, which will have to be expanded to deal with such cases, perhaps adopting ideas similar to those we present (that are, in turn, inspired by Turney&#8217;s own work on attributional and relational similarity).
    A first step in this direction, within a framework similar to Turney&#8217;s, was taken by Herda&#711;gdelen and Baroni (2009).
    Turney (2007) explicitly formalizes the set of corpus-extracted word&#8211;link&#8211;word triples as a tensor, and was our primary source of inspiration in formalizing DM in these terms.
    The focus of Turney&#8217;s article, however, is on dimensionality reduction techniques applied to tensors, and the application to corpora is only briefly discussed.
    Moreover, Turney only derives the W1&#215;LW2 space from the tensor, and does not discuss the possibility of using the tensor-based formalization to unify different views of semantic data, which is instead our main point.
