ze on typographic and cognitive/orthographic errors (Kukich, 1992) and use approaches (M.D.
    Kernighan, Church and Gale, 1991) that mostly model the edit operations using distance measures (Damerau 1964; Levenshtein 1966), specific word set confusions (Golding and Roth, 1999) and pronunciation modeling (Brill and Moore, 2000; Toutanova and Moore, 2002).
    These models are mostly character-based or string-based without considering the context.
    In addition, the author might not be aware of the errors in the word introduced during the edit operations, as most errors are due to mistype of characters near to each other on the keyboard or homophones, such as &#8220;poor&#8221; or &#8220;pour&#8221;.
    In SMS, errors are not isolated within word and are usually not surrounded by clean context.
