s the discriminative training algorithm that learns a good global ranking function used during decoding.
    Section 4 presents results on a standard Arabic-English translation task.
    Finally, some discussion and future work is presented in Section 5.
  
  
    This paper views phrase-based SMT as a block sequence generation process.
    Blocks are phrase pairs consisting of target and source phrases and local phrase re-ordering is handled by including so-called block orientation.
    Starting point for the block-based translation model is a block set, e.g. about million Arabic-English phrase pairs for the experiments in this paper.
    This block set is used to decode training sentence to obtain block orientation sequences that are used in the discriminative parameter training.
    Nothing but the block set and the parallel training data is used to carry out the training.
    We use the block set described in (Al-Onaizan et al., 2004), the use of a different block set may effect translation results.
