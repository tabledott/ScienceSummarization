nal pairs, A:B and C:D. The requirement that the cosine must be greater than or equal to the original cosine is a way of filtering out poor analogies, which may be introduced in step 1 and may have slipped through the filtering in step 2.
    Averaging the cosines, as opposed to taking their maximum, is intended to provide some resistance to noise.
    For quart:volume and mile:distance, the third column in Table 10 shows which alternates are used to calculate the average.
    For these two pairs, the average of the selected cosines is 0.677.
    In Table 7, we see that pumping:volume has slipped through the filtering in step 2, although it is not a good alternate for quart:volume.
    However, Table 10 shows that all four analogies that involve pumping:volume are dropped here, in step 12.
    Steps 11 and 12 can be repeated for each two input pairs that are to be compared.
    This completes the description of LRA.
    Table 11 gives the cosines for the sample SAT question.
