  The simplest method, however, involves eliminating the chart completing, and mimicking closure, shift, and reduction operations as operations on LR states (sets of items) directly.
  Though this method is not a straightforward instantiation ofthe architecture of Section 3 (since the chart is replaced by separate state sets), we have implemented a parser using much of the same technology described here and have successfully modeled the garden path phenomena that rely on the incompleteness of the shift-reduce t chnique.
  SThe format used in displaying these items reverts to one similar to Earleys algorithm, with a dot marking the position in the rule covered by th
