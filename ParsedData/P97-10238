 parser according to three variables: the conjunction used (and, or, but, either-or, or neither-nor), the type of modification (attributive, predicative, appositive, resultative), and the number of the modified noun (singular or plural).
    4 Validation of the Conjunction Hypothesis Using the three attributes extracted by the parser, we constructed a cross-classification of the conjunctions in a three-way table.
    We counted types and tokens of each conjoined pair that had both members in the set of pre-selected labeled adjectives discussed above; 2,748 (29.56%) of all conjoined pairs (types) and 4,024 (26.74%) of all conjunction occurrences (tokens) met this criterion.
    We augmented this table with marginal totals, arriving at 90 categories, each of which represents a triplet of attribute values, possibly with one or more &amp;quot;don't care&amp;quot; elements.
    We then measured the percentage of conjunctions in each category with adjectives of same or different orientations.
    Under the null hyp
