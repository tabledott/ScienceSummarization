ions like &#8220;the dog in the doghouse that contains a dog that is inside a doghouse....&#8221; Dale and Haddock, somewhat ad hoc, solve this problem by stipulating that a property or relation may be used only once.
    Krahmer and Theune (2002) (see also Theune [2000]) describe an extension of the incremental algorithm that allows for relational descriptions.
    Their extension suffers from what may be called the problem of forced incrementality: When a first relation fails to rule out all remaining distractors, additional relations will be tried incrementally.
    Although it could be argued that incremental selection of properties is psychologically plausible, it seems less plausible for relations.
    It is unlikely that someone would describe an A graph representation of the scene in Figure 2. object as &#8220;the dog next to the tree in front of the garage&#8221; in a situation in which &#8220;the dog in front of the garage&#8221; would suffice.
    As we shall argue, the graph perspective provides a
