and shallow parsing information.
  The full parsing?based system follows the pruning, argument identifica- tion, argument classification, and inference stages, as described earlier.
  For the shallow parsing system, the pruning heuristic is replaced by the word-based pruning classi- fiers, and the remaining stages are designed to use only shallow parsing as described in previous sections.
  Table 9 shows the overall performance of the two evaluation systems.
  As indicated in the tables, the gap in F1 between full parsing and shallow parsing?
  based systems enlarges tomore than 11 points on the gold-standard data.
  At first glance, this result seems to contradict our conclusion in Section 4.3.
  After all, if the pruning stage of shallow parsing SRL system performs equally well or even better, the overall performance gap in F1 should be small.
  After we carefully examined the output of the word-based classifier, we realized that it filters out easy candidates, and leaves examples that are difficult to the
