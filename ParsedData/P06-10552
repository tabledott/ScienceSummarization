ning (2003) addressed this question from a linguistic perspective, starting with a Markov grammar and manually splitting symbols in response to observed linguistic trends in the data.
    For example, the symbol NP might be split into the subsymbol NP&amp;quot;S in subject position and the subsymbol NP&amp;quot;VP in object position.
    Recently, Matsuzaki et al. (2005) and also Prescher (2005) exhibited an automatic approach in which each symbol is split into a fixed number of subsymbols.
    For example, NP would be split into NP-1 through NP-8.
    Their exciting result was that, while grammars quickly grew too large to be managed, a 16-subsymbol induced grammar reached the parsing performance of Klein and Manning (2003)&#8217;s manual grammar.
    Other work has also investigated aspects of automatic grammar refinement; for example, Chiang and Bikel (2002) learn annotations such as head rules in a constrained declarative language for tree-adjoining grammars.
    We present a method that combines the stre
