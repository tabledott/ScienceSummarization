on trees under various conditions, we have performed numerous experiments varying the number of features used, the definitions used for classifying a potential boundary site as boundary or nonboundary and the options available for running the C4.5 program.
    Figure 15 shows one of the highest-performing learned decision trees from our experiments.
    This decision tree was learned under the following conditions: all of the features shown in Figure 6 were used to code the training data, boundaries were classified using a threshold of three subjects, and C4.5 was run using only the default options.'
    The decision tree predicts the class of a potential boundary site based on the features before, after, duration, cuei, wordi, coref, infer, and global.pro.
    Note that although not all available features are used in the tree, the included features represent three of the four general types of knowledge (prosody, cue phrases, and noun phrases).
    Each level of the tree specifies a test on a single feature,
