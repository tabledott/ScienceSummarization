rrent single-speaker study, first position in intonational phrase was orthographically marked in only 199 of 429, or 46.4% of cases.
    So, in this study, the association between position in intonational phrase and orthographic marking appears much weaker.
    We also found that part of speech could be useful in distinguishing discourse from sentential usage&#8212;although less useful than orthographic cues&#8212;as shown in Table 12.7 If we simply predict discourse or sentential use by the assignment most frequently associated with a given part of speech, Church's part-of-speech algorithm predicts discourse or sentential use in 561 (63.9%) cases for tokens where both judges agreed on discourse/sentential assignment.
    For example, we assume that since the majority of conjunctions and verbs are judged sentential, these parts of speech are predictors of sentential status, and, since most adverbials are associated with discourse uses, these are predictors of discourse status, and so on.
