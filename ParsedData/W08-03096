performance of systems on in-domain and out-of-domain data, and provides a fairer comparison between systems trained on the Europarl corpus and systems that were developed without it.
    To lower the barrier of entry for newcomers to the field, we provided a complete baseline MT system, along with data resources.
    We provided: The performance of this baseline system is similar to the best submissions in last year&#8217;s shared task.
    The training materials are described in Figure 1.
    We received submissions from 23 groups from 18 institutions, as listed in Table 2.
    We also evaluated seven additional commercial rule-based MT systems, bringing the total to 30 systems.
    This is a significant increase over last year&#8217;s shared task, where there were submissions from 15 groups from 14 institutions.
    Of the 15 groups that participated in last year&#8217;s shared task, 11 groups returned this year.
    One of the goals of the workshop was to attract submissions from newcomers to the field, a
