ut: set Succ of successor hypotheses There is an asymmetry between the two reordering states Move and Skip: While in state Move, the algorithm is not allowed to cover the position lmin(C).
    It must first enter the state Cover to do so.
    In contrast, for the state Skip, the newly generated hypothesis always remains in the state Skip (until the state Initial is entered.)
    This is motivated by the word reordering for the German verb group.
    After the right verbal brace has been processed, no source words may be moved into the verbal brace from later in the sentence.
    There is a redundancy in the reorderings: The same reordering might be carried out using either the state Skip or Move, especially if widthskip and widthmove are about the same.
    The additional computational burden is alleviated somewhat by the fact that the pruning, as introduced in Section 3.8, does not distinguish hypotheses according to the states.
    A complexity analysis for different reordering constraints is given in Tillm
