ber of tokens in the training set doubled, and the morphological annotation was made more informative.
			The combined effect ofthese changes can probably account for the substan tial improvement in parsing accuracy.
			For Turkish, the training set grew in size as well, although only by600 sentences, but part of the improvement for Turkish may also be due to continuing efforts in error cor 927 rection and consistency checking.
			We see that the choice to include punctuation or not makes a large difference for the Turkish scores, since non-final IGs of a word are counted as punctuation (because they have the underscore character as their FORM value), which means that word-internal dependency links are included if punctuation is included.9 However, regardless of whether we compare scores with or without punctuation, we see a genuine improvement of approximately 6 percentage points.
			For Chinese, the same training set was used.
			Therefore, the drop from last year?s top score to thisyear?s is surprising.
