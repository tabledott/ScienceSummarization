eath them, also based on data extracted from the Wall Street Journal.
    The resulting hierarchy is evaluated by human judges, and future research directions are discussed.
  
  
    The first stage in constructing our hierarchy is to build an unlabeled hierarchy of nouns using bottom-up clustering methods (see, e.g., Brown et al. (1992)).
    Nouns are clustered based on conjunction and appositive data collected from the Wall Street Journal corpus.
    Some of the data comes from the parsed files 2-21 of the Wall Street Journal Penn Treebank corpus (Marcus et al., 1993), and additional parsed text was obtained by parsing the 1987 Wall Street Journal text using the parser described in Charniak et al. (1998).
    From this parsed text, we identified all conjunctions of noun phrases (e.g., &amp;quot;executive vice-president and treasurer&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;scientific equipment, apparatus and disposables&amp;quot;) and all appositives (e.g., &amp;quot;James H.
