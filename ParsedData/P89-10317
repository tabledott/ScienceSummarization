, it may not be clear what the DEFINITION OF SUCCESS is.
    In particular it is not clear what to do in those cases where an algorithm produces multiple or partial interpretations.
    In this situation a system might flag the utterance as ambiguous and draw in support from other discourse components.
    This arises in the present analysis for two reasons: (1) the constraints given by [GJW86] do not always allow one to choose a preferred interpretation, (2) the BFP algorithm proposes equally ranked interpretations in parallel.
    This doesn't happen with the Hobbs algorithm because it proposes interpretations in a sequential manner, one at a time.
    We chose to count as a failure those situations in which the BFP algorithm only reduces the number of possible interpretations, but Hobbs algorithm stops with a correct interpretation.
    This ignores the fact that Hobbs may have rejected a number of interpretations before stopping.
    We also have not needed to make a decision on how to score an algorithm
