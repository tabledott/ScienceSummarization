le corpus (as in Equation 1) and normalized by the number of parallel corpora.
  
  
    We examined the application of paraphrases to deal with unknown phrases when translating from Spanish and French into English.
    We used the publicly available Europarl multilingual parallel corpus (Koehn, 2005) to create six training corpora for the two language pairs, and used the standard Europarl development and test sets.
    For a baseline system we produced a phrase-based statistical machine translation system based on the log-linear formulation described in (Och and Ney, 2002) The baseline model had a total of eight feature functions, hm(e, f): a language model probability, a phrase translation probability, a reverse phrase translation probability, lexical translation probability, a reverse lexical translation probability, a word penalty, a phrase penalty, and a distortion cost.
    To set the weights, am, we performed minimum error rate training (Och, 2003) on the development set using Bleu (Papineni et al., 20
