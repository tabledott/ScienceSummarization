    SUMMONS, on the other hand, focuses on conceptual summarization of both structured and full-text data.
    At least four previous systems developed elsewhere use natural language to summarize quantitative data, including ANA (Kukich 1983), SEMTEX (Rosner 1987), FOG (Bourbeau et al. 1990), and LFS (Iordanskaja et al.
    1994).
    All of these use some forms of conceptual and linguistic summarization and the techniques can be adapted for our current work on summarization of multiple articles.
    In related work, Dalianis and Hovy (1993) have also looked at the problem of summarization, identifying eight aggregation operators (e.g., conjunction around noun phrases) that apply during generation to create more concise text.
  
  
    The overall architecture of our summarization system given earlier in Figure 1 draws on research in software agents (Genesereth and Ketchpel 1994) to allow connections to a variety of different types of data sources.
