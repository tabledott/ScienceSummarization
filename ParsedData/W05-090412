denoted DSTM for dependency subtree metric and DTKM for dependency tree kernel metric.
  
  
    Our testing data contains two parts.
    One part is a set of 665 English sentences generated by a ChineseEnglish MT system.
    And for each MT hypothesis, three reference translations are associated with it.
    Input: dependency tree T, maximum length N of the headword chain Output: headword chains from length 1 to N The human judgments, on a scale of 1 to 5, were collected at the 2003 Johns Hopkins Speech and Language Summer Workshop, which tells the overall quality of the MT hypotheses.
    The translations were generated by the alignment template system of Och (2003).
    This testing set is called JHU testing set in this paper.
    The other set of testing data is from MT evaluation workshop at ACL05.
    Three sets of human translations (E01, E03, E04) are selected as the references, and the outputs of seven MT systems (E9 E11 E12 E14 E15 E17 E22) are used for testing the performance of our syntactic metri
