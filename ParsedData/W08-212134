e several components in the semantic or syntactic subtasks &#8211; e.g., nine systems jointly performed predicate/argument identification and classification &#8211; but only four systems combined components between the syntactic and semantic subtasks: Henderson et al. (2008), who implemented a generative history-based model (Incremental Sigmoid Belief Networks with vectors of latent variables) where syntactic and semantic structures are separately generated but using a synchronized derivation (sequence of actions); Samuelsson et al.
    (2008), who, within an ensemble-based architecture, implemented a joint syntactic-semantic model using MaltParser with labels enriched with semantic information; Lluis and M`arquez, who used a modified version of the Eisner algorithm to jointly predict syntactic and semantic dependencies; and finally, Sun et al. (2008), who integrated dependency label classification and argument identification using a maximum-entropy Markov model.
