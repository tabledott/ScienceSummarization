uld use the EM algorithm with this model, but EM will not extend effectively to the subsequent models.
    4Here, Z&#8722;i,j denotes Z &#8722; {Zi,j} where nz is the number of elements of Z&#8722;i,j with entity index z.
    Similarly we have for the contribution of the emissions: where nh,z is the number of times we have seen head h associated with entity index z in (Z, H&#8722;i,j).
    A clear drawback of the finite mixture model is the requirement that we specify a priori a number of entities K for a document.
    We would like our model to select K in an effective, principled way.
    A mechanism for doing so is to replace the finite Dirichlet prior on Q with the non-parametric Dirichlet process (DP) prior (Ferguson, 1973).5 Doing so gives the model in figure 1(b).
    Note that we now list an infinite number of mixture components in this model since there can be an unbounded number of entities.
    Rather than a finite Q with a symmetric Dirichlet distribution, in which draws tend to have balanced clus
