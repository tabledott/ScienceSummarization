 what the &#8220;natural&#8221; proportions among the three might be.
    This means that the proportions of Positive, Negative, and Objective terms we decide to include in the training set will strongly bias the classification results if the learner is one of NB, PrTFIDF and SVMs.
    We may notice this by looking at Table 3, which shows the average proportion of test terms classified as Objective by each learner, depending on whether we have chosen Tro to coincide with Tr3o or Tr4o; note that the former (resp. latter) choice means having roughly as many (resp. roughly five times as many) Objective training terms as there are Positive and Negative ones.
    Table 3 shows that, the more Objective training terms there are, the more test terms NB, PrTFIDF and (in particular) SVMs will classify as Objective; this is not true for Rocchio, which is basically unaffected by the variation in size of Tro.
