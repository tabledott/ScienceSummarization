			In addition, we conduct cross-dataset tests, in which we train on one dataset and test on other datasets.
			5.2 Overall results.
			Final results of CRF based segmentation with newword detection are summarized in Table 3.
			The up per part of the table contains the closed test results, and the lower part contains the open test results.
			Each entry is the performance of the given metric (precision, recall, F1, and Roov) on the test set.
