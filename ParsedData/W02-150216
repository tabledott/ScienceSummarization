 the matrix.
    Of course, the development of the typology of phenomena is itself a major undertaking for which a systematic cross-linguistic approach will be needed, a discussion of which is outside the scope of this report.
    But the intent is to seed this classification scheme with a set of relatively coarse-grained phenomenon classes drawn from the existing grammars, then refine the typology as it is applied to these and new grammars built using the matrix.
  
  
    One important part of the matrix package will be a library of phenomenon-based analyses drawn from the existing grammars and over time from users of the matrix, to provide working examples of how the matrix can be applied and extended.
    Each case study will be a set of grammar files, simplified for relevance, along with documentation of the analysis, and a test suite of sample sentences which define the range of data covered by the analysis.
    This library, too, will be organized around the typology of phenomena introduced above, but
