 that employed by Hindle (1990) for detecting synonyms.
    Given a term T, we extract from the phrase database those nouns N, that appear as the head of any phrase in which T is the immediately preceding term.
    These nouns represent candidate classes of which T may be a member.
    We then generate the set of verbs that take T as direct object and calculate the mutual information value for each verb/T collocation (cf.
    Hindle 1990).
    We do the same for each noun N. Under the assumption that instance and class nouns are likely to co-occur with the same verbs, we compute a similarity score between T and each noun N&#8222; by summing the product of the mutual information values for those verbs occurring with both nouns.
    (Verbs with negative mutual information values are left out of the calculation.)
    The noun with the highest similarity score is often the class of which T is an instance, as illustrated by the sample results in Figure 1.
    For each word displayed in Figure 1, its &amp;quot;clas
