ested the hypothesis as follows.
    To avoid the need to hand-label sentences as positive or negative, we first created a sentence polarity dataset7 consisting of 10,662 movie-review &#8220;snippets&#8221; (a striking extract usually one sentence long) downloaded from www.rottentomatoes.com; each snippet was labeled with its source review&#8217;s label (positive or negative) as provided by Rotten Tomatoes.
    Then, we trained a Naive Bayes classifier on this data set and applied it to our scale dataset to identify the positive sentences (recall that objective sentences were already removed).
    Figure 1 shows that all four authors tend to exhibit a higher PSP when they write a more positive review, and we expect that most typical reviewers would follow suit.
    Hence, PSP appears to be a promising basis for computing document similarity for our rating-inference task.
    In particular, we defined to be the two-dimensional vector , and then set the itemsimilarity function required by the metric-labeling op
