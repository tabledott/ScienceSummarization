s been simplified in a number of ways.
    For example, only NPs were annotated.
    Such eminently sensible simplifications notwithstanding, we will argue that the above-mentioned criteria have not been achieved and that a rethinking of the coreference annotation enterprise is in order before it ventures into new domains involving speech, noisy data, etc.
    (see for example, Bagga, Baldwin, and Shelton 119991), or before it extends the relation of coreference to cover whole/part and class/instance relations (e.g.
    Popescu-Belis 1998; Hirschman and Chinchor 1997).
    In this section, some unclarities and inconsistencies will be discussed that we found in the literature on coreference annotation, and which appear to stem from confusion about what reference and coreference are.
    In Section 2.1, we will explore the tendency to apply coreference annotation to nonreferring NPs and bound anaphora, and we will argue that this tendency is problematic.
    In Section 2.2, we will argue that existing annotatio
