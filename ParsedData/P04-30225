; and &#8220;OTHER-ROLE&#8221;).
    We explicitly model the argument order of mentions.
    Thus, when comparing mentions and , we distinguish between the case where -citizen-Of- and -citizen-Of- .
    We thus model the extraction as a classification problem with 49 classes, two for each relation subtype and a &#8220;NONE&#8221; class for the case where the two mentions are not related.
    For each pair of mentions, we compute several feature streams shown below.
    All the syntactic features are derived from the syntactic parse tree and the dependency tree that we compute using a statistical parser trained on the PennTree Bank using the Maximum Entropy framework (Ratnaparkhi, 1999).
    The feature streams are: Words The words of both the mentions and all the words in between.
    Entity Type The entity type (one of PERSON, ORGANIZATION, LOCATION, FACILITY, Geo-Political Entity or GPE) of both the mentions.
    Mention Level The mention level (one of NAME, NOMINAL, PRONOUN) of both the mentions.
