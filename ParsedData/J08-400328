 given that i and j are both roots in Gx,).
    Moreover, if p has a head k in Gx, then k must be the topmost node in &#963;cq that is not a dependent of p (anything else would again be inconsistent with the assumption that Gx is projective).
    Therefore, we can construct a transition sequence C0,m such that Gcm = Gx, by starting in c0 = cs(x) and applying exactly the same q transitions as in C0,q, followed by as many LEFT-ARCl transitions as there are left dependents of p in Gx, followed by a RIGHT-ARCsl transition if and only if p has a head in Gx, followed by a SHIFT transition (moving the head of p back to the stack and emptying the buffer).
    &#9632; Theorem 2 The worst-case time complexity of the arc-standard, stack-based algorithm is O(n), where n is the length of the input sentence.
    Proof 2 Assuming that the oracle and transition functions can be computed in some constant time, the worst-case running time is bounded by the maximum number of transitions in a transition sequence C0,m for a sente
