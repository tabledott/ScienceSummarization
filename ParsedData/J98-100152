 and data sparseness problems simultaneously).
    However, it is likely that, as noted for grammatical tagging (Merialdo 1994), even a minimal phase of supervised learning improves radically on the results of unsupervised methods.
    Research into means to facilitate and optimize tagging is ongoing; for example, an optimization technique called committee-based sample selection has recently been proposed (Engelson and Dagan 1996), which, based on the observation that a substantial portion of manually tagged examples contribute little to performance, enables avoiding the tagging of examples that carry more or less the same information.
    Such methods are promising, although to our knowledge they have not been applied to the problem of lexical disambiguation. for much corpus-based work, is especially severe for work in WSD.
    First, enormous amounts of text are required to ensure that all senses of a polysemous word are represented, given the vast disparity in frequency among senses.
    For example, in th
