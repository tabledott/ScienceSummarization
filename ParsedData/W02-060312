count of the chunk in the data set and the split location in this chunk.
    A zero split location denotes a leaf node, i.e., a morph.
    The occurrence counts flow down through the hierachical structure, so that the count of a child always equals the sum of the counts of its parents.
    The occurrence counts of the leaf nodes are used for computing the relative frequencies of the morphs.
    To find out the morph sequence that a word consists of, we look up the chunk that is identical to the word, and trace the split indices recursively until we reach the leafs, which are the morphs.
    Note that the hierarchical structure is used only during model search: It is not part of the final model, and accordingly no cost is associated with any other nodes than the leaf nodes.
    Adding and removing morphs.
    Adding new morphs to the codebook increases the codebook cost.
    Consequently, a new word token will tend to be split into morphs already listed in the codebook, which may lead to local optima.
