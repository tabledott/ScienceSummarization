ries that provide subcategorization information have become available to researchers (Hornby 1989, Procter 1978, Sinclair 1987).
    But this is the same method of obtaining subcategorizations &#8212; painstaking work by hand.
    We have simply passed the need for tools that acquire lexical information from the computational linguist to the lexicographer.
    Thus there is a need for a program that can acquire a subcategorization dictionary from on-line corpora of unrestricted text: and easily as different usages develop.
    Dictionaries produced by hand always substantially lag real language use.
    The last two points do not argue against the use of existing dictionaries, but show that the incomplete information that they provide needs to be supplemented with further knowledge that is best collected automatically.'
    The desire to combine hand-coded and automatically learned knowledge suggests that we should aim for a high precision learner (even at some cost in coverage), and that is the approach adop
