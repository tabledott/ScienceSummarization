ME is a knowledge-based NLG system.
    While its design was informed by corpus analysis (Reiter et al., 2003), the system is based on manually authored rules and code.
    As part of the project, the SUMTIME team created a corpus of 1045 forecasts from the commercial output of five different forecasters and the input data (numerical predictions of wind, temperature, etc) that the forecasters examined when they wrote the forecasts (Sripada et al., 2003).
    In other words, the SUMTIME corpus contains both the inputs (numerical weather predictions) and the outputs (forecast texts) of the forecast-generation process.
    The SUMTIME team also derived a content representation (called &#8216;tuples&#8217;) from the corpus texts similar to that produced by SUMTIME&#8217;s content-determination module.
    The SUMTIME microplanner/realiser can be driven by these tuples; this mode (combining human content determination with SUMTIME microplanning and realisation) is called SUMTIME-Hybrid.
