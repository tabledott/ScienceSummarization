	A Uniform Approach to Analogies Synonyms Antonyms and Associations
		Recognizing analogies, synonyms, anto nyms, and associations appear to be fourdistinct tasks, requiring distinct NLP al gorithms.
		In the past, the four tasks have been treated independently, using a widevariety of algorithms.
		These four seman tic classes, however, are a tiny sample of the full range of semantic phenomena, andwe cannot afford to create ad hoc algo rithms for each semantic phenomenon; weneed to seek a unified approach.
		We propose to subsume a broad range of phenom ena under analogies.
		To limit the scope of this paper, we restrict our attention to the subsumption of synonyms, antonyms, and associations.
		We introduce a supervised corpus-based machine learning algorithm for classifying analogous word pairs, and we show that it can solve multiple-choice SAT analogy questions, TOEFL synonymquestions, ESL synonym-antonym questions, and similar-associated-both ques tions from cognitive psychology.
