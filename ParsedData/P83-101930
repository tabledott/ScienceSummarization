ammar assigned the two words exactly the same part of speech, then the Category C;.7y Editor would necessarily apply, incorrectly expunging could.
    It appears therefore that the pattern of self-corrections that occur represents a potentially rich source of evidence about the nature of syntactic categories.
    Learnability.
    If the patterns of self-correction count as evidence about the nature of syntactic categories for the linguist, then this data must be equally available to the language learner.
    This would suggest that, far from being an impediment to language learning, non-fluencies may in fact facilitate language acquisition by highlighting equivalent classes.
    This raises the general question of how children can acquire a language in the face of unrestrained non-fluency.
    How can a language learner sort out the grammatical from the ungrammatical strings?
    (The non-fluencies of speech are of course but one aspect of the degeneracy of input that makes language acquisition a puzzle.)
