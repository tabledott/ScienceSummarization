some cases, a grammar derivation and an item derivation will have the same value for any commutative semiring and any rule value function.
    In this case, we say that the derivations are commutatively iso-valued.
    Finishing our example, the value of the goal item given our example sentence is just the sum of the values of the two item-based derivations, 2.4.5 Conditions for Correctness.
    We can now specify the conditions for an item-based description to be correct.
    Given an item-based description I, if for every grammar G, there exists a one-to-one correspondence between the item derivations using I and the grammar derivations, and the corresponding derivations are iso-valued, then for every complete semiring, the value of a given input w1 wn is the same according to the grammar as the value of the goal item.
    (If the semiring is commutative, then the corresponding derivations need only be commutatively iso-valued.)
    The proof is very simple; essentially, each term in each sum occurs in the
