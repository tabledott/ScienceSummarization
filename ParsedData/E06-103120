workshops and from the IWSLT 2004 evaluation workshop confirm the findings from the NIST 2004 experiments; for the sake of clarity they are not included here.
    All correlation coefficients presented here were calculated for sentence level evaluation.
    For comparison with state-of-the-art evaluation measures, we have also calculated the correlation between human evaluation and WER and BLEU, which were both measures of choice in several international MT evaluation campaigns.
    Furthermore, we included TER (Snover et al., 2005) as a recent heuristic block movement measure in some of our experiments for comparison with our measure.
    As the BLEU score is unsuitable for sentence level evaluation in its original definition, BLEU-S smoothing as described by (Lin and Och, 2004) is performed.
    Additionally, we added sentence boundary symbols for BLEU, and a different reference length calculation scheme for TER, because these changes improved the correlation between human evaluation and the two automatic m
