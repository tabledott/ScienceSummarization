admissible descendant nodes.
    For example, the tree in Figure 3 is cut into 6 pieces, each of which corresponds to a rule on the right.
    These extracted rules are called minimal rules, which can be glued together to form composed rules with larger tree fragments (e.g. r1 in Fig.
    1) (Galley et al., 2006).
    Our experiments use composed rules.
  
  
    We now extend tree-based extraction algorithm from the previous section to work with a packed forest representing exponentially many parse trees.
    Informally, a packed parse forest, or forest in short, is a compact representation of all the derivations (i.e., parse trees) for a given sentence under a context-free grammar (Earley, 1970; Billot and Lang, 1989).
    For example, consider again the Chinese sentence in Example (1) above, which has (at least) two readings depending on the part-ofspeech of the word y&#711;u: it can be either a conjunction (CC &#8220;and&#8221;) as shown in Figure 3, or a preposition (P &#8220;with&#8221;) as shown in Fig
