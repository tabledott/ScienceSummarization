anslators, recent research (Brown et al. 1993; Melamed 1996b) suggests that it also applies to problems in machine translation.
    Texts that are available in two languages (bitexts) (Harris 1988) also play a pivotal role in various less automated applications.
    For example, bilingual lexicographers can use bitexts to discover new cross-language lexicalization patterns (Catizone, Russell, and Warwick 1993; Gale and Church 1991b); students of foreign languages can use one half of a bitext to practice their reading skills, referring to the other half for translation when they get stuck (Nerbonne et al. 1997).
    Bitexts are of little use, however, without an automatic method for matching corresponding text units in their two halves.
    The bitext mapping problem can be formulated in terms of pattern recognition.
    From this point of view, the success of a bitext mapping algorithm hinges on three tasks: signal generation, noise filtering, and search.
