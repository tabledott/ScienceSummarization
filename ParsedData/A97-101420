 of these alternatives in larger amounts of texts.
    Syntactically annotated corpora of German have been missing until now.
    In the second phase of the project Verbmobil a. treebank for :30,000 German spoken sentences as well as for the same amount of English and Japanese sentences will be created.
    We will closely coordinate the further development of our corpus with the annotation work in Verbmobil and with other German efforts in corpus annotation.
    Since the combinatorics of syntactic constructions creates a. demand for very large corpora., efficiency of annotation is an important. criterion for the success of the developed methodology and tools.
    Our annotation tool supplies efficient manipulation and immediate visualization of argument structures.
    Partial automation included in the current version significantly reduces the manna.1 effort.
    Its extension is subject to further investigations.
