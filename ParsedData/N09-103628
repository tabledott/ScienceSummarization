rse trees labeling the tables in the adaptor for each X E A.
    Specifically, if the adaptor CX for X E A currently contains m tables labeled with the trees t = (ti, ... , tm) then table label resampling replaces each tj, j E 1, ... , m in turn with a tree sampled from P(t  |t&#8722;j,wj), where wj is the terminal yield of tj.
    (Within each adaptor we actually resample all of the trees t in a randomly chosen order).
    Table label resampling is a kind of Gibbs sweep, but at a higher level in the Bayesian hierarchy than the standard Gibbs sweep.
    It&#8217;s easy to show that table label resampling preserves detailed balance for the adaptor grammars presented in this paper, so interposing table label resampling steps with the standard Gibbs steps also preserves detailed balance.
    We expect table label resampling to have the greatest impact on models with a rich hierarchical structure, and the experimental results in Table 1 confirm this.
    The unigram adaptor grammar does not involve nested adapted
