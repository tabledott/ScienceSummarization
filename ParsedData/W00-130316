unk that is modified by the right chunk, or the chunks that modify the left chunk.
    We leave experiment in such a setting for the future work.
    Figure 1 shows the relationship between the size of the training data and the parsing accuracy.
    This figure shows the accuracy of with and without the dynamic features.
    The parser achieves 86.52% accuracy for test data even with small training data (1172 sentences).
    This is due to a good characteristic of SVMs to cope with the data sparseness problem.
    Furthermore, it achieves almost 100% accuracy for the training data, showing that the training data are completely separated by appropriate combination of features.
    Generally, selecting those specific features of the training data tends to cause overfitting, and accuracy for test data may fall.
    However, the SVMs method achieve a high accuracy not only on the training data but also on the test data.
    We claim that this is due to the high generalization ability of SVMs.
    In addition, obs
