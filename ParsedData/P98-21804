in, provide greater power for resolving both structural attachment and word sense ambiguities.
    While many researchers have acknowledged the utility of labeled relations, they have been at times either unable (e.g., for lack of a sufficiently powerful parser) or unwilling (e.g., focused on purely statistical methods) to make the effort to obtain them.
    This deficiency limits the characterization of word pairs such as river/bank (Wilks et al. 1996) and write/pen (Veronis and Ide 1990) to simple relatedness, whereas the labeled relations of MindNet specify precisely the relations river&#8212;Part--&gt;bank and write&#8212;Means--&gt;pen.
  
  
    The automatic extraction of semantic relations (or semrels) from a definition or example sentence for MindNet produces a hierarchical structure of these relations, representing the entire definition or sentence from which they came.
    Such structures are stored in their entirety in MindNet and provide crucial context for some of the procedures described in lat
