for an expression in the output language, i.e., one that has no complex terms.
    We also will use the terms bound and free as follows: An expression binds a variable v if the expression is of the form &lt; q v r&gt; or q(v, r, s) where g is a quantifier.
    The variable v is said to be bound in the expressions r, or r and s, respectively.
    A variable v is unbound or free in an expression a if there is an occurrence of v in a that is not also an occurrence in a subexpression of a binding v. Note that here quantified wffs and complex terms are both thought of as expressions binding a variable.
    We present both nondeterministic and deterministic versions of the algorithm3 in an ALGOL-like language.
    Both algorithms, however, have the same underlying structure, based on the primitive operation of &amp;quot;applying&amp;quot; a complex term to a wff in which it occurs: a complex term in a wff is replaced by the variable it restricts, and that variable is then bound by wrapping the entire form in the ap
