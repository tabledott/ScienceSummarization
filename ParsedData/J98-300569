ons) to address a specific entity.'
    We will be investigating an algorithm that will select a proper ordering of multiple descriptions referring to the same person within the same discourse.
    After we collect a series of descriptions for each possible entity, we need to decide how to select among them.
    There are two scenarios.
    In the first one, we have to pick one single description from the database that best fits the summary we are generating.
    In the second scenario, the evolving summary, we have to generate a sequence of descriptions, which might possibly view the entity from different perspectives.
    We are investigating algorithms that will decide the order of generation of the different descriptions.
    Among the factors that will influence the selection and ordering of descriptions, we can note the user's interests, his knowledge of the entity, and the focus of the summary (e.g., democratic presidential candidate for Bill Clinton, versus U.S. president).
    We can also select one
