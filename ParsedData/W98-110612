    The case frames therefore have the potential for even higher precision if the unknown words are handled better.
    Expanding the semantic lexicon is one option, and additional work may suggest ways to choose slots for unknown words more intelligently.
    6 Conclusions We have shown that conceptual case frames can be generated automatically using unannotated text as input, coupled with a few hours of manual review.
    Our results for the terrorism domain show that the case frames achieve similar recall levels as the extraction patterns, but with substantially fewer false hits.
    Our results are not directly comparable to the MUC-4 results because the MUC-4 systems contained additional components, such as domainspecific discourse analyzers that resolved coreferent
