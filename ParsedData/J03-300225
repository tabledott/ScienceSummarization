e decision tree software was the widely used C5.0 (http://www.rulequest.com/ demoeula.html).
    We used a decision tree learner because it is transparent (it is easy to see which features are being used to classify page pairs).
    In addition, a decision tree produced by C5.0 can be translated into a fast C program that is a rapid classifier of document pairs.
    Each fold had 87 test items and 174 training items; the fraction of good and bad pairs in each fold&#8217;s test and training sets was roughly equal to the overall division (33% to 67%, respectively).
    Precision and recall results are reported in Table 1, together with baseline results from STRAND&#8217;s untuned classifier as reported above.
    Looking at the decision trees learned, we see that they are very similar to one another.
    In every case a tree that looked like the following was learned: where the remaining branch involved various additional partitionings of the candidate pairs that had few aligned text chunks (small n) and relati
