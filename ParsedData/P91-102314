    Two additional judges, a native speaker of French and a native speaker of German, respectively, were used to check the primary judge on 43 of the more difficult paragraphs having 230 sentences (out of 118 total paragraphs with 725 sentences).
    Both of the additional judges were also fluent in English, having spent the last few years living and working in the United States, though they were both more comfortable with their native language than with English.
    The materials were prepared in order to make the task somewhat less tedious for the judges.
