  Dialogue Act Modeling For Automatic Tagging And Recognition Of Conversational Speech
  
    So do you go to college right now?
    Are yo-, Yeah, it's my last year [laughter].
    You're a, so you're a senior now.
    Yeah, I'm working on my projects trying to graduate [laughter].
    Oh, good for you.
    Yeah.
    That's great, um, is, is N C University is that, uh, State, What did you say?
  
  
    BBN Technologies We describe a statistical approach for modeling dialogue acts in conversational speech, i.e., speechact-like units such as STATEMENT, QUESTION, BACKCHANNEL, AGREEMENT, DISAGREEMENT, and APOLOGY.
    Our model detects and predicts dialogue acts based on lexical, collocational, and prosodic cues, as well as on the discourse coherence of the dialogue act sequence.
    The dialogue model is based on treating the discourse structure of a conversation as a hidden Markov model and the individual dialogue acts as observations emanating from the model states.
    Constraints on the likely sequence of
