 the work that we are re- porting about in this paper.
  The initial separation between the lexicon and the rules is useful in constructing a system for word recognition and generation.
  The rules are, in a sense, a decomposition f a very complex mapping between lexical and surface forms to a set of simpler ela- tions that we can comprehend and ma- nipulate.
  But in the construction of the fi- nal result individual rules and the distinct lexicon disappear.
  The rules play no role at all in the actual generation and recognition process.
  They are needed only for the pur- pose of enlarging the lexicon, although other acquisition methods can be envi- sioned.
  The rules are true generalizations about the two-level exicon constructed with them but they are not a part of it.
  In linguistics the psychological reality of rules is often taken to be established by the observation that a simple listing of all forms would be not only implausible but even impossible, given that the brain must have some storage limit
