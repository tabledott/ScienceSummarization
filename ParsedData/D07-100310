?
			w where X,Y, and Z are ordinary CFG nonterminals, each Si ? 2VS (subsets of nodes in the source treeto which the nonterminals align), and w is a targetlanguage word.
			QG can be made more or less ?lib eral?
			by constraining the cardinality of the Si (weforce all |Si| = 1), and by constraining the relation ships among the Si mentioned in a single rule.
			These are called permissible ?configurations.?
			An example of a strict configuration is that a target parent-childpair must align (respectively) to a source parent child pair.
			Configurations are shown in Table 1.
			Here, following Smith and Eisner (2006), we usea weighted, quasi-synchronous dependency grammar.
			Apart from the obvious difference in appli cation task, there are a few important differences with their model.
			First, we are not interested in thealignments per se; we will sum them out as a hid den variable when scoring a question-answer pair.
			Second, our probability model includes an optional mixture component that permits arbi
