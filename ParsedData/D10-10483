to coreference resolution that addresses these is1As we will discuss below, some approaches use an additional component to infer the overall best mention clusters for a document, but this is still based on confidence scores assigned using local information. sues.
    The approach applies tiers of coreference models one at a time from highest to lowest precision.
    Each tier builds on the entity clusters constructed by previous models in the sieve, guaranteeing that stronger features are given precedence over weaker ones.
    Furthermore, each model&#8217;s decisions are richly informed by sharing attributes across the mentions clustered in earlier tiers.
    This ensures that each decision uses all of the information available at the time.
    We implemented all components in our approach using only deterministic models.
    All our components are unsupervised, in the sense that they do not require training on gold coreference links.
    The contributions of this work are the following: &#8226; We show that
