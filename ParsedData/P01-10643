    This means that and correspond to each other.
    Under our assumptions, can be decomposed as follows: Next, we define as: where is the number of words in that are the same as and is the number of different words in .
    For example, if , where and , then , , , ,and .
    Equation (4) is known as Laplace&#8217;s law (Manning and Sch&#168;utze, 1999). can be defined as: ple, used cohesion based on the spreading activation on a semantic network.
    Hearst (1994) used the similarity of word distributions as measured by the cosine to gauge cohesion.
    Reynar (1994) used word repetition as a measure of cohesion.
    Choi (2000) used the rank of the cosine, rather than the cosine itself, to measure the similarity of sentences.
    The statistical model for the algorithm is described in Section 2, and the algorithm for obtaining the maximum-probability segmentation is described in Section 3.
    Experimental results are presented in Section 4.
