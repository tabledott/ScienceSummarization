ade decisions 313 Note that the edges along which only the human or the program has made a decision (e.g., G--F and G&#8212;.&gt;F in Figure 3 and Figure 4) are not considered in the computation of success rate, since there is no agreement issue in such cases.
    3.2 Evaluation result In the evaluation, we used 400 sentences in the corpus to compute the probabilities that a phrase is removed, reduced, or unchanged.
    We tested the program on the rest 100 sentences.
    Using five-fold validation (i.e., chose different 100 sentences for testing each time and repeating the experiment five times), The program achieved an average success rate of 81.3%.
    If we consider the baseline as removing all the prepositional phrases, clauses, to-infinitives and gerunds, the baseline performance is 43.2%.
    We also computed the success rate of program's decisions on particular types of phrases.
    For the decisions on removing or keeping a clause, the system has a success rate of 78.1%; for the decisions on removing
