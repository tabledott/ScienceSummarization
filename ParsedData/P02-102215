    Our approach is also related to work on user interfaces to architectural facilities such as development environments, e.g.
    (Brugman et al., 1998) and to work on comparing different versions of information, e.g.
    (Sparck-Jones and Galliers, 1996; Paggio, 1998).
    This work is particularly novel in that it addresses the complete range of issues in NLP application development in a flexible and extensible way, rather than focusing just on some particular aspect of the development process.
    In addition, it promotes robustness, re-usability, and scalability as important principles that help with the construction of practical NLP systems.
    8 Conclusions In this paper we have described an infrastructure for language engineering software which aims to assist
