er semirings described in Figure 5, are not commutative under their multiplicative operator, concatenation.
    In many parsers, it is conventional to compute parse forests: compact representations of the set of trees consistent with the input.
    We will use a related concept, derivation forests, a compact representation of the set of derivations consistent with the input, which corresponds to the parse forest for CFGs, but is easily extended to other formalisms.
    Often, we will not be interested in the set of all derivations, but only in the most probable derivation.
    The Viterbi-derivation semiring computes this value.
    Alternatively, we might want the n best derivations, which would be useful if the output of the parser were passed to another stage, such as semantic disambiguation; this value is computed by the Viterbi-n-best derivation semiring.
    Notice that each of the derivation semirings can also be used to create transducers.
    That is, we simply associate strings rather than grammar r
