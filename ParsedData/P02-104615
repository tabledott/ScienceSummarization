e dependence is satisfied, proving the theorem.
  
  
    Dasgupta, Littman, and McAllester suggest a possible algorithm at the end of their paper, but they give only the briefest suggestion, and do not implement or evaluate it.
    I give here an algorithm, the Greedy Agreement Algorithm, that constructs paired rules that agree on unlabeled data, and I examine its performance.
    The algorithm is given in figure 4.
    It begins with two seed rules, one for each view.
    At each iteration, each possible extension to one of the rules is considered and scored.
    The best one is kept, and attention shifts to the other rule.
    A complex rule (or classifier) is a list of atomic rules H, each associating a single feature h with a label t. H(x) = t if x has feature h, and H(x) = L otherwise.
    A given atomic rule is permitted to appear multiple times in the list.
    Each atomic rule occurrence gets one vote, and the classifier&#8217;s prediction is the label that receives the most votes.
