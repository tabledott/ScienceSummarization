n average ac curacy of 66.5%, while the human-annotated list HM performed at 78.7% accuracy vs. the gold standard (GI-H4) 8.
			The remaining14, 328 adjectives were not identified as sen timent marked and therefore were considered neutral.
			The stratification of adjectives by their Net Overlap Score can serve as an indicatorof their degree of membership in the cate gory of (positive/negative) sentiment.
			Since low degrees of membership are associated with greater ambiguity and inter-annotator disagreement, the Net Overlap Score valuecan provide researchers with a set of vol ume/accuracy trade-offs.
			For example, by including only the adjectives with the Net Overlap Score of 4 and more, the researchercan obtain a list of 1, 828 positive and negative adjectives with accuracy of 81% vs. GI H4, or 3, 124 adjectives with 75% accuracy if the threshold is set at 3.
			The normalization of the Net Overlap Score values for the use inphrase and text-level sentiment tagging systems was achieved using the fuzzy mem
