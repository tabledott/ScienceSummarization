o combine the contributions for each term based on the document model and also a generic model of the language.
    Many have found that a simple mixture model using document term frequencies for the former, and occurrence statistics from a large corpus for the later, works quite well.
    McNamee and Mayfield (2001) have shown using HAIRCUT that overlapping character n-grams are effective for retrieval in non-Asian languages (e.g., using n=6) and that translingual retrieval between closely related languages is quite feasible even without translation resources of any kind (McNamee and Mayfield, 2002).
    For the task of retrieving Mandarin audio from Chinese text queries on the TDT-2 task, the system described by Meng et al (2000) achieved a mean average precision of 0.733 using character bigrams for indexing.
    On identical queries, HAIRCUT achieved 0.762 using character bigrams.
    This figure forms the monolingual baseline for our CLIR system.
    We first indexed the automatic transcription of the TDT
