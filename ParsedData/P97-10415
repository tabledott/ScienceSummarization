sed algorithm which can produce an accurate segmentation of a text, given a rudimentary initial approximation to the segmentation.
    Recognizing the utility of multiple correct segmentations of the same text, our algorithm also allows the output of a wide variety of existing segmentation algorithms to be adapted to different segmentation schemes.
    In addition, our rule-based algorithm can also be used to supplement the segmentation of an existing algorithm in order to compensate for an incomplete lexicon.
    Our algorithm is trainable and language independent, so it can be used with any unsegmented h.nguage.
  
  
    The key component of our trainable segmentation algorithm is Transformation-based Error-driven Learning, the corpus-based language processing method introduced by Brill (1993a).
    This technique provides a simple algorithm for learning a sequence of rules that can be applied to various NLP tasks.
    It differs from other common corpus-based methods in several ways.
    For one, it is we
