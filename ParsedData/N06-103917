    After taking all the basic patterns from every basic cluster, we compute the Inverse Cluster Frequency (ICF) of each unique basic pattern.
    ICF is similar to the Inverse Document Frequency (IDF) of words, which is used to calculate the weight of each basic pattern for metaclustering.
    Finally, we can perform metaclustering to obtain tables.
    We compute the similarity between each basic cluster pair, as seen in Figure 6.
    XA and XB are the set of cross-document entities from basic clusters cA and cB, respectively.
    We examine all possible mappings of relations (parallel mappings of multiple entities) from both basic clusters, and find all the mappings M whose similarity score exceeds a certain threshold. wordsim(cA, cB) is the bag-of-words similarity of two clusters.
    As a weighting function we used ICF: We then sort the similarities of all po
