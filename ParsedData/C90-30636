 al.
  1986], the cooccurrence patterns reflect regu- larized or canonical structure.
  Therefore the post- processing algorithm has to map surface structures into the normalized relations.
  During our experi- ments we have used two different implementations for this algorithm [Lappin et al.
  1988] [Jensen 1989], which take into account structures like passives, sub- clauses, questions and relative and infinitive clauses.
  The use of an automatic procedure for extracting information from a corpus that was not preprocessed manually raises a basic problem of circularity.
  Since the corpus was not disambiguated, it is not possible to distinguish the semantically correct patterns from the incorrect ones.
  Both types of ambiguity, syntac- tic and lexical, may cause the system to acquire or use inappropriate patterns.
  This problems is consid~ ered very important when dealing with a corpus: it was the re,Leon for the substantial human interven- tion in the procedure of [Grishman et al.
  1986], and it is the
