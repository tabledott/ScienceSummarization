  TnT - A Statistical Part-Of-Speech Tagger
  
    Trigrams'n'Tags (TnT) is an efficient statistical part-of-speech tagger.
    Contrary to claims found elsewhere in the literature, we argue that a tagger based on Markov models performs at least as well as other current approaches, including the Maximum Entropy framework.
    A recent comparison has even shown that TnT performs significantly better for the tested corpora.
    We describe the basic model of TnT, the techniques used for smoothing and for handling unknown words.
    Furthermore, we present evaluations on two corpora.
  
  
    A large number of current language processing systems use a part-of-speech tagger for pre-processing.
    The tagger assigns a (unique or ambiguous) part-ofspeech tag to each token in the input and passes its output to the next processing level, usually a parser.
    Furthermore, there is a large interest in part-ofspeech tagging for corpus annotation projects, who create valuable linguistic resources by a combination of
