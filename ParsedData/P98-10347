    The next section presents the training and application phases of the treebank approach to base NP identification in more detail.
    Section 3 describes our general approach for pruning the base NP grammar as well as two instantiations of that approach.
    The evaluation and a discussion of the results appear in Section 4, along with techniques for reducing training time and an initial investigation into the use of local repair heuristics.
  
  
    Figure 2 depicts the treebank approach to base NP identification.
    For training, the algorithm requires a corpus that has been annotated with base NPs.
    More specifically, we assume that the training corpus is a sequence of words wi, w2,..., along with a set of base NP annotations b(i1,j1), ..., where b(,j) indicates that the NP brackets words i through j: [Nr, wi, , wj].
    The goal of the training phase is to create a base NP grammar from this training corpus: The resulting &amp;quot;grammar&amp;quot; can then be used to identify base NPs in a
