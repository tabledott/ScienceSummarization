    Note that with this redefinition of m, the Prologue relation as defined above will now freely introduce all the brackets for all of the subrules.
    It will also be helpful to notate the set of brackets not containing those for the kth subrule: M&#8212;k = m - mk. o Now consider the regular language Leftcontext(A &lt;k &gt;lk , )m k. This contains strings in which all instances of the kth subrule's left-context expression are followed by one of the kth left-context brackets, and those brackets appear only after instances of Ak.
    The kth right-context brackets are freely distributed, as are all brackets for all the other subrules.
    Occurrences of all other left-context brackets are restricted in similarly defined regular languages.
    Putting all these bracket-restrictions together, the language nLeftcontext(Ak , &lt;k, &gt;k)m&#8212;k has each subrule's left-context duly marked by one of that subrule's left-context brackets.
    This leaves all right-context brackets unconstrained; they are res
