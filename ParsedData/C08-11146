word pair.
			For a given word pair, such as mason:stone, the first step is to generate morphological variations,such as masons:stones.
			In the following experi ments, we use morpha (morphological analyzer)and morphg (morphological generator) for mor phological processing (Minnen et al, 2001).1 The second step is to search in a large corpus for all phrases of the following form: ?[0 to 1 words] X [0 to 3 words] Y [0 to 1 words]?
			In this template, X:Y consists of morphologicalvariations of the given word pair, in either order; for example, mason:stone, stone:mason, masons:stones, and so on.
			A typical phrase for ma son:stone would be ?the mason cut the stone with?.
			We then normalize all of the phrases that are found, by using morpha to remove suffixes.
			The template we use here is similar to Turney (2006), but we have added extra context wordsbefore the X and after the Y . Our morpholog ical processing also differs from Turney (2006).In the following experiments, we search in a cor pus of 5 ? 1010
