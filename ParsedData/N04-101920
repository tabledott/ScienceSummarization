ids might yield a higher score for &#8217;q&#8217;.
    The score variability at order-1 is huge: it can be as high as 0.5.
    With higher order pyramids, scores stabilize.
    Specifically, in our data, if summaries diverge at some point as in Figure 3, where the minimum score for the better summary is higher than the maximum score for the worse summary, the size of the divergence never decreases as pyramid order increases.
    For pyramids of order &gt; 4, the chance that &#8217;b&#8217; and &#8217;q&#8217; reverse ranking approaches zero.
    For all pairs of divergent summaries, the relationship of scores follows the same pattern we see in Figure 3 and the point of divergence where the scores for one summary become consistently higher than those of the othere, was found to be stable &#8211; in all pair instances, if summary A gets higher scores than summary B for all pyramids of order n, than A gets higher scores for pyramids of order &gt; n. We analyzed the score distributions for all 67 pairs of &#8221
