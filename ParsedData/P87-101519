    Frontier nodes are annotated by zero arty functions corresponding to elementary structures.
    Each treelet (an internal node with all its children) represents the use of a rule that is encapsulated by the grammar The grammar encapsulates (either explicitly or implicitly) a finite number of rules that can be written as follows: n &gt; 0 In the case of CFG's, for each production In the case of TAG's, a derivation step in which the derived trees RI, &#8226; &#8226; &#8226; , On are adjoined into fi at rhe addresses &#8226; &#8226; &#8226; &#8226; in. would involve the use of the following rule2.
    The composition operations in the case of CFG's are parameterized by the productions.
    In TAG's the elementary tree and addresses where adjunction takes place are used to instantiate the operation.
    To show that the derivation trees of any grammar in LCFRS is a local set, we can rewrite the annotated derivation trees such that every node is labelled by a pair to include the composition operations.
