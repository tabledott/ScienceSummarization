    Then we have There are three possibilities for dealing with this problem.
    The first is to discard or restrict Leibniz's Law.
    The second is to deny that the Evening Star and the Morning Star are identical as entities in the Platonic universe; they only happen to he identical in the real world, and that is not sufficient for intersubstitutivity.
    The third is to deny that expression (16) represents sentence (14) because 'the Evening Star&amp;quot; in (14) does not refer to what it seems to refer to.
    The first possibility is the approach of researchers who treat belief as an operator rather than as a predicate, and then re&#8226; strict substitution inside the op
