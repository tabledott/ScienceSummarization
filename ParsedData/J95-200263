by the Inside/Outside algorithm, which is more naturally formulated as a bottom-up algorithm.
    Both Nakagawa (1987) and Easeler (1988) use a nonprobabilistic Earley parser augmented with &amp;quot;word match&amp;quot; scoring.
    Though not truly probabilistic, these algorithms are similar to the Viterbi version described here, in that they find a parse that optimizes the accumulated matching scores (without regard to rule probabilities).
    Prediction and completion loops do not come into play since no precise inner or forward probabilities are computed.
    Magerman and Marcus (1991) are interested primarily in scoring functions to guide a parser efficiently to the most promising parses.
    Earley-style top-down prediction is used only to suggest worthwhile parses, not to compute precise probabilities, which they argue would be an inappropriate metric for natural language parsing.
    Casacuberta and Vidal (1988) exhibit an Earley parser that processes weighted (not necessarily probabilistic) CFGs and
