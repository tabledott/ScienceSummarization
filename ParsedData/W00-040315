 the amount of effort required, we believe that the larger effort on the part of the judges is more or less compensated with the ability to evaluate summaries off-line and at variable compression rates.
    Alternative evaluations don't make such evaluations possible.
    We should concede that a utility-based approach is probably not feasible for query-based summaries as these are typically done only on-line.
    We discussed the possibility of a sentence contributing negatively to the utility of another sentence due to redundancy.
    We should also point out that sentences can also reinforce one another positively.
    For example, if a sentence mentioning a new entity is included in a summary, one might also want to include a sentence that puts the entity in the context of the reit of the article or cluster.
  
  
    We presented a new multi-document summarizer, MEAD.
    It summarizes clusters of news articles automatically grouped by a topic detection system.
    MEAD uses information from the centroid
