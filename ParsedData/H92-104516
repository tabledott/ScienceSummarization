olysemous nouns drawn from the same article will have the same sense.
  In fact, the experiment tested a particularly difficult case, since it did not include any unambiguous words.
  If we assume a mixture of 60% un- ambiguous words and 40% polysemous words, then the probability moves from 94% to 100% x .60 + 94% x .40 98%.
  In other words, there is a very strong tendency (98%) for multiple uses of a word to share the same sense in well-written coherent discourse.
  One might ask if this result is specific to Groliers or to good writing or some other factor.
  The first author looked at the usage of these same nine words in the Brown Corpus, which is believed to be a more balanced sample of general language and which is also more widely available than Groliers and is therefore more amenable to replication.
  The Brown Corpus consists of 500 dis- course fragments of 2000 words, each.
  We were able to find 259 concordance lines like the ones above, show- ing two instances of one of the nine test words select
