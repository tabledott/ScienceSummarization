o given input strings.
    Identical words that appear in both input sentences are potential matches.
    Since the same word may appear multiple times in the sentence, there are multiple ways to produce an alignment between the two input strings.
    The goal is to find the alignment that represents the best correspondence between the strings.
    This alignment is defined as the alignment that has the smallest number of &#8220;crossing edges.
    The matcher can also consider morphological variants of the same word as potential matches.
    To simultaneously align more than two sentences, the matcher simply produces alignments for all pair-wise combinations of the set of sentences.
    In the context of its use within our MEMT approach, the word-alignment matcher provides three main benefits.
    First, it explicitly identifies translated words that appear in multiple MT translations, allowing the MEMT algorithm to reinforce words that are common among the systems.
    Second, the alignment information allo
