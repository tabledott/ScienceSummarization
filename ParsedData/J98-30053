    However, only recently have there been practical results in the area of summarization.
    Summaries can be used to determine if any of the retrieved articles are relevant (thereby allowing the user to avoid reading those that are not) or can be read in place of the articles to learn about information of interest to the user.
    Existing summarization systems (e.g., Preston and Williams 1994; Cuts 1994; NetSumm 1996; Kupiec, Pedersen, and Chen 1995; Rau, Brandow, and Mitze, 1994) typically use statistical techniques to extract relevant sentences from a news article.
    This domain-independent approach produces a summary of a single article at a time, which can indicate to the user what the article is about.
    In contrast, our work focuses on generation of a summary that briefs the user on information in which he has indicated interest.
    Such briefings pull together information of interest from multiple sources, aggregating information to provide generalizations, similarities, and differences
