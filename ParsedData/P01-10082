    This paper presents a corpus-based method for automatic extraction of paraphrases.
    We use a large collection of multiple parallel English translations of novels1.
    This corpus provides many instances of paraphrasing, because translations preserve the meaning of the original source, but may use different words to convey the meaning.
    An example of parallel translations is shown in Figure 1.
    It contains two pairs of paraphrases: (&#8220;burst into tears&#8221;, &#8220;cried&#8221;) and (&#8220;comfort&#8221;, &#8220;console&#8221;).
    Emma burst into tears and he tried to comfort her, saying things to make her smile.
    Emma cried, and he tried to console her, adorning his words with puns.
    Our method for paraphrase extraction builds upon methodology developed in Machine Translation (MT).
    In MT, pairs of translated sentences from a bilingual corpus are aligned, and occurrence patterns of words in two languages in the text are extracted and matched using correlation measures
