, the estimate used is proportional to this average.
    If we have seen only one case of a noun and it occurred with a preposition p (that is f (n, p) = 1 and f (n) = 1), then our estimate is nearly cut in half.
    This is the kind of effect we want, since under these circumstances we are not very confident in 1 as an estimate of P(p I n).
    When f (n, p) is large, the adjustment factor does not make much difference.
    In general; this interpolation procedure adjusts small counts in the right direction and has little effect when counts are large.
    For our current example, this estimation procedure changes the LA score little: The LA score of 5.87 for this example is positive and therefore indicates verb attachment; the magnitude is large enough to suggest a strong preference for verb attachment.
    This method of calculating the LA score was used both to decide unsure cases in building the bigram tables as described in Ambiguous Attach 1, and to make the attachment decisions in novel ambiguous cases
