d to thewords located on the periphery, more central ele ments of the set usually have stronger and more numerous semantic relations with other categorymembers 5.
			Second, the membership of these cen tral words in the category is less ambiguous than the membership of more peripheral words.
			Thus, we can estimate the centrality of a word in a given category in two ways: 1.

			Lexicographical entries in the dictionaries, suchas WordNet, seek to establish semantic equivalence between the word and its definition and provide a rich source of human-annotated relationships between the words.
