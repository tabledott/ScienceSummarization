est set remained unseen until all parameters were fixed.
    The final results reported this paper were obtained on the test set, unless stated otherwise.
    Grammar Induction For the unlexicalized PCFG model (henceforth baseline model), we used the probabilistic left-corner parser Lopar (Schmid, 2000).
    When run in unlexicalized mode, Lopar implements the model described in Section 3.1.
    A grammar and a lexicon for Lopar were read off the Negra training set, after removing all grammatical function labels.
    As Lopar cannot handle traces, these were also removed from the training data.
    The head-lexicalized model of Carroll and Rooth (1998) (henceforth C&amp;R model) was again realized using Lopar, which in lexicalized mode implements the model in Section 3.2.
    Lexicalization requires that each rule in a grammar has one of the categories on its righthand side annotated as the head.
    For the categories S, VP, AP, and AVP, the head is marked in Negra.
    For the other categories, we used rule
