gy component and tabulated.
    In the second stage, the various types of co-occurrence relations which have been identified in the text are forwarded to a set of independent similarity modules, which operate in parallel.
    Each similarity module uses some linguistic criterion to judge the similarity or dissimilarity between any two adjectives, producing a real number between 0 and 1; a module may also refrain from making any judgement.
    The third stage combines the opinions of the various similarity modules in a single dissimilarity measure for any pair of adjectives.
    Finally, the fourth stage clusters the adjectives into groups according to the dissimilarity measure, so that adjectives with a high degree of pairwise similarity fall in the same cluster (and, consequently, adjectives with a low degree of similarity fall in different clusters).
    The algorithm currently uses two similarity modules based on two sources of linguistic data: data that help establish that two adjectives are related, and
