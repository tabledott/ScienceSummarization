f each link is represented by its own nonterminal, and production rules must be binary-branching, then some of the nonterminals involved in generating this alignment need discontinuities, or gaps.
    Figure 1(b) illustrates how to generate the sentence pair and its word alignment in this manner.
    The nonterminals X and Y have one discontinuity each.
    More generally, for any positive integer k, it is possible to construct a word alignment that cannot be generated using binary production rules whose nonterminals all have fewer than k gaps (Satta and Peserico, 2005).
    Our study measured the complexity of a word alignment as the minimum number of gaps needed to generate it under the following constraints: Our measure of alignment complexity is analogous to what Melamed et al. (2004) call &#8220;fanout.&#8221;3 The least complex alignments on this measure &#8212; those that can be generated with zero gaps &#8212; are precisely those that can be generated by an mum/median/maximum sentence lengths in each
