ns et al. (2005) suggest a method to reorder the German input before translating using a set of manually crafted rules.
    In our German&#8211;English submissions, this is done both to the training data and the input to the machine translation system.
  
  
    Our submission to the WMT 2007 shared task is a fairly straight-forward use of the Moses MT system using default parameters.
    In a sense, we submitted a baseline performance of this system.
    BLEU and NIST scores for all our systems on the test sets are displayed in Table 2.
    Compared to other submitted systems, these are very good scores, often the best or second highest scores for these tasks.
    We made a special effort in two areas: We explored domain adaptation methods for the NewsCommentary test sets and we used reordering rules for the German&#8211;English language pair.
