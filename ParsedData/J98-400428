first child is also labeled NP are affected by this transformation.
    The effect of this transformation is to excise all the children nodes labeled NP from the tree, and to attach their children as direct descendants of the parent node, as depicted in the schema below.
    Parent appends to each nonroot nonterminal node's label its parent's category.
    The effect of this transformation is to produce trees of the kind discussed in Section 4.4.
    It is straightforward to estimate PCFGs using the relative frequency estimator from the sequences of trees produced by applying these transforms to the WSJ corpus.
    We turn now to the question of evaluating the different PCFGs so obtained.
    None of the PCFGs induced from the various tree representations discussed here reliably identifies the correct tree representations on sentences from held-out data.
    It is standard to evaluate broad-coverage parsers using less-stringent criteria that measure how similiar the trees produced by the parser are to the &am
