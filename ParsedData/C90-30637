reason why other techniques use manually tagged corpora (e.g.
  [Church 1988]).
  In practice, however, we have discovered that the problem is not so cruciah semantically vMid pat- terns have occurred many more times in syntac- tically unambiguous constructs than in mnbiguous ones.
  Thus, they could be identified without the need of first disambiguating the sentences.
  Seman- tically non-valid patterns indeed occurred in the in- appropriate parses but they were too rare to pass the threshold.
  As tbr lcxical ambiguities, the chance that one sense of a word will be confused with an- other during disambiguation seems to be very small, and it never happened in our experiment.
  4 The Experiment An experiment was performed to resolve references of the anaphor "it" in the IIansard corpus.
  The examples of the ambiguous entences were selected in tile following way: First, sentences containing the word "it" were extracted randomly from the corpus.
  Then, we manually filtered out sentences that were not relevant
