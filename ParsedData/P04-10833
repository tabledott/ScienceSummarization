recedes the second (B).
    In the bottom row, [1,2,1] indicates that the first nonterminal both precedes and follows the second, i.e.
    D is discontinuous.
    Discontinuous nonterminals are annotated with the number of their contiguous segments, as in .
    The (&#8220;join&#8221;) operator rearranges the nonterminals in each component according to their role template.
    The nonterminals on the RHS are written in columns called links.
    Links express translational equivalence.
    Some nonterminals might have no translation in some components, indicated by (), as in the 2nd row.
    Terminal productions have exactly one &#8220;active&#8221; component, in which there is exactly one terminal on the RHS.
    The other components are inactive.
    E.g., (2) The semantics of are the usual semantics of rewriting systems, i.e., that the expression on the LHS can be rewritten as the expression on the RHS.
    However, all the nonterminals in the same link must be rewritten simultaneously.
    In this manner,
