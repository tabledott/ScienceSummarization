nsducers corresponding to phonological rewrite rules, but it applies to regular relations or transducers no matter how they are specified.
  Although regular elations in general are not closed under intersection, the subclass of relations denoted by standard two-level rules is closed under this operation (Kaplan [9]).
  Thus fstl and fst2 in Figure 2 may represent either a single two- level rule or the intersection of any number of rules.
  When the relationship between lexical and surface forms is complex, the descrip- tive task of setting up rules that relate the two levels can be simplified by decompos- ing the complex relation to a series of less opaque matches.
  For efficient recognition and generation, the resulting cascade can be reduced to a single transducer.
  Al- though it would be possible in principle to produce the same single transducer directly from two-level rules, we have found many cases in our descriptions of English and French where the composition approach is not only easier but also AC
