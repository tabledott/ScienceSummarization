rgue that it is more difficult to confuse yes-no questions with wh-questions than with statements.
    We will also see in a moment that interpreting the results with weighted coefficients is difficult.
    We will return to both of these problems in what follows.
    Before labeling can take place, the units of annotation, or markables, need to be identified&#8212;a process Krippendorff (1995, 2004a) calls unitizing.
    The practice in CL for the forms of annotation discussed in the previous section is to assume that the units are linguistic constituents which can be easily identified, such as words, utterances, or noun phrases, and therefore there is no need to check the reliability of this process.
    We are aware of few exceptions to this assumption, such as Carletta et al. (1997) on unitization for move coding and our own work on the GNOME corpus (Poesio 2004b).
    In cases such as text segmentation, however, the identification of units is as important as their labeling, if not more important, and the
