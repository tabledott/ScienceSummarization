ty in natural language, this set can presumably become extremely large.
    Collins (2000) and Collins and Duffy (2002) rerank the top N parses from an existing generative parser, but this kind of approach presupposes that there is an existing baseline model with reasonable performance.
    Many of these baseline models are themselves used with heuristic search techniques, so that the potential gain through the use of discriminative re-ranking techniques is further dependent on effective search.
    This paper explores an alternative approach to parsing, based on the perceptron training algorithm introduced in Collins (2002).
    In this approach the training and decoding problems are very closely related &#8211; the training method decodes training examples in sequence, and makes simple corrective updates to the parameters when errors are made.
    Thus the main complexity of the method is isolated to the decoding problem.
    We describe an approach that uses an incremental, left-to-right parser, with beam
