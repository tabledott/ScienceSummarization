oduct features from reviews, but OPINE significantly improves on both.
			(Hu and Liu, 2004) doesn?t assess candidate features, so its precision is lower than OPINE?s.
			(Kobayashi et al, 2004) employsan iterative semi-automatic approach which requires human input at every iteration.
			Neither model explicitly ad dresses composite (feature of feature) or implicit features.
			Other systems (Morinaga et al, 2002; Kushal et al, 2003) also look at Web product reviews but they do not extract 345 opinions about particular product features.
