			We also implemented Algorithms 2 and 3 in a parsing-based MT decoder (Chiang, 2005) and report results on decoding speed.
			5.1 Experiment 1: Bikel Parser.
			Bikel?s parser (2004) is a state-of-the-art multilingual parser based on lexicalized context-free models (Collins, 2003; Eisner, 2000).
			It does support k-best parsing, but, following Collins?
			parse-reranking work (Collins, 2000)(see also Section 5.1.2), it accomplishes this by sim ply abandoning dynamic programming, i.e., no items are considered equivalent (Charniak and Johnson, 2005).
			Theoretically, the time complexity is exponential in n (the input sentence length) and constant in k, since, withoutmerging of equivalent items, there is no limit on the num ber of items in the chart.
			In practice, beam search is used to reduce the observed time.5 But with the standard beamwidth of 10?4, this method becomes prohibitively expen sive for n ? 25 on Bikel?s parser.
