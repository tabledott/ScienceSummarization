ng a 76% accuracy for the probability model portion of our algorithm on identified argument slots.
    Moreover, we also find that all specificity levels of the probability model (see Figure 1) are employed in making these decisions&#8212;about a third of the decisions are made by each level.
    This indicates that while there is sufficient data in many cases to warrant using the exact probability formula , the class-based generalizations we propose prove to be very useful to the algorithm.
    As a point of comparison, the supervised method of Gildea and Jurafsky (2002) achieved 82.1% accuracy on identified arguments using general thematic roles.
    However, they had a larger and more varied target set, consisting of 1462 predicates from 67 FrameNet frames (classes), which makes their task harder than ours.
    We are aware that our test set is small compared to supervised approaches, which have a large amount of labelled data available.
    However, our almost identical results across the validation and t
