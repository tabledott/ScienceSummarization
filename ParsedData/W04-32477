umber of pages that link to that page as well as the individual scores of the linking pages.
    More formally, the PageRank of a page is given as follows: PR where are pages that link to , C is the number of outgoing links from page , and is the damping factor which can be set between and .
    This recursively defined value can be computed by forming the binary adjacency matrix, , of the Web, where if there is a link from page to page , normalizing this matrix so that row sums equal to , and finding the principal eigenvector of the normalized matrix.
    PageRank for th page equals to the th entry in the eigenvector.
    Principal eigenvector of a matrix can be computed with a simple iterative power method.
    This method can be directly applied to the cosine similarity graph to find the most prestigious sentences in a document.
    We use PageRank to weight each vote so that a vote that comes from a more prestigious sentence has a greater value in the centrality of a sentence.
