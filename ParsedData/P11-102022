between preserving the meaning and producing more varied paraphrases.
    Systems trained on fewer parallel sentences are more conservative and make fewer mistakes.
    On the other hand, systems trained on more parallel sentences often produce very good paraphrases but are also more likely to diverge from the original meaning.
    As a comparison, evaluating each human description as a paraphrase for the other descriptions in the same cluster resulted in a BLEU score of 52.9 and a PINC score of 77.2.
    Thus, all the systems performed very well in terms of retaining semantic content, although not as well in producing novel sentences.
    To validate the results suggested by the automatic metrics, we asked two fluent English speakers to rate the generated paraphrases on the following categories: semantic, dissimilarity, and overall.
    Semantic measures how well the paraphrase preserves the original meaning while dissimilarity measures how much the paraphrase differs from the source sentence.
