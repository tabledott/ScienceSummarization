inst a standard, widely available information retrieval system developed at Cornell University, [Buckley SMART utilizes a modified TF*IDF measure (ATC) plus stemming and a fairly sizable stopword list.
    Third, we use as a baseline method the default selection of the most frequent category, i.e., &amp;quot;not similar&amp;quot;.
    While this last method cannot be effectively used to identify similar paragraphs, it offers a baseline for the overall accuracy of any more sophisticated technique for this task.
    5.4 Experimental Results Our system was able to recover 36.6% of the similar paragraphs with 60.5% precision, as shown in Table 1.
    In comparison, the unmodiobtained only 32.6% precision when recall is 39.1%, i.e., close to our system's recall; and only 20.8% recall at precision of 62.2%, comparable to our classifier's used version 11.0 of SMART, released in July 1992.
