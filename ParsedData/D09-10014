    A major challenge to semantic parsing is syntactic variations of the same meaning, which abound in natural languages.
    For example, the aforementioned sentence can be rephrased as &#8220;Utah is next to Idaho,&#8221;&#8220;Utah shares a border with Idaho,&#8221; etc.
    Manually encoding all these variations into the grammar is tedious and error-prone.
    Supervised semantic parsing addresses this issue by learning to construct the grammar automatically from sample meaning annotations (Mooney, 2007).
    Existing approaches differ in the meaning representation languages they use and the amount of annotation required.
    In the approach of Zettlemoyer and Collins (2005), the training data consists of sentences paired with their meanings in lambda form.
    A probabilistic combinatory categorial grammar (PCCG) is learned using a loglinear model, where the probability of the final logical form L and meaning-derivation tree T conditioned on the sentence
