    Words with their Pos-classes are usually kept in a lexicon.

    The simplest approach to Pos-class guessing is either to assign all possible tags to an unknown word or to assign the most probable one, which is proper singular noun for capitalized words and common singular noun otherwise.
    The appealing feature of these approaches is their extreme s
