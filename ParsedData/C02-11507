classifying questions.
			Wendy Lehnert?s conceptual taxonomy (Lehnert, 1986), for example, proposesabout 13 conceptual classes including causal antecedent, goal orientation, enablement, causal consequent, verification, disjunctive, and so on.
			How ever, in the context of factual questions that are of interest to us here, conceptual categories do notseem to be helpful; instead, our goal is to se mantically classify questions, as in earlier work on TREC (Singhal et al, 2000; Hovy et al, 2001; Harabagiu et al, 2001; Ittycheriah et al, 2001).
			The key difference, though, is that we attempt todo that with a significantly finer taxonomy of answer types; the hope is that with the semantic an swer types as input, one can easily locate answercandidates, given a reasonably accurate named en tity recognizer for documents.
			2.2 Question Hierarchy.
			We define a two-layered taxonomy, which repre sents a natural semantic classification for typicalanswers in the TREC task.
			The hierarchy con tains 6 coarse classes
