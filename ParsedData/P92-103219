sly, the test words in Tables 1 and 2 were selected from the literature on polysemy, and therefore, tend to focus on the more difficult cases.
    In another experiment, we selected a random sample of 97 words; 67 of them were unambiguous and therefore had a baseline performance of 100%.10 The remaining thirty words are listed along with the number of senses and baseline performance: virus (2, 98%), device (3, 97%), direction (2, 96%), reader (2, 96%), core (3, 94%), hull (2, 94%), right (5, 94%), proposition (2, 89%), deposit (2, 88%), hour (4, 87%), path (2, 86%), view (3, 86%), pyramid (3, 82%), antenna (2, 81%), trough (3, 77%), tyranny (2, 75%), figure (6, 73%), institution (4, 71%), crown (4, 64%), drum (2, 63%), pipe (4, 60%), processing (2, 59%), coverage (2, 58%), execution (2, 57%), min (2, 57%), interior (4, 56%), campaign (2, 51%), output (2, 51%), gin (3, 50%), drive (3, 49%).
    In studying these 97 words, we found that the average baseline performance is much higher than we might have guessed
