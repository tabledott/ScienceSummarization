preposition p. First, define cN(p) = En c(n,p,true) as the number of noun attached tuples with the preposition
  
  
    Approximately 970K unannotated sentences from the 1988 Wall St. Journal were processed in a manner identical to the example sentence in Table 1.
    The result was approximately 910,000 head word tuples of the form (v ,p, n2) or (n,p, n2).
    Note that while the head word tuples represent correct attachments only 69% of the time, their quantity is about 45 times greater than the quantity of data used in previous supervised approaches.
    The extracted data was used as training material for the three classifiers clbasel Chnterp, and cibigram&#8226; Each classifier is constructed as follows: Cl base This is the &amp;quot;baseline&amp;quot; classifier that predicts N of p = of, and V otherwise. c/interp: This classifier has the form of equation (1), uses the method in section 4.1 to generate 0, and the method in section 4.2.2 to generate p. clbigram: This classifier has the form of equation
