    3.2.1 Method.
    For seen and unseen adjective-noun bigrams, we used the two sets of plausibility judgments collected by Lapata, McDonald, and Keller (1999) and Lapata, Keller, and McDonald (2001), respectively.
    We conducted four additional experiments to collect judgments for noun-noun and verb-object bigrams, both seen and unseen.
    The experimental method was the same for all six experiments.
    Materials.
    The experimental stimuli were based on the six sets of seen or unseen bigrams extracted from the BNC as described in Section 2.1 (adjective-noun, nounnoun, and verb-object bigrams).
    In the adjective-noun and noun-noun cases, the stimuli consisted simply of the bigrams.
    In the verb-object case, the bigrams were embedded in a short sentence to make them more natural: A proper-noun subject was added.
    Procedure.
    The experimental paradigm was magnitude estimation (ME), a technique standardly used in psychophysics to measure judgments of sensory stimuli
