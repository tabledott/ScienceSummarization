 disjoint (hence the need to include leaf as a possible expansion, which acts as a stop probability).
			All the experiments reported in this section were conducted using sections 02-21 of CCGbank as training corpus, and section 23 as test corpus.
			We replace all rare words in the training data with their POS-tag.
			For all experiments reported here and in section 5, the frequency threshold was set to 5.
			LikeCollins (1999), we assume that the test data is POS tagged, and can therefore replace unknown words inthe test data with their POS-tag, which is more ap propriate for a formalism like CCG with a large set of lexical categories than one generic token for all unknown words.
			The performance of the baseline model is shown in the top row of table 3.
			For six out of the 2379 sentences in our test corpus we do not get a parse.1The reason is that a lexicon consisting of the word category pairs observed in the training corpus does not contain all the entries required to parse the test corpus.
			We disc
