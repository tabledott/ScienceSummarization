 with the adequacy mentioned in the sentence.
    It then assumed that the pressure was lube oil.
    It is clear what went wrong here.
    Pressure is a magnitude whereas lube oil is a material, and magnitudes can't be materials.
    In principle, abduction requires a check for the consistency of what is assumed, and our knowledge base should have contained axioms from which it could be inferred that a magnitude is not a material.
    In practice, unconstrained consistency checking is undecidable and, at best, may take a long time.
    Nevertheless, one can, through the use of a type hierarchy, eliminate a very large number of possible assumptions that are likely to result in an inconsistency.
    We have consequently implemented a module which specifies the types that various predicate-argument positions can take on, and the likely disjointness relations among types.
    This is a way of exploiting the specificity of the English lexicon for computational purposes.
    This addition led to a speed-up of two
