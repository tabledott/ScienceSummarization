ncludes a slightly richer model of context, allowing the probability of a constituent rule to depend upon the immediate parent of the rule and a part-of-speech trigram from the input sentence.
    But none of these models come close to incorporating enough context to disambiguate many cases of ambiguity.
    A significant reason researchers have limited the contextual information used by their models is because of the difficulty in estimating very rich probabilistic models of context.
    In this work, we present a model, the history-based grammar model, which incorporates a very rich model of context, and we describe a technique for estimating the parameters for this model using decision trees.
    The history-based grammar model provides a mechanism for taking advantage of contextual information from anywhere in the discourse history.
    Using decision tree technology, any question which can be asked of the history (i.e.
    Is the subject of the previous sentence animate?
    Was the previous sentence a q
