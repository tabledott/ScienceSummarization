g N to m, the composed machine is in state 1, which it can leave only by a transition over labials.
    After converting N to n, it enters state 2, from which there is no labial transition.
    Otherwise, state 2 is equivalent to the initial state.
    Figure 5 illustrates the behavior of this machine as a generator applied to the abstract string iNtractable.
    Starting in state 0, the first transition over the &amp;quot;other&amp;quot; arc produces i on the output tape and returns to state 0.
    Two different transitions are then possible for the N on the input tape.
    These carry the machine into states 1 and 2 and output the symbols m and n respectively.
    The next symbol on the input tape is t. Since this is not a labial, no transition is possible from state 1, and that branch of the process therefore blocks.
    On the other branch, the t matches the &amp;quot;other&amp;quot; transition back to state 0 and the machine stays in state 0 for the remainder of the string.
    Since state 0 is a final s
