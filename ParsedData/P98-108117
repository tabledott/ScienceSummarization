 Memory-Based based methods reaches the quality of TagPair.9 The explanation for this can be found when we examine the differences within the MemoryBased general strategy: the more feature information is stored, the higher the accuracy on Tune, but the lower the accuracy on Test.
    This is most likely an overtraining effect: Tune is probably too small to collect case bases which can leverage the stacking effect convincingly, especially since only 7.51% of the second stage material shows disagreement between the featured tags.
    To examine if the overtraining effects are specific to this particular second level classifier, we also used the C5.0 system, a commercial version of the well-known program C4.5 (Quinlan 1993) for the induction of decision trees, on the same training materia1.19 Because C5.0 prunes the decision tree, the overfitting of training material (Tune) is less than with Memory-Based learning, but the results on Test are also worse.
    We conjecture that pruning is not beneficial when the i
