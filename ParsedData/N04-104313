thing in the discriminative tagger may account for the difference.
    Second, we consider the impact of word clusters.
    Figure 2 compares performance of the discriminative tagger, now with cluster features included, to the baseline HMM.
    Immediately, with only 5,000 words of training, the discriminative model significantly outperforms the HMM.
    With 50,000 words of training, performance for the discriminative model exceeds 90F, a level not reached by the HMM until it has observed 150,000 words of training.
    Somewhat surprisingly, the clusters continue to provide some benefit even with 1,000,000 words of training.
    At this operating point, the discriminative tagger achieves an F-score of 96.08 compared to 94.72 for the HMM, a 25% reduction in error.
    Third, we consider the impact of active learning.
    Figure 3 shows (a) discriminative tagger performance without cluster features, (b) the same tagger using active learning, (c) the discriminative tagger with cluster features, and (d) the disc
