a finite set of elementary trees that are either initial trees or auxiliary trees.
    Trees are composed using an operation called adjoining, which is defined as follows.
    Let n be some node labeled X in a tree -y (see Figure 3).
    Let 71 be a tree with root and foot labeled by X.
    When 7' is adjoined at ?I in the tree 7 we obtain a tree v&amp;quot;.
    The subtree under,; is excised from 7, the tree 7' is inserted in its place and the excised subtree is inserted below the foot of y'.
    It can be shown that the path set of the tree set generated by a TAG G is a context-free language.
    TAG's can be used to give the structural descriptions discussed by Gazdar (1985) for the unbounded nested dependencies in Norwedish, for cross serial dependencies in Dutch subordinate clauses, and for the nestings of paired English complementizers.
    From the definition of TAG's, it follows that the choice of adjunction is not dependent on the history of the derivation.
    Like CFG's, the choice is predetermine
