., 2003) and Conditional Random Fields (McCallum and Li, 2003) were applied by one system each.
    Combination of different learning systems has proven to be a good method for obtaining excellent results.
    Five participating groups have applied system combination.
    Florian et al. (2003) tested different methods for combining the results of four systems and found that robust risk minimization worked best.
    Klein et al. (2003) employed a stacked learning system which contains Hidden Markov Models, Maximum Entropy Models and Conditional Markov Models.
    Mayfield et al. (2003) stacked two learners and obtained better performance.
    Wu et al. (2003) applied both stacking and voting to three learners.
    Munro et al. (2003) employed both voting and bagging for combining classifiers.
    The choice of the learning approach is important for obtaining a good system for recognizing named entities.
    However, in the CoNLL-2002 shared task we found out that choice of features is at least as important.
