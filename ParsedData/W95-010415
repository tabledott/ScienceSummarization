), and found that k = 3 generally did best, indicating that most of the action, for our task and confusion sets, comes from local syntax.
    In the rest of this paper, this value of k will be used.
    2We are interpreting the condition &amp;quot;c, occurs within a &#177;k-word window of tv,&amp;quot; as a binary feature &#8212; either it happens, or it does not.
    This allows us to handle context words in the same Bayesian framework as will be used later for other binary features (see Section 3.3).
    A more conventional interpretation is to take into account the number of occurrences of each c, within the &#177;k-word window, and to estimate p(cilwi) accordingly.
    However, either interpretation is valid, as long as it is applied consistently &#8212; that is, both when estimating the likelihoods from training data, and when classifying test cases.
    Training phase Table 2 shows the effect of varying k for our usual collection of confusion sets.
    It can be seen that performance generally degrades
