al inheritance - the probability of a class given the first letter is often not very informative for some languages (such as English or Romanian) or, by contrast, may be extremely important for others (e.g.
    Japanese).
    The basic concept of this bootstrapping procedure is to iteratively leverage relatively independent sources of information.
    Beginning with some seed names for each class, the algorithm learns contextual patterns that are indicative for those classes and then iteratively learns new class members and word-internal morphological clues.
    Through this cycle, probability distributions for class given token, prefix/suffix or context are incrementally refined.
    More details are given when describing stage 2 of the algorithm. opposed to the classical maximum entropy principle When faced with a highly skewed observed class distribution for which there is little confidence due to small sample size, a typical response to this uncertainty in statistical machine learning systems is to backof
