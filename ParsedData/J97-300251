estricted-form, rather than normalform, grammars.
    In this case an Earley-style scheme (Earley 1970), employing an active chart, can be used.
    The time complexity remains the same as the normal-form case.
    We have found this to be useful in practice.
    For bracketing grammars of the type considered in this paper, there is no advantage.
    However, for more complex, linguistically structured grammars, the more flexible parser does not require the unreasonable numbers of productions that can easily arise from normal-form requirements.
    For most grammars, we have found performance to be comparable or faster than the normalform parser.
  
  
    The twin concepts of bilingual language modeling and bilingual parsing have been proposed.
    We have introduced a new formalism, the inversion transduction grammar, and surveyed a variety of its applications to extracting linguistic information from parallel corpora.
