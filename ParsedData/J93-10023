ng realistic input, the set of possible analyses licensed by the grammar can be in the thousands.
    Finally, it is extremely unlikely that any generative grammar will ever be capable of correctly analyzing all naturally occurring input, even when tuned for a particular corpus or sublanguage (if only because of the synchronic idealization implicit in the assumption that the set of grammatical sentences of a language is well formed.) this paper, we describe our to the first and second problems and make some preliminary remarks concerning the third (far harder) problem.
    Our apto grammar tuning is based on a semi-automatic parsing phase which additions to the grammar are made manually and statistical information concerning the frequency of use of grammar rules is acquired.
    Using this statistical information and modified grammar, a breadth-first probabilistic parser is constructed.
    The latter is capable of ranking the possible parses identified by the grammar in a useful (and efficient) manner.
