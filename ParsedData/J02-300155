lation with the path statistics improves results.
    The curve labeled &#8220;interpolation&#8221; in Figure 10 reflects a linear interpolation of the form Note that this method can identify only those frame elements that have a corresponding constituent in the automatically generated parse tree.
    For this reason, it is interesting to calculate how many true frame elements overlap with the results of the system, relaxing the criterion that the boundaries must match exactly.
    Results for partial matching are shown in Table 9.
    Three types of overlap are possible: the identified constituent entirely within the true frame element, the true frame element entirely within the identified constituent, and each sequence partially contained by the other.
    An example of the first case is shown in Figure 11, where the true MESSAGE frame element is Mandarin by a head, but because of an error in the parser output, no constituent exactly matches the frame element&#8217;s boundaries.
    In this case, the system
