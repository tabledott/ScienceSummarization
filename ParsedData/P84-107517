m is that even though the three implementations differ substantially from one another, using different parsing algorithms (with both top down and bottom up properties), different implementations of unification, different methods of compiling the rules, all are able to run on exactly the same grammars yielding the identical results.
    The three implementations of the PATR-II system currently in operation at SRI are as follows: a testbed for experimentation with efficient structuresharing DAG unification algorithms, and incorporating an Earley-style parsing algorithm.
    In addition, Lauri Karttunen and his students at the University of Texas have implemented a system based on.
    PATR-II but with several interesting extensions, including disjunction and negation in the graph structures [Karttunen, 84].
    These extensions will undoubtedly be integrated into the SRI systems and formal semantics for them are being pursued.
  
  
    The PATR-II formalism was designed as a computer language for encoding ling
