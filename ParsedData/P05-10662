    In this paper we describe an approach for the use of syntactic information within phrase-based SMT systems.
    The approach constitutes a simple, direct method for the incorporation of syntactic information in a phrase&#8211;based system, which we will show leads to significant improvements in translation accuracy.
    The first step of the method is to parse the source language string that is being translated.
    The second step is to apply a series of transformations to the resulting parse tree, effectively reordering the surface string on the source language side of the translation system.
    The goal of this step is to recover an underlying word order that is closer to the target language word-order than the original string.
    Finally, we apply a phrase-based system to the reordered string to give a translation into the target language.
