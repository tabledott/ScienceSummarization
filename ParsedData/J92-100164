 time-consuming work.
    This needed work includes filling a number of gaps in our knowledge sources.
    For example, the system needs much more information about role-related preferences and specialized semantic contexts.
    At present all this information is collected and coded by hand, although recent work by Ravin (1990) and Dahlgren, McDowell, and Stabler (1989) suggests that the collection of role-related information may be automatable.
    Our next step is to evaluate the effect of text coding on an information retrieval task, by applying traditional term-weighted statistical retrieval methods to the recoded text.
    One intriguing aspect of this approach is that errors in distinguishing sense preferences should not be too costly in this task, so long as the program is fairly consistent in its disambiguation of terms in both the source texts and the input queries.
