 (1993) and Dagan, Church, and Gale (1993).
    Later, Fung and McKeown (1994) improved on K-Vec by employing relative position offsets, instead of a fixed model of co-occurrence.
    This strategy made the algorithm more robust for noisier bitexts.
  
  
    SIMR borrows several insights from previous work.
    Like the algorithms of Gale and Church (1991a) and Brown, Lai, and Mercer (1991), SIMR exploits the correlation between the lengths of mutual translations.
    Like char_align (Church 1993), SIMR infers bitext maps from likely points of correspondence between the two texts, points that are plotted in a two-dimensional space of possibilities.
    Unlike previous methods, SIMR greedily searches for only a small chain of correspondence points at a time.
    The search begins in a small search rectangle in the bitext space, whose diagonal is parallel to the main diagonal.
    The search for each chain alternates between a generation phase and a recognition phase.
    In the generation phase, SIMR generate
