lected 965 items (15%) from the AdjN hapaxes, and 983 items ( 0.35%) from the low-frequency PNV triples.
    Manual examination of the samples yielded 31 TPs for AdjN (a proportion of 3.2%) and 6 TPs for PNV (0.6%).
    Considering the low proportion of collocations in the samples, we must expect highly skewed frequency distributions (where is very small), which are problematic for standard statistical tests.
    In order to obtain reliable estimates, we have used an exact test based on the following model: Assuming a proportion of TPs in the full low-frequency data (AdjN or PNV), the number of TPs in a random sample of size is described by a binomially distributed random variable with parameter .11 Consequently, the probability of finding or less TPs in the sample is .
    We apply a one-tailed statistical test based on the probabilities to our samples in order to obtain an upper estimate for the actual proportion of collocations among the low-frequency data: the estimate is accepted at a given significance
