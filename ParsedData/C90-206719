improvements which can be made: for instance, the part-of-speech for input words and words in definitions can be used to extract only the correct lemmas from the dictionary, the frequency of use for particular senses of each word can be used to help choose among competing senses, and additional knowledge can be extracted from other dictionaries and thesauri.
			It is also conceivable that the network could "learn" by giving more weight to links which have been heavily activated over numerous runs on large samples of text.
			The model we describe here is only a first step toward a fuller understanding and refinement of the use of VLNNs for language processing, and it opens several interesting avenues for further application and research.
