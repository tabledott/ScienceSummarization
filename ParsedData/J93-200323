s no possibility for confusion, or, more properly, when the probability of confusion is not thereby materially increased, we write Pr (f, a, e) for Pr(F f, A = a, E = e), and use similar shorthands throughout.
    We can write the likelihood of (f le) in terms of the conditional probability Pr(f, ale) as The sum here, like all subsequent sums over a, is over the elements of A(e, f).
    We restrict ourselves in this section to alignments like the one shown in Figure 1 where each French word has exactly one connection.
    In this kind of alignment, each cept is either a single English word or it is empty.
    Therefore, we can assign cepts to positions in the English string, reserving position zero .for the empty cept.
    If the English string, e = e1e2... e1, has 1 words, and the French string, f = firn 1112 &#8226; fm, has m words, then the alignment, a, can be represented by a series, ay' a1a2 ...am, of m values, each between 0 and 1 such that if the word in position j of the French string is connected to
