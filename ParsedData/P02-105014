    More generally, the majority of rule patterns are variations on the same solution to the same problem.
    Viewing the problem from a higher level of linguistic abstraction made it possible to find all the relevant cases in a short time (a few days) and express the solution compactly (&lt; 20 rules).
    The complete set of rules can be found in (Hwa et al., 2002).
