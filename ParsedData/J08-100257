y.
    This implies that such features carry overlapping information.
    Table 13 shows parsing accuracy for covered and uncovered sentences.
    As defined in Section 5.1, &#8220;covered&#8221; indicates that the HPSG lexicon has all correct lexical entries for a sentence.
    In other words, for covered sentences, exactly correct parse trees are obtained if the disambiguation model worked perfectly.
    The result reveals clear differences in accuracy between covered and uncovered sentences.
    The F-score for covered sentences is around 2.5 points higher than the overall F-score, whereas the F-score is more than 10 points lower for uncovered sentences.
    This result indicates improvement of lexicon quality is an important factor for higher accuracy.
    Figure 23 shows the learning curve.
    A feature set was fixed, and the parameter of the Gaussian prior was optimized for each model.
    High accuracy is attained even with a small training set, and the accuracy seems to be saturated.
