y possible classes for a sentence.
    However, that interpretation fails computationally because a general sentence has exponentially many possible dependency trees and thus exponentially many margin constraints.
    To circumvent this problem we make the assumption that the constraints that matter for large margin optimization are those involving the incorrect trees y' with the highest scores s(x, y').
    The resulting optimization made by MIRA (see Figure 3, line 4) would then be: reducing the number of constraints to the constant k. We tested various values of k on a development data set and found that small values of k are sufficient to achieve close to best performance, justifying our assumption.
    In fact, as k grew we began to observe a slight degradation of performance, indicating some overfitting to the training data.
    All the experiments presented here use k = 5.
    The Eisner (1996) algorithm can be modified to find the k-best trees while only adding an additional O(k log k) factor to the r
