k and Johnson (2005) use coarse-to-fine parsing on top of the Charniak (2000) parser and get 50-best lists for section 23.
			Figure 9(a) compares the results of oracle reranking.
			Collins?
			curve converges at around k = 50 while ours continues to increase.
			With a beam width of 10?4 and k = 100, our parser plus oracle reaches an F-score of96.4%, compared to Collins?
			94.9%.
			Charniak and John son?s work, however, is based on a completely different parser whose 1-best F-score is 1.5 points higher than the1-bests of ours and Collins?, making it difficult to com pare in absolute numbers.
			So we instead compared the relative improvement over 1-best.
			Figure 9(b) shows that our work has the largest percentage of improvement in terms of F-score when k &gt; 20.
			To further explore the impact of Collins?
			cell limit on the quality of k-best lists, we plotted average number of parses for a given sentence length (Figure 10).
			Generally speaking, as input sentences get longer, the number of parses g
