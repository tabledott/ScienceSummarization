arrant reliable maximum likelihood estimation, its probability can be computed as a weighted sum of the probabilities of words that are similar to it.
    It was shown in (Dagan et al., 1997) that a similarity-based smoothing method achieved much better results than backoff smoothing methods in word sense disambiguation.
    The remainder of the paper is organized as follows.
    The next section is concerned with similarities between words based on their distributional patterns.
    The similarity measure can then be used to create a thesaurus.
    In Section 3, we evaluate the constructed thesauri by computing the similarity between their entries and entries in manually created thesauri.
    Section 4 briefly discuss future work in clustering similar words.
    Finally, Section 5 reviews related work and summarize our contributions.
  
  
    Our similarity measure is based on a proposal in (Lin, 1997), where the similarity between two objects is defined to be the amount of information contained in the comm
