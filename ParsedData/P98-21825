plane, and helicopter would all have counted as co-occuring with each other in our algorithm.
  
  
    R&amp;S used the same figure of merit both for selecting new seed words and for ranking words in the final output.
    Their figure of merit was simply the ratio of the times the noun coocurs with a noun in the seed list to the total frequency of the noun in the corpus.
    This statistic favors low frequency nouns, and thus necessitates the inclusion of a minimum occurrence cutoff.
    They stipulated that no word occuring fewer than six times in the corpus would be considered by the algorithm.
    This cutoff has two effects: it reduces the noise associated with the multitude of low frequency words, and it removes from consideration a fairly large number of certainly valid category members.
    Ideally, one would like to reduce the noise without reducing the number of valid nouns.
    Our statistics allow for the inclusion of rare occcurances.
    Note that this is particularly important given our algorit
