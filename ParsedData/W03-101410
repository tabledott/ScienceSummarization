1; texts) and those that are not (the &#8220;irrelevant&#8221; texts).
    Most recently, two bootstrapping algorithms have been used to learn extraction patterns.
    Metabootstrapping (Riloff and Jones, 1999) learns both extraction patterns and a semantic lexicon using unannotated texts and seed words as input.
    ExDisco (Yangarber et al., 2000) uses a bootstrapping mechanism to find new extraction patterns using unannotated texts and some seed patterns as the initial input.
    For our research, we adopted a learning process very similar to that used by AutoSlog-TS, which requires only relevant texts and irrelevant texts as its input.
    We describe this learning process in more detail in the next section.
  
  
    We have developed a bootstrapping process for subjectivity classification that explores three ideas: (1) highprecision classifiers can be used to automatically identify subjective and objective sentences from unannotated texts, (2) this data can be used as a training set to automatically lea
