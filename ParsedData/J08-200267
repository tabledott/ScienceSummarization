ment constituents that are missing in the automatic parse trees produced by Charniak&#8217;s parser.
    We can see that the percentage of missing constituents is quite high.
    We report local and joint model results in Figures 14(a) and 14(b), respectively.
    As for gold-standard parses, we test on all arguments regardless of whether they correspond to constituents that have been recovered by the parser and use the same measures detailed in Section 3.2.
    We also compare the confusion matrices for the local and joint models, ignoring the confusions among modifier argument labels (COARSEARGM setting) in Figure 15.
    The error reduction of the joint over the local model is 10.3% in CORE arguments F-Measure and 8.3% in ALL arguments F-Measure.
    Semantic role labeling is very sensitive to the correctness of the given parse tree, as the results show.
    If an argument does not correspond to any constituent in a parse tree, or a constituent exists but is not attached or labeled correctly, our model wil
