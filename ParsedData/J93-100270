sed on probabilistic CFG can be brought out by considering various probabilistic derivations using the probabilistic parse table for Grammar 1.
    Assuming that we are using probabilities simply to rank parses, we can compute the total probability of an analysis by multiplying together the probabilities of each transition we take during its derivation.
    In Figure 10, we give the two possible complete derivations for a sentence such as the winter holiday camp closed consisting of a determiner, three nouns, and an intransitive verb.
    The ambiguity concerns whether the noun compound is left- or right-branching, and, as we saw in Section 2, a probabilistic CFG cannot distinguish these two derivations.
    The probability of each step can be read off the action table and is shown after the lookahead item in the figure.
    In step 8 a shift-reduce conflict occurs so the stack 'splits' while the left- and rightbranching analyses of the noun compound are constructed.
