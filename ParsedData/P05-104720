proach was found to be significantly better than the document-centric approach (p &lt; 0.001, Wilcoxon Signed Ranks Test).
    Although it is an informative evaluation, the document filtering task is limited for evaluating IE pattern learning.
    This evaluation indicates whether the set of patterns being learned can identify documents containing descriptions of events but does not provide any information about whether it can find those events within the documents.
    In addition, the set of seed patterns used for these experiments have a high precision and low recall (Table 2).
    We have found that the distribution of patterns and documents in the corpus means that learning virtually any pattern will help improve the F-measure.
    Consequently, we believe the sentence filtering evaluation to be more useful for this problem.
    Results from the sentence filtering experiment are shown in tabular format in the right hand side of Table 22 and graphically in Figure 3.
