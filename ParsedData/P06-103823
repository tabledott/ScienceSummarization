ogy as best as we could, using the same WordNet (WN) categories and the same corpus (BNC) in addition to the Dmoz and Russian corporal.
    The evaluation method is as follows.
    We took the exact 10 WN subsets referred to as &#8216;subjects&#8217; in (Widdows and Dorow, 2002), and removed all multi-word items.
    We now selected at random 10 pairs of words from each subject.
    For each pair, we found the largest of our discovered categories containing it (if there isn&#8217;t one, we pick another pair.
    This is valid because our Recall is obviously not even close to 100%, so if we did not pick another pair we would seriously harm the validity of the evaluation.)
    The various morphological forms of the same word were treated as one during the evaluation.
    The only difference from the (Widdows and Dorow, 2002) experiment is the usage of pairs rather than single words.
    We did this in order to disambiguate our categories.
    This was not needed in (Widdows and Dorow, 2002) because they had dir
