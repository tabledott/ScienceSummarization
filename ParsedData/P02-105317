aluate PMI-IR on the collection of 1,336 hand-labeled adjectives that were used in the experiments of Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown (1997).
    A related question for future work is the relationship of accuracy of the estimation of semantic orientation at the level of individual phrases to accuracy of review classification.

    Equation (3) is a very simple estimator of semantic orientation.
    It might benefit from more sophisticated statistical analysis (Agresti, 1996).
