e then evaluated based on this showed how one could compute latent semantic collection.
    Although this strategy for evaluation is vectors for any word in a corpus (Schone and not flawless, it is reasonable and makes dynamic Jurafsky, 2000).
    Using the same approach, we evaluation tractable.
    Table 4 shows the algorithms&#8217; compute semantic vectors for every proposed word performance (including proper nouns). n-gram C=X X ...X Since LSA involves word Though Internet dictionaries and WordNet are counts, we can also compute semantic vectors completely separate &#8220;gold standards,&#8221; results are surprisingly consistent.
    One can conclude that WordNet may safely be used as a gold standard in future MWU headword evaluations.
    Also, SCP have virtually identical results and seem to best identify MWU headwords (particularly if proper nouns are desired).
    Yet there is still significant room for improvement.
  
  
    Can performance be improved?
    Numerous strategies could be explored.
