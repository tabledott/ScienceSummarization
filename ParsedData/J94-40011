as composing a conjunctive structure.
    This is realized using a dynamic programming technique.
    A long sentence can be reduced into a shorter form by recognizing conjunctive structures.
    Consequently, the total dependency structure of a sentence can be obtained by relatively simple head-dependent rules.
    A serious problem concerning conjunctive structures, besides the ambiguity of their scopes, is the ellipsis of some of their components.
    Through our dependency analysis process, we can find the ellipses and recover the omitted components.
    We report the results of analyzing 150 Japanese sentences to illustrate the effectiveness of this method.
  
  
    This paper presents a syntactic analysis method that first detects conjunctive structures in a sentence by checking parallelism of two series of words and then analyzes the dependency structure of the sentence with the help of the information about the conjunctive structures.
    Analysis of long sentences is one of the most difficult proble
