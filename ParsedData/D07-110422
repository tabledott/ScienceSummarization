 starting range of the binary search, but we can check for the existence of ub to decide whether we even need to search for aub at all.
			This can help us avoid searches that are guaranteed to be fruitless.
			Now consider the discontiguous case.
			As in the analogous contiguous case, a phrase a?b will onlyexist in the text if its maximal prefix a?
			and maxi mal suffix ?b both exist in the corpus and overlap at specific positions.
			8 Searching for a?b is potentially very expensive, so we put all available information to work.
			Before searching, we require that both a?and ?b exist.
			Additionally, we compute the location of a?b using the locations of both maximal sub phrases.
			To see why the latter optimization is useful, consider a phrase abXcd.
			In our baseline algorithm, we would search for ab and cd, and then perform a computation to see whether these subphrases were collocated within an elastic window.
			However, if weinstead use abXc and bXcd as the basis of the com putation, we gain two ad
