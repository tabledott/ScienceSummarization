l extraction in isolation.
    However, in many cases, considering influences between extractions can be very useful.
    For example, in our protein-tagging task, repeated references to the same protein are common.
    If the context surrounding one occurrence of a phrase is very indicative of it being a protein, then this should also influence the tagging of another occurrence of the same phrase in a different context which is not indicative of protein references.
    Relational Markov Networks (RMN's) (Taskar et al., 2002) are a generalization of CRF's that allow for collective classification of a set of related entities by integrating information from features of individual entities as well as the relations between them.
    Results on classifying connected sets of web pages have verified the advantage of this approach (Taskar et al., 2002).
    In this paper, we present an approach to collective information extraction using RMN's that simultaneously extracts all of the information from a document by expl
