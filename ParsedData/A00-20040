  Advances In Domain Independent Linear Text Segmentation
  
    This paper describes a method for linear text segmentation which is twice as accurate and over seven times as fast as the state-of-the-art (Reynar, 1998).
    Inter-sentence similarity is replaced by rank in the local context.
    Boundary locations are discovered by divisive clustering.
  
  
    Even moderately long documents typically address several topics or different aspects of the same topic.
    The aim of linear text segmentation is to discover the topic boundaries.
    The uses of this procedure include information retrieval (Hearst and Plaunt, 1993; Hearst, 1994; Yaari, 1997; Reynar, 1999), summarization (Reynar, 1998), text understanding, anaphora resolution (Kozima, 1993), language modelling (Morris and Hirst, 1991; Beeferman et al., 1997b) and improving document navigation for the visually disabled (Choi, 2000).
    This paper focuses on domain independent methods for segmenting written text.
    We present a new algorithm that bu
