The analysis accompani-st fails to identify the suffix -ist, but it will successfully identify the stem as being the same as the one found in accompanied and accompaniment, which it would not have done if it had associated the i with the suffix.
    I have, in any event, marked this analysis as wrong, but without much conviction behind the decision.
    Similarly, the analysis of French putative stem embelli with suffixes e/rent/t passes the low test of treating related words with the same stem, but I have counted it as in error, on the grounds that the analysis is unquestionably one letter off from the correct, traditional analysis of second-conjugation verbs.
