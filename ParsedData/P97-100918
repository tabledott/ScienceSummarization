 Since the WordNet senses are ordered according to their frequency in SemCor, choosing the first sense is roughly the same as choosing the sense with highest prior probability, except that we are not using all the files in SemCor.
    It can be seen from Table 3 that our algorithm performed slightly worse than the baseline when the strictest correctness criterion is used.
    However, when the condition is relaxed, its performance gain is much lager than the baseline.
    This means that when the algorithm makes mistakes, the mistakes tend to be close to the correct answer.
  
  
    The Step C in Section 3.2 is similar to Resnik's noun group disambiguation (Resnik, 1995a), although he did not address the question of the creation of noun groups.
    The earlier work on WSD that is most similar to ours is (Li, Szpakowicz, and Matwin, 1995).
    They proposed a set of heuristic rules that are based on the idea that objects of the same or similar verbs are similar.
    Our algorithm treats all local contexts equ
