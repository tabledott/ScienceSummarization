t, the space of symmetric at-most-one-to-one matchings is #P-hard to sum over exactly (Valiant, 1979).
    Second, even without matchings to worry about, standard methods for maximizing the above formulation would require summation over pairs of trees, and we want to assume a fairly generic interface to independent monolingual parsers (though deeper joint modeling and/or training is of course a potential extension).
    As we have chosen to operate in a reranking mode over monolingual k-best lists, we have another issue: our k-best outputs on the data which trains our model may not include the gold tree pair.
    We therefore make several approximations and modifications, which we discuss in turn.
    Because summing over alignments a is intractable, we cannot evaluate (2) or its derivatives.
    However, if we restrict the space of possible alignments, then we can make this optimization more feasible.
    One way to do this is to stipulate in advance that for each tree pair, there is a canonical alignment a0
