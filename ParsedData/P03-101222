n probabilities by using features, such as improvements to P(f|e) in (Berger et al., 1996).
    By the same token we can use maximum entropy to improve our estimates of P(lk|eik, fjk, Ck).
    We are currently investigating maximum entropy as an alternative to our current feature model which assumes conditional independence among features.
    There have been many recent proposals to leverage syntactic data in word alignment.
    Methods such as (Wu, 1997), (Alshawi et al., 2000) and (Lopez et al., 2002) employ a synchronous parsing procedure to constrain a statistical alignment.
    The work done in (Yamada and Knight, 2001) measures statistics on operations that transform a parse tree from one language into another.
  
  
    The alignment algorithm described here is incapable of creating alignments that are not one-to-one.
    The model we describe, however is not limited in the same manner.
    The model is currently capable of creating many-to-one alignments so long as the null probabilities of the words
