ng a machine learning filter.
    Mann (2002) and Fleischman et al. (2003) used part of speech patterns to extract a subset of hyponym relations involing proper nouns.
  
  
    The research discussed above on discovering hyponym relationships all take a bottom up approach.
    That is, they use patterns to independently discover semantic relationships of words.
    However, for infrequent words, these patterns do not match or, worse yet, generate incorrect relationships.
    Ours is a top down approach.
    We make use of cooccurrence statistics of semantic classes discovered by algorithms like CBC to label their concepts.
    Hyponym relationships may then be extracted easily: one hyponym per instance/concept label pair.
    For example, if we labeled concept (A) from Section 1 with disease, then we could extract is-a relationships such as: diabetes is a disease, cancer is a disease, and lupus is a disease.
    A concept instance such as lupus is assigned a hypernym disease not because it necessarily occurs
