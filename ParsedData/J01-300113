 Nadas et al. (1991) used the flip-flop algorithm to decide which of the cues was most important for each word by maximizing mutual information scores between words.
    Yarowsky (1996) used an extremely rich features set by expanding this set with syntactic relations such as subject-verb, verb-object and adjective-noun relations, part-of-speech n-grams and others.
    The approach was based on the hypothesis that words exhibited &amp;quot;one sense per collocation&amp;quot; (Yarowsky 1993).
    A large corpus was examined to compute the probability of a particular collocate occurring with a certain sense and the discriminatory power of each was calculated using the log-likelihood ratio.
    These ratios were used to create a decision list, with the most discriminating collocations being preferred.
    This approach has the benefit that it does not combine the probabilities of the collocates, which are highly non-independent knowledge sources.
    Yarowsky (1993) also examined the discriminatory power of the
