, we as sume that words or phrases w with a dependency path connecting them to p are frame elements.
			Eachframe element is represented by an unlabeled depen dency path Rw which we extract by traversing thedependency tree from w to p. Analogously, we ex tract from the FrameNet annotations all dependencypaths RSR that are labeled with semantic role infor mation and correspond to p. We next measure thecompatibility of labeled and unlabeled paths as fol lows: s(w,SR) = maxRSR?M [sim(Rw,RSR) ?P(RSR)] (2) where M is the set of dependency relation pathsfor SR in FrameNet, sim(Rw,RSR) the similarity be tween paths Rw and RSR weighted by the relative w SRw SR (a) (b) Figure 2: Sample original bipartite graph (a) and its subgraph with edge covers (b).

			We consider both core and non-core semantic roles instan tiated by frames with at least one annotation in FrameNet.
