kups in precomputed matrices.
    This idea arises in our formulation out of the need to compute probability sums given as infinite series.
    Graham, Harrison, and Ruzzo (1980) use a nonprobabilistic version of the same technique to create a highly optimized Earley-like parser for general CFGs that implements prediction and completion by operations on Boolean matrices.'
    The matrix inversion method for dealing with left-recursive prediction is borrowed from the LRI algorithm of Jelinek and Lafferty (1991) for computing prefix probabilities for SCFGs in CNF.18 We then use that idea a second time to deal with the similar recursion arising from unit productions in the completion step.
    We suspect, but have not proved, that the Earley computation of forward probabilities when applied to a CNF grammar performs a computation that is isomorphic to that of the LRI algorithm.
    In any case, we believe that the parser-oriented view afforded by the Earley framework makes for a very intuitive solution to the pr
