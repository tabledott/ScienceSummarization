  Edit Detection And Parsing For Transcribed Speech
  
    We present a simple architecture for parsing transcribed speech in which an edited-word detector first removes such words from the sentence string, and then a standard statistical parser trained on transcribed speech parses the remaining words.
    The edit detector achieves a misclassification rate on edited words of 2.2%. which marks everything as not edited, has an error rate of 5.9%.)
    To evaluate our parsing results we introduce a new evaluation metric, the purpose of which is to make evaluation of a parse tree relatively indifferent the exact tree position of By this metric the parser achieves 85.3% precision and 86.5% recall.
  
  
    While significant effort has been expended on the parsing of written text, parsing speech has received relatively little attention.
    The comparative neglect of speech (or transcribed speech) is understandable, since parsing transcribed speech presents several problems absent in regular text: &#8220;um&#822
