erred to as spurious ambiguity, enables CCG to produce elegant analyses of coordination and extraction phenomena (Steedman, 2000).
    However, the introduction of extra derivations increases the complexity of the modelling and parsing problem.
    Clark et al. (2002) handle the additional derivations by modelling the derived structure, in their case dependency structures.
    They use a conditional model, based on Collins (1996), which, as the authors acknowledge, has a number of theoretical deficiencies; thus the results of Clark et al. provide a useful baseline for the new models presented here.
    Hockenmaier (2003a) uses a model which favours only one of the derivations leading to a derived structure, namely the normal-form derivation (Eisner, 1996).
    In this paper we compare the normal-form approach with a dependency model.
    For the dependency model, we define the probability of a dependency structure as follows: where &#57737; is a dependency structure, S is a sentence and A(&#57737;) is the set
