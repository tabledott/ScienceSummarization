for studying machinereadable corpora are at present still rather primitive.
    These are concordancing programs (see Figure 1), which are basically KWIC (key word in context; Aho et al. 1988) indexes with additional features such as the ability to extend the context, sort leftward as well as rightward, and so on.
    There is very little interactive software.
    In a typical situation in the lexicography of the 1980s, a lexicographer is given the concordances for a word, marks up the printout with colored pens to identify the salient senses, and then writes syntactic descriptions and definitions.
    Although this technology is a great improvement on using human readers to collect boxes of citation index cards (the method Murray used in constructing The Oxford English Dictionary a century ago), it works well if there are no more than a few dozen concordance lines for a word, and only two or three main sense divisions.
    In analyzing a complex word such as take, save, or from, the lexicographer is trying t
