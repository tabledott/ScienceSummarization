  to treat these as having zero probability and hence a zero entropy for the distribution.
  It is quite possible, especially for the lower frequency distributions, that we would see a contrary example in a larger sample.
  By cross-validation, we discover for the aid~aide xample that for collocations with an observed 1/0 distribution, we would actually expect he minor sense to occur 6% of the time in an independent sample, on average.
  Thus a fairer distribution would be .94/.06, giving a cross-validated ntropy of .33 bits rather than 0 bits.
  For a more unbalanced observed istribution, such as 10/0, the probability of seeing the minor sense decreases to 2%, giving a cross-validated ntropy of H(.98,.02) = .14 bits.
  Repeating this process and taking t
