vantage of the statistical data over semantic onstraints.
  While se- mantic constraints should approve any combination of arguments in a syntactic relation that may oc- cur in the text, the statistics approve only those combinations that actually occur and reject others.
  Manual observation of the 18 sentences in which the statistics completely resolved the ambiguity showed that only in 7 cases the ambiguity could be elim- inated by traditional selectional constraints.
  This is consistent with the evaluation in [Itobbs 1978], where only in 12 out of 132 sentences the ambiguity was eliminated by selectional constraints.
  An additional note should be made concerning the technical methodology of the experiment.
  Within the limited resources of our research, it was not fea- sible to build the statistical database for the entire Itansard corpus, which contains about 60 million words.
  The expensive resources are the parsing time and the storage for the cooceurrence patterns and their statistics.
