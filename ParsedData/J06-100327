h universal (applicable to arbitrary objects and ?not presuming any form of knowledge representation?)
  and theoretically justified (?derived from a set of assumptions?, instead of ?directly by a formula?, so that ?if the assumptions are deemed reasonable, the similarity measure necessarily follows?).
  He used the following three intuitions as a basis: 1.
  The similarity between arbitrary objects A and B is related to their commonality; the more commonality they share, the more similar they are.
  The similarity between A and B is related to the differences between them; the more differences they have, the less similar they are.
  The maximum similarity between A and B is reached when A and B are identical, no matter how much commonality they share.
  Lin defined the commonality between A and B as the information content of ?the proposition that states the commonalities?
