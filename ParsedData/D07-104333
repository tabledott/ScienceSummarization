rently reduce the goodness of a clustering solu tion.
			Using these results as an example, we find that at approximately 30 clusters an increase of clusters translates to an increase in V-Measure.
			This is due to an increased homogeneity (H(C|K)H(C) ) and a relatively stable completeness (H(K|C)H(K) ).
			That is, inclusion of more clusters leads to clusters with a more skewedwithin-cluster distribution and a equivalent distribu tion of cluster memberships within classes.
			This is intuitively preferable ? one criterion is improved, the other is not reduced ? despite requiring additionalclusters.
			This is an instance in which the MDL principle limits the usefulness of Q2.
			We again (see sec tion 5.1) observe the close dependency of VI and k.Moreover, in considering figures 5 and 4, simulta neously, we see considerably higher values achieved by the document clustering experiments.
			Given the na??ve approaches taken in these experiments, this is expected ? and even desired ? given the previous work on
