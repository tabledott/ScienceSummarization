agreement cases involve low-strength subjectivity.
    The annotators consistently agree about which are the clear cases of subjective sentences.
    This leads us to define the gold-standard that we use in our experiments.
    A sentence is subjective if it contains at least one private-state expression of medium or higher strength.
    The second class, which we call objective, consists of everything else.
    Thus, sentences with only mild traces of subjectivity are tossed into the objective category, making the system&#8217;s goal to find the clearly subjective sentences.
  
  
    In the last few years, two bootstrapping algorithms have been developed to create semantic dictionaries by exploiting extraction patterns: Meta-Bootstrapping (Riloff and Jones, 1999) and Basilisk (Thelen and Riloff, 2002).
    Extraction patterns were originally developed for information extraction tasks (Cardie, 1997).
    They represent lexico-syntactic expressions that typically rely on shallow parsing and syntactic role ass
