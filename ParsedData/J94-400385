 that do not use bilingual material for training.
    Gale proposes to use &amp;quot;pseudo-words&amp;quot; as another practical source of testing examples (Gale, Church, and Yarowsky 1992b) (equivalently, Schiitze [19921 uses &amp;quot;artificial ambiguous words&amp;quot;).
    Pseudo-words are constructed artificially as a union of several different words (say, wi, w2, and w3 define three &amp;quot;senses&amp;quot; of the pseudo-word x).
    The disambiguation method is presented with texts in which all occurrences of wi, w2, and w3 are considered as occurrences of x and should then select the original word (sense) for each occurrence.
    Though testing with this method does not provide results for real ambiguities that occur in the text, it can be very useful while developing and tuning the method (Gale shows high correlation between the performance of his method on real sense ambiguities and pseudo-words).
  
  
    The method presented in this paper takes advantage of two linguistic phenomena, both prov
