ategory as possible.
    In the first step, we classified whole oneto-one alignments into two classes: the first consisted of alignments whose Japanese and English sentences ended with periods, question marks, exclamation marks, or other readily identifiable characteristics.
    We call this class &#8220;one-to-one&#8221;.
    The second class consisted of the one-to-one alignments not belonging to the first class.
    The alignments in this class, together with the whole one-to-n alignments, are called &#8220;one-to-many&#8221;.
    One-to-one had about 640,000 alignments and one-to-many had about 660,000 alignments.
    We first evaluated the precision of one-to-one alignments by sorting them in decreasing order of SntScore.
    We randomly extracted 100 samples from each of 10 blocks ranked at the top-300,000 alignments.
    (A block had 30,000 alignments.)
    We classified these 1000 samples into two classes: The first was &#8220;match&#8221; (A), the second was &#8220;not match&#8221; (D).
    We judged
