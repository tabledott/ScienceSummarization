8; Cutting et al, 1992; Vempala and Wang, 2005), word sense disambiguation (Shin and Choi, 2004), semantic role labeling (Baldewein et al., 2004), pitch accent type disambiguation (Levow, 2006).
			They are particularly appealing for tasks in which there is an abundance of language data available, but manual annotation of this data is very resource-intensive.
			Unsupervised clustering can eliminate the need for (full) manual annotation of the data into desired classes, but often at the cost of making evaluation of success more difficult.
			External evaluation measures for clustering can be applied when class labels for each data point in some evaluation set can be determined a priori.
			The clustering task is then to assign these data points toany number of clusters such that each cluster con tains all and only those data points that are membersof the same class Given the ground truth class la bels, it is trivial to determine whether this perfect clustering has been achieved.
			However, evaluating how far
