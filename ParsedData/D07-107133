e results for our approach are higher than those reported by He and Young (2006) even without the second, high-recall, strategy.
			With the two-pass strategy our method has more than halved the F-measure error rate, giving improvements from 90.3% F-measure to 95.9% F-measure.

			new method gives improvements in performance both with and without the two pass strategy, showingthat the new CCG combinators, and the new learn ing algorithm, give some improvement on even this domain.
			The improved performance comes from aslight drop in precision which is offset by a large in crease in recall.
