    The chance of problems of this sort being introduced increases as we add more reference translations.
    Bleu&#8217;s inability to distinguish between randomly generated variations in translation hints that it may not correlate with human judgments of translation quality in some cases.
    As the number of identically scored variants goes up, the likelihood that they would all be judged equally plausible goes down.
    This is a theoretical point, and while the variants are artificially constructed, it does highlight the fact that Bleu is quite a crude measurement of translation quality.
    A number of prominent factors contribute to Bleu&#8217;s crudeness: Each of these failures contributes to an increased amount of inappropriately indistinguishable translations in the analysis presented above.
    Given that Bleu can theoretically assign equal scoring to translations of obvious different quality, it is logical that a higher Bleu score may not How much of the meaning expressed in the reference tr
