    We compared the output of the XLE system, a deep-grammar-based parsing system using the English Lexical-Functional Grammar previously constructed as part of the Pargram project (Butt et al., 2002), to the same gold standard.
    This system incorporates sophisticated ambiguity-management technology so that all possible syntactic analyses of a sentence are computed in an efficient, packed representation (Maxwell and Kaplan, 1993).
    In accordance with LFG theory, the output includes not only standard context-free phrase-structure trees but also attribute-value matrices (LFG&#8217;s f(unctional) structures) that explicitly encode predicate-argument relations and other meaningful properties.
    XLE selects the most probable analysis from the potentially large candidate set by means of a stochastic disambiguation component based on a log-linear (a.k.a. maximum-entropy) probability model (Riezler et al., 2002).
    The stochastic component is also &#8220;ambiguity-enabled&#8221; in the sense that
