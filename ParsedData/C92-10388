  Dale [DaI88,DaI89,DH91] }ins suggested oing this by re- quiring the generation system to produce mtn imal distinguishing descriptions, i.e., distinguishing de- scriptions that  include as few attributes of the in- tended referent as possible.
  Keiter [Keig0a, Rei90b] ha.s pointed out that  this task is in fact NP-Hard, and has proposed instead that referring expressions should obey three rules: No  Unnecessary  Components :  all components of a referring expremion must be necessary to ful- fill the referential goal.
