nym test questions from the Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL), obtaining a score of 74% (Turney, 2001).
    For comparison, Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA), another statistical measure of word association, attains a score of 64% on the same 80 TOEFL questions (Landauer &amp; Dumais, 1997).
    The Pointwise Mutual Information (PMI) between two words, word1 and word2, is defined as follows (Church &amp; Hanks, 1989): Here, p(word1 &amp; word2) is the probability that word1 and word2 co-occur.
    If the words are statistically independent, then the probability that they co-occur is given by the product p(word1) p(word2).
    The ratio between p(word1 &amp; word2) and p(word1) p(word2) is thus a measure of the degree of statistical dependence between the words.
    The log of this ratio is the amount of information that we acquire about the presence of one of the words when we observe the other.
    The Semantic Orientation (SO) of a phrase, phrase, is calculated here as follows: The reference words
