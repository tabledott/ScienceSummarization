t positions on state transitions result in middle-out transduction.
    When applied to the problem of translation, the head transducers forming the dependency transduction model operate on input and output strings that are sequences of dependents of corresponding headwords in the source and target languages.
    The dependency transduction model produces synchronized dependency trees in which each local tree is produced by a head transducer.
    In other words, the dependency model applies the head transducers recursively, imposing a recursive decomposition of the source and target strings.
    A dynamic programming search algorithm finds optimal (lowest total weight) derivations of target strings from input strings or word lattices produced by a speech recognizer.
    Section 3 defines dependency transduction models and describes the search algorithm.
    We construct the dependency transduction models for translation automatically from a set of unannotated examples, each example comprising a source string
