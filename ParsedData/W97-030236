    The goal of a good thresholding algorithm is to trade off correctness for increased speed.
    We must thus measure both correctness and speed, and there are some subtleties to measuring each.
    First, the traditional way of measuring correctness is with metrics such as precision and recall.
    Unfortunately, there are two problems with these measures.
    First, they are two numbers, neither useful without the other.
    Second, they are subject to considerable noise.
    In pilot experiments, we found that as we changed our thresholding values monotonically, precision and recall changed non-monotonically (see Figure 11).
    We attribute this to the fact that we must choose a single parse from our parse forest, and, as we tighten a thresholding parameter, we may threshold out either good or bad parses.
    Furthermore, rather than just changing precision or recall by a small amount, a single thresholded item may completely change the shape of the resulting tree.
    Thus, precision and
