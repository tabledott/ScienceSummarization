6 runs.
			S01 is one of the best segmentation systems in mainland China (Zhang et al., 2003).
			We also achieve two best runs (ASo and HKc), with a comparable average of 91.9% over the same 6 runs, and a 92.7% average over all the 8 runs.Second, performance varies significantly across dif ferent datasets, indicating that the four datasets havedifferent characteristics and use very different seg mentation guidelines.
			We also notice that the worstresults were obtained on CTB dataset for all systems.
			This is due to significant inconsistent segmen tation in training and testing (Sproat and Emerson, 2003).
			We verify this by another test.
			We randomly split the training data into 80% training and 20%testing, and run the experiments for 3 times, result ing in a testing F1 of 97.13%.
			Third, consider a comparison of our results with site S12, who use a sliding-window maximum entropy model (Xue, 2003).
			They participated in two datasets, with an average of 93.8%.
			Our average over the same two runs
