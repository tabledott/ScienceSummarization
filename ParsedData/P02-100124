portant remarks on efficiency: &#8226; Computing ti is an instance of the well-known algebraic path problem (Lehmann, 1977; Tar an, 1981a).
    Let Ti = xiofoyi.
    Then ti is the total semiring weight w0n of paths in Ti from initial state 0 to final state n (assumed WLOG to be unique and unweighted).
    It is wasteful to compute ti as suggested earlier, by minimizing (cxxi)of o(yixE), since then the real work is done by an c-closure step (Mohri, 2002) that implements the all-pairs version of algebraic path, whereas all we need is the single-source version.
    If n and m are the number of states and edges,19 then both problems are O(n3) in the worst case, but the single-source version can be solved in essentially O(m) time for acyclic graphs and other reducible flow graphs (Tar an, 1981b).
    For a general graph Ti, Tar an (1981b) shows how to partition into &#8220;hard&#8221; subgraphs that localize the cyclicity or irreducibility, then run the O(n3) algorithm on each subgraph (thereby reducing n to as l
