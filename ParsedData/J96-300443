he first and second hanzi of a double given name.
    Yet, some hanzi are far more probable in women's names than they are in men's names, and there is a similar list of male-oriented hanzi: mixing hanzi from these two lists is generally less likely than would be predicted by the independence model.
    As a partial solution, for pairs of hanzi that co-occur sufficiently often in our namelists, we use the estimated bigram cost, rather than the independence-based cost.
    The second weakness is purely conceptual, and probably does not affect the performance of the model.
    For previously unseen hanzi in given names, Chang et al. assign a uniform small cost; but we know that some unseen hanzi are merely accidentally missing, whereas others are missing for a reason&#8212;for example, because they have a bad connotation.
    As we have noted in Section 2, the general semantic class to which a hanzi belongs is often predictable from its semantic radical.
    Not surprisingly some semantic classes are better for
