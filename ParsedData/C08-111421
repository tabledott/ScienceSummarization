antic analysis (LSA) implicitly con tains a theory of synonymy (Landauer and Dumais, 1997).
			The problem with this approach is that it can be very difficult to work out how to modify the algorithm if it does not behave the way we want.On the other hand, with a supervised learning algo rithm, we can put our knowledge into the labeling of the feature vectors, instead of putting it directly into the algorithm.
			This makes it easier to guide the system to the desired behaviour.With our approach to the SAT analogy ques tions, we are blurring the line between supervised and unsupervised learning, since the training set for a given SAT question consists of a single realpositive example (and a single ?virtual?
			or ?simulated?
			negative example).
			In effect, a single example (mason:stone) becomes a sui generis; it con stitutes a class of its own.
			It may be possible to apply the machinery of supervised learning toother problems that apparently call for unsupervised learning (for example, clustering or meas
