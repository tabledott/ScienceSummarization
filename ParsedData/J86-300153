 be indicated explicitly by linguistic cues or implicitly from its utterance-level intentions and their relationship to elements of the intentional structure.
    If neither of these is the case, the utterance is part of the current segment.
    Thus, intention recognition and focus space management play key roles in processing.
    Moreover, they are also related: the intentional structure is a primary factor in determining focus space changes, and the focus space structure helps constrain the intention recognition process.
    The recognition of DP/DSPs is the central issue in the computational modeling of intentional structure.
    If, as we have claimed, for the discourse to be coherent and comprehensible, the OCP must be able to recognize both the DP/DSPsl&#176; and relationships (dominance and satisfaction-precedence) between them, then the question of how the OCP does so is a crucial issue.
    For the discourse as a whole, as well as for each of its segments, the OCP must identify both the intention t
