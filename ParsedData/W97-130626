d experiment.
    If it were the case that integration of world knowledge would have prevented those errors, then Hobbs' skepticism still holds since CogNIAC has only minimized the role of world knowledge, not eliminated it.
    In looking at the mistakes made in the second experiment, there were no examples that appeared to be beyond the scope of further improving the syntactic rules or expanding the basic categorization of noun phrases into person, company or place.
    For the data considered so far, there does appear to be a class of anaphors that can be reliably recognized and resolved with non-knowledge intensive techniques.
    Whether this holds in general remains an open question, but it is a central design assumption behind the system.
    A more satisfying answer to Hobbs' skepticism is contained in the earlier suggestive conjecture that world knowledge facilitates anaphora by eliminating ambiguity.
    This claim can be advanced to say that world knowledge comes into play in those cases of anaphor
