    Previous computational efforts typically have not been based on an explicit notion of the range of possible scopings.
    In response to this problem, we The naive algorithm for generating quantifier scopings is to generate all permutations of the quantifiers.
    For a sentence with n quantified noun phrases this will generate n! different readings.
    But for the sentence there are not six different readings, but only five.
    The reading that is missing is the one in which most samples is outscoped by every representative but outscopes a company.
    A model for the disallowed reading could include a different company not only for each representative but also for each sample.
    The reduction in number of readings for a given sentence is not significant for sentence (1), but in the sentence there are only 42 valid readings, as opposed to the 120 readings the naive algorithm would generate, and this Copyright 1987 by the Association for Computational Linguistics.
