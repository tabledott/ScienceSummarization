rent types of potentially subjective collocations are being recognized.
    Frequencies and increases in precision of fixed-n-gram and ugen-n-gram collocations learned from the subjective-element data.
    For each data set, baseline frequency is the total number of words, and baseline precision is the proportion of words in opinion pieces.
    Randomly selected examples of our learned collocations that appear in the test data are given in Tables 5 and 6.
    It is interesting to note that the unique generalized collocations were learned from the training data by their matching different unique words from the ones they match in the test data.
    In this section, we identify adjective and verb PSEs using distributional similarity.
    Opinion-piece data are used for training, and (a different set of) opinion-piece data and the subjective-element data are used for testing.
    With distributional similarity, words are judged to be more or less similar based on their distributional patterning in text (Lee 1999;
