    In Performance of the joint model using the top ten parses from Charniak&#8217;s parser.
    Results are on Section 23.
    Propbank I, there have been several changes in the annotation conventions, as well as error fixes and addition of new propositions.
    There was also a change in the way PP arguments are annotated: In the February 2004 data some PP arguments are annotated at the head NP child, but in Propbank I all PP arguments are annotated at the PP nodes.
    In order to achieve maximal performance with respect to these annotations, it would probably be best to change the feature definitions to account for the changes.
    However, we did no adaptation of the features.
    The training set consists of the annotations in Sections 2 to 21, the development set is section 24 (Devset), and one of the test sets is section 23 (Test WSJ).
    The other test set is from the Brown corpus (Test Brown).
    The CoNLL annotations distinguish refer
