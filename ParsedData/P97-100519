nce that a machine guessing randomly could have come up with results so much better than the baseline.
    It will be recalled that in the LR models, the facets with more than two levels were computed by means of binary decision machines for each level, then choosing the level with the most positive score.
    Therefore some feeling for the internal functioning of our algorithms can be obtained by seeing what the performance is for each of these binary machines, and for the sake of comparison this information is also given for some of the neural net models.
    Table 2 shows how often each of the binary machines correctly determined whether a text did or did not fall in a particular facet level.
    Here again the appropriate baseline could be determined two ways.
    In a machine that chooses randomly, performance would be 50%, and all of the numbers in the table would be significantly better than chance (p &lt; .05, binomial distribution).
    But a simple machine that always guesses No would perform much b
