mate parsing and further shows the robustness of online learning algorithms with approximate inference.
    The approximations we have presented are very simple.
    They start with a reasonably good baseline and make small transformations until the score of the structure converges.
    These approximations work because freer-word order languages we studied are still primarily projective, making the approximate starting point close to the goal parse.
    However, we would like to investigate the benefits for parsing of more principled approaches to approximate learning and inference techniques such as the learning as search optimization framework of (Daum&#180;e and Marcu, 2005).
    This framework will possibly allow us to include effectively more global features over the dependency structure than those in our current second-order model.
