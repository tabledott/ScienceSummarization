mple, Grosz [19771 presents several examples of pronouns being used to refer to objects mentioned many utterances back.
    Second, the hearer must process (interpret) the particular linguistic expression that realizes the center.
    Most previous attempts to account for the interaction of different kinds of referring expressions with centering and focusing (or 'topic') have conflated these two.
    For example, Joshi and Weinstein [19811 present a preliminary report on their research regarding the connection between the computational complexity of the inferences required to process a discourse and the coherence of that discourse as assessed by measures that invoke the centering phenomenon.
    However, several of the examples combine changes of expression and shifts in centering.
    Violations of the basic centering rule require the hearer to draw two different kinds of inferences.
    The kind required depends on whether a full definite noun phrase is used to express the center or whether a pronoun is use
