e runtime is 0(n4 max(P, IVO)).
    By comparison, the CKY algorithm uses only the first type of item, and relies on rules whose inputs are pairs Such rules can be instantiated in 0(n5) different ways for a fixed grammar, yielding 0(n5) time complexity.
    The new algorithm saves a factor of n by combining those two constituents in two steps, one of which is insensitive to k and abstracts over its possible values, the other of which is insensitive to h' and abstracts over its possible values.
    It is straightforward to turn the new 0(n4) recognition algorithm into a parser for stochastic bilexical CFCs (or other weighted bilexical CFGs).
    In a stochastic CFG, each nonterminal A[a] is accompanied by a probability distribution over productions of the form A[a] &#8212;&gt; a.
    A parse is just a derivation (proof tree) of lhn and its probability&#8212;like that of any derivation we find&#8212;is defined as the product of the probabilities of all productions used to condition inference rules in the proof
