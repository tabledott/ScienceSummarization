r model uses a standard first order Markov model.
    Despite using such a simple model, our method can provide a better result with the help of unlabeled data.
    As shown in Tables 8 and 9, the previous best performance for syntactic chunking and NER was reported by (Ando and Zhang, 2005), and is referred to as &#8216;ASO-semi&#8217;.
    ASO-semi also incorporates unlabeled data solely as additional information in the same way as JESS-CM.
    ASO-semi uses unlabeled data for constructing auxiliary problems that are expected to capture a good feature representation of the target problem.
    As regards syntactic chunking, JESS-CM significantly outperformed ASO-semi for the same 15M-word unlabeled data size obtained from the Wall Street Journal in 1991 as described in (Ando and Zhang, 2005).
    Unfortunately with NER, JESS-CM is slightly inferior to ASO-semi for the same 27M-word unlabeled data size extracted from the Reuters corpus.
    In fact, JESS-CM using 37M-words of unlabeled data provided a compara
