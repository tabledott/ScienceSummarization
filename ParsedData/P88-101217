    Flow obstructed. we know the alarm is for the lube oil pressure, and this provides evidence that the flow is not merely of a fluid but of lube oil.
    The more specific our assumptions are, the more informative our interpretation is.
    The less specific they are, the more likely they are to be correct.
    We therefore need a scheme of abductive inference with three features.
    First, it should be possible for goal expressions to be assumable, at varying costs.
    Second, there should be the possibility of making assumptions at various levels of specificity.
    Third, there should be a way of exploiting the natural redundancy of texts.
    We have devised just such an abduction scheme.6 First, every conjunct in the logical form of the sentence is given an assumability cost, as described at the end of Section 2.
    Second, this cost is passed back to the antecedents in Horn clauses by assigning weights to them.
    Axioms are stated in the form This says that P1 and P2 imply Q, but also that if th
