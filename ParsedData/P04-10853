ection of 75 meetings collected at the International Computer Science Institute (ICSI), one among the growing number of corpora of humanto-human multi-party conversations.
    These are naturally occurring, regular weekly meetings of various ICSI research teams.
    Meetings in general run just under an hour each; they have an average of 6.5 participants.
    These meetings have been labeled with adjacency pairs (AP), which provide information about speaker interaction.
    They reflect the structure of conversations as paired utterances such as questionanswer and offer-acceptance, and their labeling is used in our work to determine who are the addressees in agreements and disagreements.
