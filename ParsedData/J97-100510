ders on 3 texts under two conditions&#8212;text plus speech or text alone&#8212;is reported at levels ranging from 74.3% to 95.1%.
    In Hirschberg and Nakatani (1996), average reliability (measured using the kappa coefficient discussed in Carletta [1996]) of segmentinitial labels among 3 coders on 9 monologues produced by the same speaker, labeled using text and speech, is .8 or above for both read and spontaneous speech; values of at least .8 are typically viewed as representing high reliability (see Section 3.2).
    Reliability labeling from text alone is .56 for read and .63 for spontaneous speech.
    Other notions of segment have also been used in evaluating naive or trained coders.
    Hearst (1993) asked naive subjects to place boundaries between paragraphs of running text, to indicate topic changes.
    Hearst reports agreement of greater than 80%, and indicates that significance results were found that were similar to those reported in Passonneau and Litman (1993).
    Flammia and Zue (1995) asked
