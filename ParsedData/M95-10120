  MITRE: DESCRIPTION OF THE ALEMBIC SYSTEM USED FOR MUC-6 John Aberdeen, John Burger, David Day, Lynette Hirschman, Patricia Robinson, and Marc Vilain The MITRE Corporation 202 Burlington Rd .
  Bedford, MA 01730 {aberdeen, john, clay, lynette, parann, mbv}@mitre .org As with several other veteran Muc participants, MITRES Alembic system has undergone a major trans - formation in the past two years.
  The genesis of this transformation occurred during a dinner conversation at the last Muc conference, MUC-5 .
  At that time, several of us reluctantly admitted that our major impediment towards improved performance was reliance on then-standard linguistic models of syntax.
  We knew we would need an alternative to traditional linguistic grammars, even to the somewhat non-traditional categoria l pseudo-parser we had in place at the time.
  The problem was, which alternative ?
  The answer came in the form of rule sequences, an approach Eric Brill originally laid out in his work o n part-of-speech tagging [5, 7] .
