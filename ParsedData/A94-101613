rating such scores.
    Instead, we are planning to use an English language model on the output, in a manner similar to that done by speech and statistical translation systems (Brown et al., 1990).
    Statistically generating such a model is feasible, since it does not rely on knowing correspondences between source and target languages.
    It is a weaker approach, but should go some distance in selecting between otherwise indistinguishable outputs.
    Another possible direction for future development would be to employ ideas from the area of heuristic search, and only run the highest-quality-score engine on each unit of source text.
    This assumes that we can reliably estimate scores in advance (not currently true for the expensive engines), and that the engines can be run on fragments.
    A less ambitious version of this idea would be to run the low-scoring engines only where there are gaps in the normally high-scoring engines.
