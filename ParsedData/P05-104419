nd also appeared at the other training set sizes.
    Believing this might be indicative of brittleness in Viterbi label selection, we computed the expected accuracy of the LENGTH models; the same &#8220;dips&#8221; were present.
    This could indicate that the learner was trapped in a local maximum, suggesting that, since other criteria did not exhibit this behavior, LENGTH might be a bumpier objective surface.
    It would be interesting to measure the bumpiness (sensitivity to initial conditions) of different contrastive objectives.7 The assumption that the tagging dictionary is completely known is difficult to justify.
    While a POS lexicon might be available for a new language, certainly it will not give exhaustive information about all word types in a corpus.
    We experimented with removing knowledge from the tagging dictionary, thereby increasing the difficulty of the task, to see how well various objective functions could recover.
    One means to recovery is the addition of features to the model
