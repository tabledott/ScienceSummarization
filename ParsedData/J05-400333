 6 shows the amounts of extracted data, measured in number of English tokens.
    For ArabicEnglish, we were able to extract from the Gigaword corpora much more data than in our previous experiments (see Table 2), clearly due to the better dictionary.
    For ChineseEnglish, there was no increase in the size of extracted data (although the amount from Table 6 is smaller than that from Table 2, it counts only sentence pairs extracted with confidence higher than 0.70).
    In the previous section, we measured, for our training corpora, their coverage of the test set (Tables 3 and 4).
    We repeated the measurements for the training data from Table 6 and obtained very similar results: using the additional extracted data improves coverage, especially for longer n-grams.
    To give the reader an idea of the amount of data that is funneled through our system, we show in Figure 7 the sizes of the data processed by each of the system&#8217;s components during extraction from the Gigaword and Web-based Chinese-Engli
