    The method parses a sentence deterministically only deciding whether the current segment modifies segment on its immediate right hand side.
    Moreover, it does not assume the independence constraint between dependencies
  
  
    This section describes the general formulation of the probabilistic model for parsing which has been applied to Japanese statistical dependency analysis.
    First of all, we define a sentence as a sequence of segments B = (b1, b2 ..., bm) and its syntactic structure as a sequence of dependency patterns D = (Dep(1), Dep(2), ... , Dep(m&#8722;1)) , where Dep(i) = j means that the segment bi depends on (modifies) segment bj.
    In this framework, we assume that the dependency sequence D satisfies the following two constraints.
    Statistical dependency analysis is defined as a searching problem for the dependency pattern D that maximizes the conditional probability P(D|B) of the input sequence under the above-mentioned constraints.
    If we assume that the dependency probab
