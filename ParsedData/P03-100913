 and Joanis, 2003).
    We associate with each cluster its most prevalent semantic class, and denote the number of verbs in a cluster K that take its prevalent class by nprevalent(K).
    Verbs that do not take this class are considered as errors.
    Given our task, we are only interested in classes which contain two or more verbs.
    We therefore disregard those clusters where nprevalent(K) = 1.
    This leads us to define modified purity: number of verbs .
    The modification we introduce to purity removes the bias towards the trivial configuration comprised of only singletons.
    We first evaluated the clusters against the predominant sense, i.e. using the monosemous gold standard.
    The results, shown in Table 2, demonstrate that both clustering methods perform significantly better on the task than our random clustering baseline.
    Both methods show clearly better performance with fine-grained SCFs (with prepositions, +PP) than with coarse-grained ones (-PP).
    Surprisingly, the simple NN method
