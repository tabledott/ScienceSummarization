ontingency table for Cohen, and in what we will call an agreement table for the others.
    Consider the following situation.
    Two coders2 code 150 occurrences of Okay and assign to them one of the two labels Accept or Ack(nowledgement) (Allen and Core 1997).
    The two coders label 70 occurrences as Accept, and another 55 as Ack.
    They disagree on 25 occurrences, which one coder labels as Ack, and the other as Accept.
    In Figure 1, this example is encoded by the top contingency table on the left (labeled Example 1) and the agreement table on the right.
    The contingency table directly mirrors our description.
    The agreement table is an N &#215; m matrix, where N is the number of items in the data set and m is the number of labels that can be assigned to each object; in our example, N = 150 and m = 2.
    Each entry nij is the number of codings of label j to item i.
    The agreement table in Figure 1 shows that occurrences 1 through 70 have been labeled as Accept by both coders, 71 through 125
