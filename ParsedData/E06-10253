on Task 2 by considering the algebraic sum of the orientations of terms as representative of the orientation of the document they belong to; but more sophisticated approaches are also possible (Hatzivassiloglou and Wiebe, 2000; Riloff et al., 2003; Wilson et al., 2004).
    Implicit in most works dealing with term orientation is the assumption that, for many languages for which one would like to perform opinion mining, there is no available lexical resource where terms are tagged as having either a Positive or a Negative connotation, and that in the absence of such a resource the only available route is to generate such a resource automatically.
    However, we think this approach lacks realism, since it is also true that, for the very same languages, there is no available lexical resource where terms are tagged as having either a Subjective or an Objective connotation.
    Thus, the availability of an algorithm that tags Subjective terms as being either Positive or Negative is of little help, since determini
