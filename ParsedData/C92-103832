ase might record that a particular screw had (size.
  one-inch), and the gen- eration system would choose to call this screw small or/arye depending on the size of the other screws in the context set.
  We hope to do further research on determining how exactly this process hould work.
  Conc lus ions We have presented an algorithm for the generation of referring expressions that  is substantially simpler and faster than the algorithms we have proposed in previous work [Da189,Rei90a], largely because it performs much less length-oriented optimization of its output.
  We have been guided in this simplifica- tion effort by psycholinguistic findings and transcript analyses, and believe that the resulting algorithm is a more practical one for natural  anguage generation systems than the ones we proposed previously.
