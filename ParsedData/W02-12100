  Efficient Deep Processing Of Japanese
  
    We present a broad coverage Japanese grammar written in the HPSG formalism with MRS semantics.
    The grammar is created for use in real world applications, such that robustness and performance issues play an important role.
    It is connected to a POS tagging and word segmentation tool.
    This grammar is being developed in a multilingual context, requiring MRS structures that are easily comparable across languages.
  
  
    Natural language processing technology has recently reached a point where applications that rely on deep linguistic processing are becoming feasible.
    Such applications (e.g. message extraction systems, machine translation and dialogue understanding systems) require natural language understanding, or at least an approximation thereof.
    This, in turn, requires rich and highly precise information as the output of a parse.
    However, if the technology is to meet the demands of real-world applications, this must not come at the cost
