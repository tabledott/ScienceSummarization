word in the Hebrew data is 1.8 and is 1.7 in Arabic.
    For the bilingual models which employs probabilistic string-edit distance as a prior on abstract morphemes, we parameterize the string-edit model with the chart of Semitic consonant relationships listed on page xxiv of (Thackston, 1999).
    All pairs of corresponding letters are given equal substitution probability, while all other letter pairs are given substitution probability of zero.
    Evaluation Methods Following previous work, we evaluate the performance of our automatic segmentation algorithm using F-score.
    This measure is the harmonic mean of recall and precision, which are calculated on the basis of all possible segmentation points.
    The evaluation is performed on a random set of 1/5 of the parallel phrases which is unseen during the training phase.
    During testing, we do not allow the models to consider any multilingual evidence.
    This restriction allows us to simulate future performance on purely monolingual data.
