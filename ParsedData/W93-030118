at the French position j was connected to the English position i will not increase the probability that j + 1 will be connected to an English position near i.
    The absence of such dependence can easily confuse the program, mainly in aligning adjacent occurrences of the same word, which are common in technical texts.
    Brown et al. introduce such dependence in their Model 4.
    We have selected a simpler alternative defined in terms of offset probabilities.
    The first step in finding the most probable alignment is to determine the relevant connectzons for each French position.
    Relevant connections are required to be reasonably likely, that is, their translation probability (t(f le)) should exceed some minimal threshold.
    Moreover, they are required to fall within a window between 1(j) &#8212; w and 1(j) + w in the English corpus, as in the previous step (parameter estimation).
    We call a French position relevant if it has at least one relevant connection.
    Each alignment A then consists o
