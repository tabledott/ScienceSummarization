    Each utterance Ui is assigned a list of forward-looking centers, Cf (Ui), and a unique backward-looking center, Cb(Ui).
    A ranking imposed on the elements of the Cf reflects the assumption that the most highly ranked element of C f (Ui) (the preferred center Cp(Ui)) is most likely to be the Cb(Ui.4.1).
    The most highly ranked element of C f (Ui) that is realized in U2-F1 (i.e., is associated with an expression that has a valid interpretation in the underlying semantic representation) is the Cb(Ui+i).
    Therefore, the ranking on the Cf plays a crucial role in the model.
    Grosz et al. (1995) and Brennan et al.
    (1987) use grammatical relations to rank the Cf (i.e., subj obj ...) but state that other factors might also play a role.
    For their centering algorithm, Brennan et al. (1987, henceforth BFP-algorithm) extend the notion of centering transition relations, which hold across adjacent utterances, to differentiate types of shift (cf.
    Table 1 taken from Walker et al. (1994)).
