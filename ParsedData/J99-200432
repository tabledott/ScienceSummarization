t, data collected from the XTAG parses, was split into 8,000 words of training and 3,000 words of test material.
    The data collected from converting the Penn Treebank was used in two experiments differing in the size of the training corpus-200,000 words' and 1,000,000 words9&#8212;and tested on 47,000 words'''.
    A total of 300 different supertags were used in these experiments. mance of the trigram supertagger on the IBM Manual corpus, a set of 14,000 words correctly supertagged was used as the training corpus and a set of 1,000 words was used as a test corpus.
    The performance of the supertagger on this corpus is shown in Table 6.
    Performance on the ATIS corpus was evaluated using a set of 1,500 words correctly supertagged as the training corpus and a set of 400 words as a test corpus.
    The performance of the supertagger on the ATIS corpus is also shown in Table 6.
    As expected, the performance on the ATIS corpus is higher than that of the WSJ and the IBM Manual corpus despite the extremel
