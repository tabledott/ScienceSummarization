tegorize the adjectives as relational or attributive (Levi, 1978); such a categorization may be useful in classifying them as either scalar or non-scalar.
    For determining whether a group of adjectives is scalar, we also plan to use the gradability of the adjectives as observed in the corpus.
    In addition, we are exploring tests for determining whether two adjectives are antonymous, essentially in the opposite direction of the work by Justeson and Katz (1991) , and tests for comparing the relative semantic strength of two adjectives.
    Furthermore, we plan to consider alternative evaluation methods and test our system on a much larger set of adjectives.
    That was not done for the current evaluation because of the difficulty for humans of constructing large models.
    We are considering an evaluation method which would use a thesaurus to judge similarity, as well as a supplementary method based on mathematical properties of the clustering.
    Neither of these methods would access any human models.
