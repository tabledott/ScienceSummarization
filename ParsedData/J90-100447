nformation (the empty verb anaphor) is overtly realized in a position where there is enough information (the antecedent).
    Thus it appears that the problem might be solved if the antecedent is generated before the anaphor.
    This is the case if the antecedent is the semantic head of the clause; the anaphor will then be instantiated via top-down information through the chained_nodes predicate.
    However, in the example grammar the antecedent is not necessarily the semantic head of the clause because of the VP modifier rule (12).
    Typically, there is a relation between the empty anaphor and some antecedent expressed implicitly in the grammar; in the case at hand, it comes about by percolating the information through different rules from the antecedent to the anaphor.
    We propose to make this relation explicit by defining an empty head with a Prolog clause using the predicate head_gap. head _ gap(v(A,B,ni1)/Sem, v(A,B,v(A,B)/Sem)/Sem).
    Such a definition can intuitively be understood as follows:
