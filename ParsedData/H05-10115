 accuracy comparable to that of a combination of more complex standard models.
	
	
			We develop two word alignment models, incorpo rating different word association features intended to indicate how likely two words or groups of words are to be mutual translations, plus additional features measuring how much word reordering is required bythe alignment1, and how many words are left un linked.
			One of the models also includes a feature measuring how often one word is linked to several words.
			Each of our feature scores have analogs in theIBM and HMM models.
			The association scores corresponds to word translation probabilities; the reordering scores correspond to distortion probabili ties; the scores for words left unlinked corresponds to probabilities of words being linked to the nullword; and the scores for one-to-many links corre spond to fertility probabilities.
			2.1 The Log-Likelihood-Based Model.
			In our first model, we use a log-likelihood-ratio (LLR) statistic as our measure of word associatio
