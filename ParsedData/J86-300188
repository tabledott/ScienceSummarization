ut Jack at the party?
    Well, a lot of other people thought he acted just as badly as we thought he did.
    The utterances today recall, or return to, yesterday's conversation to help satisfy the intention that more be said about Jack's poor behavior.
    Anything that can be talked about once can be talked about again.
    However, if there is no focus space on the stack corresponding to the segment and DSP being discussed further, then, as Polanyi and Scha (1983) point out, there is no popping of the stack.
    There need not be any discourse underway when a semantic return occurs; in such cases, the focus stack will be empty.
    Thus, unlike the returns that follow normal interruptions, semantic returns involve a push onto the stack of a new space containing, among other things, representations of the reintroduced entities.
    The separation of attentional state from intentional structure makes clear not only what is occurring in such cases, but also the intuitions underlying the term semantic return.
