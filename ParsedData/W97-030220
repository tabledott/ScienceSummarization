of the algorithms need to be changed. of the form N &#8212;&gt; NIA NI+1,1 in the first pass that wasn't thresholded out by multi-pass thresholding, beam thresholding, etc., we consider every descendant production instance, that is, all those of the form NP Ni; NkZ;1,i , for appropriate values of p, q, r. This algorithm is given in Figure 4, which uses a current pass matrix Chart to keep track of nonterminals in the current pass, and a previous pass matrix, Prey Chart to keep track of nonterminals in the previous pass.
    We use one additional optimization, keeping track of the descendants of each nonterminal in each cell in PrevChart which are in the corresponding cell of Chart.
    We tried multiple-pass thresholding in two different ways.
    In the first technique we tried, productioninstance thresholding, we remove from consideration in the second pass the descendants of all production instances whose combined inside-outside probability falls below a threshold.
    In the second technique, node threshol
