 examples, coverage can be increased at little cost in accuracy by using the one-sense-per-discourse heuristic.
    We acquire selectional preferences as probability distributions over the WordNet (Fellbaum 1998) noun hyponym hierarchy.
    The probability distributions are conditioned on a verb or adjective class and a grammatical relationship.
    A noun is disambiguated by using the preferences to give probability estimates for each of its senses in WordNet, that is, for WordNet synsets.
    Verbs and adjectives are disambiguated by using the probability distributions and Bayes&#8217; rule to obtain an estimate of the probability of the adjective or verb class, given the noun and the grammatical relationship.
    Previously, we evaluated noun and verb disambiguation on the English all-words task in the SENSEVAL-2 exercise (Cotton et al. 2001).
    We now present results also using preferences for adjectives, again evaluated on the SENSEVAL-2 test corpus (but carried out after the formal evaluation deadline
