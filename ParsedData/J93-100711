 sailing thus requires more than a glossary, it requires knowledge of domain-dependent collocations.
    The recurrent property simply means that these combinations are not exceptions, but rather that they are very often repeated in a given context.
    Word combinations such as &amp;quot;to make a decision, to hit a record, to perform an operation&amp;quot; are typical of the language, and collocations such as &amp;quot;to buy short,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;to ease the jib&amp;quot; are characteristic of specific domains.
    Both types are repeatedly used in specific contexts.
    By cohesive2 clusters, we mean that the presence of one or several words of the collocations often implies or suggests the rest of the collocation.
    This is the property mostly used by lexicographers when compiling collocations (Cowie 1981; Benson 1989a).
    Lexicographers use other people's linguistic judgment for deciding what is and what is not a collocation.
    They give questionnaires to people such as the one given in Figur
