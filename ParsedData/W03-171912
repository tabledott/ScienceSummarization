n rates as the probability that a character string that has been identified as a word is really a word; these precision-based confidences are given as &#8220;c &#8221; in the tables.
    It seems reasonable to treat two systems as significantly different (at the 95% confidence level), if at least one of their recall-based or precision-based confidences are different.
    Using this criterion all systems are significantly different from each other except that on PK closed S10 is not significantly different from S09, and S07 is not significantly different from S04.
  
  
    In Figure 1 we plot the F scores for all systems, all tracks.
    We include as &#8220;BASE&#8221;, and &#8220;TOP&#8221; the baseline and topline scores discussed previously.
    In most cases people performed above the baseline, though well below the ideal topline; note though that the two participants in the Academia Sinica open track underperformed the baseline.
    Performance on the Penn Chinese Treebank (CTB) corpus was generally low
