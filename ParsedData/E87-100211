etailed account, even of all the material in Table I, not to mention problems that would arise if we were to consider the full range of Arabic roots.
    What I do hope to do, however, is to establish a theoretical framework within which solutions to all of these problems could be developed.
    We must presumably expect the transducers we construct to account for the Arabic data to have transition functions from states and quadruples of symbols to states.
    In other words, we will be able to describe them with transition diagrams whose edges are labeled with a vector of four symbols.
    When the automaton moves from one state to another, each of the four tapes will advance over the symbol corresponding to it on the transition that sanctions the move. shall allow myself extensions to this basic scheme which will enhance the perspicuity and economy of the formalism without changing its essential character.
    In particular, these extensions will leave us clearly within the domain of finite-state devices.
