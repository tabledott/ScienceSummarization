    Regarding the other evaluation criteria, which take the word order into account, the nonmonotone search of the alignment templates has a clear advantage.
    This was already indicated by the low degree of monotonicity on this task.
    The rather free word order in German and the long range dependencies of the verb group make reorderings necessary.
    The translation results for the Xerox task are shown in Table 7.
    Here, we see that both phrase-based systems clearly outperform the single-word based systems.
    The PB system performs best on this task.
    Compared to the AT system, the BLEU score improves by 4.1% absolute.
    The improvement of the PB system with respect to the AT system is statistically significant at the 99% level.
    The translation results for the Canadian Hansards task are shown in Table 8.
    As on the Xerox task, the phrase-based systems perform better than the single-word based systems.
    The monotone phrase-based system yields even better results than the alignme
