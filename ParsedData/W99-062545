rity by two additional independent reviewers, who agreed on their decisions 91% of the time, versus 50% expected by chance; in this case, K = 0.82.
    Thus, we feel confident in the reliability of our annotation process, and can use the annotated corpus to assess the performance of our similarity measure and compare it to measures proposed earlier in the information retrieval literature.
    We compare the performance of our system to three other methods.
    First, we use standard TF*IDF, a method that with various alterations, remains at the core of many information retrieval and text matching systems [Salton and Buckley 1988; Salton 1989].
    We compute the total frequency (TF) of words in each text unit.
    We also compute the number of units each word appears in in our training set (DF, or document frequency).
    Then each text unit is represented as a vector of TF*IDF scores calculated as Similarity between text units is measured by the cosine of the angle between the corresponding two vectors (i.e.
