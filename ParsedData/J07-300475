ule instantiation tokens (corresponding to 38 rule types, because one rule appears 13 times in one sentence), six involve coordination, and three punctuation.
    One missing rule is an instance of substitution (caused by a parasitic gap).
    Two missing rules are instances of type-raised argument types combining with a verb of a rare type.
  
  
    This paper has presented an algorithm which translates Penn Treebank phrase-structure trees into CCG derivations augmented with word&#8211;word dependencies that approximate the underlying predicate&#8211;argument structure.
    In order to eliminate some of the noise in the original annotation and to obtain linguistically adequate derivations that conform to the &#8220;correct&#8221; analyses proposed in the literature, considerable preprocessing was necessary.
    Even though certain mismatches between the syntactic annotations in the Penn Treebank and the underlying semantics remain, and will affect any similar attempt to obtain expressive grammars from the T
