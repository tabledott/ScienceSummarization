d the evaluation tool EvalTrans (Nie&#223;en and Leusch 2000), which is designed to facilitate the work of manually judging evaluation quality and to ensure consistency over time and across evaluators.
    It is a costly and time-consuming task to compile large texts and have them translated to form bilingual corpora suitable for training the model parameters for statistical machine translation.
    As a consequence, it is important to investigate the amount of data necessary to sufficiently cover the vocabulary expected in testing.
    Furthermore, we want to examine to what extent the incorporation of morphological knowledge sources can reduce this amount of necessary data.
    Figure 4 shows the relation between the size of a typical German corpus and the corresponding number of different full forms.
    At the size of 520,000 words, the size of the Verbmobil corpus used for training, this curve still has a high growth rate.
    To investigate the impact of the size of the bilingual corpus available for tr
