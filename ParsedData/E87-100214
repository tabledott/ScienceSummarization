ed in generating a form that depends only minimally on information in a transducer is given in table The eight step are labeled (a) - (h).
    For each one, a box is shown enclosing the symbols currently under the read-write heads.
    The tapes move under the heads from the right and then continue to the left No symbols are shown to the right on the bottom tape, because we are assuming that the operation chronicled in these diagrams is one in which a surface form is being 5 (a) V t b [1 (e) k t {b} CCVVCVC V VCCV V C C a a {al a [1 a ak t a (b) t b t [] V a a VVCVC [] VCCVC V V a ak tab (c) (g) V C VC VC VCCVC a a [] a &#8226;&#9632;&#9632;&#8226; [] ak t a b (d) k t [] (h) k t b V C C V a C VC V VCCVCVC a a i a k t a a ak t ab i b Table II generated.
    The bottom tape&#8212;the one containing the surface form&#8212;is therefore being written and it is for this reason that nothing appears to the right.
    The other three tapes, in the order shown, contain the root, the prosodic template, and the vocalism.
