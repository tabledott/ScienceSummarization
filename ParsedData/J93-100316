 , , ni) + log Up2 , k2 , n2) &#8212; log L(p, , ni) &#8212; log L(p,k2, n2)] &#8226; For the multinomial case, it is convenient to use the double subscripts and the abbreviations This expression implicitly involves n because E119 = n. Maximizing and taking the logarithm, &#8212;21og A = 2 [log L (Pi , ) + log L (P2, K2) &#8212; log L(Q, ) &#8212; log L (Q, K2)1 where If the null hypothesis holds, then the log-likelihood ratio is asymptotically X2 distributed with k/2 &#8212; 1 degrees of freedom.
    When j is 2 (the binomial), &#8212;2 log A will be X2 distributed with one degree of freedom.
    If we had initially approximated the binomial distribution with a normal distribution with mean np and variance np(1 &#8212; p), then we would have arrived at another form that is a good approximation of &#8212;2 log A when np(1 &#8212; p) is more than roughly 5.
    This form is where &#8212;21og A (kji &#8212; niqi)2 as in the multinomial case above and Interestingly, this expression is exactly the test statistic
