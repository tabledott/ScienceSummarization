construct the dependency tree.
    Learning is based on techniques like SVM (Vapnik 1998) or Memory Based Learning (Daelemans 2003), which provide high accuracy but are often computationally expensive.
    Kudo and Matsumoto (2002) report a two week learning time on a Japanese corpus of about 8000 sentences with SVM.
    Using Maximum Entropy (Berger, et al. 1996) classifiers I built a parser that achieves a throughput of over 200 sentences per second, with a small loss in accuracy of about 23 %.
    The efficiency of Maximum Entropy classifiers seems to leave a large margin that can be exploited to regain accuracy by other means.
    I performed a series of experiments to determine whether increasing the number of features or combining several classifiers could allow regaining the best accuracy.
    An experiment cycle in our setting requires less than 15 minutes for a treebank of moderate size like the Portuguese treebank (Afonso et al., 2002) and this allows evaluating the effectiveness of adding/removing
