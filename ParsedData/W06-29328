s for all 13 languages provided by the CoNLL organizers (Buchholz et al., 2006).
    Based on performance from a held-out section of the training data, we used non-projective parsing algorithms for Czech, Danish, Dutch, German, Japanese, Portuguese and Slovene, and projective parsing algorithms for Arabic, Bulgarian, Chinese, Spanish, Swedish and Turkish.
    Furthermore, for Arabic and Spanish, we used lemmas instead of inflected word forms, again based on performance on held-out data1.
    Results on the test set are given in Table 1.
    Performance is measured through unlabeled accuracy, which is the percentage of words that modify the correct head in the dependency graph, and labeled accuracy, which is the percentage of words that modify the correct head and label the dependency edge correctly in the graph.
    These results show that the discriminative spanning tree parsing framework (McDonald et al., 2005b; McDonald and Pereira, 2006) is easily adapted across all these languages.
