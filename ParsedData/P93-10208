equential relations.
    Given that the average length of our narratives is 700 words, this is consistent with previous findings (Rotondo, 1984) that non-linear segmentation is impractical for naive subjects in discourses longer than 200 words. '
    Since prosodic phrases were already marked in the transcripts, we restricted subjects to placing boundaries between prosodic phrases.
    In principle, this makes it more likely that subjects will agree on a given boundary than if subjects were completely unrestricted.
    However, previous studies have shown that the smallest unit subjects use in similar tasks corresponds roughly to a breath group, prosodic phrase, or clause (Chafe, 1980; Rotondo, 1984; Hirschberg and Grosz, 1992).
    Using smaller units would have artificially lowered the probability for agreement on boundaries.
    Figure 2 shows the responses of subjects at each potential boundary site for a portion of the excerpt from Figure 1.
    Prosodic phrases are numbered sequentially, with the first
