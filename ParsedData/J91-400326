aptured by assuming the following levels of representation.
    These four structures essentially constitute the different levels of semantic expressiveness and representation that are needed for a computational theory of lexical semantics.
    Each level contributes a different kind of information to the meaning of a word.
    The important difference between this highly configurational approach to lexical semantics and feature-based approaches is that the recursive calculus defined for word meaning here also provides the foundation for a fully compositional semantics for natural language and its interpretation into a knowledge representation model.
    A logical starting point for our investigations into the meaning of words is what has been called the functional structure or argument structure associated with verbs.
    What originally began as the simple listing of the parameters or arguments associated with a predicate has developed into a sophisticated view of the way arguments are mapped onto syntactic
