ed manually for the target application, but several techniques have been developed for generating semantic knowledge automatically.
    Some systems learn the meanings of unknown words using expectations derived from other word definitions in the surrounding context (e.g., (Granger, 1977; Carbonell, 1979; Jacobs and Zernik, 1988; Hastings and Lytinen, 1994)).
    Other approaches use example or case-based methods to match unknown word contexts against previously seen word contexts (e.g., (Berwick, 1989; Cardie, 1993)).
    Our task orientation is a bit different because we are trying to construct a semantic lexicon for a target category, instead of classifying unknown or polysemous words in context.
    To our knowledge, our system is the first one aimed at building semantic lexicons from raw text without using any additional semantic knowledge.
    The only lexical knowledge used by our parser is a part-of-speech dictionary for syntactic processing.
    Although we used a hand-crafted part-of-speech dictiona
