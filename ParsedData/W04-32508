 well the English output of the Portuguese-English matches the reference sentence.
    We would like to stress that comparing performance of a method that translates text from different languages instead of using different translation methods on the same input text is irrelevant for the purpose of this paper.
    We are comparing output of different systems in either case.
    As an alternative, we may also use a single language pair and different systems, say, by using different parameter settings.
    But we feel that this would leave us with many arbitrary choices that we would like to avoid for the sake of clarity of our argument.
    We already reported some BLEU scores earlier.
    These were computed on a 30,000 sentence test set (about 900,000 words).
    Such a huge test set is very uncommon2, since translating such a large amount of text is computationally very expensive.
    It may take hours or even days, which does not contribute to a fast turn-around system development process.
    Therefore, we
