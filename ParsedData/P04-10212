ansliterating English names into Chinese is not straightforward.
    However, recalling the original from Chinese transliteration is even more challenging as the E2C transliteration may have lost some original phonemic evidences.
    The Chinese-English backward transliteration process is also called back-transliteration, or C2E (Knight &amp; Graehl, 1998).
    In machine transliteration, the noisy channel model (NCM), based on a phoneme-based approach, has recently received considerable attention (Meng et al. 2001; Jung et al, 2000; Virga &amp; Khudanpur, 2003; Knight &amp; Graehl, 1998).
    In this paper we discuss the limitations of such an approach and address its problems by firstly proposing a paradigm that allows direct orthographic mapping (DOM), secondly further proposing a joint source-channel model as a realization of DOM.
    Two other machine learning techniques, NCM and ID3 (Quinlan, 1993) decision tree, also are implemented under DOM as reference to compare with the proposed n-gram TM.
