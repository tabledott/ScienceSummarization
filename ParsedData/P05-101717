e accuracy values of semantic orientation classification for four different sets of seed words and various networks.
    In the table, cv corresponds to the result of 10-fold cross validation, in which case we use the pseudo leave-one-out error for hyper-parameter estimation, while in other cases we use magnetization.
    In most cases, the synonyms and the cooccurrence information from corpus improve accuracy.
    The only exception is the case of 2 seed words, in which G performs better than GT.
    One possible reason of this inversion is that the computation is trapped in a local optimum, since a small number of seed words leave a relatively large degree of freedom in the solution space, resulting in more local optimal points.
    We compare our results with Turney and with various networks and four different sets of seed words.
    In the parenthesis, the actual best value of Q is written, except for cv.
    Littman&#8217;s results.
    With 14 seed words, they achieved 61.26% for a small corpus (approx.
