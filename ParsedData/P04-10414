ammars (Johnson, 2002), i.e. they do not resolve LDDs but interpret linguistic material purely locally where it oc curs in the tree.
			Recently (Cahill et al, 2002) showed how wide-coverage, probabilistic unification grammarresources can be acquired automatically from fstructure-annotated treebanks.
			Many second gen eration treebanks provide a certain amount of deep syntactic or dependency information (e.g. in the form of Penn-II functional tags and traces) supporting the computation of representations ofdeep linguistic information.
			Exploiting this in formation (Cahill et al, 2002) implement an automatic LFG f-structure annotation algorithmthat associates nodes in treebank trees with f structure annotations in the form of attribute-valuestructure equations representing abstract predicate argument structure/dependency relations.
			From the f-structure annotated treebank they automatically extract wide-coverage, robust, PCFG-based LFG approximations that parse new text into trees and f-structure represen
