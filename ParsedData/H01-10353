  BACKGROUND Previous research on the word alignment of parallel corpora has tended to focus on their use in translation model training for MT rather than on monolingual applications.
  One exception is bilin- gual parsing.
  Wu (1995, 1997) investigated the use of concurrent parsing of parallel corpora in a transduction inversion framework, helping to resolve attachment ambiguities in one language by the coupled parsing state in the second language.
  Jones and Havrilla (1998) utilized similar joint parsing techniques (twisted-pair gram- mars) for word reordering in target language generation.
  However, with these exceptions in the field of parsing, to our knowledge no one has previously used linguistic annotation pro- jection via aligned bilingual corpora to induce traditional stand- alone monolingual text analyzers in other languages.
  Thus both our proposed projection and induction methods, and their applica-
