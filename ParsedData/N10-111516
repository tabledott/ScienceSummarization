ST) parsers.
    Beam-search decoding for left-toright parsers (Zhang and Clark, 2008) is also linear, but has an additional linear dependence on the beamsize.
    The reported results in (Zhang and Clark, 2008) use a beam size of 64, compared to our constant of k = 6.
    Our Python-based implementation5 (the perceptron is implemented in a C extension module) parses about 40 tagged sentences per second on an Intel based MacBook laptop.
  
  
    We evaluate the parser using the WSJ Treebank.
    The trees were converted to dependency structures with the Penn2Malt conversion program,6 using the headfinding rules from (Yamada and Matsumoto, 2003).7 We use Sections 2-21 for training, Section 22 for development, and Section 23 as the final test set.
    The text is automatically POS tagged using a trigram HMM based POS tagger prior to training and parsing.
    Each section is tagged after training the tagger on all other sections.
    The tagging accuracy of the tagger is 96.5 for the training set and 96.8 for t
