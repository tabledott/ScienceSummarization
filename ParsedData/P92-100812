 then pattern matching was used to detect possible repairs, and the edits associated with the repairs were made.
    Parsing was then reattempted.
    If parsing succeeded at this point, the sentence was marked as a repair.
    Otherwise, it was marked as no opinion.
    Table 5 shows the results of these experiments.
    We ran them two ways: once using syntactic constraints alone and again using both syntactic and semantic constraints.
    As can be seen, Gemini is quite accurate at detecting a repair, although somewhat less accurate at detecting a false positive.
    Furthermore, in cases where Gemini detected a repair, it produced the intended correction in 62 out of 68 cases for syntax alone, and in 60 out of 64 cases using combined syntax and semantics.
    In both cases, a large number of sentences (29% for syntax, 50% for semantics) received a no opinion evaluation.
    The no opinion cases were evenly split between repairs and false positives in both tests.
    The main points to be noted from Table
