    For example, consider these two candidate translations of forever hearing the activity guidebook that party direct.
    Although they appear to be on the same subject, they differ markedly in quality.
    For comparison, we provide three reference human translations of the same sentence below. which guarantees the military forces always being under the command of the Party.
    Reference 3: It is the practical guide for the army always to heed the directions of the party.
