    For the (word, supertag) pairs that do not appear in the corpus, the word emit probability is estimated as shown in Equation 8.
    Some of the word features used in our impleBangalore and Joshi Supertagging mentation include prefixes and suffixes of length less than or equal to three characters, capitalization, and digit features.
    The counts for the (word, supertag) pairs for the words that do not appear in the corpus is estimated using the leaving-one-out technique (Niesler and Woodland 1996; Ney, Essen, and Kneser 1995).
    A token UNK is associated with each supertag and its count NuNK is estimated by: where N1(TI) is the number of words that are associated with the supertag Tj that appear in the corpus exactly once.
    N(T1) is the frequency of the supertag Tj and NuNK(TI) is the estimated count of UNK in 7.1.
    The constant n is introduced so as to ensure that the probability is not greater than one, especially for supertags that are sparsely represented in the corpus.
