als of the task to any arbitrary dialogue behavior, by tagging the dialogue with the attributes for the task.9 This makes it possible to evaluate any potential dialogue strategies for achieving the task, as well as to evaluate dialogue strategies that operate at the level of dialogue subtasks (subdialogues).
    Consider the longer versions of Dialogues 1 and 2 in Figures 2 and 3.
    Each utterance in Figures 2 and 3 has been tagged using one or more of the attribute abbreviations in Table 1, according to the subtask(s) the utterance contributes to.
    As a convention of this type of tagging, 'Using a single confusion matrix for all attributes as in Tables 3 and 4 inflates 1G when there are few cross-attribute confusions by making P(E) smaller.
    In some cases it might be desirable to calculate ic first for identification of attributes and then for values within attributes, or to average ic for each attribute to produce an overall ic for the task.
