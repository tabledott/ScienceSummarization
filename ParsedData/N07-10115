 clustering according to the model.
    Clustering terminates when there exists no additional merge that improves the probability of the clustering.
    We refer to the system described in this section as First-Order Uniform.
  
  
    In this section we propose two enhancements to the training procedure for the First-Order Uniform model.
    First, because each training example consists of a subset of noun phrases, the number of possible training examples we can generate is exponential in the number of noun phrases.
    We propose an errordriven sampling method that generates training examples from errors the model makes on the training data.
    The algorithm is as follows: Given initial parameters A, perform greedy agglomerative clustering on training document i until an incorrect cluster is formed.
    Update the parameter vector according to this mistake, then repeat for the next training document.
    This process is repeated for a fixed number of iterations.
    Exactly how to update the parameter vect
