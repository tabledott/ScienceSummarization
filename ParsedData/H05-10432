sed infor mation extraction system that embodies a solution to eachof the above subtasks.
			OPINE is built on top of the Know ItAll Web information-extraction system (Etzioni et al, 2005) as detailed in Section 3.
			Given a particular product and a corresponding set of reviews, OPINE solves the opinion mining tasks outlinedabove and outputs a set of product features, each accom panied by a list of associated opinions which are ranked based on strength (e.g., ?abominable?
			is stronger than?bad).
			This output information can then be used to gen erate various types of opinion summaries.This paper focuses on the first 3 review mining sub tasks and our contributions are as follows: 1.
			We introduce OPINE, a review-mining system whose.
			novel components include the use of relaxation labeling to find the semantic orientation of words in the context of given product features and sentences.
			review-mining system (Hu and Liu, 2004) and find that OPINE?s precision on the feature extraction task is 22% better
