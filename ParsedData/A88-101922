 parsed into noun phrases by laborious semi-automatic means (with considerable help from Eva Ejerhed).
    It took about a man-week to prepare the training material.
    The stochastic parser is given a sequence of parts of speech as input and is asked to insert brackets corresponding to the beginning and end of noun phrases.
    Conceptually, the parser enumerates all possible parsings of the input and scores each of them by the precedence probabilities.
    Consider, for example, the input sequence: NN VB.
    There are 5 possible ways to bracket this sequence (assuming no recursion): Each of these parsings is scored by multiplying 6 precedence probabilities, the probability of an open/close bracket appearing (or not appearing) in any one of the three positions (before the NN, after the NN or after the VB).
    The parsing with the highest score is returned as output.
    A small sample of the output is given in the appendix.
    The method works remarkably well considering how simple it is.
