i is the set of relevant (binary) parsing decisions made by parser i. ri is a parse selected from among the outputs of the individual parsers.
    It is chosen such that the decisions it made in including or excluding constituents are most probable under the models for all of the parsers.
  
  
    The three parsers were trained and tuned by their creators on various sections of the WSJ portion of the Penn Treebank, leaving only sections 22 and 23 completely untouched during the development of any of the parsers.
    We used section 23 as the development set for our combining techniques, and section 22 only for final testing.
    The development set contained 44088 constituents in 2416 sentences and the test set contained 30691 constituents in 1699 sentences.
    A sentence was withheld from section 22 because its extreme length was troublesome for a couple of the parsers.'
    The standard measures for evaluating Penn Treebank parsing performance are precision and recall of the predicted constituents.
