re supplied for all NPs, since the gold mentions list here will also include verb headwords that are linked to event NPs, but will not include singleton mentions, which do not end up as part of any chain.
    The latter constraint makes this test seem somewhat artificial, since it directly reveals part of what the systems are designed to determine, but it still has some value in quantifying the impact that mention detection has on the overall task and what the results are if the mention detection is perfect.
    Since this was a logical extension of the task and since the data was available to the participants for the development set, a few of the sites did run experiments of this type.
    Therefore we decided to provide the gold mentions data to a few sites who had reported these scores, so that we could compute the performance on the test set.
    The results of these experiments are shown in Tables 16 and 17.
    The results show that performance does go up significantly, indicating that it is markedly ea
