tities, normalize temporal and spatial expressions, resolve instances of coreference, and annotate predicates with polarity, tense, and modality information.
    Following preprocessing, texts are sent to an Alignment Module which uses a Maximum Entropy-based classifier in order to estimate the probability that pairs of constituents selected from texts encode corresponding information that could be used to inform an entailment judgment.
    This module assumes that since sets of entailing texts necessarily predicate about the same set of individuals or events, systems should be able to identify elements from each text that convey similar types of presuppositions.
    Examples of predicates and arguments aligned by this module are presented in Figure 3.
    Aligned constituents are then used to extract sets of phrase-level alternations (or &#8220;paraphrases&#8221;) from the WWW that could be used to capture correspondences between texts longer than individual constituents.
