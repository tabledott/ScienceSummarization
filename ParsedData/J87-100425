nything.
    In the following, we present another trace of the parser with the sentence / * a *, where *s represent an unknown word.
    We use the same grammar and parsing table as in the first example (Figures 2.1 and 2.2).
    At the very beginning, we have The possibility of the first unknown word being a preposition has now disappeared.
    The parser accepts the sentence in only one way, and returns &amp;quot;10&amp;quot; as the root node of the parse forest.
    We have shown that our parsing algorithm can handle unknown words without any special mechanism.
  
  
    In this section, we present some empirical results of the algorithm's practical performance.
    Since space is limited, we only show the highlights of the results, referring the reader to chapter 6 of Tomita (1985) for more detail.
    Figure 5.1 shows the relationship between parsing time of the Tomita algorithm and the length of input sentence, and Figure 5.2 shows the comparison with Earley's algorithm (or active chart parsing), using
