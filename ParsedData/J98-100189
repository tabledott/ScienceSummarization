 Work on automatic WSD has a history as long as automated language processing generally.
    Looking back, it is striking to note that most of the problems and the basic approaches to solving them were recognized at the outset.
    Since so much of the early work on WSD is reported in relatively obscure books and articles across several fields and disciplines, it is not surprising that recent authors are often unaware of it.
    What is surprising is that in the broad sense, relatively little progress seems to have been made in nearly 50 years.
    Even though much recent work cites results at the 90% level or better, these studies typically involve very few words, most often only nouns, and frequently concern only broad sense distinctions.
    In a sense, WSD work has come full circle, returning most recently to empirical methods and corpus-based analyses that characterize some of the earliest attempts to solve the problem.
