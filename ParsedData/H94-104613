  Such cases, which lower the average scores, are a necessary but unfortunate consequence of the relatively small sample of tagged text that is available; with a large sample we should have sense frequencies for all of the polysemous words.
  However, we can get some idea of how significent this effect is by simply omitting all instances of guessing, i.e., by basing the percen- tage correct only on those words for which there are data available in the training material.
  When guesses are
