sing but also to sequence tagging, such as POS tagging and named entity recognition (which will be discussed in Section 6).
    We then define inside/outside &#945;-products that represent the &#945;-products of partial structures of a feature forest.
    Inside &#945;-products correspond to inside probabilities in PCFG, and represent the summation of &#945;-products of the daughter sub-trees.
    Outside &#945;-products correspond to outside probabilities in PCFG, and represent the summation of &#945;-products in the upper part of the feature forest.
    Both can be computed incrementally by a dynamic programming algorithm similar to the algorithm for computing inside/outside probabilities in PCFG.
    Given inside/outside o -products of all nodes in a feature forest, the model expectation &#181;i is easily computed by multiplying them for each node.
    To describe the algorithm, we first define the notion of a feature forest, the generalized representation of features in a packed forest structure.
