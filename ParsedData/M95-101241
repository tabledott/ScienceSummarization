  PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS We participated in two officially-scored tasks at MUC-6, named entities and template elements .
  As noted above, we put roughly a staff week into customizing the system to handle the scenario templates task, bu t chose not to participate in the evaluation because another staff week or so would have been required to achieve performance on a par with other parts of the system.
  Overall performance On the named entity task, we obtained an official P&amp;R score of 91 .2, where the separate precision and recal l scores were both officially reported to be 91 .
