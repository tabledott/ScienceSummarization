translating from English into languages or domains with limited parallel data.
    We also ran experiments varying different system parameters.
    Table 5.4 explores different ordering strategies, Table 5.5 looks at the impact of discontiguous phrases and Table 5.6 looks at the impact of decoder optimizations such as treelet pruning and n-best list size.
  
  
    We presented a novel approach to syntacticallyinformed statistical machine translation that leverages a parsed dependency tree representation of the source language via a tree-based ordering model and treelet phrase extraction.
    We showed that it significantly outperforms a leading phrasal SMT system over a wide range of training set sizes and phrase sizes.
    Constituents vs. dependencies: Most attempts at syntactic SMT have relied on a constituency analysis rather than dependency analysis.
    While this is a natural starting point due to its wellunderstood nature and commonly available tools, we feel that this is not the most effective repre
