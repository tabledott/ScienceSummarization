ey technol ogy of Information Extraction and Open-Domain Question Answering (Voorhees and Harman, 2000).
			We are building a trainable Open-Domain Question Answering System called SAIQA-II.
			In this paper, we show that an NE recognizer based on Support Vector Machines (SVMs) gives better scores thanconventional systems.
			SVMs have given high per formance in various classification tasks (Joachims, 1998; Kudo and Matsumoto, 2001).
			However, it turned out that off-the-shelf SVM classifiers are too inefficient for NE recognition.
			The recognizer runs at a rate of only 85 bytes/sec on an Athlon 1.3 GHz Linux PC, while rule-based systems (e.g., Isozaki, (2001)) can process several kilobytes in a second.
			The major reason is the inefficiency of SVM classifiers.
			There are otherreports on the slowness of SVM classifiers.
			Another SVM-based NE recognizer (Yamada and Mat sumoto, 2001) is 0.8 sentences/sec on a Pentium III 933 MHz PC.
			An SVM-based part-of-speech (POS).
