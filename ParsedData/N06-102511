r computing semantic relatedness in Wikipedia see Strube &amp; Ponzetto (2006)): given the candidate referring expressions REZ and REj we first pull the pages they refer to.
    This is accomplished by querying the page titled as the head lemma or, in the case of NEs, the full NP.
    We follow all redirects and check for disambiguation pages, i.e. pages for ambiguous entries which contain links only (e.g.
    Lincoln).
    If a disambiguation page is hit, we first get all the hyperlinks in the page.
    If a link containing the other queried RE is found (i.e. a link containing president in the Lincoln page), the linked page (President of the United States) is returned, else we return the first article linked in the disambiguation page.
    Given a candidate coreference pair REZ/j and the Wikipedia pages PREi/j they point to, obtained by querying pages titled as TREi/j, we extract the following features: I/J GLOSS CONTAINS U if no Wikipedia page titled TREi/j is available.
