English.
    Finally, in both German and Spanish, preposition attachments often led to errors, which is not surprising given the unlexicalized target-language grammars.
    Rather than trying to adjudicate which dependencies are &#8220;mere&#8221; annotation conventions, it would be useful to test learned dependency models on some extrinsic task such as relation extraction or machine translation.
  
  
    Finally, we consider the problem of parser projection when some target language trees are available.
    As in the adaptation case (&#167;3), we train a conditional model (not a generative DMV) of the target tree given the target sentence, using the monolingual and bilingual QG features, including configurations conjoined with tags, outlined above (&#167;2).
    For these experiments, we used the LDC&#8217;s English-Chinese Parallel Treebank (ECTB).
    Since manual word alignments also exist for a part of this corpus, we were able to measure the loss in accuracy (if any) from the use of an automatic Englis
