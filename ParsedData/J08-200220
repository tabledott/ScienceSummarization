t make it difficult to compare results obtained by different researchers, because researchers use their own implementations of evaluation measures, without making all the exact details clear in their papers.
    The first issue is the existence of arguments consisting of multiple constituents.
    In this case it is not clear whether partial credit is to be given for guessing only some of the constituents comprising the argument correctly.
    The second issue is whether the bracketing of constituents should be required to be recovered correctly, in other words, whether pairs of labelings, such as [the]ARG0 [man]ARG0 and [the man]ARG0 are to be considered the same or not.
    If they are considered the same, there are multiple labelings of nodes in a parse tree that are equivalent.
    The third issue is that when using automatic parsers, some of the constituents that are fillers of semantic roles are not recovered by the parser.
    In this case it is not clear how various research groups have scored their s
