rgence or the infinity norm is taken to be the measure of distance between the two distributions.

    A lexicalized parse tree and a list of the rules it contains. where |V |is the number of words in the vocabulary and |T  |is the number of part-ofspeech tags).
    Although nothing has changed from a formal point of view, the practical consequences of expanding the number of nonterminals quickly become apparent when one is attempting to define a method for parameter estimation.
    The simplest solution would be to use the maximum-likelihood estimate as in equation (1), for example, But the addition of lexical items makes the statistics for this estimate very sparse: The count for the denominator is likely to be relatively low, and the number of outcomes (possible lexicalized RHSs) is huge, meaning that the numerator is very likely to be zero.
    Predicting the whole lexicalized rule in one go is too big a step.
    One way to over
