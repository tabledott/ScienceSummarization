    A computational system for understanding may need to explicitly acknowledge this ambiguity.
    A computational system for generation would try to plan a retention as a signal of an impending shift, so that after a retention, a shift would be preferred rather than a continuation.
    Of course the local approach described here does not provide all the necessary information for interpreting pronouns; constraints are also imposed by world knowledge, pragmatics, semantics and phonology.
    There are other interesting questions concerning the centering algorithm.
    How should the centering algorithm interact with an inferencing mechanism?
    Should it make choices when there is more than one proposed anchor with the same ranking?
    In a database query system, how should answers be incorporated into the discourse model?
    How does centering interact with a treatment of definite/indefinite NP's and quantifiers?
    We are exploring ideas for these and other extensions to the centering approach fo
