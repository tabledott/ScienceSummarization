ding the nominal part.
    Then we join a Prep-chunk and one &#8212; or more coordinated &#8212; NP-chunks into a PPchunk.
    Finally, we assign adverbial function (ADVFUNC) labels (e.g. locative or temporal) to all chunks.
    In the last stage of the cascade, we label several types of grammatical relations between pairs of words in the sentence.
    The data for all our experiments was extracted from the Penn Treebank II Wall Street Journal (WSJ) corpus (Marcus et al., 1993).
    For all experiments, we used sections 00-19 as training material and 20-24 as test material.
    See Section 4 for results on other train/test set splittings.
    For evaluation of our results we use the precision and recall measures.
    Precision is the percentage of predicted chunks/relations that are actually correct, recall is the percentage of correct chunks/relations that are actually found.
    For convenient comparisons of only one value, we also list the Fo---1 value (C.J.van Rijsbergen, 1979).
