ndences with idioms and other phrasal chunks.
			To mitigate this limitation on final mappings, we follow the approach of Och (2000): we align once in the forward direction and again in the backward direction.
			These alignments can subsequently be recombined in a variety of ways, 5 The formula for AER given here and in Och &amp; Ney (2003) is intended to compare an automatic alignment against a gold standard alignment.
			However, when comparing one human against another, both comparison and reference distinguish between SURE and POSSIBLE links.
			Because the AER is asymmetric (though each direction differs by less than 5%), we have presented the average of the directional AERs.
			such as union to maximize recall or intersection to maximize precision.
			Och also documents a method for heuristically recombining the unidirectional alignments intended to balance precision and recall.
			In our experience, many alignment errors are present in one side but not the other, hence this recombination also serves t
