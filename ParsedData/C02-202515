(We restrict attention in the test corpus to sentences that are ambiguous according to the grammar, that is, for which the parse selection task is nontrivial.)
  We examine four models: an HMM tagging model, a simple PCFG, a PCFG with grandparent annotation, and a hybrid model that combines predictions from the PCFG and the tagger.
  These models will be described in more detail presently.
  The tagger that we have implemented is a standard tri- gram HMM tagger, defining a joint probability distribu- tion over the preterminal sequences and yields of these trees.
  Trigram probabilities are smoothed by linear in- terpolation with lower-order models.
  For comparison, we present the performance of a unigram tagger and an upper-bound oracle tagger that knows the true tag se- quence and scores highest the parses that have the correct preterminal sequence.
  The PCFG models define probability distributions over the trees of derivational types corresponding to the HPSG analyses of sentences.
  A PCFG model has para
