the opposite effect with hand-aligned data (Galley et al., 2004).
    To study how sentence length correlates with the complexity of translational equivalence, we took subsets of each bitext while varying the maximum length of the shorter sentence in each pair.5 Figure 4 plots the resulting alignment failure rates with and without constraining parse trees.
    The lines in these graphs are not comparable to each other because of the variety of genres involved.
    We examined by hand 30 random sentence pairs from the MTEval bitext in each of three different categories: (1) the set of sentence pairs that could not be hierarchically aligned without gaps, even without constraining parse trees; (2) the set of sentence pairs that could not be hierarchically aligned without gaps with one constraining parse tree, but that did not fall into category 1; and (3) the set of sentence pairs that could not be hierarchically aligned without gaps with two constraining parse trees, but that did not fall into category 1 or 2.
