eference translation.
    As expected the translation quality improves using classes.
    For the small EuTRANs-I task the word error rates reduce significantly.
    The word error rates for the EuTRANs-II task are much larger because the task has a very large vocabulary and is more complex.
    The bilingual classes show better results than the monolingual classes MONO.
    One explanation for the improvement in translation quality is that the bilingually optimized classes result in an increased average size of used alignment templates.
    For example the average length of alignment templates with the EuTRANs-I corpus using WORD is 2.85 and using BIL-2 it is 5.19.
    The longer the average alignment template length, the more context is used in the translation and therefore the translation quality is higher.
    An explanation for the superiority of BIL-2 over BIL is that by first optimizing the English classes mono-lingually, it is much more probable that longer sequences of classes occur more often thereb
