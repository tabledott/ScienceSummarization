r of complete constituents.
    When the first window position ends with an editing signal and the first and second constituents in the window are of the same type, the first is expunged.
    For example, in sentence (8) the first of two determiners separated by an editing signal is expunged and the first of two verbs is similarly expunged.
    (8) I was just that -- the kind of guy that didn't have-like to have people worrying.
    STACK COPY EDITOR.
    If the first constituent in the window is preceded by an editing signal, the Stack Copy Editor looks into the stack for a constituent of the same type, and expunges any copy it finds there along with all descendants.
    (In the current implementation, the Stack Copy Editor is allowed to look at successive nodes in the stack, back to the first COMP node or attention shifting boundary.
    If it finds a copy, it expunges that copy along with any nodes that are at a shallower level in the stack.
