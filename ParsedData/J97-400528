02 = 3/2.
    The functions fi and f2 represent the frequencies of features 1 and 2, respectively, as in Figure 11.
    We are able to exactly The frequencies (number of instances) of features 1 and 2 in dags generated by G2, and the computation of dag weights 0 and dag probabilities q. recreate the empirical distribution using fewer features than before.
    Intuitively, we need only use as many features as are necessary to distinguish among trees that have different empirical probabilities.
    This added flexibility is welcome, but it does make parameter estimation more involved.
    Now we must not only choose values for weights, we must also choose the features that weights are to be associated with.
    We would like to do both in a way that permits us to find the best model, in the sense of the model that minimizes the Kullback-Leibler distance with respect to the empirical distribution.
    The ITS algorithm (Della Pietra, Della Pietra, and Lafferty 1995) provides a method to do precisely that.
