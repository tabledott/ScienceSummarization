s of the interacting entities), they perform reasonably well even when considered separately.
    In particular, KGC achieved good performance on both data sets.
    This result was not expected on the LLL challenge because this task requires not only to recognize the presence of relationships between entities but also to identify their roles.
    On the other hand, the outcomes of KLC on the AImed data set show that such kernel helps to identify the presence of relationships as well.
    At first glance, it may seem strange that KGC outperforms ERK on AImed, as the latter approach exploits a richer representation: sparse sub-sequences of words, PoS tags, entity and chunk types, or WordNet synsets.
    However, an approach based on n-grams is sufficient to identify the presence of a relationship.
    This result sounds less surprising, if we recall that both approaches cast the relation extraction problem as a text categorization task.
