    In the following section, we discuss the motivation for a Bayesian approach and present our model and search procedure.
    Section 3 gives results illustrating how the parameters of the prior affect results, and Section 4 describes how to infer a good choice of parameters from unlabeled data.
    Section 5 presents results for a range of corpus sizes and dictionary information, and Section 6 concludes.
  
  
    In model-based approaches to unsupervised language learning, the problem is formulated in terms of identifying latent structure from data.
    We define a model with parameters 0, some observed variables w (the linguistic input), and some latent variables t (the hidden structure).
    The goal is to assign appropriate values to the latent variables.
    Standard approaches do so by selecting values for the model parameters, and then choosing the most probable variable assignment based on those parameters.
    For example, maximum-likelihood estimation (MLE) seeks parameters 0&#65533; such tha
