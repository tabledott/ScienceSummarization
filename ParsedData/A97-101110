    The grammar tries to be careful not to introduce false dependencies but for an obvious reason this is not always possible.
    If several syntactic functions of a word have dependency relations, they form a dependency forest.
    Therefore, when the syntactic function is not rashly disambiguated, the correct reading may survive even after illegitimate linking, as the global pruning (Section 5) later extracts dependency links that form consistent trees.
    Links formed between syntactic labels constitute partial trees, usually around verbal nuclei.
    But a new mechanism is needed to make full use of the structural information provided by multiple rules.
    Once a link is formed between labels, it can be used by the other rules.
    For example, when a head of an object phrase (OM) is found and indexed to a verb, the noun phrase to the right (if any) is probably an object complement (CPCOMPL-0).
    It should have the same head as the existing object if the verb has the proper subcategorisation tag (S
