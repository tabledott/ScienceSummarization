TAG derivation steps for "Every politician hates a vegetable." a tin'get expression from a source or vice versa.
			Thus, it can be used to characterize both of these mappings.
			Furthermore, the existence of a parsing algorithm for the base formalism of a synchronous TAG is a sufficient condition for interpreting a synchronous TAG grammar.
			Schabes and Joshi (1988) and Vijay-Shanker and Joshi (1985) provide parsing algorithms for TAGs that could serw:: to parse the base formalism of a synchronous TAG.
			Given such an algorithm, semantic interpretation can be performed by parsing the sentence according to the source grammar; the pairings then determine a deriva- tion in the target language for tile logical form.
			Gen- eration from a logical form proceeds by the converse process of parsing the logical form expression thereby determining the derivation for the natural anguage sen- fence.
			Machine translation proceeds akmg similar lines by mapping two 'FAGs directly (Abeill6 et al, 1990), In previous wor
