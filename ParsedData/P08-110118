ess known-words, and character information is used for unknown words in a similar way to Ng and Low (2004).
    In comparison, our model handles character and word information simultaneously in a single perceptron model.
  
  
    The Chinese Treebank (CTB) 4 is used for the experiments.
    It is separated into two parts: CTB 3 (420K characters in 150K words / 10364 sentences) is used for the final 10-fold cross validation, and the rest (240K characters in 150K words / 4798 sentences) is used as training and test data for development.
    The standard F-scores are used to measure both the word segmentation accuracy and the overall segmentation and tagging accuracy, where the overall accuracy is TF = 2pr/(p + r), with the precision p being the percentage of correctly segmented and tagged words in the decoder output, and the recall r being the percentage of gold-standard tagged words that are correctly identified by the decoder.
    For direct comparison with Ng and Low (2004), the POS tagging accuracy is also
