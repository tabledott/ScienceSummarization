PATR-II formalism&#8212; which is used as the formalism interpreted by the parsing algorithms&#8212;and a formal definition of restriction for PATR-H's nonterminal domain.
    In Section 4, we develop a correct, complete and terminating extension of Earley's algorithm for the PATR-II formalism using the restriction notion.
    Readers uninterested in the technical details of the extensions may want to skip these latter two sections, referring instead to Section 4.1 for an informal overview of the algorithms.
    Finally, in Section 5, we discuss applications of the particular algorithm and the restriction technique in general.
  
  
    Problems with efficiently parsing formalisms based on potentially infinite nonterminal domains have manifested themselves in many different ways.
    Traditional solutions have involved limiting in some way the class of grammars that can be parsed.
    The limitations can be applied to the formalism by, for instance. adding a context-free &amp;quot;backbone.&amp;quot; If we re
