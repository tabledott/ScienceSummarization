  During the early stages of the Penn Treebank project, the initial automatic POS assignment was provided by PARTS (Church 1988), a stochastic algorithm developed at AT&amp;T Bell Labs.
  PARTS uses a modif ied version of the Brown Corpus tagset close to our own and assigns POS tags with an error rate of 3-5%.
  The output of PARTS was automatically tokenized 8 and the tags assigned by PARTS were automatically mapped onto the Penn Treebank tagset.
  This mapp ing  introduces about 4% error, since the Penn Treebank tagset makes certain distinctions that the PARTS tagset does not.
  9 A sample of the resulting tagged text, which has an error rate of 7-9%, is shown in Figure 1.
  More recently, the automatic POS assignment is provided by a cascade of stochastic and rule-driven taggers developed on the basis of our early experience.
  Since these taggers are based on the Penn Treebank tagset, the 4% error rate introduced as an arte
