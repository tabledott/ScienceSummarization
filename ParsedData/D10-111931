c Japanese than the agglutinative Turkish.
    There are also variations in the average number of learned lexical items in the best parses during the final pass of training: 192 for Japanese, 206 for Spanish, 188 for English and 295 for Turkish.
    As compared to the other languages, the morpologically rich Turkish requires significantly more lexical variation to explain the data.
    Finally, there are a number of cases where the UBL algorithm could be improved in future work.
    In cases where there are multiple allowable word orders, the UBL algorithm must learn individual entries for each possibility.
    For example, the following two categories are often learned with high weight for the Japanese word &#8220;chiisai&#8221;: and are treated as distinct entries in the lexicon.
    Similarly, the approach presented here does not model morphology, and must repeatedly learn the correct categories for the Turkish words &#8220;nehri,&#8221; &#8220;nehir,&#8221; &#8220;nehirler,&#8221; and &#8220;nehirlerin&#8
