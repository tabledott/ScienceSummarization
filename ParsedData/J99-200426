ers, nouns, and auxiliary verbs&#8212;is the correct supertag most of the time.
    Also, backing off to the part of speech helps in supertagging unknown words, which most often are nouns.
    The bulk of the errors committed by the unigram model is incorrectly tagged verbs (subcategorization and transformation), prepositions (noun attached vs. verb attached) and nouns (head vs. modifier noun).
    We first explored the use of trigram model of supertag disambiguation in Joshi and Srinivas (1994).
    The trigram model was trained on (part-of-speech, supertag) pairs collected from the LTAG derivations of 5,000 WSJ sentences and tested on 100 WSJ sentences.
    It produced a correct supertag for 68% of the words in the test set.
    A major drawback of this early work was that it used no lexical information in the supertagging process as the training material consisted of (part-of-speech, supertag) pairs.
    Since that early work, we have improved the performance of the model by incorporating lexical informati
