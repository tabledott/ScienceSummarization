20% of the sentences can be discarded.
    Hence, with our algorithm we can achieve at least as high accuracy as the Brown and Gale algorithms without discarding any data.
    This is especially significant since, presumably, the sentences discarded by the Brown and Gale algorithms are those sentences most difficult to align.
    In addition, the errors made by our algorithm are generally of a fairly trivial nature.
    We randomly sampled 300 alignments from the newer Hansard corpus.
    The two errors we found are displayed in Figures 3 and 4.
    In the first error, Ei was aligned with F1 and E2 was aligned with F2.
    The correct alignment maps El and E2 to F1 and F2 to nothing.
    In the second error, E1 was aligned with F1 and F2 was aligned to nothing.
    Both of these errors could have been avoided with improved sentence boundary detection.
    Because length-based alignment algorithms ignore lexical information, their errors can be of a more spectacular nature.
    The rate of alignment ranged fro
