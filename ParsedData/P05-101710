 that a small number of seed words are given.
    In other words, we know beforehand the semantic orientations of those given words.
    We incorporate this small labeled dataset by modifying the previous update rule.
    Instead of QE(x, W) in Equation (2), we use the following function H(Q, x, W) : where [t] is 1 if t is negative, otherwise 0, and xz is calculated with the right-hand-side of Equation (6), where the penalty term &#945;(xi &#8722; ai)2 in Equation (10) is ignored.
    We choose Q that minimizes this value.
    However, when a large amount of labeled data is unavailable, the value of pseudo leave-one-out error rate is not reliable.
    In such cases, we use magnetization m for hyper-parameter prediction: where L is the set of seed words, ai is the orientation of seed word i, and &#945; is a positive constant.
    This expression means that if xi (i E L) is different from ai, the state is penalized.
    Using function H, we obtain the new update rule for xi (i E L) : i and anew iare the average
