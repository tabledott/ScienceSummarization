    Assume that we split the sentences into four phrases: (John , @), (can hit , -IJ T &#136; ), (the ball , oD) and (.
    , .).
    Since a phrase-based decoder generates the translation from left to right, the following steps need to happen when we translate from English to Korean: It is clear that in order for the phrase-based decoder to successfully carry out all of the reordering steps, a very strong reordering model is required.
    When the sentence gets longer with more complex structure, the number of words to move over during decoding can be quite high.
