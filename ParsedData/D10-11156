8), subsuming various earlier proposals.
    Given two vectors u and v, they identify two general classes of composition models, (linear) additive models: where A and B are weight matrices, and multiplicative models: where C is a weight tensor projecting the uv tensor product onto the space of p. Mitchell and Lapata derive two simplified models from these general forms.
    Their simplified additive model p = &#945;u + Qv was a common approach to composition in the earlier literature, typically with the scalar weights set to 1 or to normalizing constants (Foltz et al., 1998; Kintsch, 2001; Landauer and Dumais, 1997).
    Mitchell and Lapata also consider a constrained version of the multiplicative approach that reduces to componentwise multiplication, where the i-th component of the composed vector is given by: pi = uivi.
    The simplified additive model produces a sort of (statistical) union of features, whereas component-wise multiplication has an intersective effect.
    They also evaluate a weighted comb
