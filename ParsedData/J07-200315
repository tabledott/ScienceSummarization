 D: 3 These modules are due to U. Germann and F. J. Och.
    In a previous paper (Chiang et al. 2005) we reported on translation modules for numbers and names.
    The present modules are not the same as those, though the mechanism for integrating them is identical.
    209 Computational Linguistics Volume 33, Number 2 where the &#966;i are features defined on derivations and the &#955;i are feature weights.
    One of the features is an m-gram language model PLM(e); the remainder of the features we will define as products of functions on the rules used in a derivation: The factors other than the language model factor can be put into a particularly convenient form.
    A weighted synchronous CFG is a synchronous CFG together with a function w that assigns weights to rules.
    This function induces a weight function over derivations: It is easy to write dynamic-programming algorithms to find the highest-weight translation or k-best translations with a weighted synchronous CFG.
    Therefore it is problematic
