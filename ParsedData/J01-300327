ssive features is highly significant (N = 59, R = .44, p =-- .001), as is the correlation between the transitive and past participle features (N = 59, R = .36, p = .005).
    (Since, as explained in the next section, our features are expressed as proportions&#8212;e.g., percent transitive use out of detected transitive and intransitive use&#8212;correlations of intransitivity with passive or past participle use have the same magnitude but are negative.) large corpus, given the current state of annotation.
    However, we do assume that currently available corpora, such as the Wall Street Journal (WSJ), provide a representative, and large enough, sample of language from which to gather corpus counts that can approximate the distributional patterns of the verb class alternations.
    Our work draws on two text corpora&#8212;one an automatically tagged combined corpus of 65 million words (primarily WSJ), the second an automatically parsed corpus of 29 million words (a subset of the WSJ text from the first corpus
