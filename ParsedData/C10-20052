ysis classification method for Twitter, whichfirst classifies messages as subjective and ob jective, and further distinguishes the subjectivetweets as positive or negative.
			To reduce the la beling effort in creating these classifiers, instead of using manually annotated data to compose thetraining data, as regular supervised learning ap proaches, we leverage sources of noisy labels asour training data.
			These noisy labels were pro vided by a few sentiment detection websites over twitter data.
			To better utilize these sources, we verify the potential value of using and combining them, providing an analysis of the provided labels, examine different strategies of combining these sources in order to obtain the best outcome; and, propose a more robust feature set that captures a more abstract representation of tweets, composedby meta-information associated to words and spe cific characteristics of how tweets are written.
			By using it, we aim to handle better: the problem of lack of information on tweets,
