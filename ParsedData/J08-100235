of CONT|HOOK of all of the argument signs are percolated to ARGX of the mother.
    In addition, the elements in CONT|RELS are percolated to the mother by the Semantic Principle.
    Compositional semantics usually satisfies the above conditions, including MRS (Copestake et al. 1995, 2006).
    The composition of MRS refers to HOOK, and no internal structures of daughters.
    The Semantic Principle of MRS also assures that all semantic relations in RELS are percolated to the mother.
    When these conditions are satisfied, semantics may include any constraints, such as selectional restrictions, although the grammar we used in the experiments does not include semantic restrictions to constrain parse forests.
    Under these conditions, local structures of predicate&#8211;argument structures are encoded into a conjunctive node when the values of all of its arguments have been instantiated.
    We introduce the notion of inactives to denote such local structures.
    An inactive is a subset of predicate&#8211;a
