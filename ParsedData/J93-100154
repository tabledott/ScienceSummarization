(x) and f (y), respectively, and normalizing by N, the size of the corpus.
    The joint probability, Pr(x,y), is estimated by counting the number of times that x is immediately followed by y in the corpus, f (x , y), and normalizing by N. Unfortunately, mutual information values become unstable if the counts are too small.
    For this reason, small counts (less than 10) are shown in parentheses.
    A dash is used when there is no evidence for the collocation.
    Like Table 7, Table 8 also shows that &amp;quot;more data are better data.&amp;quot; That is, there is plenty of evidence in the larger corpora, but not in the smaller ones.
    &amp;quot;Only a large corpus of natural language enables us to identify recurring patterns in the language and to observe collocational and lexical restrictions accurately....&amp;quot; (Hanks 1990; p. 36) However, in order to make use of this evidence we have to find ways to compensate for the obvious problems of working with unbalanced data.
    For example, in the Cana
