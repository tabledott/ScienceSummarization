vel.1 For example, if an ncmod GR is incorrectly labelled with xmod, but is otherwise correct, it will be correct for all levels which subsume both ncmod and xmod, for example mod.
    The microaveraged scores are calculated by aggregating the counts for all the relations in the hierarchy, including the subsuming relations; the macro-averaged scores are the mean of the individual scores for each relation (Briscoe et al., 2006).
    The results show that the performance of the CCG parser is higher than RASP overall, and also higher on the majority of GR types (especially the more frequent types).
    RASP uses an unlexicalised parsing model and has not been tuned to newspaper text.
    On the other hand it has had many years of development; thus it provides a strong baseline for this test set.
    The overall F-score for the CCG parser, 81.86%, is only 3 points below that for CCGbank, which provides an upper bound for the CCG parser (given the conversion process being used).
