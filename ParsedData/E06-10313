ror measure in quadratic time.
    The new evaluation measure will be investigated and compared to state-of-the-art methods on two translation tasks.
    The correlation with human assessment will be measured for several different statistical MT systems.
    We will see that the new measure significantly outperforms the existing approaches.
    As a further improvement, we will introduce word dependent substitution costs.
    This method will be applicable to the new measure as well as to established measures like WER and PER.
    Starting from the observation that the substitution of a word with a similar one is likely to affect translation quality less than the substitution with a completely different word, we will show how the similarity of words can be accounted for in automatic evaluation measures.
    This paper is organized as follows: In Section 2, we will present the state of the art in MT evaluation and discuss the problem of block reordering.
    Section 3 will introduce the new error measure CDER
