pair.
    For each pair, we compute the Euclidean distance between the original input and its reconstruction: This model of a standard autoencoder is boxed in Fig.
    2.
    Now that we have defined how an autoencoder can be used to compute an n-dimensional vector representation (p) of two n-dimensional children (c1, c2), we can describe how such a network can be used for the rest of the tree.
    Essentially, the same steps repeat.
    Now that y1 is given, we can use Eq.
    2 to compute y2 by setting the children to be (c1, c2) = (x2, y1).
    Again, after computing the intermediate parent vector y2, we can assess how well this vector capture the content of the children by computing the reconstruction error as in Eq.
    4.
    The process repeat until the full tree is constructed and we have a reconstruction error at each nonterminal node.
    This model is similar to the RAAM model (Pollack, 1990) which also requires a fixed tree structure.
    Now, assume there is no tree structure given for the input
