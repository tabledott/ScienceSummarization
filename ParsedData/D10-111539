d based on adjective co-occurrence vectors.
    We conclude that, although our approach does not provide a direct encoding of adjective meaning in terms of such independently collected vectors, it does have meaningful ways to represent their semantic properties.
  
  
    The work we reported constitutes an encouraging start for our approach to modeling (AN) composition.
    We suggested, along the way, various directions for further studies.
    We consider the following issues to be the most pressing ones.
    We currently train each adjective-specific model separately: We should explore hierarchical modeling approaches that exploit similarities across adjectives (and possibly syntactic constructions) to estimate better models.
    Evaluation-wise, the differences between observed and predicted ANs must be analyzed more extensively, to support the claim that, when their vectors differ, model-based prediction improves on the observed vector.
    Evaluation in a more applied task should also be pursued &#8211
