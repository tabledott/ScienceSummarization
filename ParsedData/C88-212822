e meaning).
  Under this parameterization, the architecture serves as a generator for the grammar, generating sentences with the intended meaning.
  By changing the priority function, the order in which possibilities are pursued in generation can be controlled, thereby modeling depth-first strategies, breadth-first strategies, and so forth.
  Of course, as described, this approach to generation is sorely inade- quate for several reasons.
  First, it requires that we initially insert the entire lexicon into the agenda t arbitrary numbers of string positions.
  Not only is it infeasible to insert the lexicon so many times (indeed, even once is too much) but it also leads to massive redundancy in generation.
  The same phrase may be generated starting at many dif- ferent positions.
  For parsing, keeping track of which positions phrases occur at is advantageous; for generation, once a phrase is generated, we want to be able to use it in a variety of places.
  A simple solution to this problem is to ignore the st
