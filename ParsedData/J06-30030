    are at least two kinds of similarity. similarity correspondence between rein contrast with which is correspondence between attributes. two words have a high degree of attributional similarity, we call them When two pairs of words have a high degree of relational similarity, we say that their relations are For example, the word pair mason:stone is analogous to the pair carpenter:wood.
    This article introduces Latent Relational Analysis (LRA), a method for measuring relational similarity.
    LRA has potential applications in many areas, including information extraction, word sense disambiguation, and information retrieval.
    Recently the Vector Space Model (VSM) of information retrieval has been adapted to measuring relational similarity, achieving a score of 47% on a collection of 374 college-level multiple-choice word analogy questions.
    In the VSM approach, the relation between a pair of words is characterized by a vector offrequencies of predefined pattern
