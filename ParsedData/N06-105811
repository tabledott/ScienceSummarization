    We represent context by n-grams and local collocations, features typically used in supervised word sense disambiguation.
    Both n-grams and collocations exclude the word wj.
    An n-gram is a sequence of n adjacent words appearing in r1 ... ri&#8722;10ri+1 ... rm.
    A local collocation also takes into account the position of an n-gram with respect to the target word.
    To compute local collocations for a word at position i, we extract all n-grams (n = 1... 4) beginning at position i &#8722; 2 and ending at position i + 2.
    To make these position dependent, we prepend each of them with the length and starting position.
    Once the classifier3 for wj is trained, we apply it to the context r1 ... ri&#8722;1&#10065;ri+1 ... rm.
    For positive predictions, we rewrite the string as r1 ... ri&#8722;1wjri+1 ... rm.
    In this formulation, all substitutions are tested independently.
    For the example from Table 2, only the pair (difficult, hard) passes this filter, a
