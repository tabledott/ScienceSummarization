993) and also to the probabilistic model.
    Since we use the same data and methodology as in earlier work, some detail is omitted in the subsequent discussion but full details and rationale can be found in Weeds and Weir (2003).
    Pseudo-disambiguation tasks (e.g.
    Lee, 1999) have become a standard evaluation technique and, in the current context, we may use a word's neighbours to decide which of two cooccurrences is the most likely.
    Although pseudo-disambiguation itself is an artificial task, it has relevance in at least two real application areas.
    First, by replacing occurrences of a particular word in a test suite with a pair or set of words from which a technique must choose, we recreate a simplified version of the word sense disambiguation task; that is, choosing between a fixed number of homonyms based on local context.
    The second is in language modelling where we wish to estimate the probability of co-occurrences of events but, due to the sparse data problem, it is often the case tha
