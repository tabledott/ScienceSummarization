 feature selection, whereas NB performs best with some feature selection ( ).
    We will investigate the effect of more elaborate feature selection schemes on the performance of different learning algorithms for WSD in future work.
    Also, using the combination of four knowledge sources gives better performance than using any single individual knowledge source for most algorithms.
    On the SENSEVAL-2 test set, SVM achieves 65.4% (all 4 knowledge sources), 64.8% (remove syntactic relations), 61.8% (further remove POS), and 60.5% (only collocations) as knowledge sources are removed one at a time.
    Before concluding, we note that the SENSEVAL2 participating system UMD-SST (Cabezas et al., 2001) also used SVM, with surrounding words and local collocations as features.
    However, they reported recall of only 56.8%.
    In contrast, our implementation of SVM using the two knowledge sources of surrounding words and local collocations achieves recall of 61.8%.
