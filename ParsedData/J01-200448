igure 5 shows the reduction in parser error, 1 LR---LP , and the reduction in rule expansions considered as the conditioning information increased.
    The bulk of the improvement comes from simply conditioning on the labels of the parent and the closest sibling to the node being expanded.
    Interestingly, conditioning all POS expansions on two c-commanding heads made no difference in accuracy compared to conditioning only leftmost POS expansions on a single c-commanding head; but it did improve the efficiency.
    These results, achieved using very straightforward conditioning events and considering only the left context, are within one to four points of the best published Observed running time on Section 23 of the Penn Treebank, with the full conditional probability model and beam of 10-11, using one 300 MHz UltraSPARC processor and 256MB of RAM of a Sun Enterprise 450. accuracies cited above.'
    Of the 2,416 sentences in the section, 728 had the totally correct parse, 30.1 percent tree accuracy.
