ncorporated into the semantic interpretation of larger expressions, including explicit methods for type coercion.
    Finally, I discussed how these richer lexical representations can be used to generate projective inheritance structures that connect the conceptual information associated with lexical items to the global conceptual lexicon.
    This suggests a way of accounting for relations such as coherence and the prototypicality of a predication.
    Although much of what I have presented here is incomplete and perhaps somewhat programmatic, I firmly believe this approach can help clarify the nature of word meaning and compositionality in natural language, and at the same time bring us closer to understanding the creative use of word senses.
