es, for example).
    As an example, the following sentences might be derivable from a lexical entry for English 'be': Likewise, the following for German `Buch': Values are the principal 'results' of a DATR description: the most typical operation is to determine the value associated (by an extensional sentence) with some node/path pair.
    The right-hand sides of definitional sentences are lvalues, which can be simple atoms, inheritance descriptors (quoted or unquoted), or lists of lvalues.
    An atom is primitive, an inheritance descriptor specifies where the required value can be inherited from, and lists allow arbitrary structures to be built as values.
    Inheritance descriptors come in several forms with two dimensions of variation.
    The unquoted/quoted distinction specifies whether the inheritance context is local (the most recent context employed) or global (the initial context employed).
    Once the context is established, the descriptor specifies a new node, a new lpath, or both to be used to
