n for our Champollion translates single words or collocations in one language into collocations (including single word translations) in a second language using the aligned corpus as a reference database.
    Before running Champollion there are two steps that must be carried out: source and target language sentences of the database corpus must be aligned and a list of collocations to be translated must be provided in the source language.
    For our experiments, we used corpora that had been aligned by Gale and Church's sentence alignment program (Gale and Church 1991b) as our input data.8 Since our intent in this paper is to evaluate Champollion, we tried not to introduce errors into the training data; for this purpose, we kept only the 1-1 alignments.
    Indeed, more complex sentence alignments tend to have a much higher alignment error rate (Gale and Church 1991b).
    By doing so, we lost an estimated 10% of the text (Brown, Lai, and Mercer 1991), which was not problematic since we had enough data.
