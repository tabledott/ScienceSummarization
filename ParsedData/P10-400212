ation performs inference over the full hypergraph structure (Kumar et al., 2009).
    In particular, by defining a semiring whose values are sets of line segments, having an addition operation equivalent to union, and a multiplication operation equivalent to a linear transformation of the line segments, Och&#8217;s line search can be computed simply using the INSIDE algorithm.
    Since the translation hypergraphs generated by cdec may be quite large making inference expensive, the logic for constructing error surfaces is factored according to the MapReduce programming paradigm (Dean and Ghemawat, 2004), enabling parallelization across a cluster of machines.
    Implementations of the BLEU and TER loss functions are provided (Papineni et al., 2002; Snover et al., 2006).
    In addition to the widely used MERT algorithm, cdec also provides a training pipeline for discriminatively trained probabilistic translation models (Blunsom et al., 2008; Blunsom and Osborne, 2008).
    In these models, the translation mod
