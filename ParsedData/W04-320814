    This might be due to the fact that EM estimation at each intermediate step is not reliable, since we only have a small amount of aligned sentences that are truly parallel.
    The EM learner is therefore weak when applied to bilingual sentences from very-non-parallel corpus.
    We decided to try using parallel corpora to initialize the EM estimation, as in Zhao and Vogel (2002).
    The results are discussed in Section 6.
    This step augments the earlier matched documents by the &#8220;find-one-get-more&#8221; principle.
    From the set of aligned sentence pairs, we look for other documents, judged to be dissimilar in the first step, that contain one or more of these sentence pairs.
    We further find other documents that are similar to each of the monolingual documents found.
    This new set of documents is likely to be off-topic, yet contains segments that are on-topic.
    Following our new alignment principle, we believe that these documents might still contain more parallel sentence candid
