icate.
    They cannot take into account the features of other argument nodes, because they are only given the input (parse tree), and the identity of the argument nodes is unknown.
    It is conceivable that a local model could condition on the features of all nodes in the tree but the number of parameters (features) would be extremely large.
    The joint syntactic&#8211;semantic features proposed here encode important dependencies using a very small number of parameters, as we will show in Section 5.4.
    We should note that Xue and Palmer (2004) define a similar feature template, called syntactic frame, which often captures similar information.
    The important difference is that their template extracts contextual information from noun phrases surrounding the predicate, rather than from the sequence of argument nodes.
    Because we use a joint model, we are able to use information about other argument nodes when labeling a node.
    Repetition Features.
    We also add features that detect repetitions
