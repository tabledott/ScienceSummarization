SSN-Tags&#8221;) includes no words in the vocabulary, relying completely on the information provided by the part-of-speech tags of the words.
    The second model (&#8220;SSN-Freq 200&#8221;) uses all tag-word pairs which occur at least 200 times in the training set.
    The remaining words were all treated as instances of the unknown-word.
    This resulted in a vocabulary size of 512 tag-word pairs.
    The third model (&#8220;SSN-Freq 20&#8221;) thresholds the vocabulary at 20 instances in the training set, resulting in 4242 tag-word pairs.
    3 We determined appropriate training parameters and network size based on intermediate validation results and our previous experience with networks similar to the models SSN-Tags and SSN-Freq 200.
    We trained two or three networks for each of the three vocabulary sizes and chose the best ones based on their validation performance.
    Training times vary but are long, being around 4 days for a SSN-Tags model, 6 days for a SSN-Freq 200 model, and 10 days for a SSN
