esigned to negate the effects of subordinationwhen both candidate and anaphor ap- pear in the same subordinate context, the assumption being that the prominence of a candidate should be de- termined with respect o the position of the anaphor.
			This is a point of difference between our algorithm and the one described in (Lappin and Leass, 1994).
			The salience of a candidate which is determined tobe in the same subordinate context as a pronoun (determined as a function of precedence r lations and EMBED and ADJUNCT values) is temporarily increased to the level it would have were the candidate not in the subordi- nate context; the level is returned to normal after the anaphor is resolved.
			The parallelism heuristic rewards candidates which are such that the pair consisting of the GFUN values of candidate and anaphor are identical to GFUN values of a previously identified anaphor-antecedent pair.
			This parallelism heuristic differs from a similar one used by the Lappin/Leass algorithm, which rewards candi-
