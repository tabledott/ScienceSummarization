l and Castellan 1988).
    These different values can lead to contradictory conclusions on intercoder agreement.
    Moreover, the assumption of equal distributions over the categories masks the exact source of disagreement among the coders.
    Thus, such an assumption is detrimental if such systematic disagreements are to be used to improve the coding scheme (Wiebe, Bruce, and O&#8217;Hara 1999).
    Second, &#954; is affected by skewed distributions of categories (the prevalence problem) and by the degree to which the coders disagree (the bias problem).
    That is, for a fixed P(A), the values of &#954; vary substantially in the presence of prevalence, bias, or both.
    We will conclude by suggesting that &#954;Co is a better choice than &#954;S&amp;C in those studies in which the assumption of equal distributions underlying &#954;S&amp;C does not hold: the vast majority, if not all, of discourse- and dialogue-tagging efforts.
    However, as &#954;Co suffers from the bias problem but &#954;S&amp;C does
