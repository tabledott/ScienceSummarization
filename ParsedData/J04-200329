    No feature selection or threshold was applied: All features seen in training were used. lexicon models is depicted in Figure 1.
    This figure includes the possibility of using restructuring operations as suggested in Section 3 in order to deal with structural differences between the languages involved.
    This can be especially advantageous in the case of multiword phrases which jointly fulfill a syntactic function: Not merging them 2 Of course, there is not only one set of relevant tags, but at least one per part of speech.
    In order to keep the notation as simple as possible, this fact is not accounted for in the formulas and the textual descriptions.
