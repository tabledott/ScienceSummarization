 Observe, for instance website and Webseite.
    This is even more the case for words that can be traced back to common language roots, such as friend and Freund, or president and Pr&#168;asident.
    Still, these words &#8211; often called cognates &#8211; maintain a very similar spelling.
    This can be defined as differing in very few letters.
    This measurement can be formalized as the number of letters common in sequence between the two words, divided by the length of the longer word.
    The example word pair friend and freund shares 5 letters (fr-e-nd), and both words have length 6, hence there spelling similarity is 5/6, or 0.83.
    This measurement is called longest common subsequence ratio [Melamed, 1995].
    In related work, string edit distance (or, Levenshtein distance) has been used [Mann and Yarowski, 2001].
    With this computational means at hand, we can now measure the spelling similarity between every German and English word, and sort possible word pairs accordingly.
