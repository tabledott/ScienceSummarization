adaptation of existing resources to new applications and domains.
    The system aims to identify the parameters relevant to the creation of a name recognition system across different types of variability such as changes in domain, genre and media.
    For example, less formal texts may not follow standard capitalisation, punctuation and spelling formats, which can be a problem for many generic NE systems.
    Current evaluations with this system average around 93% precision and 95% recall across a variety of text types.
    The MUSE system has also been adapted to take part in the current ACE (Automatic Content Extraction) program run by NIST.
    This requires systems to perform recognition and tracking tasks of named, nominal and pronominal entities and their mentions across three types of clean news text (newswire, broadcast news and newspaper) and two types of degraded news text (OCR output and ASR output).
