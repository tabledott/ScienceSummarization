e few problem sentences can be accurately translated to logical form, and because logical entailment is a strict standard, recall tends to be poor.
    The simple graph matching formulation of the problem belies three important issues.
    First, the above systems assume a form of upward monotonicity: if a good match is found with a part of the text, other material in the text is assumed not to affect the validity of the match.
    But many situations lack this upward monotone character.
    Consider variants on ID 98.
    Suppose the hypothesis were Arafat targeted for assassination.
    This would allow a perfect graph match or zero-cost weighted abductive proof, because the hypothesis is a subgraph of the text.
    However, this would be incorrect because it ignores the modal operator could.
    Information that changes the validity of a proof can also exist outside a matching clause.
    Consider the alternate text Sharon denies Arafat is targeted for assassination.1 The second issue is the assumption of
