  i=1 Prob(Si = ci) (3) where the linguistic and structural constraints are represented by the filter F .
  In other words, this objective function reflects the expected number of correct argument predic- tions, subject to the constraints.
  When there are two or more argument classifiers from different SRL systems, a joint inference procedure can take the output estimated probabilities for all these candidates as input, although some candidates may refer to the same phrases in the sentence.
  For example, Figure 3 shows the two candidate sets for a fragment of a sentence, ..., traders say, unable to cool the selling panic in both stocks and futures.
  In this example, system A has two argument candidates, a1 = traders and a4 = the selling panic in both stocks and futures; system B has three argument candidates, b1 = traders, b2 = the selling panic, and b3 = in both stocks and futures.
  A straightforward solution to the combination is to treat each argument produced by a system as a possible outpu
