setsu (B1) in its pre-conjunct as also depending on the bunsetsu (131) in its post-conjunct corresponding to B, (Figure 14d) (we think B, corresponds to B1 when the path specifying these conjuncts contains an element a(i,j)).
    A CS that satisfies the following two conditions is called a strong CS: For example, in the sentence in Figure 15, the detected CS [TASUKE-NI(a help).
    &#8226; ARE-BA(sometimesbe),]- [SAMATAGE-NI(an obstacle).
    &#8226; .ARU(sometimesbe).] satisfies the above two conditions.
    Thus, by checking the relation between the CS and the outside modifier phrase &amp;quot;SONO KAIHATSU-NO(to its development)&amp;quot; the phrase is considered to depend on both of the bunsetsus &amp;quot;TASUKE-NI(a help)&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;SAMATAGE-NI(an obstacle).&amp;quot; In the same way, &amp;quot;COMPUTER-NO ARCHITECTURE-GA(the architecture of a computer)&amp;quot; is again thought to depend on both the bunsetsu &amp;quot;NARU(be)&amp;quot; in the preconjunct and the bunsetsu &amp;quot;NARU(b
