erm investments (SBAR because the market is down), in which an SBAR headed by that is a complement, but an SBAR headed by because is an adjunct.
    A second reason for incorporating the complement/adjunct distinction into the parsing model is that this may help parsing accuracy.
    The assumption that complements are generated independently of one another often leads to incorrect parses.
    (See Figure 6 for examples.)
    In addition, the first child following the head of a prepositional phrase is marked as a complement.
    3.2.2 Probabilities over Subcategorization Frames.
    Model 1 could be retrained on training data with the enhanced set of nonterminals, and it might learn the lexical properties that distinguish complements and adjuncts (IBM vs. week, or that vs. because).
    It would still suffer, however, from the bad independence assumptions illustrated in Figure 6.
    To solve these kinds of problems, the generative process is extended to include a probabilistic choice of left and right subcat
