ribution of word senses.
    Even systems which show superior performance to this heuristic often make use of the heuristic where evidence from the context is not sufficient (Hoste et al., 2001).
    Whilst a first sense heuristic based on a sense-tagged corpus such as SemCor is clearly useful, there is a strong case for obtaining a first, or predominant, sense from untagged corpus data so that a WSD system can be tuned to the genre or domain at hand.
    SemCor comprises a relatively small sample of 250,000 words.
    There are words where the first sense in WordNet is counter-intuitive, because of the size of the corpus, and because where the frequency data does not indicate a first sense, the ordering is arbitrary.
    For example the first sense of tiger in WordNet is audacious person whereas one might expect that carnivorous animal is a more common usage.
    There are only a couple of instances of tiger within SemCor.
    Another example is embryo, which does not occur at all in SemCor and the first sen
