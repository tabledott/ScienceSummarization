d on Markov models, the lexicon consists of probabilities of the somewhat counterintuitive but proper form P(WORD I TAG).
    In the transformationbased tagger, the lexicon is simply a list of all tags seen for a word in the training corpus, with one tag labeled as the most likely.
    Below we show a lexical entry for the word half in the transformation-based tagger.1&#176; half: CD DT JJ NN PDT RB VB This entry lists the seven tags seen for half in the training corpus, with NN marked as the most likely.
    Below are the lexical entries for half in a Markov model tagger, extracted from the same corpus: It is difficult to make much sense of these entries in isolation; they have to be viewed in the context of the many contextual probabilities.
    First, we will describe a nonlexicalized version of the tagger, where transformation templates do not make reference to specific words.
    In the nonlexicalized tagger, the transformation templates we use are: Change tag a to tag b when: where a, b, z and w are var
