rticles are prefixed to one another and onto an open-class category gives rise to a distinct sort of morphological ambiguity: space-delimited tokens may be ambiguous between several different segmentation possibilities.
    The same form fmnh can be segmented as f-mnh, f (&#8220;that&#8221;) functioning as a reletivizer with the form mnh.
    The form mnh itself can be read as at least three different verbs (&#8220;counted&#8221;, &#8220;appointed&#8221;, &#8220;was appointed&#8221;), a noun (&#8220;a portion&#8221;), and a possessed noun (&#8220;her kind&#8221;).
    Such ambiguities cause discrepancies between token boundaries (indexed as white spaces) and constituent boundaries (imposed by syntactic categories) with respect to a surface form.
    Such discrepancies can be aligned via an intermediate level of PoS tags.
    PoS tags impose a unique morphological segmentation on surface tokens and present a unique valid yield for syntactic trees.
    The correct ambiguity resolution of the syntactic level the
