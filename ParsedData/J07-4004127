bank dependencies when compared with DepBank; the simple post-processing rules have increased the F-score from 77.86% to 84.76%.
    However, note that this F-score provides an upper bound on the performance of the CCG parser, and that this score is still below the F-scores reported earlier when evaluating the parser output against CCGbank.
    Section 11.4 contains more discussion of this issue.
  
  
    The results in Table 16 were obtained by parsing the sentences from CCGbank corresponding to those in the 560-sentence test set used by Briscoe, Carroll, and Watson (2006).
    We used the CCGbank sentences because these differ in some ways from the original Penn Treebank sentences (there are no quotation marks in CCGbank, for example) and the parser has been trained on CCGbank.
    Even here we experienced some unexpected difficulties, because some of the tokenization is different between DepBank and CCGbank (even though both resources are based on the Penn Treebank), and there are some sentences in DepBan
