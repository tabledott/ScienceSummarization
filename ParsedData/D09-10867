&#8220;begun&#8221; are siblings in English and not in direct dependency, the QG features still leverage this indirect projection.
    We start by describing the features we use to augment conditional and generative parsers when scoring pairs of trees (&#167;2).
    Then we discuss in turn monolingual (&#167;3) and cross-lingual (&#167;4) parser adaptation.
    Finally, we present experiments on cross-lingual parser projection in conditions when no target language trees are available for training (&#167;5) and when some trees are available (&#167;6).
  
  
    What should our model of source and target trees look like?
    In our view, traditional approaches based on synchronous grammar are problematic both computationally and linguistically.
    Full inference takes O(n6) time or worse (depending on the grammar formalism).
    Yet synchronous models only consider a limited hypothesis space: e.g., parses must be projective, and alignments must decompose according to the recursive parse structure.
