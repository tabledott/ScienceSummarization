    The named entities in the same cluster may be considered similar to each other, so we will select the named entities from different clusters at one time.
    We employ a Kmeans clustering algorithm (Jelinek 1997), which is shown in Figure 1.
    The number of clusters is K Initialization: Randomly equally partition {NE1, ..., NEN} into K initial clusters Cj (j = 1, ... , K).
    Loop until the number of changes for the centroids of all clusters is less than a threshold In each round, we need to compute the pairwise similarities within each cluster to get the centroid of the cluster.
    And then, we need to compute the similarities between each example and all centroids to repartition the examples.
    So, the algorithm is time-consuming.
    Based on the assumption that N examples are uniformly distributed between the K clusters, the time complexity of the algorithm is about O(N2/K+NK) (Tang et al. 2002).
    In one of our experiments, the size of the NESet (N) is around 1
