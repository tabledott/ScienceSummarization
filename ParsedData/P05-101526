    But since you ask: we temporarily turned a blind eye to this serious issue, creating a collection of 5394 reviews by 496 authors with at most 80 reviews per author, where we pretended that our rating conversions mapped correctly into a universal rating scheme.
    Preliminary results on this dataset were actually comparable to the results reported above, although since we are not confident in the class labels themselves, more work is needed to derive a clear analysis of this setting.

    Q: How about trying &#8212; A: &#8212;Yes, there are many alternatives.
    A few that we tested are described in the Appendix, an
