embeddings, nominal constructions, etc.
    Average sentence length was 23.7 words.
    Parses for the English sentences were constructed by a process of automatic analysis followed by hand correction; output trees from a broad-coverage lexicalized English parser (Collins, 1997) were automatically converted into dependencies to be corrected.
    The goldstandard dependency analyses for the Chinese sentences were constructed manually by two fluent speakers of Chinese, working independently and using the Chinese Treebank's (manually constructed) constituency parses for reference.4 Inter-annotator agreement ort unlabeled syntactic dependencies is 92.4%.
    Manual EnglishChinese alignments were constructed by two annotators who are native speakers of Chinese using a software environment similar to that described by Melamed (1998).
    The direct projection of English dependencies to Chinese yielded poor results as measured by precision and recall over unlabeled syntactic dependencies: precision was 30.1% and rec
