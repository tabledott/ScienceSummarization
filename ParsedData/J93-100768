e the variety of a given corpus by: 0 corpus &#8212; E(f(w)/S) log(f (w) /S) w in which f (w) is the frequency of appearance of the word w in the corpus and S is the total number of different word forms in the corpus.
    In addition, to be fair in our comparison of the three corpora, we have used three (sub)corpora of about one million words for DJ, NYT, and Brown.
    The 1 million&#8212;word Brown corpus (Francis and Ktit'era 1982) contains 43,300 different words, of which only 1091 are repeated more than 100 times.
    The 0 of the Brown corpus is: &#176;Brown = 10.5.
    In comparison, the size of DJ is 8,000,000.
    It contains 59,233 different words of which 5,367 are repeated more than 100 times.
    DJ 0 ratio is: ODJ = 9.6.
    And the 0 ratio of NYT which contains stories pertaining to various domains has been estimated at ONyT = 10.4.
    According to this measure, DJ is much more focused than both the Brown Corpus and NYT because the difference in variety is 1 in the logarithmic scale.
