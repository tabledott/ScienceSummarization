    The part of the HPSG system that uses the centering algorithm for pronoun binding is called the pragmatics processor.
    It interacts with another module called the semantics processor, which computes representations of intrasentential anaphoric relations, (among other things).
    The semantics processor has access to information such as the surface syntactic structure of the utterance.
    It provides the pragmatics processor with representations which include of a set of reference markers.
    Each reference marker is contraindexed2 with expressions with which it cannot co-specify3.
    Reference markers also carry information about agreement and grammatical function.
    Each pronominal reference marker has a unique index from A1, , An and is displayed in the figures in the form [POLLARD:Al], where POLLARD is the semantic representation of the co-specifier.
    For non-pronominal reference markers the surface string is used as the index.
    Indices for indefinites are gen
