 the multi-prototype approach: as the number of clusters increases, the number of occurrences assigned to each cluster decreases, increasing noise and resulting in some poor prototypes that mainly cover outliers.
    The word similarity task is somewhat robust to this phenomenon, but synonym prediction is more affected since only the top predicted choice is used.
    When raters are forced to chose between the top three predictions for each method (presented as top set in Figure 3 left), the effect of this noise is reduced and the multi-prototype approach remains dominant even for a large number of clusters.
    This indicates that although more clusters can capture finer-grained sense distinctions, they also can introduce noise.
    When presented with words in context (Figure 3 right),7 raters found no significant difference in the two methods for words used in their majority sense.8 However, when a minority sense is presented (e.g. the &#8220;prison&#8221; sense of cell), raters prefer the choice predicted
