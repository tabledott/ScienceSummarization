omplicated for language pairs that employ very different alphabets and sound systems, such as Japanese/English and Arabic/English.
    Phonetic translation across these pairs is called transliteration.
    We will look at Japanese/English transliteration in this paper.
    Japanese frequently imports vocabulary from other languages, primarily (but not exclusively) from English.
    It has a special phonetic alphabet called katakana, which is used primarily (but not exclusively) to write down foreign names and loanwords.
    To write a word like golfbag in katakana, some compromises must be made.
    For example, Japanese has no distinct L and Ft sounds: the two English sounds collapse onto the same Japanese sound.
    A similar compromise must be struck for English II and F. Also, Japanese generally uses an alternating consonant-vowel structure, making it impossible to pronounce LFB without intervening vowels.
