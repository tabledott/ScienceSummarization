of both subjective and objective sentences.
    Subjective texts often include some factual information.
    For example, editorial articles frequently contain factual information to back up the arguments being made, and movie reviews often mention the actors and plot of a movie as well as the theatres where it&#8217;s currently playing.
    Even if one is willing to discard subjective texts in their entirety, the objective texts usually contain a great deal of subjective information in addition to facts.
    For example, newspaper articles are generally considered to be relatively objective documents, but in a recent study (Wiebe et al., 2001) 44% of sentences in a news collection were found to be subjective (after editorial and review articles were removed).
    One of the main obstacles to producing a sentencelevel subjectivity classifier is a lack of training data.
    To train a document-level classifier, one can easily find collections of subjective texts, such as editorials and reviews.
