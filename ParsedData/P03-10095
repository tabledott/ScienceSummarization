me low frequency verbs were included to investigate the effect of sparse data on clustering performance.
    To ensure that our gold standard covers all (or most) senses of these verbs, we looked into WordNet (Miller, 1990) and assigned all the WordNet senses of the verbs to gold standard classes.2 Two versions of the gold standard were created: monosemous and polysemic.
    The monosemous one lists only a single sense for each test verb, that corresponding to its predominant (most frequent) sense in WordNet.
    The polysemic one provides a comprehensive list of senses for each verb.
    The test verbs and their classes are shown in table 1.
    The classes are indicated by number codes from the classifications of Levin, Dorr (the classes starting with 0) and Korhonen (the classes starting with A).3 The predominant sense is indicated by bold font.
  
  
    We obtain our SCF data using the subcategorization acquisition system of Briscoe and Carroll (1997).
    We expect the use of this system to be beneficia
