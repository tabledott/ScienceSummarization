rmance on a training sample is all very well, but what does this guarantee about how well the algorithm generalizes to newly drawn test examples?
    Freund and Schapire (1999) discuss how the theory for classification problems can be extended to deal with both of these questions; Collins (2002) describes how these results apply to NLP problems.
    As a final note, following Collins (2002), we used the averaged parameters from the training algorithm in decoding test examples in our experiments.
    Say &#175;&#945;ti is the parameter vector after the i&#8217;th example is processed on the t&#8217;th pass through the data in the algorithm in figure 1.
    Then the averaged parameters &#175;&#945;AV G are defined as &#175;&#945;AV G = Ei,t &#175;&#945;ti/NT.
    Freund and Schapire (1999) originally proposed the averaged parameter method; it was shown to give substantial improvements in accuracy for tagging tasks in Collins (2002).
    This section gives a description of the basic incremental parsing approach.
