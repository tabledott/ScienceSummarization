tandard dependency structure.
    We will refer to such derivations as correct derivations.
    Figure 1 gives an algorithm for finding nodes in a packed chart which appear in correct derivations. cdeps(c) is the number of correct dependencies on conjunctive node c, and takes the value &#8722;1 if there are any incorrect dependencies on c. dmax(c) is the maximum number of correct dependencies produced by any sub-derivation headed by c, and takes the value &#8722;1 if there are no sub-derivations producing only correct dependencies. dmax(d) is the same value but for disjunctive node d. Recursive definitions for calculating these values are given in Figure 1; the base case occurs when conjunctive nodes have no disjunctive daughters.
    The algorithm identifies all those root nodes heading derivations which produce just the correct dependencies, and traverses the chart top-down marking the nodes in those derivations.
    The insight behind the algorithm is that, for two conjunctive nodes in the same equivalence
