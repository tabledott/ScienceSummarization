tags annotated by the Brill tagger(Brill, 1995).
    Base NP large data set (baseNP-L) This data set consists of 20 sections (02-21) of the WSJ part of the Penn Treebank for the training data, and one section (00) for the test data.
    POS tags in this data sets are also annotated by the Brill tagger.
    We omit the experiments IOB1 and IOE1 representations for this training data since the data size is too large for our current SVMs learning program.
    In case of IOB1 and IOE1, the size of training data for one classifier which estimates the class I and O becomes much larger compared with IOB2 and IOE2 models.
    In addition, we also omit to estimate the voting weights using cross validation method due to a large amount of training cost.
    Chunking data set (chunking) This data set was used for CoNLL-2000 shared task(Tjong Kim Sang and Buchholz, 2000).
