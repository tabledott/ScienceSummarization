ccept the intersection of the sets of tape pairs accepted by an arbitrary set of transducers.
    It is, for example, easy to design a transducer that will map a string of x's onto the same number of y's followed by an arbitrary number of z's.
    It is equally easy to design one that maps a string of x's onto the same number of z's preceded by an arbitrary number of x's.
    The intersection of these sets contains those pairs with some number of x's on one tape, and that same number of y's followed by the same number of z's on the other tape.
    The set of second tapes therefore contains a context-free language which it is clearly not within the power of any finite-state device to generate.
    Koskenniemi overcame this objection in his original work by adopting the view that all the transducers in the parallel configuration should share the same pair or read-write heads.
    The effect of this is to insist that they not only accept the same pairs of tapes, but that they agree on the particular sequence of
