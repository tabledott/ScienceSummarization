o compute the baseline performance, the baseline &#8220;system&#8221; provided for the task consisted solely of a software to extract features, as opposed to a model built using the regression algorithm.
    The rationale behind this decision was to encourage participants to experiment with alternative methods for combining different quality indicators.
    This was achieved to a large extent.
    The best-performing machine learning techniques were found to be the M5P Regression Trees and the SVM Regression (SVR) models.
    The merit of the M5P Regression Trees is that it provides compact models that are less prone to overfitting.
    In contrast, the SVR models can easily overfit given the small amount of training data available and the large numbers of features commonly used.
    Indeed, many of the submissions that fell below the baseline performance can blame overfitting for (part of) their suboptimal performance.
    However, SVR models can achieve high performance through the use of tuning and feature
