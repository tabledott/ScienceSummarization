	Deterministic Dependency Parsing Of English Text
		This paper presents a deterministic dependency parser based on memory-based learning, which parses English text in linear time.
		When trainedand evaluated on the Wall Street Journal sec tion of the Penn Treebank, the parser achieves a maximum attachment score of 87.1%.
		Unlikemost previous systems, the parser produces la beled dependency graphs, using as arc labels a combination of bracket labels and grammaticalrole labels taken from the Penn Treebank II annotation scheme.
		The best overall accuracy ob tained for identifying both the correct head and the correct arc label is 86.0%, when restricted to grammatical role labels (7 labels), and 84.4% for the maximum set (50 labels).
	
	
			There has been a steadily increasing interest in syntactic parsing based on dependency analysis in re cent years.
			One important reason seems to be thatdependency parsing offers a good compromise be tween the conflicting demands of analysis depth, on the one hand, and rob
