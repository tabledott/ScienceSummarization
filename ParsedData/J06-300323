   Rosario and Hearst (2001) and Rosario, Hearst, and Fillmore (2002) classify nounmodifier relations in the medical domain, using Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) and Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) as lexical resources for representing each noun-modifier pair with a feature vector.
    They trained a neural network to distinguish 13 classes of semantic relations.
    Nastase and Szpakowicz (2003) explore a similar approach to classifying general noun-modifier pairs (i.e., not restricted to a particular domain, such as medicine), using WordNet and Roget&#8217;s Thesaurus as lexical resources.
    Vanderwende (1994) used hand-built rules, together with a lexical knowledge base, to classify noun-modifier pairs.
    None of these approaches explicitly involved measuring relational similarity, but any classification of semantic relations necessarily employs some implicit notion of relational similarity since members of the same class must be relationally similar to some extent.
