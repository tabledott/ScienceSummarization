scores of the other two applications are not high.
    The percentages of label &#8220;3&#8221; are around 30%.
    The main reason is that the average numbers of unit replacements for these two applications are much larger than sentence similarity computation.
    It is thus more likely to bring in incorrect unit replacements, which influence the quality of the generated paraphrases.
    The usability is needed to be manually labeled only for sentence simplification, since it can be automatically labeled in the other two applications.
    As shown in Table 1, for sentence simplification, most paraphrases are labeled &#8220;2&#8221; in usability, while merely less than 20% are labeled &#8220;3&#8221;.
    We conjecture that it is because the raters are not sensitive to the slight change of the simplification degree.
    Thus they labeled &#8220;2&#8221; in most cases.
    We compute the kappa statistic between the raters.
    Kappa is defined as K = P(A)&#8722;P(E) (Car1&#8722;P(E)letta, 1996), where P(A) is
