    We will call these coefficients multi-&#960; and multi-&#954;, respectively, dropping the multi-prefixes when no confusion is expected to arise.5 2.5.1 Fleiss&#8217;s Multi-&#960;.
    With more than two coders, the observed agreement Ao can no longer be defined as the percentage of items on which there is agreement, because inevitably there will be items on which some coders agree and others disagree.
    The solution proposed in the literature is to measure pairwise agreement (Fleiss 1971): Define the amount of agreement on a particular item as the proportion of agreeing judgment pairs out of the total number of judgment pairs for that item.
    Multiple coders also pose a problem for the visualization of the data.
    When the number of coders c is greater than two, judgments cannot be shown in a contingency table like Table 1, because each coder has to be represented in a separate dimension.
    Fleiss (1971) therefore uses a different type of table which lists eac
