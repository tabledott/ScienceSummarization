t that there are many more verbs that do not allow consonant doubling, listing the verbs that do is the most economic solution.
    An added benefit is that if a lemma does allow consonant doubling but is not included in the list then the word form generated will still be correct with respect to American English.
    The morphological generator comprises a set of of approximately 1,650 rules expressing morphological regularities, subregularities, and exceptions for specific words; also around 350 lines of C/Flex code for program initialisation and defining the functions called by the rule actions.
    The rule set is in fact obtained by automatically reversing a morphological analyser.
    This is a much enhanced version of the analyser originally developed for the GATE system (Cunningham et al., 1996).
    Minnen and Carroll (Under review) describe in detail how the reversal is performed.
    The generator executable occupies around 700Kb on disc.
