) does not, because wh-atts in (7b) contains a non-atomic attribute np-atts.
    (Barton, Jr. et al., 1987) argued that the unification of recursive attribute structures is a major source of computational complexity.
    On the other hand, let a be the number of atomic attributes, n be the number of non-atomic attributes.
    The time it takes to unify two attribute vectors is a + ma if they satisfy the unit closure condition.
    Since both n and a can be regarded as constants, the unification takes only constant amount of time.
    In our current implementation, n -= 2, a = 59.
  
  
    Correa (1991) proposed an interpretation of GB principles based on attribute grammars.
    An attribute grammar consists of a phrase structure grammar and a set of attribution rules to compute the attribute values of the non-terminal symbols.
    The attributes are evaluated after a parse tree has been constructed by the phrase structure grammar.
    The original objective of attribute grammar is to derive the semantics of
