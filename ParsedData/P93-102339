    The mathematical method, which uses cluster silhouettes and the silhouette coefficient (Kaufman and Rousseeuw, 1990), can also be used to automatically determine the proper number of clusters, one of the hardest problems in cluster analysis.
    We also plan a formal study to evaluate the appropriateness of the clustering method used, by computing and evaluating the results when a hierarchical algorithm is employed instead in stage four.
    Eventually, we plan to evaluate the system's output by using it to augment adjective entries in a lexicon and test the augmented lexicon in an application such as language generation.
