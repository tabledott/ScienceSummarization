o 10 (best) according to how much the full category had met the expectations they had when seeing only the triplet.
    Results are given in Table 1.
    The first line gives the average percentage of triplets that were given scores of 1 or 2 (that is, &#8216;significant shared meaning&#8217;.)
    The 2nd line gives the average score of a triplet (1 is best.)
    In these lines scores of 5 were not counted.
    The 3rd line gives the average score given to a full category (10 is best.)
    Interevaluator Kappa between scores 1,2 and 3,4 was 0.56, 0.67 and 0.72 for Dmoz, BNC and Russian respectively.
    Our algorithm clearly outperforms k-means, which outperforms random.
    We believe that the Russian results are better because the percentage of native speakers among our subjects for Russian was larger than that for English.
    The major guideline in this part of the evaluation was to compare our results with previous work having a similar goal (Widdows and Dorow, 2002).
    We have followed their methodol
