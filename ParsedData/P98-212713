rder of their similarity to a given word w. The similarity tree for w is created as follows: among lw, w1, wz-11.
    For example, Figure 3 shows the similarity tree for the top-40 most similar words to duty.
    The first number behind a word is the similarity of the word to its parent.
    The second number is the similarity of the word to the root node of the tree.
    Inspection of sample outputs shows that this algorithm works well.
    However, formal evaluation of its accuracy remains to be future work.
  
  
    There have been many approaches to automatic detection of similar words from text corpora.
    Ours is similar to (Grefenstette, 1994; Hindle, 1990; Ruge, 1992) in the use of dependency relationship as the word features, based on which word similarities are computed.
    Evaluation of automatically generated lexical resources is a difficult problem.
    In (Hindle, 1990), a small set of sample results are presented.
    In (Smadja, 1993), automatically extracted collocations are judged by a le
