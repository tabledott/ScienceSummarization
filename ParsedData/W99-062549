t; restricts a pair of matching primitives to occur within a relative distance of four words.
    If the composite feature also restricts the types of the primitives in the pair, the name of the restricting primitive feature is added to the composite feature name.
    For example the feature named Verb Distance &lt; 5 requires one member of the pair to be a verb and the relative distance between the primitives to be at most five.
    The second column in Table 2 shows whether the feature value has been normalized according to its overall rarity6, while the third column indicates the actual threshold used in decisions assuming that only this feature is used for classification.
    The fourth column shows the applicability of that feature, that is, the percentage of multiple times for the same feature and normalization option, highlighting the effect of different decision thresholds. paragraph pairs for which this feature would apply (i.e., have a value over the specified threshold).
    Finally, the fifth and
