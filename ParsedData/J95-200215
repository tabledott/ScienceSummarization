 all rules with the same nonterminal X on the LHS must therefore sum to unity.
    Context-freeness in a probabilistic setting translates into conditional independence of rule choices.
    As a result, complete derivations have joint probabilities that are simply the products of the rule probabilities involved.
    The probabilities of interest mentioned in Section 1 can now be defined formally.
    Definition 1 The following quantities are defined relative to a SCFG G, a nonterminal X, and a string x over the alphabet E of G. where i, v2,. vk are strings of terminals and nonterminals, X -4 A is a production of G, and 1)2 is derived from vi by replacing one occurrence of X with A. b) The string probability P(X 4 x) (of x given X) is the sum of the probabilities of all left-most derivations X &#8226; &#8226; &#8226;= x producing x from X.' c) The sentence probability P(S x) (of x given G) is the string probability given the start symbol S of G. By definition, this is also the probability P(x I G) assigned to x
