subscripts to indicate the reordering of phrases.
    The phrase-based model is able to order &#8220;diplomatic...Korea&#8221; correctly (using phrase reordering) and &#8220;one...countries&#8221; correctly (using a phrase translation), but does not accomplish the necessary inversion of those two groups.
    A lexicalized phrase-reordering model like that in use in ISI&#8217;s system (Och et al., 2004) might be able to learn a better reordering, but simpler distortion models will probably not.
    We propose a solution to these problems that does not interfere with the strengths of the phrasebased approach, but rather capitalizes on them: since phrases are good for learning reorderings of words, we can use them to learn reorderings of phrases as well.
    In order to do this we need hierarchical phrases that consist of both words and subphrases.
    For example, a hierarchical phrase pair that might help with the above example is: (5) (yu 1 you 2 , have 2 with 1 ) where 1 and 2 are placeholders for subphrases
