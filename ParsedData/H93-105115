nits were connected to both the hidden and in- put units.
  In all cases, the network configuration with no hidden units was either superior or statistically in- distinguishable from the more complex networks.
  As no network topology was significantly better than one with no hidden units, all data reported here are derived from such networks.
  RESULTS AND DISCUSSION All of the classifiers performed best with the largest num- ber (200) of training contexts.
  The percent correct re- sults reported below are averaged over the three trials with 200 training contexts.
  The Bayesian classifier av- eraged 71~ correct answers, the content vector classifier averaged 72%, and the neural network classifier averaged 76%.
  None of these differences are statlstlcally signifi- cant due to the limited sample size of three trials.
  The results reported below are taken from trial A with 200 training contexts.
  Confusion matrices of this trial are given in Tables 2 - 4.
