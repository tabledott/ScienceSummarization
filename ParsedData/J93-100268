different frequencies of occurrence.
    However, this approach appears to be the natural stochastic, probabilistic model that emerges when using a LALR(1) table.
    Any further sensitivity to context would require sensitivity to patterns in larger sections of a parse derivation than can be defined in terms of such a table.
    The probabilities required to create the probabilistic version of the parse table can be derived from the set of parse histories resulting from the training phase described in Section 5, by computing the frequency with which each transition from a particular state has been taken and converting these to probabilities such that the probabilities A probabilistic version of the parse table for Grammar 1. assigned to each transition from a given state sum to one.
    In Figure 9 we show a probabilistic LALR(1) parse table for Grammar 1 derived from a simple, partial (and artificial) training phase.
    In this version of the table a probability is associated with each shift action in the s
