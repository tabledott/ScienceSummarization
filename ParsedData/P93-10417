oncentrates on lexical cohesion of a text. segment.
    The experiment proved that LCP closely correlate with the segment boundaries captured by the human judgments, and that lexical cohesion plays main role in forming a sequence of words into segments.
    Text segmentation described here provides basic information for text understanding: Segment boundaries provide valuable restriction for determination of the referents.
    Segment boundaries can be considered as segment switching (push and pop) in hierarchical structure of text.
    The segmentation can be applied also to text summarizing.
    (Consider a list of average meaning of segments.)
    In future research, the author needs to examine validity of LCP for other genres &#8212; Hearst (1993) segments expository texts.
    Incorporating other clues (e.g. cue phrases, tense and aspect, etc.) is also needed to make this segmentation method more robust.
