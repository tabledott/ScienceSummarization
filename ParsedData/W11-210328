l for some language pairs deviates in a nontrivial amount from the overall agreement rate.
    Let us focus on inter-annotator agreement rates in the individual track (excluding reference comparisons), in the top right portion of Table 49.
    The overall K is 0.320, but it ranges from 0.264 for GermanEnglish, to 0.477 for Spanish-English.
    What distinguishes those two language pairs from each other?
    If we examine the results in Table 8, we see that Spanish-English had two very weak systems, which were likely easy for annotators to agree on comparisons involving them.
    (This is the converse of annotators agreeing more often on comparisons involving the reference.)
    English-French is similar in that regard, and it too has a relatively high agreement rate.
    On the other hand, the participants in GermanEnglish formed a large pool of more closelymatched systems, where the gap separating the bottom system is not as pronounced.
    So it seems that the low agreement rates are indicative of a more co
