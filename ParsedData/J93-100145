ine translation (MT) more suitable for rationalism or empiricism?
    Both approaches have been investigated.
    Weaver (1949) was the first to propose an information theoretic approach to MT.
    The empirical approach was also practiced at Georgetown during the 1950s and 1960s (Henisz-Dostert, Ross Macdonald, and Zarechnak 1979) in a system that eventually became known as SYSTRAN.
    Recently, most work in MT has tended to favor rationalism, though there are some important exceptions, such as example-based MT (Sato and Nagao 1990).
    The issue remains as controversial as ever, as evidenced by the lively debate on rationalism versus empiricism at TMI-92, a recent conference on MT.'
    The paper by Brown et al. (1990) revives Weaver's information theoretic approach to MT.
    It requires a bit more squeezing and twisting to fit machine translation into the noisy channel mold: to translate, for example, from French to English, one imagines that the native speaker of French has thought up what he or she wa
