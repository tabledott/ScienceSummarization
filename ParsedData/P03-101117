f words:1 where A is the set of word pairs aligned by the automatic system, and G the set aligned in the gold standard.
    We provide a comparison of the tree-based models with the sequence of successively more complex models of Brown et al. (1993).
    Results are shown in Table 2.
    The error rates shown in Table 2 represent the minimum over training iterations; training was stopped for each model when error began to increase.
    IBM Models 1, 2, and 3 refer to Brown et al. (1993).
    &#8220;Tree-to-String&#8221; is the model of Yamada and Knight (2001), and &#8220;Tree-to-String, Clone&#8221; allows the node cloning operation of Section 2.1.
    &#8220;Tree-to-Tree&#8221; indicates the model of Section 3, while &#8220;Tree-to-Tree, Clone&#8221; adds the node cloning operation of Section 3.1.
    Model 2 is initialized from the parameters of Model 1, and Model 3 is initialized from Model 2.
    The lexical translation probabilities Pt(f|e) for each of our tree-based models are initialized from Model 1,
