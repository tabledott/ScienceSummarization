    Since this variant of the algorithm increases the overall nondeterminism, it has only been used for the data sets that include informative root labels (Arabic, Czech, Portuguese, Slovene).
    History-based parsing models rely on features of the derivation history to predict the next parser action.
    The features used in our system are all symbolic and extracted from the following fields of the data representation: FORM, LEMMA, CPOSTAG, POSTAG, FEATS, and DEPREL.
    Features of the type DEPREL have a special status in that they are extracted during parsing from the partially built dependency graph and may therefore contain errors, whereas all the other features have gold standard values during both training and parsing.2 Based on previous research, we defined a base model to be used as a starting point for languagespecific feature selection.
    The features of this model are shown in Table 1, where rows denote tokens in a parser configuration (defined relative to the stack, the remaining input, and th
