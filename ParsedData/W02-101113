the following exponential form: where Z(d) is a normalization function.
    Fi,c is a feature/class function for feature fi and class c, defined as follows:6 class c. The parameter values are set so as to maximize the entropy of the induced distribution (hence the classifier&#8217;s name) subject to the constraint that the expected values of the feature/class functions with respect to the model are equal to their expected values with respect to the training data: the underlying philosophy is that we should choose the model making the fewest assumptions about the data while still remaining consistent with it, which makes intuitive sense.
    We use ten iterations of the improved iterative scaling algorithm (Della Pietra et al., 1997) for parameter training (this was a sufficient number of iterations for convergence of training-data accuracy), together with a Gaussian prior to prevent overfitting (Chen and Rosenfeld, 2000).
    Support vector machines (SVMs) have been shown to be highly effective at traditional
