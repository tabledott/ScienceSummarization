    However, more recent work&#8212;some of it discussed in this survey&#8212;on extracting phrasal paraphrases (or patterns) does include direct evaluation of the paraphrasing itself: The original phrase and its paraphrase are presented to multiple human judges, along with the contexts in which the phrase occurs in the original sentence, who are asked to determine whether the relationship between the two phrases is indeed paraphrastic (Barzilay and McKeown 2001; Barzilay and Lee 2003; Ibrahim, Katz, and Lin 2003; Pang, Knight, and Marcu 2003).
    A more direct approach is to substitute the paraphrase in place of the original phrase in its sentence and present both sentences to judges who are then asked to judge not only their semantic equivalence but also the grammaticality of the new sentence (Bannard and Callison-Burch 2005; CallisonBurch 2008).
    Motivation for such substitution-based evaluation is discussed in CallisonBurch (2007): the basic idea
