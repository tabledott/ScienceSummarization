of the document has been justified by analyzing the behavior of humans doing the task, and by automatic evaluation of a system operating on a similar principle.
    We have compared two systems that use this basic technique, one taking a statistical approach and the other a linguistic approach.
    The results of the linguistically motivated approach show that we can build a working system with minimal linguistic knowledge and circumvent the need for large amounts of training data.
    We should be able to quickly produce a comparable system for other languages, especially in light of current multi-lingual initiatives that include automatic parser induction for new languages, e.g. the TIDES initiative.
    We plan to enhance Hedge Trimmer by using a language model of Headlinese, the language of newspaper headlines (M&#229;rdh 1980) to guide the system in which constituents to remove.
    We Also we plan to allow for morphological variation in verbs to produce the present tense headlines typical of Headlinese.
