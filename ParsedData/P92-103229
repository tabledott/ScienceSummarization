der to address this state of affairs, we decided to try to establish upper and lower bounds on the level of performance that we could expect to obtain.
    We estimated the lower bound by positing a simple baseline system which ignored context and simply assigned the most likely sense in all cases.
    Hopefully, most reasonable systems would outperform this system.
    The upper bound was approximated by trying to estimate the limit of our ability to measure performance.
    We assumed that this limit was largely dominated by the ability for the human judges to agree with one another.
    The estimate depends very much, not surprisingly, on the particular experimental design.
    Jorgensen, who was interested in highlighting differences among informants, found a very low estimate (68%), well below the baseline (75%), and also well below the level that BarHillel asserted as not-good-enough.
    In our own work, we have attempted to highlight agreements, so that there would more dynamic range between the basel
