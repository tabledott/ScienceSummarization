    Our evaluation was conducted with 4294 nouns that occurred at least 100 times in the parsed corpus and are found in both WordNet1.5 and the Roget Thesaurus.
    Table 1 shows the average similarity between corresponding entries in different thesauri and the standard deviation of the average, which is the standard deviation of the data items divided by the square root of the number of data items.
    Since the differences among sim SiMJacard cosine, SiMdzce and are very small, we only included the results for sitncosi, in Table 1 for the sake of brevity.
    It can be seen that sim, Hindle, and cosine are significantly more similar to WordNet than Roget is, but are significantly less similar to Roget than WordNet is.
    The differences between Hindle and Hindle,. clearly demonstrate that the use of other types of dependencies in addition to subject and object relationships is very beneficial.
    The performance of sim, Hindle, and cosine are quite close.
