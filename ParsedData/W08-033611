ver, having a basic segmenter like MaxMatch still gives the phrase-based MT system a win over the character-based segmentation (treating each Chinese character as a word).
    We will refer to the characterbased segmentation as CharBased.
    In Table 1, we can see that on the Chinese word segmentation task, having MaxMatch is obviously better than not trying to identify Chinese words at all (CharBased).
    As for MT performance, in Table 1 we see that having a segmenter, even as sim2Different phrase extraction heuristics might affect the results.
    In our experiments, grow-diag outperforms both one-tomany and many-to-one for both MaxMatch and CharBased.
    We report the results only on grow-diag. ple as MaxMatch, can help phrase-based MT system by about 1.37 BLEU points on all 1082 sentences of the test data (MT05).
    Also, we tested the performance on 828 sentences of MT05 where all elements are in vocabulary3 for both MaxMatch and CharBased.
    MaxMatch achieved 32.09 BLEU and CharBased achieved 30.
