 LA procedure recognized about 85% of the 586 actual noun attachment examples as noun attachments, and about 70% of the actual verb attachments as verb attachments.
    If we restrict the lexical association procedure to choose attachment only in cases where the absolute value of the LA score is greater than 2.0 (an arbitrary threshold indicating that the probability of one attachment is four times greater than the other), we get attachment judgments on 621 of the 880 test sentences, with overall precision of about 89%.
    On these same examples, the judges also showed improvement, as evident in Table 3.7 The fact that an LA score threshold improves precision indicates that the LA score gives information about how confident we can be about an attachment choice.
    In some applications, this information is useful.
    For instance, suppose that we wanted to incorporate the PP attachment procedure in a parser such as Fidditch.
    It might be preferable to achieve increased precision in PP attachment, in retu
