  A Cascaded Linear Model for Joint Chinese Word Segmentation and Part-of-Speech Tagging
  
    We propose a cascaded linear model for joint Chinese word segmentation and partof-speech tagging.
    With a character-based perceptron as the core, combined with realvalued features such as language models, the cascaded model is able to efficiently utilize knowledge sources that are inconvenient to incorporate into the perceptron directly.
    Experiments show that the cascaded model achieves improved accuracies on both segmentation only and joint segmentation and part-of-speech tagging.
    On the Penn Chinese Treebank 5.0, we obtain an error reduction of segmentation and joint segmentation and part-of-speech tagging over the perceptron-only baseline.
  
  
    Word segmentation and part-of-speech (POS) tagging are important tasks in computer processing of Chinese and other Asian languages.
    Several models were introduced for these problems, for example, the Hidden Markov Model (HMM) (Rabiner, 1989), Maximum
