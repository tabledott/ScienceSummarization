ze of grammars grows asymptotically, traditional generative grammar is indistinguishable from MDL-style rationalism.
    We return to this point below.
    There is a striking point that has so far remained tacit regarding the treatment of this problem in contemporary linguistic theory.
    That point is this: the problem addressed in this paper is not mentioned, not defined, and not addressed.
    The problem of dividing up words into morphemes is generally taken as one that is so trivial and Goldsmith Unsupervised Learning of the Morphology of a Natural Language devoid of interest that morphologists, or linguists more generally, simply do not feel obliged to think about the problem.34 In a very uninteresting sense, the challenge presented by the present paper to current morphological theory is no challenge at all, because morphological theory makes no claims to knowing how to discover morphological analysis; it claims only to know what to do once the morphemes have been identified.
