 precision of our links (motivated by categories defined by the WordNet supersenses) against the baseline algorithm and against an &#8220;oracle&#8221; for named entity recognition.
    Finally, in section 4.5 we evaluate the taxonomies inferred by our algorithm directly against the WordNet 2.1 taxonomy; we perform this evaluation by testing each taxonomy on a set of human judgments of hypernym and non-hypernym noun pairs sampled from newswire text.
    We evaluate the quality of our acquired hyponyms by direct judgment.
    In four separate annotation sessions, two judges labeled {50,100,100,100} samples uniformly generated from the first {100,1000,10000,20000} single links added by our algorithm.
    For the direct measure of fine-grained precision, we simply ask for each link H(X, Y ) added by the system, is X a Y ?
    In addition to the fine-grained precision, we give a coarse-grained evaluation, inspired by the idea of supersense-tagging in (Ciaramita and Johnson, 2003).
