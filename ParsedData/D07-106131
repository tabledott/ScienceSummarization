ontains many pairs that are not semantically similar but still receive high scores, such as ?computer-software?
			at 8.81.
			WS-353 contains pairs that include non-nouns, such as ?eat-drink,?
			one proper noun not appearing in WordNet (?Maradona-football?), and some pairs potentially subject to political bias.
			Again,the aggregate human judgments correlate well with ear lier data sets where they overlap?the 30 judgments that WordSimilarity-353 shares with the Miller and Charles data have ? = .939 and the 29 shared with Rubenstein and Goodenough have ? = .904 (by our calculations).
			We generated similarity scores for word pairs in all three data sets using the three variants of our walk model (MarkovLink, MarkovGloss, MarkovJoined) and with multiple distributional distance measures.
			We used the WordNet::Similarity package (Pedersen et al, 2004) to compute baseline scores for several existing measures, noting that one word pair was not processed in WS-353 because one of the words was missing from Word
