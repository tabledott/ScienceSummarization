endencies.
    All of these approaches require considerably more specialized linguitic knowledge than the pattern-matching algorithm described here.
    This algorithm is both simple and general, and can serve as a benchmark against which more complex approaches can be evaluated.
    The pattern-matching approach is not tied to any particular linguistic theory, but it does require a treebank training corpus from which the algorithm extracts its patterns.
    We used sections 2&#8211;21 of the Penn Treebank as the training corpus; section 24 was used as the development corpus for experimentation and tuning, while the test corpus (section 23) was used exactly once (to obtain the results in section 3).
    Chapter 4 of the Penn Treebank tagging guidelines (Bies et al., 1995) contains an extensive description of the kinds of empty nodes and the use of co-indexation in the Penn Treebank.
    Table 1 contains summary statistics on the distribution of empty nodes in the Penn Treebank.
