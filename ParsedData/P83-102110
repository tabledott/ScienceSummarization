f the NP and the value of the attribute obj of the S is the functional structure of the VP.'
    For those familiar with the details of the mapping from functional descriptions to functional structures in LFG, DCG variables are just &amp;quot;placeholder&amp;quot; symbols (Bresnan and Kaplan, 1982).
    As we noted above, an apparent difference between LFG and DCGs is that LFG functional structure nodes, unlike DCG function symbols, do not have a definite number of children.
    Although we must leave to a separate paper the details of the application to LFG of the unification algorithms from theorem proving, we will note here that the formal properties of logical and LFG or UG unification are similar, and there are adaptations to LFG and UG of the algorithms and data structures used in the logical case.
  
  
    The Earley Deduction proof procedure schema is named after Earley's context-free parsing algorithm (Earley, 1970), on which it is based.
    Earley Deduction provides for definite clauses the same k
