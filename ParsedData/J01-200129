 analysis that we have mentioned, counting the number of letters in the inventory of stems and suffixes that have been hypothesized; the improvement in this count over the number of letters in the original word list is a measure of the fitness of the analysis.'
    He used a list of 120 French words in one experiment, and 39 forms of the same verb in another experiment, and employed what he terms a genetic algorithm to find the best cut in each word.
    He associated each of the 120 words (respectively, 39) with an integer (between 1 and the length of the word minus 1) indicating where the morphological split was to be, and measured the fitness of that grammar in terms of its decrease in number of total letters.
    He does not describe the fitness function used, but seems to suggest that the single top-performing grammar of each generation is preserved, all others are eliminated, and the top-performing grammar is then subjected to mutation.
    That is, in a case-by-case fashion, the split between stems and
