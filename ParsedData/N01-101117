    A win shows it was more accurate than the method in the column, a loss means it was less accurate, and a tie means it was equally accurate.
    The decision tree/power divergence method was more accurate than the best reported SENSEVAL results for 19 of the 36 tasks, and more accurate for 30 of the 36 tasks when compared to the average reported accuracy.
    The decision stumps also fared well, proving to be more accurate than the best SENSEVAL results for 14 of the 36 tasks.
    In general the feature sets selected by the power divergence statistic result in more accurate decision trees than those selected by the Dice Coefficient.
    The power divergence tests prove to be more reliable since they account for all possible events surrounding two words w1 and w2; when they occur as bigram w1w2, when w1 or w2 occurs in a bigram without the other, and when a bigram consists of neither.
    The Dice Coefficient is based strictly on the event where w1 and w2 occur together in a bigram.
