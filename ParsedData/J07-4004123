 POS tag is CC, is changed to conj.
    Ampersands are also a significant problem, and occur frequently in WSJ text.
    For example, the CCGbank analysis of Standard &amp; Poor&#8217;s index assigns the lexical category N/N to both Standard and &amp;, treating them as modifiers of Poor, whereas DepBank treats &amp; as a coordinating term.
    We fixed this by creating conj GRs between any &amp; and the two words on either side; removing the modifier GR between the two words; and replacing any GRs in which the words on either side of the &amp; are arguments with a single GR in which &amp; is the argument.
    The ta relation, which identifies text adjuncts delimited by punctuation (Briscoe 2006), is difficult to assign correctly to the parser output.
    The simple punctuation rules used by the parser, and derived from CCGbank, do not contain enough information to distinguish between the various cases of ta.
    Thus the only rule we have implemented, which is somewhat specific to the newspaper genre, is to r
