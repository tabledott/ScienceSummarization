assical French novels into English, and data created for machine translation evaluation methods such as Bleu (Papineni et al., 2002) which use multiple reference translations.
    While the results reported for these methods are impressive, their usefulness is limited by the scarcity of monolingual parallel corpora.
    Small data sets mean a limited number of paraphrases can be extracted.
    Furthermore, the narrow range of text genres available for monolingual parallel corpora limits the range of contexts in which the paraphrases can be used.
    Instead of relying on scarce monolingual parallel data, our method utilizes the abundance of bilingual parallel data that is available.
    This allows us to create a much larger inventory of phrases that is applicable to a wider range of texts.
    Our method for identifying paraphrases is an extension of recent work in phrase-based statistical machine translation (Koehn et al., 2003).
    The essence of our method is to align phrases in a bilingual parallel corp
