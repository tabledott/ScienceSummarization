and lemmatized nouns (VTNL), verb-related dependencies (VD), noun-related dependencies (ND), verb and noun dependencies (VDND), and all available dependencies (AD).
    For comparison we also report the naive baseline of generating a random oder (BR).
    As can be seen from Table 3 the best performing features are NL and VDND.
    This is not surprising given that NL encapsulates notions of entity-based coherence, which is relatively important for our domain.
    A lot of texts are about a particular entity (company or individual) and their properties.
    The feature VDND subsumes several other features and does expectedly better: it captures entity-based coherence, the interrelations among verbs, the structure of sentences and also preserves information about argument structure (who is doing what to whom).
    The distance between the orders produced by the model and the original texts increases when all types of dependencies are Feature T StdDev Min Max taken into account.
    The feature space becomes to
