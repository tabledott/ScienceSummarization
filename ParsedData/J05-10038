tic models with global features for parsing and other NLP tasks.
    (Log-linear models are often referred to as maximum-entropy models in the NLP literature.)
    Similar methods have also been proposed for machine translation (Och and Ney 2002) and language understanding in dialogue systems (Papineni, Roukos, and Ward 1997, 1998).
    Previous work (Friedman, Hastie, and Tibshirani 1998) has drawn connections between log-linear models and boosting for classification problems.
    One contribution of our research is to draw similar connections between the two approaches to ranking problems.
    We argue that the efficient boosting algorithm introduced in this article is an attractive alternative to maximum-entropy models, in particular, feature selection methods that have been proposed in the literature on maximum-entropy models.
    The earlier methods for maximum-entropy feature selection methods (Ratnaparkhi, Roukos, and Ward 1994; Berger, Della Pietra, and Della Pietra 1996; Della Pietra, Della Pietra, a
