, they are marked, and the translation of the sentence is continued monotonically, keeping track of the positions already covered.
    To formalize the approach, we introduce four reordering states S: To formalize the approach, the following notation is introduced: Order in which the English source positions are covered for the English-to-German reordering example given in Figure 7. rmax(C) is the rightmost covered and lmin(C) is the leftmost uncovered source position. u(C) is the number of &#8220;skipped&#8221; positions, and m(C) is the number of &#8220;moved&#8221; positions.
    The function card(&#183;) returns the cardinality of a set of source positions.
    The function w(C) describes the &#8220;window&#8221; size in which the word reordering takes place.
    A procedural description for the computation of the set of successor hypotheses for a given partial hypothesis (S, C, j) is given in Table 3.
    There are restrictions on the possible successor states: A partial hypothesis in state Skip cannot b
