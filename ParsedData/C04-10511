t distance data lacks many of the complex lexical and syntactic alternations that characterize monolingual paraphrase.
		The summary sentences, while less readily alignable, retain more of the non-trivial alternations that are of greatest interest learning paraphrase relationships.
	
	
			The importance of learning to manipulate monolingual paraphrase relationships for applications like summarization, search, and dialog has been highlighted by a number of recent efforts (Barzilay &amp; McKeown 2001; Shinyama et al 2002; Lee &amp; Barzilay 2003; Lin &amp; Pantel 2001).
			While several different learning methods have been applied to this problem, all share a need for large amounts of data in the form of pairs or sets of strings that are likely to exhibit lexical and/or structural paraphrase alternations.
			One approach1 1 An alternative approach involves identifying anchor points--pairs of words linked in a known way--and collecting the strings that intervene.
