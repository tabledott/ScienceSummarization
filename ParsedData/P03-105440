 unless it is somehow explicitly encoded into category labels.
    More complex parsing models have indirectly overcome this by modeling distance (rather than height).
    Linear distance is difficult to encode in a PCFG &#8211; marking nodes with the size of their yields massively multiplies the state space.13 Therefore, we wish to find indirect indicators that distinguish high attachments from low ones.
    In the case of two PPs following a NP, with the question of whether the second PP is a second modifier of the leftmost NP or should attach lower, inside the first PP, the important distinction is usually that the lower site is a non-recursive base NP.
    Collins (1999) captures this notion by introducing the notion of a base NP, in which any NP which dominates only preterminals is marked with a -B.
    Further, if an NP-B does not have a non-base NP parent, it is given one with a unary production.
    This was helpful, but substantially less effective than marking base NPs without introducing the unary,
