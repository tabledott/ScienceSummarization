n be computed in time proportional to the size of the compact forest.
    The parser then removes all constituents nij,k whose probability falls below some preset threshold.
    In the version of this parser available on the web, this threshold is on the order of 10&#8722;4.
    The unpruned edges are then exhaustively evaluated according to the fine-grained probabilistic model; in effect, each coarse-grained dynamic programming state is split into one or more fine-grained dynamic programming states.
    As noted above, the fine-grained model conditions on information that is not available in the coarse-grained model.
    This includes the lexical head of one&#8217;s parents, the part of speech of this head, the parent&#8217;s and grandparent&#8217;s category labels, etc.
    The fine-grained states investigated by the parser are constrained to be refinements of the coarse-grained states, which drastically reduces the number of fine-grained states that need to be investigated.
    It is certainly possible to
