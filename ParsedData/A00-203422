    Stevenson and Merlo (1999) use syntactic and lexical cues for classifying 60 verbs in three verb classes: unergative, unaccusative and verbs with an optional direct object.
    These three classes were chosen because a few well defined features, specified a priori, can distinguish the three groups.
    Twenty verbs from Levin's classification were used in each class.
    They were selected by virtue of having sufficient frequency in a combined corpus (from the Brown and the wsJ) of 65 million words.
    The verbs were also chosen for having one predominant intended sense in the corpus.
    Stevenson and Merlo used four linguistically motivated features to distinguish these groups.
    Counts from the corpus data for each of the four features were normalised to give a score on a scale of 1 to 100.
    One feature was the causative non-causative distinction.
    For this feature, a measure similar to our LO measure was used.
    The four features were identified in the corpus using a
