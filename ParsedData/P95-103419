d lattices to each fragment of the input, in a bottom-up compositional fashion.
    For example, consider the following semantic input, which is written in the PENMAN-style Sentence Plan Language (SPL) (Penman, 1989), with concepts drawn from the SENSUS ontology (Knight and Luk, 1994), and may be rendered in English as It is easy for Americans to obtain guns: We process semantic subexpressions in a bottomup order, e.g., A2, G, P, E, and finally A.
    The grammar assigns what we call an e-structure to each subexpression.
    An e-structure consists of a list of distinct syntactic categories, paired with English word lattices: (&lt;syn, lat&gt;, &lt;syn, lat&gt;, ) .
    As we climb up the input expression, the grammar glues together various word lattices.
    The grammar is organized around semantic feature patterns rather than English syntax&#8212;rather than having one S -&gt; NP-VP rule with many semantic triggers, we have one AGENT-PATIENT rule with many English renderings.
    Here is a sample rule: Give
