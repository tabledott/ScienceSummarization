ese metrics are defined between concepts, rather than words, but they can be easily turned into a word-to-word similarity metric by selecting for any given pair of words those two meanings that lead to the highest concept-to-concept similarity.
    We use the WordNet-based implementation of these metrics, as available in the WordNet::Similarity package (Patwardhan et al., 2003).
    We provide below a short description for each of these six metrics.
    The Leacock &amp; Chodorow (Leacock and Chodorow, 1998) similarity is determined as: where length is the length of the shortest path between two concepts using node-counting, and D is the maximum depth of the taxonomy.
    The Lesk similarity of two concepts is defined as a function of the overlap between the corresponding definitions, as provided by a dictionary.
    It is based on an algorithm proposed in (Lesk, 1986) as a solution for word sense disambiguation.
    The Wu and Palmer (Wu and Palmer, 1994) similarity metric measures the depth of the two conce
