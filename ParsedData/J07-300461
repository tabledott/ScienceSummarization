coindexed with *RNR* traces receive the category of the corresponding traces.
    Argument clusters are ignored in this step. treatArgumentClusters: Assign categories to argument clusters. cutTracesAndUnaryRules: Cut out constituents that are not part of the CCG derivation, such as traces, null elements, and the copy of the first conjunct in argument cluster coordination.
    Eliminate resulting unary projections of the form X &#8658; X. verifyDerivation: Discard those trees for which the algorithm does not produce a valid CCG derivation.
    In most cases, this is due to argument cluster coordination that is not annotated in a way that our algorithm can deal with. assignDependencies: coindex specific classes of lexical categories to project non-local dependencies, and generate the word&#8211;word dependencies that constitute the underlying predicate&#8211;argument structure.
  
  
    In a number of cases, missing structure or a necessary distinction between different constructions needed to inform the trans
