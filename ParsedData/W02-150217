will also make explicit reference to language families, since both similarities and differences among related languages will be of interest in these case studies.
    Examples to be included in the first release of this library include numeral classifiers in Japanese, subject pro drop in Spanish, partial-VP fronting in German, and verb diathesis in Norwegian.
  
  
    The matrix itself is not a grammar but a collection of generalizations across grammars.
    As such, it cannot be tested directly on corpora from particular languages, and we must find other means of evaluation.
    We envision overall evaluation of the matrix based on case studies of its performance in helping grammar engineers quickly start new grammars and in helping them scale those grammars up.
    Evaluation in detail will based on automatable deletion/substitution metrics, i.e., tools that determine which types from the matrix get used as is, which get used with modifications, and which get ignored in various matrix-derived grammars.
