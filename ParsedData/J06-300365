t &#8220;stone is to mason as carpenter is to wood.&#8221; In general (except when the semantic relations between A and B are symmetrical), we have the following inequality: Therefore we do not want A:B and B:A to be represented by identical row vectors, although it would ensure that equation (8) is satisfied.
    In step 12 of LRA, the relational similarity between A:B and C:D is the average of the cosines, among the (num filter + 1)2 cosines from step 11, that are greater than or equal to the cosine of the original pairs, A:B and C:D. That is, the average includes only those alternates that are &#8220;better&#8221; than the originals.
    Taking all alternates instead of the better alternates, recall drops from 56.1% to 40.4% and precision drops from 56.8% to 40.8%.
    Both decreases are statistically significant with 95% confidence, according to the Fisher Exact Test (Agresti 1990).
    Suppose a word pair A:B corresponds to a vector r in the matrix X.
    It would be convenient if inspection of r gave us
