 whether the segmentations with which they are consistent are &amp;quot;popular&amp;quot; or not.
    While Can's system incorporates fairly sophisticated models of various linguistic information, it has the drawback that it has only been tested with a very small lexicon (a few hundred words) and on a very small test set (thirty sentences); there is therefore serious concern as to whether the methods that he discusses are scalable.
    Another question that remains unanswered is to what extent the linguistic information he considers can be handled&#8212;or at least approximated&#8212;by finite-state language models, and therefore could be directly interfaced with the segmentation model that we have presented in this paper.
    For the examples given in (1) and (2) this certainly seems possible.
    Consider first the examples in (2).
    The segmenter will give both analyses I- cai2 neng2 'just be able,' and lit cai2-neng2 'talent,' but the latter analysis is preferred since splitting these two morphemes is g
