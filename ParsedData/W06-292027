 the scores of all dependency arcs in it.
    The search for the best parse can then be formalized as the search for the maximum spanning tree (MST) (McDonald et al., 2005b).
    If the parse has to be projective, Eisner&#8217;s bottom-up-span algorithm (Eisner, 1996) can be used for the search.
    For non-projective parses, McDonald et al. (2005b) propose using the Chu-Liu-Edmonds (CLE) algorithm (Chu and Liu, 1965; Edmonds, 1967) and McDonald and Pereira (2006) describe an approximate extension of Eisner&#8217;s algorithm.
    There are also alternatives to MST which allow imposing additional constraints on the dependency structure, e.g.
    that at most one dependent of a token can have a certain label, such as &#8220;subject&#8221;, see Riedel et al. (2006) and Bick (2006).
    By contrast, Canisius et al. (2006) do not even enforce the tree constraint, i.e. they allow cycles.
    In a variant of the &#8220;all pairs&#8221; approach, only those pairs of tokens are considered that are not too distant (Can
