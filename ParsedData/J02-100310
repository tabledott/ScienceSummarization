mple, when dog rules out as many distractors as chihuahua, chihuahua cannot be chosen.
    A is the list of Attributes; L is the set of Attribute/Value combinations returned by the algorithm.
    A further notational convention will be useful: Values will be identified by two indices, the first of which identifies the Attribute.
    Thus, to denote Value j of Attribute Ai, we write Vi,j.
    This version of the algorithm will be called D&amp;RAtt.
    The initializations of L and D are omitted for brevity.
    We will switch back and forth between D&amp;R and D&amp;RAtt, depending on what is at stake.
    Like D&amp;R, D&amp;RAtt has linear complexity.
    This can be made precise in the following way.3 If the running time of a call of FindBestValue(r,Ai) is a constant times the number of Values of the Attribute Ai, then the worst-case running time of D&amp;RAtt is O(nvna), where na equals the number of Attributes in the language and nv the average number of Values of all Attributes.
