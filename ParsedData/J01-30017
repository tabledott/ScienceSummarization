    Each of these knowledge sources has been used for WSD and in Section 3 we describe a method which performs rough-grained disambiguation using part-of-speech information.
    Wilks (1975) describes a system which performs WSD using semantic information in the form of preference restrictions.
    Lesk (1986) also used semantic information for WSD in the form of textual definitions from dictionaries.
    Pragmatic information was used by Yarowsky (1992) whose approach relied upon statistical models of categories from Roget's Thesaurus (Chapman, 1977), a resource that had been used in much earlier approaches to WSD such as Masterman (1957).
    The remainder of this paper is organised as follows: Section 2 reviews some systems which have combined knowledge sources for WSD.
    In Section 3 we discuss the relationship between semantic disambiguation and part-of-speech tagging, reporting an experiment which quantifies the connection.
    A general WSD system is presented in
