f prosody.
    Thus, we sought to determine whether acoustic analysis could help in deciding, when such words were present, whether or not they marked the interruption point of a repair.
    In a preliminary study of the cue words &amp;quot;no&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;well,&amp;quot; we compared 9 examples of these words at the site of a repair to 15 examples of the same words occurring in fluent speech.
    We found that these groups were quite distinguishable on the basis of simple prosodic features.
    Table 7 shows the percentage of repairs versus false positives characterized by a clear rise or fall in FO (greater than 15 Hz), lexical stress (determined perceptually), and continuity of the speech immediately preceding and following the editing expression (&amp;quot;continuous&amp;quot; means there was no silent pause on either side of the cue word).
    As can be seen, at least for this limited data set, cue words marking repairs were quite distinguishable from those same words found in fluent strings on
