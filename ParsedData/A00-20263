ages require linguistic sophistication in order to write the abstract semantic representation, but they are flexible because minor changes to the input can accomplish major changes to the generated text.
    The only trainable approaches (known to the author) to surface generation are the purely statistical machine translation (MT) systems such as (Berger et al., 1996) and the corpus-based generation system described in (Langkilde and Knight, 1998).
    The MT systems of (Berger et al., 1996) learn to generate text in the target language straight from the source language, without the aid of an explicit semantic representation.
    In contrast, (Langkilde and Knight, 1998) uses corpus-derived statistical knowledge to rank plausible hypotheses from a grammarbased surface generation component.
  
  
    In trainable surface NLG, the goal is to learn the mapping from semantics to words that would otherwise need to be specified in a grammar or knowledge base.
