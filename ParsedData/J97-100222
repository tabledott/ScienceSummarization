e entire route), but are not included in the coding scheme because of their rarity.
    Coding involves marking where in the dialogue transcripts a transaction starts and which of the four types it is, and for all but IRRELEVANT transactions, indicating the start and end point of the relevant route section using numbered crosses on a copy of the route giver's map.
    The ends of transactions are not explicitly coded because, generally speaking, transactions do not appear to nest; for instance, if a transaction is interrupted to review a previous route segment, participants by and large restart the goal of the interrupted transaction afterwards.
    It is possible that transactions are simply too large for the participants to remember how to pick up where they left off.
    Note that it is possible for several transactions (even of the same type) to have the same starting point on the route.
    The basic route follower coding identifies whether the follower action was drawing a segment of the route or crossi
