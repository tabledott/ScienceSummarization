 probability.
    It seems likely that the structural preference for local attachment might be overruled in appropriate contexts if lexeme (or better, word sense) information were taken into account.
    The slightly worse results (relative to mean definition length) obtained for the unseen data appear to be caused more by the nonexistence of a correct analysis in a number of cases, rather than by a marked decline in the usefulness of the rule probabilities.
    This again highlights the need to deal effectively with examples outside the coverage of the grammar.
  
  
    The system that we have developed offers partial and practical solutions to two of the three problems of corpus analysis we identified in the introduction.
    The problem of tuning an existing grammar to a particular corpus or sublanguage is addressed partly by manual extensions to the grammar and lexicon during the semi-automatic training phase and partly by use of statistical information regarding frequency of rule use gathered during thi
