 did not.
    Of the 62% that had repairs, it made the appropriate correction for 57%.
    These numbers show that although pattern matching is useful in identifying possible repairs, it is less successful at making appropriate corrections.
    This problem stems largely from the overlap of related patterns.
    Many sentences contain a subsequence of words that match not one but several patterns.
    For example the phrase &amp;quot;FLIGHT &lt;word&gt; FLIGHT&amp;quot; matches three different patterns: show the flight earliest flight show the flight time flight date All R1 I M1 R1 show the delta flight united flight R1 Mi.
    I Ri Each of these sentences is a false positive for the other two patterns.
    Despite these problems of overlap, pattern matching is useful in reducing the set of candidate sentences to be processed for repairs.
    Rather than applying detailed and possibly time-intensive analysis techniques to 10,000 sentences, we can increase efficiency by limiting ourselves to the 500 sentences
