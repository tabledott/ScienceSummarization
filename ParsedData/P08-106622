    The well-formed dependency structures defined here are similar to the data structures in previous work on mono-lingual parsing (Eisner and Satta, 1999; McDonald et al., 2005).
    However, here we have fixed structures growing on both sides to exploit various translation fragments learned in the training data, while the operations in mono-lingual parsing were designed to avoid artificial ambiguity of derivation.
    Charniak et al. (2003) described a two-step stringto-CFG-tree translation model which employed a syntax-based language model to select the best translation from a target parse forest built in the first step.
    Only translation probability P(FIE) was employed in the construction of the target forest due to the complexity of the syntax-based LM.
    Since our dependency LM models structures over target words directly based on dependency trees, we can build a single-step system.
    This dependency LM can also be used in hierarchical MT systems
