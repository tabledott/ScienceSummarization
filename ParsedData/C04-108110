g-range de pendencies, but also cause more data sparseness problems and require more memory for training.
			The best Markov order for a particular application can be selected by held-out cross-validation.
			1.
			First-order: Here the inputs are examined in.
			the context of the current state only.
			The feature functions are represented as f(yt,x).There are no separate parameters for state tran sitions.
			2.
			First-order+transitions: Here we add parame-.
			ters corresponding to state transitions.
			The fea ture functions used are f(yt,x), f(yt?1, yt).context of the current and previous states.
			Fea ture function are represented as f(yt?1, yt,x).
			4.
			Third-order: Here inputs are examined in.
			the context of the current, and two previous states.
			Feature function are represented as f(yt?2, yt?1, yt,x).
	
	
			We cast the segmentation problem as one of se quence tagging: Chinese characters that begin a new word are given the START tag, and characters in the middle and at the end of words are
