e translation and alignment hypergraph, and is computed using the INSIDE algorithm.
    The gradient with respect to a particular feature is the difference in this feature&#8217;s expected value in the translation and alignment hypergraphs, and can be computed using either INSIDEOUTSIDE or the expectation semiring and INSIDE.
    Since a translation forest is generated as an intermediate step in generating an alignment forest (&#167;2) this computation is straightforward.
    Since gradient-based optimization techniques may require thousands of evaluations to converge, the batch training pipeline is split into map and reduce components, facilitating distribution over very large clusters.
    Briefly, the cdec is run as the map function, and sentence pairs are mapped over.
    The reduce function aggregates the results and performs the optimization using standard algorithms, including LBFGS (Liu et al., 1989), RPROP (Riedmiller and Braun, 1993), and stochastic gradient descent.
