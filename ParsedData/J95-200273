es corresponding to all productions Y v that are reachable through the left-corner relation Z =L Y.
    As indicated in equation (13), contributions to the forward probabilities of new states have to be summed when several paths lead to the same state.
    However, the summation in equation (13) can be optimized if the a values for all old states with the same nonterminal Z are summed first, and then multiplied by R(Z 4L Y).
    These quantities are then summed over all nonterminals Z, and the result is once multiplied by the rule probability P(Y v) to give the forward probability for the predicted state.
    B.2 Completion Unlike prediction, the completion step still involves iteration.
    Each complete state derived by completion can potentially feed other completions.
    An important detail here is to ensure that all contributions to a state's a and -y are summed before proceeding with using that state as input to further completion steps.
    One approach to this problem is to insert complete states int
