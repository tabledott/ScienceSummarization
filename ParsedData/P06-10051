2), his refers to some other, perhaps previously evoked entity.
    Traditional pronoun resolution systems are not designed to distinguish between these cases.
    They lack the specific world knowledge required in the second instance &#8211; the knowledge that a person does not usually explicitly need his own support.
    We collect statistical path-coreference information from a large, automatically-parsed corpus to address this limitation.
    A dependency path is defined as the sequence of dependency links between two potentially coreferent entities in a parse tree.
    A path does not include the terminal entities; for example, &#8220;John needs his support&#8221; and &#8220;He needs their support&#8221; have the same syntactic path.
    Our algorithm determines that the dependency path linking the Noun and pronoun is very likely to connect coreferent entities for the path &#8220;Noun needs pronoun&#8217;s friend,&#8221; while it is rarely coreferent for the path &#8220;Noun needs pronoun&#8217;s support
