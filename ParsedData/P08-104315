orphological analyzer M : W&#8212;* L is a function mapping sentences in Hebrew (W E W) to their corresponding lattices (M(W) = L E L).
    We define the lattice L to be the concatenation of the lattices Li corresponding to the input words wi (s.t.
    M(wi) = Li).
    Each connected path (l1 ... lk) E L corresponds to one morphological segmentation possibility of W. The Parser Given a sequence of input tokens W = w1 ... wn and a morphological analyzer, we look for the most probable parse tree &#960; s.t.
    Since the lattice L for a given sentence W is determined by the morphological analyzer M we have which is precisely the formula corresponding to the so-called lattice parsing familiar from speech recognition.
    Every parse &#960; selects a specific morphological segmentation (l1...lk) (a path through the lattice).
    This is akin to PoS tags sequences induced by different parses in the setup familiar from English and explored in e.g.
    (Charniak et al., 1996).
