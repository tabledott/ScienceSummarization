    This article will present a DP-based beam search decoder for the IBM-4 translation model.
    The decoder is designed to carry out an almost full search with a small number of search errors and with little performance degradation as measured by the word error criterion.
    A preliminary version of the work presented here was published in Tillmann and Ney (2000).
  
  
    To explicitly describe the word order difference between source and target language, Brown et al. (1993) introduced an alignment concept, in which a source position j is mapped to exactly one target position i: Regular alignment example for the translation direction German to English.
    For each German source word there is exactly one English target word on the alignment path.
    An example for this kind of alignment is given in Figure 2, in which each German source position j is mapped to an English target position i.
    In Brown et al. (1993), this alignment concept is used
