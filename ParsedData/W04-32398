 and di (EL i=1 di = 1, di &gt; 0) is a normalized weight assigned to xi.
    Given T, find the optimal rule (&#710;t, &#710;y) that maximizes the gain, i.e., The most naive and exhaustive method, in which we first enumerate all subtrees F and then calculate the gains for all subtrees, is usually impractical, since the number of subtrees is exponential to its size.
    We thus adopt an alternative strategy to avoid such exhaustive enumeration.
    The method to find the optimal rule is modeled as a variant of the branch-and-bound algorithm, and is summarized in the following strategies: We will describe these steps more precisely in the following subsections.
    Abe and Zaki independently proposed an efficient method, rightmost-extension, to enumerate all subtrees from a given tree (Abe et al., 2002; Zaki, 2002).
    First, the algorithm starts with a set of trees consisting of single nodes, and then expands a given tree of size (k &#8722; 1) by attaching a new node to this tree to obtain trees of size k. Ho
