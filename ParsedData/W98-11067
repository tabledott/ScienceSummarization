nteraction and used the case frames exactly as they were generated.
    The purpose of the selectional restrictions is to constrain the types of information that can be instantiated by each slot.
    Consequently, we hoped that the case frames would be more reliably instantiated than the extraction patterns, thereby producing fewer false hits.
    To evaluate the case frames, we used the same corpus and evaluation metrics as previous experiments with AutoSlog and AutoSlog- TS (Riloff, 1996b) so that we can draw comparisons between them.
    For training, we used the 1500 MUC- 4 development texts to generate the extraction patterns and the semantic lexicon.
    AutoSlog-TS generated 44,013 extraction patterns in its first pass.
    After discarding the patterns that occurred only once, the remaining 11,517 patterns were applied to the corpus for the second pass and ranked for manual We reviewed the top 2168 and kept 306 extraction patterns for the final dictionary.
    We built a semantic lexicon for nine cate
