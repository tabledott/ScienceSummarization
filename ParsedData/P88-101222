an simply introduce a predicate which stands for all the remaining properties.
    It will never be provable, but it will be assumable.
    Thus, we can rewrite (5) as Then the fact that something is fluid can be used as evidence for its being lube oil.
    With the weights distributed according to semantic contribution, we can go to extremes and use an axiom like to allow us to use the fact that something is a mammal as (weak) evidence that it is an elephant.
    In principle, one should try to prove the entire logical form of the sentence and the constraints at once.
    In this global strategy, any heuristic ordering of the individual problems is done by the theorem prover.
    From a practical point of view, however, the global strategy generally takes longer, sometimes significantly so, since it presents the theorem-prover with a longer expression to be proved.
    We have experimented both with this strategy and with a bottom-up strategy in which, for example, we try to identify the lube oil before tryi
