etrieve relevant example sentences illustrating the suggested correction.
			For each suggestion, we create an exact string query including a small window of context to the left and to the right of the suggested correction.
			The query is issued to a search engine, and the retrieved results are separated into sentences.
			Those sentences that contain the string query are added to a list of example candidates.
			The candidates are then ranked by two initially implemented criteria: Sentence length (shorter examples are preferred in order to reduce cognitive load) and context overlap (sentences that contain additional words from the user input are preferred).
