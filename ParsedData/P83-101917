    Once the lexical analysis is complete, The phrase structure tree is constructed on the basis of pattern-action rules using two internal data structures: 1) a push-down stack of incomplete nodes, and 2) a buffer of complete constituents, into which the grammar rules can look through a window of three constituents.
    The parser matches rule patterns to the configuration of the window and stack.
    Its basic actions include &#8212; starting to build a new node by pushing a category onto the stack &#8212; attaching the first element of the window to the stack &#8212; dropping subtrees from the stack into the first position in the window when they are complete.
    The parser proceeds deterministically in the sense that no aspect of the tree structure, once built may be altered by any rule.
    (See Marcus 1980 for a comprehensive discussion of this theory of parsing.)
