 the set of all suxifiacy trees adjoisable at u. I~--~amp~ 2.4: Let G == (I~.)
  be u TAG with I~  constraints where I: a I t S C~) / ~t s S (B2) I I a b 84 s (~t )  s (~=) I   I I  I a S (?~) (?~) S h In a t no anxiliary trees can be adjoined to the root node.
  Only ~t is adjoinable to the left S node at depth 1 and only ~= is adjoinable to the right S node at depth 1.
  In ~t only BI is adjoinuhie at the root node and uo auxiliary trees ate adjoinable at the ~.~,~ node.
  Similarly for ~2.
  We must now modify our definition of adjoining to take care o( the local constraints, given a tree "7 with a node, say, is, labelled A and given an auxiliary tree, say,/J, with the root node labelled A, we define adjoining as follows.
  ~ is adjoinable to "y at the node n if B E ~, where ~ is the constraint associated with the node u in "7.
  The result of adjoining d to ~ will be as defined in earlier, except hat the constraint C ~.~sociated with u will be replaced by C, the constraint ?ssociated with the root node or
