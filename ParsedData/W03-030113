rill, 2001), highly benefits from large amounts of training data.
    Increased performance is therefore expected when larger training data sets are available.
    The only evaluation set where Romanian-English data leads to better performance is the Probable alignments set.
    We believe however that these figures are not directly comparable, since the English-French Probable alignments were obtained as a reunion of the alignments assigned by two different annotators, while for the Romanian-English Probable set two annotators had to reach an agreement (that is, an intersection of their individual alignment assignments).
    Interestingly, in an overall evaluation, the limited resources systems seem to lead to better results than those with unlimited resources.
    Out of 28 different evaluation figures, 20 top ranked figures are provided by systems with limited resources.
    This suggests that perhaps using a large number of additional resources does not seem to improve a lot over the case when only parall
