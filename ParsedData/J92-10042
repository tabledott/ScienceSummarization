t, agreement, and semantic constraints.
    TINA provides an automatic sentence generation capability that has been effective for identifying overgeneralization problems as well as in producing a word-pair language model for a recognizer.
    The parser is currently integrated with MIT's SUMMIT recognizer for use in two application domains, with the parser screening recognizer outputs either at the sentential level or to filter partial theories during the active search process.
  
  
    Over the past few years, there has been a gradual paradigm shift in speech recognition research both in the U.S. and in Europe.
    In addition to continued research on the transcription problem, i.e., the conversion of the speech signal to text, many researchers have begun to address as well the problem of speech understanding.1 This shift is at least partly brought on by the realization that many of the applications involving human/machine interface using speech require an &amp;quot;understanding&amp;quot; of the intended m
