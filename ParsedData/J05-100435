es represent an important resource in their own right.
  We were able to use membership in a VerbNet class which already had consistent framing to project accurate frames files for up to 300 verbs.
  If the overlap between VerbNet and PropBank had been more than 50%, this number might have been higher.
  4.2 Annotation We begin the annotation process by running a rule-based argument tagger (Palmer, Rosenzweig, and Cotton 2001) on the corpus.
  This tagger incorporates an extensive lexicon, entirely separate from that used by PropBank, which encodes class-based 84 Figure 1 Split constituents: In this case, a single semantic role label points to multiple nodes in the original treebank tree.
  Computational Linguistics Volume 31, Number 1 85 mappings between grammatical and semantic roles.
  The rule-based tagger achieved 83% accuracy on pilot data, with many of the errors due to differing assumptions made in defining the roles for a particular verb.
  The output of this tagger is then corrected by hand.
