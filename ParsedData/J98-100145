s, work on WSD continued, most notably in the Harvard &amp;quot;disambiguation project&amp;quot; for content analysis (Stone et al. 1966; Stone 1969), and also in the work of Iker (1974, 1975), Choueka and Dreizin (1976) and Choueka and Goldberg (1979).
    In the context of the shift away from the use of corpora and empirical methods, the work of Weiss (1973) and Kelley and Stone (1975) on the automatic extraction of knowledge for word sense disambiguation seems especially innovative.
    Weiss (1973) demonstrated that disambiguation rules can be learned from a manually sense-tagged corpus.
    Despite the small size of his study (five words, a training set of 20 sentences for each word, and 30 test sentences for each word), Weiss's results are encouraging (90% correct).
    Kelley and Stone's (1975) work, which grew out of the Harvard &amp;quot;disambiguation project&amp;quot; for content analysis, is on a much larger scale; they extract KWIC concordances for 1,800 ambiguous words from a corpus of a half-mi
