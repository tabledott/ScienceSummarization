    If word pairs have probabilities attached to them, then word ordering resembles the finding the least-cost circuit, also known as the Traveling Salesman Problem.
    Salesman Problem.
    It introduces edge costs c111 and seeks a minimum-cost circuit.
    By viewing edge costs as log probabilities, we can cast the Traveling Salesman Problem as one of optimizing P(e), that is, of finding the best source word order in Model 1 decoding.
    4.2 Reduction 2 (from Minimum Set Cover Problem) The Minimum Set Cover Problem asks: given a collection C of subsets of finite set S. and integer n, does C contain a cover for S of size &lt; n, i.e., a subcollection whose union is S?
    We now transform any instance of Minimum Set Cover into an instance of M1-DECIDE, using polynomial time.
    This time, we assume a rather neutral source model in which all strings of a given length are equally likely, but we construct a mor
