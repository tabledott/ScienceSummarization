   Together the three constituents of discourse structure supply the information needed by the CPs to determine how an individual utterance fits with the rest of the discourse &#8212; in essence, enabling them to figure out why it was said and what it means.
    The context provided by these constituents also forms the basis for certain expectations about what is to come; these expectations play a role in accommodating new utterances.
    The attentional state serves an additional purpose: namely, it furnishes the means for actually using the information in the other two structures in generating and interpreting individual utterances.
    The first component of discourse structure is the structure of the sequence of utterances that comprise a discourse.1 Just as the words in a single sentence form constituent phrases, the utterances in a discourse are naturally aggregated into discourse segments.
    The utterances in a segment, like the words in a phrase, serve particular roles with respect to that segment.
