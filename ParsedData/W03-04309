 the model&#8217;s expected value: (&#732;E[fk]&#8722;EA[fk])N. The last term is the derivative of the Gaussian prior.
  
  
    PA( Typically the features, fk, are based on some number of hand-crafted atomic observational tests (such as word is capitalized or word is &#8220;said&#8221;, or word appears in lexicon of country names), and a large collection of features is formed by making conjunctions of the atomic tests in certain user-defined patterns; (for example, the conjunctions consisting of all tests at the current sequence position conjoined with all tests at the position one step ahead&#8212;specifically, for instance, current word is capitalized and next word is &#8220;Inc&#8221;).
    There can easily be over 100,000 atomic tests (mostly based on tests for the identity of words in the vocabulary), and ten or more shifted-conjunction patterns&#8212;resulting in several million features (Sha and Pereira, 2003).
    This large number of features can be prohibitively expensive in memory and computation;
