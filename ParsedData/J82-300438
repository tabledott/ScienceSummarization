VP = V (N E Cati+i(P N)i)(E adj') so that the parser can also find VPs by just counting coccurrences of terminal symbols.
    Now we simplify (40a-b) so that S phrases can also be parsed by just counting occurrences of terminal symbols.
    First, translate (40a-b) into the equation: Furthermore, the number of parse trees for a given input sentence can be found by multiplying three numbers: (a) the Catalan of the number of P N's before the verb, (b) the Catalan of one more than the number of P N's after the verb, and (c) the ramp of the number of adj's.
    For example, the sentence (53) The man on the hill saw the boy with a telescope yesterday in the morning. has Cat * Cat2 * 3 = 6 parses.
    That is, there is one way to parse &amp;quot;the man on the hill,&amp;quot; two ways to parse &amp;quot;saw the boy with a telescope&amp;quot; (&amp;quot;telescope&amp;quot; is either a complement of &amp;quot;see&amp;quot; as in (54a-c) or is attached to &amp;quot;boy&amp;quot; as in (54d-f)), and three ways to parse
