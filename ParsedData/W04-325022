m 100 sentences to 3000 sentences.
    As described earlier, the systems translate aligned test sentences from different source languages into English.
    First, we want to answer the questions: How often can we draw conclusions with 95% statistical significance?
    How often are we correct?
    Even for small test sets of size 300 sentences (about 9000 words), we can reliably draw the right conclusion, if the true BLEU score difference is at level and accuracy of the conclusions. least 2-3%.
    Note that we make no general statements about relation of test set size and statistical significance BLEU score differences, this particular finding is specific to our test scenario and depends highly on how similar the systems are.
    Only one conclusion is wrong for test sets of size 300 &#8211; the already mentioned conclusion that the Danish system outperforms the Portuguese system.
    For test sets with only 100 sentences, we observer more false conclusions, which suggests that this might be too small for a
