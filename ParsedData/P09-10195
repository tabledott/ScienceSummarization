e cost function of any candidate translation can be represented as a line in the plane if the initial parameter set &#955;M is shifted along a direction dM .
    Let C = {E1, ..., EK} denote a set of candidate translations, then computing the best scoring translation hypothesis E&#65533; out of C results in the following optimization problem: as the independent variable.
    For any particuthe decoder seeks that translation which yields the largest score and therefore corresponds to the topmost line segment.
    If to +oo, other translation hypotheses may at some point constitute the topmost line segments and thus change the decision made by the decoder.
    The entire sequence of topmost line segments is called upper envelope and provides an exhaustive representation of all possible outcomes that the decoder may yield if is shifted along the chosen direction.
    Both the translations and their corresponding line segments can efficiently be computed without incorporating any error criterion.
    Once the env
