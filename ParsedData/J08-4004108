ement was statistically significant, and provide a confusion matrix or agreement table so that readers can find out whether overall figures of agreement hide disagreements on less common categories.
    For an example of good practice in this respect, see Teufel and Moens (2002).
    The decision whether a corpus is good enough for publication should be based on more than the agreement score&#8212;specifically, an important consideration is an independent evaluation of the results that are based on the corpus.
