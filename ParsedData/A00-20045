eil and Denos, 1992).
    'The contrast of the image has been adjusted to highlight the image features.
    Each value in the similarity matrix is replaced by its rank in the local region.
    The rank is the number of neighbouring elements with a lower similarity value.
    Figure 2 shows an example of image ranking using a 3 x 3 rank mask with output range {0, 8).
    For segmentation, we used a 11 x 11 rank mask.
    The output is expressed as a ratio r (equation 2) to circumvent normalisation problems (consider the cases when the rank mask is not contained in the image).
    # of elements with a lower value To demonstrate the effect of image ranking, the process was applied to the matrix shown in figure 1 to produce figure 32.
    Notice the contrast has been improved significantly.
    Figure 4 illustrates the more subtle effects of our ranking scheme. r(x) is the rank (1 x 11 mask) of (x) which is a sine wave with decaying mean, amplitude and frequency (equation 3).
    The final process determines the
