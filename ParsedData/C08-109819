mentary lexicon for the corpus to be pro cessed.In case of the TnT tagger, the entries of the supplementary lexicon were added to the regular lexicon with a default frequency of 1 if the word/tagpair was unknown, and with a frequency propor tional to the prior probability of the tag if the wordwas unknown.
			This strategy returned the best results on the development data.
			In case of the SVM Tool, we were not able to successfully integrate the supplementary lexicon.
			5.1.1 Refined Tagset Prepositions are not annotated with case in theTiger treebank, although this information is impor tant for the disambiguation of the case of the next noun phrase.
			In order to provide the tagger with some information about the case of prepositions, a second training corpus was created in which prepositions which always select the same case, such as durch (through), were annotated with thiscase (APPR.Acc).
			Prepositions which select gen itive case, but also occur with dative case 8 , were tagged with APPR.Gen. The mor
