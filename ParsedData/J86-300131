 FS3 has been pushed onto it because the DSP of DS3, DSP3, is dominated solely by DSPi, not by DSP2.
    In this example, the intentional structure includes only dominance relationships, although, it may, in general, also include satisfaction-precedence relationships.
    The stacking of focus spaces reflects the relative salience of the entities in each space during the corresponding segment's portion of the discourse.
    The stack relationships arise from the ways in which the various DSPs relate; information about such relationships is represented in the dominance hierarchy (depicted on the right in the figure).
    The spaces in Figure 1 are&#8226; snapshots illustrating the results of a sequence of operations, such as pushes onto and pops from a stack.
    A push occurs when the DSP for a new segment contributes to the DSP for the immediately preceding segment.
    When the DSP contributes to some intention higher in the dominance hierarchy, several focus spaces are popped from the stack before the new
