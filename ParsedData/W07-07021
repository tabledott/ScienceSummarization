ility to incorporate the generalisations implicit insyntactic knowledge and they do not respect linguistic phrase boundaries.
			This makes it difficult to im prove reordering in phrase-based models.
			Syntax-based models can overcome some of theproblems associated with phrase-based models because they are able to capture the long range struc tural mappings that occur in translation.
			Recently 1www.nist.gov/speech/tests/mt/mt06eval official results.html there have been a few syntax-based models that show performance comparable to the phrase-basedmodels (Chiang, 2005; Marcu et al, 2006).
			How ever, reliably learning powerful rules from parallel data is very difficult and prone to problems with sparsity and noise in the data.
			These models also suffer from a large search space when decoding with an integrated language model, which can lead to search errors (Chiang, 2005).In this paper we investigate the idea of incorporating syntax into phrase-based models, thereby lever aging the strengths of both the p
