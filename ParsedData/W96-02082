nse disambiguation have also demonstrated similar performance (Leacock, Towell, &amp; Voorhees, 1993b; Lehman, 1994).
    However, in a comparison of neural-network and decision-tree methods on learning to generate the past tense of an English verb, decision trees performed significantly better (Ling &amp; Marinov, 1993; Ling, 1994).
    Subsequent experiments on this problem have demonstrated that an inductive logic programming method produces even better results than decision trees (Mooney &amp; Califf, 1995).
    In this paper, we present direct comparisons of a fairly wide range of general learning algorithms on the problem of discriminating six senses of the word &amp;quot;line&amp;quot; from context, using data assembled by Leacock et al. (1993b).
    We compare a naive Bayesian classifier (Duda &amp; Hart, 1973), a perceptron (Rosenblatt, 1962), a decision-tree learner (Quinlan, 1993), a k nearest-neighbor classifier (Cover &amp; Hart, 1967), logic-based DNF (disjunctive normal form) and CNF (conjuncti
