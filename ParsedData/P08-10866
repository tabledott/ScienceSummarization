mputed for each of these tentative moves and the exchange leading to the highest increase in the optimization criterion (3) is performed.
    This procedure is then repeated until the algorithm reaches a local optimum.
    To be able to efficiently calculate the changes in the optimization criterion when exchanging a word, the counts in Eq.
    (3) are computed once for the initial clustering, stored, and afterwards updated when a word is exchanged.
    Often only a limited number of iterations are performed, as letting the algorithm terminate in a local optimum can be computationally impractical.
    The implementation described in (Martin et al., 1998) uses a memory saving technique introducing a binary search into the complexity estimation.
    For the sake of simplicity, we omit this detail in the following complexity analysis.
    We also do not employ this optimization in our implementation.
    The worst case complexity of the exchange algorithm is quadratic in the number of classes.
    However, Input
