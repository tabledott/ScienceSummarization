hereafter referred to as VPCs) consist of a head verb and one or more obligatory particles, in the form of intransitive prepositions (e.g. hand in), adjectives (e.g. cut short) or verbs (e.g. let go) .
    Here, we focus exclusively on prepositional particles due to their high productivity and variable compositionality.
    Examples of prepositional VPCs are put up, finish up, gun down and make out as used in the following sentences: VPCs cause significant problems for NLP systems.
    Semantically, they often cannot be understood through the simple composition of their independent parts.
    Compare, for example, sentences (1) and (4).
    In (1), the meaning seems to be that Peter put the picture somewhere and that as a consequence the picture was up.
    That is, the verb and the particle make independent contributions to the sentence.
    A (partial) Parsons-style semantic analysis of this might be as follows: Sentence (4), on the other hand requires a rather different analysis.
