 like to commit also to scores that are more in the extremes of the available range.
    Since the quality estimation task would be negatively influenced by having most of the scores in the middle of the range, we have chosen to compute the final effort scores as an weighted average between the three PE-effort scores, with more weight given to the judges with higher standard deviation from their own mean score.
    We have used weights 3, 2, and 1 for the three PE-effort judges according to this criterion.
    There is an additional advantage resulting from this weighted average score: instead of obtaining average numbers only at values x.0, x.33, and x.66 (for unweighted average)7, the weighted averages are spread more evenly in the range [1, 5].
    A few variations of the training data were provided, including version with cases restored and a version detokenized.
    In addition, engine-internal information from Moses such as phrase and word alignments, detailed model scores, etc.
