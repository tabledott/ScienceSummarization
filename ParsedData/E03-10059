this PCFG-reduction, which is heavily based on Goodman (2002).
    Goodman assigns every node in every tree a unique number which is called its address.
    The notation A@k denotes the node at address k where A is the nonterminal labeling that node.
    A new nonterminal is created for each node in the training data.
    This nonterminal is called A k. Nonterminals of this form are called &amp;quot;interior&amp;quot; nonterminals, while the original nonterminals in the parse trees are called &amp;quot;exterior&amp;quot; nontermimals.
    Let aj represent the number of subtrees headed by the node A@j.
    Let a represent the number of subtrees headed by nodes with nonterminal A, that is a =Ej aj.
    Goodman (1996, 2002) further illustrates this by a node A @j of the following form: To see how many subtrees it has, Goodman first considers the possibilities of the left branch.
    There are bk non-trivial subtrees headed by B@k, and there is also the trivial case where the left node is simply B.
    Thus there
