ual judgments on Mechanical Turk.
  
  
    In this section we report on a number of creative uses of Mechanical Turk to do more sophisticated tasks.
    We give evidence that Turkers can create high quality translations for some languages, which would make creating multiple reference translations for Bleu less costly than using professional translators.
    We report on experiments evaluating translation quality with HTER and with reading comprehension tests.
    In addition to evaluating machine translation quality, we also investigated the possibility of using Mechanical Turk to create additional reference translations for use with automatic metrics like Bleu.
    Before trying this, we were skeptical that Turkers would have sufficient language skills to produce translations.
    Our translation HIT had the following instructions: We solicited translations for 50 sentences in French, German, Spanish, Chinese and Urdu, and designed the HIT so that five Turkers would translate each sentence.
