 The association of NE classes and slots in the template is made automatically; Person, Organization, Post (slots) correspond to C-PERSON, CORG, C-POST (NE-classes), respectively, in the Succession scenario, and Suspect, Arresting Agency, Charge (slots) correspond to C-PERSON, C-ORG, C-OFFENCE (NE-classes), respectively, in the Arrest scenario.
    10 For each model, we get a list of the pattern candidates ordered by the ranking function discussed in Section 3.3 after filtering.
    The result of the performance is shown (Figure 3) as a precision-recall graph for each subset of top- ranked patterns where ranges from 1 to the number of the pattern candidates.
    The test set was accumulated from Mainichi Newspaper in 1996 by a simple keyword search, with some additional irrelevant documents.
    (See Table 1 for detail.)
    Figure 3(a) shows the precision-recall curve of top- relevant extraction patterns for each model on the Succession Scenario.
    At lower recall levels (up to 35%), all the models perform
