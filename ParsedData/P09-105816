studies on joint Chinese word segmentation and POS tagging have used Penn Chinese Treebank (CTB) (Xia et al., 2000) in experiments.
    However, versions of CTB and experimental settings vary across different studies.
    In this paper, we used CTB 5.0 (LDC2005T01) as our main corpus, defined the training, development and test sets according to (Jiang et al., 2008a; Jiang et al., 2008b), and designed our experiments to explore the impact of the training corpus size on our approach.
    Table 5 provides the statistics of our experimental settings on the small and large training data.
    The out-of-vocabulary (OOV) is defined as tokens in the test set that are not in the training set (Sproat and Emerson, 2003).
    Note that the development set was only used for evaluating the trained model to obtain the optimal values of tunable parameters.
    We evaluated both word segmentation (Seg) and joint word segmentation and POS tagging (Seg &amp; Tag).
    We used recall (R), precision (P), and F1 as evaluation metr
