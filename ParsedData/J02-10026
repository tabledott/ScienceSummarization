t there is an inherent trade-off between precision and recall; improving one tends to cause the score for the other to decline.
    In the segmentation example, positing more boundaries will tend to improve the recall but at the same time reduce the precision.
    Some evaluators use a weighted combination of the two known as the F-measure (Baeza-Yates and Ribeiro-Neto 1999), but this is difficult to interpret (Beeferman, Berger, and Lafferty 1999).
    Another approach is to plot a precision-recall curve, showing the scores for precision at different levels of recall.
    Two hypothetical segmentations of the same reference (ground truth) document segmentation.
    The boxes indicate sentences or other units of subdivision, and spaces between boxes indicate potential boundary locations.
    Algorithm A-0 makes two near misses, while Algorithm A-1 misses both boundaries by a wide margin and introduces three false positives.
    Both algorithms would receive scores of 0 for both precision and recall.
