  It operates by sampling pages from each domain and identifying their languages; if a domain is deemed to be multilingual, all pages on the site are crawled exhaustively.
    BITS appears to consider all possible combinations of Web page pairs in the two languages (i.e., the full cross product within each site) and filters out bad pairs by using a large bilingual dictionary to compute a content-based similarity score and comparing that score to a threshold.
    For each page pair, the similarity score is number of translation token pairs number of tokens in A Translation token pairs are considered within a fixed window (i.e., a distance-based measure of co-occurrence is used).5 In addition to cross-lingual lexical matching, BITS filters out candidate pairs that do not match well in terms of file size, anchors (numbers, acronyms, and some named entities), or paragraph counts.
