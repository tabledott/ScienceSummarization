he dictionary have only a single spelling that for the most part agrees with our gold-standard.
    Also, most of the names in the dictionary are English names and with English names the human evaluator was rigid, mostly accepting only the exact-matching spelling.
  
  
    We have presented and evaluated a transliteration algorithm using phonetic-based and spelling-based nation on the development and blind test sets by category.
    The evaluation is based on human-subjective evaluation. models.
    This algorithm is most accurate on backtransliterating English names.
    The reason for this is that most names in the dictionary are of English origin.
    Hence, the language model was mostly trained on English names.
    One way to improve transliterations of non-English names is to train the language model on a list of non-English names in addition to the dictionary names.
    Our current models do not deal with the issue of metathesis (e.g., metathesis of v and r between the spelling and the pronunciation o
