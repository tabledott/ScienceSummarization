 the translated text.
    When compared with the gold-standard, nearly half of the phrases in the development test set and more than a third of the blind test were translated incorrectly by the commercial system.
    The errors can be classified into several categories including: poor transliterations (e.g., Koln Baol vs. Colin Powell), translating a name instead of sounding it out (e.g., O&#8217;Neill&#8217;s urine vs. Paul O&#8217;Neill), wrong translation (e.g., Joint Corners Organization vs. Joint Chiefs of Staff) or wrong word order (e.g.,the Church of the Orthodox Roman).
    Table 2 shows a detailed comparison of the translation accuracy between our system, the commercial system, and the human translators.
    The translations obtained by our system show significant improvement over the commercial system.
    In fact, in some cases it outperforms the human translator.
    When we consider the top-20 translations, our system&#8217;s overall accuracy (84%) is higher than the human&#8217;s (75.3%) on the
