ally many derivations d. But Figure 2 sums over these derivations in time only linear on the size of the hypergraph.
    Its correctness relies on axiomatic properties of the semiring: namely, &#8853; is associative and commutative with identity 0, &#8855; is associative with two-sided identity 1, and &#8855; distributes over &#8853; from both sides.
    The distributive property is what makes Figure 2 work.
    The other properties are necessary to ensure that The algorithm in Figure 2 is general and can be applied with any semiring (e.g., Viterbi).
    Below, we present our novel semirings.
  
  
    We now introduce the computational problems of this paper and the semirings we use to solve them.
    We are given a function p : D &#8594; R&gt;0, which decomposes multiplicatively over component hyperedges e of a derivation d &#8712; D: that is, p(d) def = eEd pe.
    In practice, p(d) will specify a probability distribution over the derivations in the hyper2Eisner (2002) uses closed semirings that are also e
