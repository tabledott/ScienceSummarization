 We show the precision, recall, and F-measure independently measured for the subjective, objective, and all sentences.
    We also evaluated a variation of the rule-based classifier that labels a sentence as objective if there are at most three weak expressions in the previous, current, and next sentence combined, which raises the recall of the objective classifier.
    Our attempts to increase the recall of the subjective classifier all resulted in significant loss in precision, and thus we kept the original heuristic.
    In its original English implementation, this system was proposed as being high-precision but low coverage.
    Evaluated on the MPQA corpus, it has subjective precision of 90.4, subjective recall of 34.2, objective precision of 82.4, and objective recall of 30.7; overall, precision is 86.7 and recall is 32.6 (Wiebe and Riloff, 2005).
    We see a similar behavior on Romanian for subjective sentences.
    The subjective precision is good, albeit at the cost of low recall, and thus the class
