 where 1 &gt; A+ &gt; A &gt; A- &gt; 0, has only one clearly visible global maximum.
    This global maximum can be found by standard hill-climbing methods, as long as the step size is large enough to avoid getting stuck on the pebbles.
    Given estimates for A+ and A- , we can compute B(ku,v Inu,v, A+) and B(ku,vin&#8222;,v, A- ).
    These are probabilities that ku,v) links were generated by an algorithm that generates correct links and by an algorithm that generates incorrect links, respectively, out of n(&#8222;,,v) co-occurrences.
    The ratio of these probabilities is the likelihood ratio in favor of u and v being mutual translations, for all u and v:
  
  
    In the basic word-to-word model, the hidden parameters A+ and A- depend only on the distributions of link frequencies generated by the competitive linking algorithm.
    More accurate models can be induced by taking into account various features of the linked tokens.
    For example, frequent words are translated less consistently than rare wor
