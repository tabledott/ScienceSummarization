y are carefully following written instructions, but because they know the purpose of the research very well&#8212;which makes it virtually impossible for others to reproduce the results on the basis of the same coding scheme (the problems arising when using experts were already discussed at length in Carletta [1996]).
    Practices which violate the third requirement (independence) include asking coders to discuss their judgments with each other and reach their decisions by majority vote, or to consult with each other when problems not foreseen in the coding instructions arise.
    Any of these practices make the resulting data unusable for measuring reproducibility.
    Krippendorff&#8217;s own summary of his recommendations is that to obtain usable data for measuring reproducibility a researcher must use data generated by three or more coders, chosen according to some clearly specified criteria, and working independently according to a written coding scheme and coding instructions fixed in advance.
