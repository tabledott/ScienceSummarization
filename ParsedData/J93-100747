    Cass' takes input sentences labeled with part of speech and attempts to identify syntactic structure.
    One of the subtasks performed by Cass is to identify predicate argument relations, and this is the task we are interested in here.
    Stage 3 works in the following three steps.
    All the syntactic labels produced by Cass on sentence (10).
    Identical to what we did at Stage 2, Step 2.1.
    Given a pair of words w and w,, a distance of the two words (optional), and a tagged corpus, Xtract produces all the (tagged) sentences containing them in the given position specified by the distance.
    Input: Output of Step 3.1.
    A set of tagged sentences each containing both w and w,.
    Output: For each sentence, a set of syntactic labels such as those shown in Figure 9.
    Discussion: Cass is called on the concordances.
    From Cass output, we only retrieve binary syntactic relations (or labels) such as &amp;quot;verb&#8212;object&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;verb&#8212;subject,&amp;quot; &
