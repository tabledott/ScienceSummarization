  As discussed in (Agirre et al., 2000), we propose using an existing ontology such as SENSUS (Knight and Luk, 1994) to identify signature term relations.
  The external hierarchical framework can be used to generalize topic signatures and suggest richer rep- resentations for topic signatures.
  Automated entity recognizers can be used to (:lassify unknown enti- ties into their appropriate SENSUS concept nodes.
  We are also investigating other approaches to attto- matieally learn signature term relations.
  The idea mentioned in this paper is just a starting point.
