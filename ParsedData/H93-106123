 a semantic oncordance would be for people trying to learn English as a second language.
  By providing them with the appropriate sense of an unfamiliar word, they are spared the task of selecting a sense from the several alternatives listed in a standard ic- tionary.
  Moreover, they can retrieve other sentences that illustrate the same usage of the word, and from such sen- tences they can acquire both local and topical information about the use of a word: (1) local information about the grammatical constructions in which that word can express the given concept, and (2) topical information about other words that are likely to be used when that concept is dis- cussed.
  A use for specific semantic oncordances would be in sci- ence education!
  much of the new learning demanded of beginning students in any field of science is terminological.
  Sense Frequencies Much attention has been paid to word frequencies, but rela- tively little to the frequencies of occurrence of different meanings.
