t of vertices and set of edges , where is a subset of .
    For a given vertex , let be the set of vertices that point to it (predecessors), and let be the set of vertices that vertex points to (successors).
    The score of a vertex is defined as follows (Brin and Page, 1998): where is a damping factor that can be set between 0 and 1, which has the role of integrating into the model the probability of jumping from a given vertex to another random vertex in the graph.
    In the context of Web surfing, this graph-based ranking algorithm implements the &#8220;random surfer model&#8221;, where a user clicks on links at random with a probability , and jumps to a completely new page with probability .
    The factor is usually set to 0.85 (Brin and Page, 1998), and this is the value we are also using in our implementation.
    Starting from arbitrary values assigned to each node in the graph, the computation iterates until convergence below a given threshold is achieved 1.
    After running the algorithm, a score
