  Automatic Construction Of A Hypernym-Labeled Noun Hierarchy From Text
  
    Previous work has shown that automatic methods can be used in building semantic lexicons.
    This work goes a step further by automatically creating not just clusters of related words, but a hierarchy of nouns and their hypernyms, akin to the hand-built hierarchy in WordNet.
  
  
    The purpose of this work is to build something like the hypernym-labeled noun hierarchy of WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998) automatically from text using no other lexical resources.
    WordNet has been an important research tool, but it is insufficient for domainspecific text, such as that encountered in the MUCs (Message Understanding Conferences).
    Our work develops a labeled hierarchy based on a text corpus.
    In this project, nouns are clustered into a hierarchy using data on conjunctions and appositives appearing in the Wall Street Journal.
    The internal nodes of the resulting tree are then labeled with hypernyms for the nouns clustered undern
