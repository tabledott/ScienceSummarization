    For example, in the sentence Mary took a picture to Bob, the fact that photography does not normally have a destination (negative role-related information) should override the support for the 'photograph' interpretation of took a picture given by collocation analysis.

    Our strategy for combining the preferences described in the preceding sections is to rate most highly the sense with the strongest combination of supporting cues.
    The system assigns each preference cue a strength, an integer value between +10 and -10, and then sums these strengths to find the sense with the highest rating.
    The streng
