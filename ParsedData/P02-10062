    In this paper we present an approach for automatically learning such regular expressions (along with determining their precision) from the web, for given types of questions.
    Our method uses the machine learning technique of bootstrapping to build a large tagged corpus starting with only a few examples of QA pairs.
    Similar techniques have been investigated extensively in the field of information extraction (Riloff, 96).
    These techniques are greatly aided by the fact that there is no need to hand-tag a corpus, while the abundance of data on the web makes it easier to determine reliable statistical estimates.
    Our system assumes each sentence to be a simple sequence of words and searches for repeated word orderings as evidence for useful answer phrases.
    We use suffix trees for extracting substrings of optimal length.
    We borrow the idea of suffix trees from computational biology (Gusfield, 97) where it is primarily used for detecting DNA sequences.
