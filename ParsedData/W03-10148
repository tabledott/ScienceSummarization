f our hypotheses was that extraction patterns would be able to represent subjective expressions that have noncompositional meanings.
    For example, consider the common expression drives (someone) up the wall, which expresses the feeling of being annoyed with something.
    The meaning of this expression is quite different from the meanings of its individual words (drives, up, wall).
    Furthermore, this expression is not a fixed word sequence that could easily be captured by N-grams.
    It is a relatively flexible construction that may be more generally represented as &lt;x&gt; drives &lt;y&gt; up the wall, where x and y may be arbitrary noun phrases.
    This pattern would match many different sentences, such as &#8220;George drives me up the wall,&#8221; &#8220;She drives the mayor up the wall,&#8221; or &#8220;The nosy old man drives his quiet neighbors up the wall.&#8221; We also wondered whether the extraction pattern representation might reveal slight variations of the same verb or noun phrase that
