nferential Model (IIM) Our independent model is the same as the joint model above except that it computes candidate inferential SPs using the Independent Relational Model (IRM) instead of the JRM.
    Consider the same example relations pi and pj from the joint model and suppose that the IRM gives the following relational SP scores for pi: and the following relational SP scores for pj: Given an inference rule pi =&gt; pj and the instance (x, pi, y), the system&#8217;s task is to determine whether (x, pj, y) is valid.
    Let C(w) be the set of semantic classes c(w) to which word w belongs.
    Below we present three filtering algorithms which range from the least to the most permissive: Since both JIM and IIM use a ranking score in their inferential SPs, each filtering algorithm can be tuned to be more or less strict by setting an acceptance threshold on the ranking scores or by selecting only the top i percent highest ranking SPs.
    In our experiments, reported in Section 5, we tested each model using vari
