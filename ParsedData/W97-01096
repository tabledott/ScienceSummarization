icult to establish distances between them.
    The PP attachment also depends on the selection of word senses and vice versa, as will be shown in the result section.
    A number of other researchers have explored corpus-based approaches to PP attachment that make use of word classes.
    For examples, Weischedel [W91] and Basil [B91] both describe the use of manually constructed, domain specific word classes together with corpus-based statistics in order to resolve PP attachment ambiguity.
    Because these papers describe results obtained on different corpora, however, it is difficult to make a performance comparison.
    We will now discuss the issues connected with matching two different words based on their semantic distance.
    Employing the notion of semantic similarity, it is necessary to address a number of problems.
    At first, we have to specify the semantic hierarchy.
    Second, we need to determine how to calculate the distance between two different concepts in the hierarchy.
    Finally we m
