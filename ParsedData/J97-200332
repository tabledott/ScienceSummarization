   In many cases, the determinization algorithm can also be used to minimize a subsequential transducer; we describe this use of the algorithm and give the related proofs in the appendix.
    Recall that one can define a metric on E* by: where we denote by u A v the longest common prefix of two strings u and v in E*.
    The definition we gave for subsequential power series depends on the transducers representing them.
    The theorem that follows gives an intrinsic characterization of subsequential power series.'
    Theorem 9 Let S be a rational power series defined on the tropical semiring.
    S is subsequential iff it has bounded variation.
    Proof Assume that S is subsequential.
    Let T = (Q, i, F, E, 6,0&#8226;, A, p) be a subsequential transducer.
    8 denotes the transition function associated with 7-, a its output function, and A and p the initial and final weight functions.
    Let L be the maximum of the lengths of all output labels of T: and R the upper bound of all output differences at fin
