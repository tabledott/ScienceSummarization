a Chinese-English machine translation system.
    We used an automatic syntactic parser (Bikel, 2002) to produce the parallel parse trees.
    The parser was trained using the Penn English/Chinese Treebanks.
    We then used the algorithm in (Xia 2001) to convert the phrasal structure trees to dependency trees to acquire the parallel dependency trees.
    The statistics of the datasets we used are shown as follows: The training set consists of Xinhua newswire data from LDC and the FBIS data (mostly news), both filtered to ensure parallel sentence pair quality.
    We used the development test data from the 2001 NIST MT evaluation workshop as our test data for the MT system performance.
    In the testing data, each input Chinese sentence has 4 English translations as references.
    Our MT system was evaluated using the n-gram based Bleu (Papineni et al., 2002) and NIST machine translation evaluation software.
    We used the NIST software package &#8220;mteval&#8221; version 11a, configured as case-insensiti
