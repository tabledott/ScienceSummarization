datasets, we hypothesized that a combination of these classifiers should bring furtherimprovement.
			Experiment 5 therefore used all shal low and deep features together.
			However, the overallperformance of this classifier (see Column 5 in Ta ble 1) is not significantly better than either of the separate classifiers.
			Closer inspection of the results reveals that, in comparison to the shallow classifier, the hybrid classifier performs better or equally on all subsets but CD.
			In comparison to the deep classifier in Column 4, the hybrid classifier performs equallywell or better on all subsets apart from MT. Overall, this means more robust performance of the hy brid classifier over differently designed datasets and therefore more independence from dataset design.
			Experiment 6: Dependency on dataset designAs Eperiment 5 shows, simple combination of methods, while maybe more robust, will not necessar ily raise overall performance if the system does notknow when to apply which method.
			To test this hy p
