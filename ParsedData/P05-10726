using Charniak parses is about 3% absolute worse than when using TreeBank parses.
    On the other hand, argument identification performance using Charniak parses is about 12.7% absolute worse.
    Half of these errors &#8211; about 7% are due to missing constituents, and the other half &#8211; about 6% are due to mis-classifications.
    Motivated by this severe degradation in argument identification performance for automatic parses, we examined a number of techniques for improving argument identification.
    We made a number of changes to the system which resulted in improved performance.
    The changes fell into three categories: i) new features, ii) feature selection and calibration, and iii) combining parses from different syntactic representations.
  
  
    While the Path feature has been identified to be very important for the argument identification task, it is one of the most sparse features and may be difficult to train or generalize (Pradhan et al., 2004; Xue and Palmer, 2004).
