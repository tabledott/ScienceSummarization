  Maximum Entropy Based Phrase Reordering Model For Statistical Machine Translation
  
    We propose a novel reordering model for phrase-based statistical machine translation (SMT) that uses a maximum entropy (MaxEnt) model to predicate reorderings of neighbor blocks (phrase pairs).
    The model provides content-dependent, hierarchical phrasal reordering with generalization based on features automatically learned from a real-world bitext.
    We present an algorithm to extract all reordering events of neighbor blocks from bilingual data.
    In our experiments on Chineseto-English translation, this MaxEnt-based reordering model obtains significant improvements in BLEU score on the NIST MT-05 and IWSLT-04 tasks.
  
  
    Phrase reordering is of great importance for phrase-based SMT systems and becoming an active area of research recently.
    Compared with word-based SMT systems, phrase-based systems can easily address reorderings of words within phrases.
    However, at the phrase level, reordering is sti
