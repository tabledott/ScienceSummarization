 need not be constrained by the 15In the present approach, the default &amp;quot;expected Cb&amp;quot; is the (matrix) SUBJECT referent, and the Cb is established in the next utterance with a (matrix) (SUBJECT) pronoun, if there is one.
    More factors such as TOPIC (wa-marking) and Ident (see below) are also relevant to the centering in Japanese.
    These are discussed in the longer paper in preparation. property-sharing, as illustrated in the following examples: (18)-2 has only one pronoun and (19)-2 has two pronouns with different gender.
    In both cases, the nonSUBJECT pronoun naturally corefers with the previous SUBJECT.
    The property-sharing constraint becomes relevant only in the case of completely ambiguous multipronouns as in (17).
    Note that this in turn explains why the property-sharing was first recognized for zero pronominals, which lack gender/number/person distinctions altogether.
    Explicitly signalled parallelism.
    The second relevant type of parallelism effect is found in a di
