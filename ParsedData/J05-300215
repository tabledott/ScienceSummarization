rse trees) that can be automatically derived from a corpus to generate a fusion sentence.
    In our approach, sentence fusion is modeled after the typical generation pipeline: content selection (what to say) and surface realization (how to say it).
    In contrast to that involved in traditional generation systems in which a content selection component chooses content from semantic units, our task is complicated by the lack of semantics in the textual input.
    At the same time, we can benefit from the textual information given in the input sentences for the tasks of syntactic realization, phrasing, and ordering; in many cases, constraints on text realization are already present in the input.
    The algorithm operates in three phases: Content selection occurs primarily in the first phase, in which our algorithm uses local alignment across pairs of parsed sentences, from which we select fragments to be included in the fusion sentence.
    Instead of examining all possible ways to combine these fragments, we
