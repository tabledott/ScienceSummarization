e the similarity between two distribution vectors, The Pearson correlation coefficient was used in (Tao and Zhai, 2005); here we also considered two other commonly used measures &#8211; cosine (Salton and McGill, 1983), and Jensen-Shannon divergence (Lin, 1991), though our results show that Pearson correlation coefficient performs better than these two other methods.
    In both scoring methods described above, scoring of each candidate transliteration pair is independent of the other.
    As we have noted, document pairs that contain lots of plausible transliteration pairs should be viewed as more plausible document pairs; at the same time, in such a situation we should also trust the putative transliteration pairs more.
    Thus these document pairs and transliteration pairs mutually &#8220;reinforce&#8221; each other, and this can be exploited to further optimize our transliteration scores by allowing transliteration pairs to propagate their scores to each other according to their co-occurrence strengths.
