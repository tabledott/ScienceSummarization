anslations have to be provided for collocations, and should not be word-based but rather expression-based.
    Bilingual dictionaries are generally inadequate in dealing with such issues.
    They generally limit such context-sensitive translations to ambiguous words (e.g., &amp;quot;number&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;rock&amp;quot;) or highly complex words such as &amp;quot;make,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;have,&amp;quot; etc.
    Moreover, even in these cases, coverage is limited to semantic variants, and lexical collocations are generally omitted.
    One possible application is the development of compilation techniques for bilingual dictionaries.
    This would require compiling two monolingual collocational dictionaries and then developing some automatic or assisted translation methods.
    Those translation methods could be based on the statistical analysis of bilingual corpora currently available.
    A simple algorithm for translating collocations is given in Smadja (1992).
    Several other applications such as
