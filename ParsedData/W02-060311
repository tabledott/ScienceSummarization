it of the word into two parts is evaluated.
    The algorithm selects the split (or no split) that yields the minimum total cost.
    In case of no split, the processing of the word is finished and the next word is read from input.
    Otherwise, the search for a split is performed recursively on the two segments.
    The order of splits can be represented as a binary tree for each word, where the leafs represent the morphs making up the word, and the tree structure describes the ordering of the splits.
    During model search, an overall hierarchical data structure is used for keeping track of the current segmentation of every word type encountered so far.
    Let us assume that we have seen seven instances of linja-auton (Engl.
    &#8217;of [the] bus&#8217;) and two instances of autonkuljettajallakaan (Engl.
    &#8217;not even by/at/with [the] car driver&#8217;).
    Figure 1 then shows a possible structure used for representing the segmentations of the data.
    Each chunk is provided with an occurrence
