  As INITIATIVE passes back and forth between the discourse participants, we say that CONTROL over the conversation gets trans- ferred from one discourse participant to another.
  Why should we, as computational linguists, be interested in factors that contribute to the interac- tivity of a discourse?
  There are both theoretical and practical motivations.
  First, we wish to ex- tend formal accounts of single utterances produced by single speakers to explain multi-participant, multi-utterance discourses[Po186, CP86].
  Previ- ous studies of the discourse structure of multi- participant dialogues have often factored out the role of MIXED-INITIATIVE, by allocating control to one participant[Gro77, Coh84], or by assuming a passive listener[McK85, Coh87].
  Since conversation is a collaborative process[CWG86, SSJ74], models of conversation can provide the
