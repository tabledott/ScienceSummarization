ntextWN outperforms the method based on WordNet.
    The results of statistical significance testing are summarized in Table 5.
    All the paraphrasing methods except LSA, exhibit higher correlation with human scores than plain BLEU.
    Our method significantly outperforms BLEU, and all the other paraphrasebased metrics.
    This consistent improvement confirms the importance of contextual filtering.
    5Depending on the experimental setup, correlation values can vary widely.
    Our scores fall within the range of previous researchers (Papineni et al., 2002; Lin and Och, 2004).
    The third column in Table 4 shows that automatic paraphrasing continues to improve correlation scores even when two human references are paraphrased using our method.
    In the last section, we saw significant variations in MT evaluation performance when different paraphrasing methods were used to generate a synthetic reference.
    In this section, we examine the correlation between the quality of automatically generated para
