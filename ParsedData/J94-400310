a multinomial model for a single lexical relation and then using a constraint propagation algorithm to account simultaneously for all relations in the sentence.
    Section 4 describes the experimental setting.
    Section 5 presents and analyzes the results of the experiment and cites additional results (Dagan, Marcus, and Markovitch 1993).
    In Section 6 we analyze the limitations of the algorithm in different cases and suggest enhancements to improve it.
    We also discuss the possibility of adopting the algorithm for monolingual applications.
    Finally, in Section 7 we present a comparative analysis of statistical sense disambiguation methods and then conclude in Section 8.
    2 A similar observation underlies the use of parallel bilingual corpora for sense disambiguation (Brown et al. 1991; Gale, Church, and Yarowsky 1992).
    As we explain in Section 7, these corpora are a form of a manually tagged corpus and are more difficult to obtain than monolingual corpora.
    Erroneously, the preliminary
