] shows that nouns, verbs and adjectives also differ in their ability to be disambiguated by wider context.
  1993] previously showed that nouns can be disambiguated based strictly on distant context, and that useful information was present up to 10,000 words away.
  We replicated an exper- iment in which performance was calculated for disambigua- tions based strictly on 5 word windows centered at various distances (shown on the horizontal axis).
  Gales observation was tested only on nouns; our experiment also shows that reasonably accurate decisions may be made for nouns using exclusively remote context.
  Our results in this case are based on test sets with equal numbers of the two senses.
  Hence chance performance is at 50%.
  However, when tested on verbs and adjectives, precision drops off with a much steeper slope as the distance from the ambiguous word increases.
  This would indicate that approaches giving equal weight o all po- sitions in a broad window of context may be less well-suited for handli
