  A Probabilistic Earley Parser As A Psycholinguistic Model
  
    In human sentence processing, cognitive load can be defined many ways.
    This report considers a definition of cognitive load in terms of the total probability of structural options that have been disconfirmed at point in a sentence: the surprisal of word its prefix on a phrase-structural language model.
    These loads can be efficiently calculated using a probabilistic Earley parser (Stolcke, 1995) which is interpreted as generating predictions about reading time on a word-by-word basis.
    Under grammatical assumptions supported by corpusfrequency data, the operation of Stolcke&#8217;s probabilistic Earley parser correctly predicts processing phenomena associated with garden path structural ambiguity and with the subject/object relative asymmetry.
  
  
    What is the relation between a person&#8217;s knowledge of grammar and that same person&#8217;s application of that knowledge in perceiving syntactic structure?
    The answer to be
