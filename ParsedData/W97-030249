 experiments using hand optimized parameters.
    We recently ran the optimization algorithm and reran the experiments, achieving a factor of two speedup with no performance loss.
    While we had not spent a great deal of time hand optimizing these parameters, we are very encouraged by the optimization algorithm's practical utility.
    This paper introduces four new techniques: beam thresholding with priors, global thresholding, multiple-pass parsing, and automatic search for thresholding parameters.
    Beam thresholding with priors can lead to almost an order of magnitude improvement over beam thresholding without priors.
    Global thresholding can be up to three times as efficient as the new beam thresholding technique, although the typical improvement is closer to 50%.
    When global thresholding and beam thresholding are combined, they are usually two to three times as fast as beam thresholding alone.
    Multiple-pass parsing can lead to up to an additional 50% improvement with the grammars in this
