  Case studies include French, Chinese, Czech and Spanish.
  Existing text analysis tools for English are applied to bilingual text corpora and their output projected onto the second language via statistically derived word alignments.
  Simple direct annotation projection is quite noisy, however, even with optimal alignments.
