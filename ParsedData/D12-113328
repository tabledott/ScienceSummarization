 parser of Lee et al. (2011) can handle nonprojective trees and experimental results are presented for four languages, but their graph-based model is relatively simple and the baselines therefore well below the state of the art.
    We are thus the first to show consistent improvements in both tagging and (labeled) parsing accuracy across typologically diverse languages at the state-of-the-art level.
    Moreover, the capacity to handle non-projective dependencies, which is crucial to attain good performance on Czech and German, does not seem to hurt performance on English and Chinese, where the benchmark sets contain only projective trees.
    The use of beam search in transition-based dependency parsing in order to mitigate the problem of error propagation was first proposed by Johansson and Nugues (2006), although they still used a locally trained model.
    Globally normalized models were first explored by Titov and Henderson (2007), who were also the first to use a parameterized SHIFT transition like the
