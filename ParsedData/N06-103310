 4) is a permuted sequence while (2, 5) is not.
    As special cases, single numbers are permuted sequences as well.
    A sequence a is said to be binarizable if it is a permuted sequence and either This is a recursive definition.
    Each binarizable permuted sequence has at least one hierarchical binarization pattern.
    For instance, the permuted sequence (2, 3, 5, 4) is binarizable (with two possible binarization patterns) while (2, 4,1, 3) is not (see Figure 3).
    An SCFG is said to be binarizable if the permutation of each synchronous production is binarizable.
    We denote the class of binarizable SCFGs as bSCFG.
    This set represents an important subclass of SCFG that is easy to handle (parsable in O(|w|6)) and covers many interesting longer-than-two rules.3 Proof.
    Once we decompose the permutation of n in the original rule into binary permutations, all that remains is to decorate the skeleton binary parse with nonterminal symbols and attach terminals to the skeleton appropriately.
    We e
