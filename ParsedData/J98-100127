of a vector method that relates each word and its context.
    In experiments on a single word (bank), the method achieved 45% accuracy on sense identification, and 90% accuracy on homograph identification.
    Lesk's method has been extended by creating a neural network from definition texts in the Collins English Dictionary (CED), in which each word is linked to its senses, which are themselves linked to the words in their definitions, which are in turn linked to their senses, etc.
    (Veronis and Ide 1990).7 Experiments on 23 ambiguous words, each in six contexts (138 pairs of words), produced correct disambiguation, using the relatively fine sense distinctions in the CED, in 71.7% of the cases (three times better than chance: 23.6%) (Ide and Veronis 1990b); in later experiments, improving the parameters and only distinguishing homographs enabled a rate of 85% (vs. chance: 39%) (Veronis and Ide 1995).
    Applied to the task of mapping the senses of the CED and OALD for the same 23 words (59 senses in all
