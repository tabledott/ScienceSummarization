ng, and this year we use yet another one.
    In this section, we discuss each of these overall ranking methods and a few more.
    In the first human evaluation, we use fluency and adequacy judgments on a scale from 1 to 5 (Koehn and Monz, 2006).
    We normalized the scores on a per-sentence basis, thus converting them to a relative ranking in a 5-system comparison.
    We listed systems by the average of these scores over all sentences, in which they were judged.
    We did not report ranks, but rank ranges.
    To give an example: if a system scored neither statistically significantly better nor statistically significantly worse than 3 other systems, we assign it the rank range 1&#8211;4.
    The given evidence is not sufficient to rank it exactly, but it does rank somewhere in the top 4.
    In subsequent years, we did not continue the reporting of rank ranges (although they can be obtained by examining the pairwise comparison tables), but we continued to report systems as winners whenever there was not
