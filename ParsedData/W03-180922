dwin et al. used LSA to calculate the distributional similarity between an MWE and its head word, and demonstrate a correlation between similarity and compositionality (modelled in terms of endocentricity) by way of items with higher similarity being more compositional.
    They do not go as far as to classify MWEs as being compositional or non-compositional, however.
  
  
    Having created our gold-standard data, we implemented some statistical techniques for automatic analysis.
    In this, we use the VPC tokens with sentential contexts extracted from the BNC as reported in Section 3, i.e. a superset of the data used to annotate the VPCs.
    We mapped the gold-standard data onto four binary (yes/no) classification tasks over VPC items: Note the partial conditional chaining between these tests, e.g. an item for which the verb and particle contribute their simplex meaning (i.e. positive exemplars for TASKS 3 and 4) is completely compositional (i.e. a positive exemplar for TASK 1).
