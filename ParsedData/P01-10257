he precision values of the highest ranked word combinations with ): As expected from the results of other studies (e.g.
    Lezius (1999)), the precision of is significantly lower than that of log-likelihood,8 cally overestimates the collocativity of low-frequency pairs, cf. section 4.3. whereas the t-test competes with log-likelihood, especially for larger values of .
    Frequency leads to clearly better results than and , and, for , comes close to the accuracy of t-test and log-likelihood.
    For a clearer picture, however, larger portions of the SLs need to be examined.
    A well suited means for comparing the goodness of different AMs are the precision and recall graphs obtained by stepwise processing of the complete SLs (Figures 1 to 10 below).9 The -axis represents the percentage of data processed in the respective SL, while the axis represents the precision (or recall) values achieved.
    For instance, the precision values for and for the AdjN data can be read from the -axis in Figure 1 at position
