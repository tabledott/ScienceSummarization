    A similar result holds for the algori ginal inference problem.
    (Case 2) If case 1 does not arise, then a couple of strategies are possible.
    (This situation could arise in cases where the LP is not tight&#8212;i.e., it has a fractional solution&#8212;or where K is not large enough for convergence.)
    The first is to define the primal solution to be the average of the solutions enOur first set of experiments considers the integration of Model 1 of Collins (2003) (a lexicalized phrasestructure parser, fr om here on referred to as Model the last equality is because and are defined by the respective arg Thus, d Eisner, 2008; Martins et al., 2009).
    1),11 and the 2nd order discriminative dependency parser of Koo et al. (2008).
    The inference problem for a sentence x is to find where Y is the set of all lexicalized phrase-structure trees for the sentence x; f1(y) is the score (log probability) under Model 1; f2(y) is the score under Koo et al. (2008) for the dependency structure implied by y;
