e model of a text in terms of its constituent word indices (Salton and Buckley, 1988; Salton and Yang, 1973; Croft, 1984; Turtle and Croft, 1992; Bookstein, 1983; Korfhage, 1995; Jones, 1979).
    The value of the i-th dimension of a word vector W is f if the i-th word in the lexicon appears f times in the same sentences as W. Left columns in Table 1 and Table 2 show the list of content words which appear most frequently in the context of flu and Africa respectively.
    The right column shows those which occur most frequently in the context of bv,g.
    We can see that the context of At is more similar to that of flu than to that of Africa.
  
  
    So the first clue to the similarity between a word and its translation number of common words in their contexts.
    In a bilingual corpus, the &amp;quot;common word&amp;quot; is actually a bilingual word pair.
    We use the lexicon of the MT system to &amp;quot;bridge&amp;quot; all bilingual word pairs in the corpora.
    These word pairs are used as seed word
