he constraints and minimizes the value of the objective function, which is also a linear combination of variables.
    We can solve IP instances with generic problem-solving software such as lp solve or CPLEX.3 In this section we explain tence f = &#8220;CE NE EST PAS CLAIR .&#8221; There is one city for each word in f. City boundaries are marked with bold lines, and hotels are illustrated with rectangles.
