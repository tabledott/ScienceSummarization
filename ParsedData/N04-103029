			Thus far, in all experiments our unseen test data was selected from the same source as the training data.
			In order to see how well the features generalize to texts drawn from a similar source, we used the classifier trained on PropBank training data to test data drawn from the AQUAINT corpus (LDC, 2002).
			We annotated 400 sentences from the AQUAINT corpus with PropBank arguments.
			This is a collection of text from the New York Times Inc., Associated Press Inc., and Xinhua News Service (PropBank by comparison is drawn from Wall Street Journal).
			The results are shown in Table 15.
