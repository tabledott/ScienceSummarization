rence for intersentential candidates in the original centering model, we defined the following anaphora resolution strategy (which is not the best solution for the anaphora resolution problem either, but sufficient for the purposes of the evaluation): Since clauses are short in general, step 2 of the algorithm only rarely applies.
    5.1.3 Results.
    The results of our evaluation are given in Table 14.
    The first row gives the number of third person pronouns and possessive pronouns in the data.
    The upper part of the table shows the results for the BFP algorithm, the lower part those for the FunC algorithm.
    Overall, the data are consistently in favor of the FuncC algorithm, though no significance judgments can be made (the data were not drawn as a random sample).
    The overall error rate of each approach is given in the rows labeled as &amp;quot;wrong&amp;quot;.
    We also tried to determine the major sources of errors (see the nonbold sections in Table 14), and were able to distinguish three
