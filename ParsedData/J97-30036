nsive and less error-prone.
    Zhang and Kim (1990) developed a system for automated learning of morphological word formation rules.
    This system divides a string into three regions and infers from training examples their correspondence to underlying morphological features.
    Kupiec (1992) describes a guessing component that uses a prespecified list of suffixes (or rather endings) and then statistically learns the predictive properties of those endings from an untagged corpus.
    In Brill (1994, 1995) a transformation-based learner that learns guessing rules from a pretagged training corpus is outlined: First the unknown words are labeled as common nouns and a list of generic transformations is defined.
    Then the learner tries to instantiate the generic transformations with word features observed in the text.
    A statistical-based suffix learner is presented in Schmid (1994).
    From a training corpus, it constructs a suffix tree where every suffix is associated with its information measure to em
