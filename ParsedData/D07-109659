			Despite these characteristics, the top UAS reaches 62.49 and is thus more than 10 percentage points below the top UAS for the chemical data set.
			One major reason for this is that auxiliary and main verb dependencies are annotated differently in the CHILDES data than in the WSJ training set.
			As aresult of this discrepancy, participants were not re quired to submit results for the CHILDES data.
			The best performing system on the CHILDES corpus is an open system (Bick, 2007), but the distance tothe top closed system is approximately 1 percent age point.
			In this domain, it seems more feasible touse general language resources than for the chemi cal domain.
			However, the results prove that the extra effort may be unnecessary.
	
	
			Two years of dependency parsing in the CoNLL shared task has brought an enormous boost to thedevelopment of dependency parsers for multiple lan guages (and to some extent for multiple domains).But even though nineteen languages have been covered by almost as many diff
