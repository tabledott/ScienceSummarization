ffers from Soon et al. (2001), Ng and Cardie (2002) in several aspects.
    First, the mention-pair model is used as an approximation to the entity-mention model (3), which itself is an approximation of .
    Second, instead of doing a pick-first (Soon et al., 2001) or best-first (Ng and Cardie, 2002) selection, the mention-pair linking model is used to compute a starting probability.
    The starting probability enables us to score the action of creating a new entity without thresholding the link probabilities.
    Third, this probabilistic framework allows us to search the space of all possible entities, while Soon et al. (2001), Ng and Cardie (2002) take the &#8220;best&#8221; local hypothesis.
  
  
    The data used in all experiments presented in this section is provided by the Linguistic Data Consortium and is distributed by NIST to all participants in the ACE evaluation.
    In the comparative experiments for the mention detection and entity tracking tasks, the training data for the English system con
