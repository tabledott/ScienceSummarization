    The analysis tree that we will be implicitly traversing in the course of generation is given Computational Linguistics Volume 16, Number 1, March 1990 35 Shieber et al. Semantic Head-Driven Grammar in Figure 4.
    The rule numbers are keyed to the grammar.
    The pivots chosen during generation and the branches corresponding to the semantic head relation are shown in boldface.
    We begin by attempting to find a nonchain rule that will define the pivot.
    This is a rule whose left-hand-side semantics matches the root semantics decl(call _ up(john, friends)) (although its syntax may differ).
    In fact, the only such nonchain rule is We conjecture that the pivot is labeled sentence/ decl(call_up(john,friends)).
    In terms of the tree traversal, we are implicitly choosing the root node [a] as the pivot.
    We recursively generate from the child's node [b], whose category is s(finite)/call_up(john, friends).
    For this category, the pivot (which will turn out
