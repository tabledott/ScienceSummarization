y tree structures in a packed form.
    If T(s) is represented in a feature forest, p(tIT(s)) can be estimated using dynamic programming without unpacking the chart.
    A feature forest is formally defined as a tuple, (C, D, R, y, b), where C is a set of conjunctive nodes, D is a set of disjunctive nodes, R C_ C is a set of root nodes2, y : D 2c is a conjunctive daughter function, and b : C 2D is a disjunctive The simplest way to map a chart of HPSG parse trees into a feature forest is to map each equivalence class e E E to a conjunctive node c E C. However, in HPSG parsing, important features for disambiguation are combinations of a mother and its daughters, i.e., (m, 1, r).
    Hence, we map the tuple (eM, el, er), which corresponds to (m, 1, r), into a conjunctive node.
    Figure 2 shows (a part of) the HPSG parse trees in Figure 1 represented as a feature forest.
    Square boxes are conjunctive nodes, dotted lines express a disjunctive daughter function, and solid arrows represent a conjunctive daughte
