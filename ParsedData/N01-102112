 of its input, so as a psycholinguistic theory it is a total parallelism theory.
    The explanation for garden-pathing will turn on the reduction in the probability of the new tree set compared with the previous tree set &#8211; reanalysis plays no role.
    Before illustrating this kind of explanation with a specific example, it will be important to first clarify the nature of the linking hypothesis between the operation of the probabilistic Earley parser and the measured effects of the human parser.
  
  
    The measure of cognitive effort mentioned earlier is defined over prefixes: for some observed prefix, the cognitive effort expended to parse that prefix is proportional to the total probability of all the structural analyses which cannot be compatible with the observed prefix.
    This is consistent with eagerness since, if the parser were to fail to infer the incompatibility of some incompatible analysis, it would be delaying a computation, and hence not be eager.
    This prefix-based linking hypoth
