AF} E RF is the set of realvalued model parameters.
    We used a simple count cut-off feature selection algorithm which counts the number of occurrences of all features in a predefined set after which it discards the features whose count is less than a pre-specified threshold.
    The parameter of the feature selection algorithm is the threshold value; a value of 0 will keep all features encountered in the training data.
    The model parameters A are estimated such that the model assigns maximum log-likelihood to the training data subject to a Gaussian prior centered at 0, A &#8764; N(0, diag(u2i )), that ensures smoothing (Chen and Rosenfeld, 2000): As s
