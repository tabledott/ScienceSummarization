ributional similarity between words, Turney (2008) shares with DM the goal of unifying attributional and relational similarity under the same distributional model.
    He observes that tasks that are traditionally solved with an attributional similarity approach can be recast as relational similarity tasks.
    Instead of determining whether two words are, for example, synonymous by looking at the features they share, we can learn what the typical patterns are that connect synonym pairs when they co-occur (also known as, sometimes called, etc.
    ), and make a decision about a potential synonym pair based on their occurrence in similar contexts.
    Given a list of pairs instantiating an arbitrary relation, Turney&#8217;s PairClass algorithm extracts patterns that are correlated with the relation, and can be used to discover new pairs instantiating it.
    Turney tests his system in a variety of tasks (TOEFL synonyms; SAT analogies; distinguishing synonyms and antonyms; distinguishing pairs that are semantic
