presented.
    Both the above examples indicate the presence of (perhaps domain-dependent) lexical constraints that are not explainable on semantic grounds.
    In the case of prepositions in time adjuncts, the constraints are institutionalized in the language, but still nothing about the concept MONTH relates to the use of the preposition in with month names instead of, say, on (Herskovits, 1986).
    Furthermore, lexical constraints are not limited to the syntagmatic, interlexical constraints discussed above.
    For a generator to be able to produce sufficiently varied text, multiple renditions of the same concept must be accessible.
    Then, the generator is faced with paradigmatic choices among alternatives that without sufficient information may look equivalent.
    These choices include choices among synonyms (and near-synonyms), and choices among alternative syntactic realizations of a semantic role.
    However, it is possible that not all the alternatives actually share the same level of fluency or
