nfusion network may be represented as a standard word lattice with all paths traveling via all nodes.
    The links in this lattice represent the alternative words (including nulls) at the corresponding position in the string.
    Confusion network decoding may be viewed as finding the highest scoring path through this lattice with summing all word scores along the path.
    The standard lattice decoding algorithms may also be used to generate -best lists from the confusion network.
    The simplest way to introduce system weights is to accumulate system-specific scores along the paths and combine these scores linearly with the weights.
    The system weights may be tuned using Powell&#8217;s method on -best lists as described in Section 2.
    The word-level combination tuning can be summarized as follows: 7.
    Re-rank the -best list using the new weights.
    Testing the word-level combination has the same steps as the tuning apart from steps 6 and 7.
