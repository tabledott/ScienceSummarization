ons behind what is typical vary, and likewise association scores vary in their ability to partition the set depending on the notion of &amp;quot;typicality&amp;quot; employed by the annotators.
    Researchers also sometimes show how well the results accord with the contents of MRDs, even though these cannot be taken as definitive.
    In this study we are less interested in the dichotomy of whether a putative phrasal candidate is indeed a genuine multiword or not (although it is more likely that those with low compositionality are likely to be) but we use empirical methods to gauge the position of a candidate on a continuum between the fully opaque idiom and transparent compositional phrases.
    Variability of idioms on a scale of compositionality has been discussed by Nunberg et al. (1994) and in the psycholinguistics literature, see (Gibbs and Nayak, 1989).
    Tseng (2000) also advocates use of a spectrum when considering the semantics of prepositions.
    We will consider compositionality as a continuou
