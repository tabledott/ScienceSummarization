l is difficult with the data size that is available in practice&#8212;a problem usually referred to as the data sparseness problem.
    For example, suppose that we employ the maximum-likelihood estimation (or MLE for short) to estimate the probability parameters of a conditional probability distribution, as described above, given the co-occurrence data in Figure 1.
    In this case, MLE amounts to estimating the parameters by simply normalizing the frequencies so that they sum to one, giving, for example, the estimated probabilities of 0, 0.2, and 0.4 for swallow, eagle, and bird, respectively (see Figure 2).
    Since in general the number of parameters exceeds the size of data that is typically available, MLE will result in estimating most of the probability parameters to be zero.
    To address this problem, Grishman and Sterling (1994) proposed a method of smoothing conditional probabilities using the probability values of similar words, where the similarity between words is judged based on co-occurrence
