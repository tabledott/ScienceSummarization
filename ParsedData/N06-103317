oth terminals and nonterminals).
  
  
    In this section, we answer two empirical questions.
    It has been shown by Shapiro and Stephens (1991) and Wu (1997, Sec.
    4) that the percentage of binarizable cases over all permutations of length n quickly approaches 0 as n grows (see Figure 6).
    However, for machine translation, it is more meaningful to compute the ratio of binarizable rules extracted from real text.
    Our rule set is obtained by first doing word alignment using GIZA++ on a Chinese-English parallel corpus containing 50 million words in English, then parsing the English sentences using a variant of Collins parser, and finally extracting rules using the graph-theoretic algorithm of Galley et al. (2004).
    We did a &#8220;spectrum analysis&#8221; on the resulting rule set with 50,879,242 rules.
    Figure 6 shows how the rules are distributed against their lengths (number of nonterminals).
    We can see that the percentage of non-binarizable rules in each bucket of the same length does
