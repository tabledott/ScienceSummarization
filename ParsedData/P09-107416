ween proper names is relatively easy (e.g.
    Kameyama (1997)) because string matching functions specialized to the type of proper name (e.g. person vs. location) are quite accurate.
    Thus, we would expect a coreference resolution system to depend critically on its Named Entity (NE) extractor.
    On the other hand, state-of-the-art NE taggers are already quite good, so improving this component may not provide much additional gain.
    To study the influence of NE recognition, we replace the system-generated NEs of RECONCILEACL09 with gold-standard NEs and retrain the coreference classifier.
    Results for each of the data sets are shown in box 4 of Table 3.
    (No gold standard NEs are available for MUC7.)
    Comparison to the BASELINE system (box 2) shows that using gold standard NEs leads to improvements on all data sets with the exception of ACE2 and ACE05, on which performance is virtually unchanged.
    The improvements tend to be small, however, between 0.5 to 3 performance points.
