eech, while letters or graphemes are representations of words in written language.
    For example, the phonemes for the word phoenix are [ f i n &#9632; k s ].
    The L2P task is a crucial part of speech synthesis systems, as converting input text (graphemes) into phonemes is the first step in representing sounds.
    L2P conversion can also help improve performance in spelling correction (Toutanova and Moore, 2001).
    Unfortunately, proper nouns and unseen words prevent a table look-up approach.
    It is infeasible to construct a lexical database that includes every word in the written language.
    Likewise, orthographic complexity of many languages prevents us from using hand-designed conversion rules.
    There are always exceptional rules that need to be added to cover a large vocabulary set.
    Thus, an automatic L2P system is desirable.
    Many data-driven techniques have been proposed for letter-to-phoneme conversion systems, including pronunciation by analogy (Marchand and Damper, 2000), const
