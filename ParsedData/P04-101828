 are essentially computed with the single (normal) mention, and therefore the starting model is weak.
    In our model, the starting model is obtained by &#8220;complementing&#8221; the linking scores.
    The advantage is that we do not need to train a starting model.
    To compensate the model inaccuracy, we introduce a &#8220;starting penalty&#8221; to balance the linking and starting scores.
    To our knowledge, the paper is the first time the Bell tree is used to represent the search space of the coreference resolution problem.
  
  
    We propose to use the Bell tree to represent the process of forming entities from mentions.
    The Bell tree represents the search space of the coreference resolution problem.
    We studied two maximum entropy models, namely the mention-pair model and the entitymention model, both of which can be used to score entity hypotheses.
    A beam search algorithm is used to search the best entity result.
    State-of-the-art performance has been achieved on the ACE corefere
