    In the article pair selection stage, the researchers try to identify, for an article in one language, the best matching article in the other language.
    Zhao and Vogel (2002) measure article similarity by defining a generative model in which an English story generates a Chinese story with a given probability.
    Utiyama et al. (2003) use the BM25 (Robertson and Walker 1994) similarity measure.
    The two works also differ in the way they define the sentence similarity score.
    Zhao and Vogel (2002) combine a sentence length model with an IBM Model 1-type translation model.
    Utiyama et al. (2003) define a score based on word overlap (i.e., number of word pairs from the two sentences that are translations of each other), which also includes the similarity score of the article pair from which the sentence pair originates.
    The performance of these approaches depends heavily on the ability to reliably find similar document pairs.
    Moreover, comparable article pairs, even those similar in conten
