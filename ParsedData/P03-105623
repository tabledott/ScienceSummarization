e tentatively conclude that in English, for most N/V-ambiguous tokens, morphology and POS prior contribute essentially nothing that cannot be adduced from the token's surrounding function-word context; whereas in Chinese, it seems that the lack of function words puts a much greater burden on prior knowledge of an N/V-ambiguous word's distributional behavior.
    When we included all the PCFG enhancements listed in this section, we achieved an increase of 1.4% in Fl; interestingly, precision actually decreased by 0.4% whereas recall increased by 3.2%.
    Our PCFG enhancements were most effective at reducing NP-NP modification error, incorrect recursive bracketings, and IP/VP attachment errors.
    They were less effective at improving coordination attachment resolution and prenominal modification.
    Although they were not directly identified as solutions to common types of errors, we identifled several more PCFG refinements that reflect linguistically motivated generalizations and improve parsing performanc
