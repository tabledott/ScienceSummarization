ich would accept all words and would be affected by the noise introduced from unrelated concepts.
    Thus the context selection factors into the accuracy obtained.
    However, for evaluating the measure as being suitable for use in real applications, the Gloss Vector measure proves relatively accurate.
    The Gloss Vector measure can draw conclusions about any two concepts, irrespective of partof-speech.
    The only other measure that can make this same claim is the Extended Gloss Overlaps measure.
    We would argue that Gloss Vectors present certain advantages over it.
    The Extended Gloss Overlap measure looks for exact string overlaps to measure relatedness.
    This &#8220;exactness&#8221; works against the measure, in that it misses potential matches that intuitively would contribute to the score (For example, silverware with spoon).
    The Gloss Vector measure is more robust than the Extended Gloss Overlap measure, in that exact matches are not required to identify relatedness.
    The Gloss Vec
