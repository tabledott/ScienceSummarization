dependency parsing has been restricted to applications of secondorder parsers, the most powerful of which (Carreras, 2007) requires O(n4) time and O(n3) space, while being limited to second-order parts.
    In this paper, we present new third-order parsing algorithms that increase both the size and variety of the parts participating in the factorization, while simultaneously maintaining computational requirements of O(n4) time and O(n3) space.
    We evaluate our parsers on the Penn WSJ Treebank (Marcus et al., 1993) and Prague Dependency Treebank (Haji&#711;c et al., 2001), achieving unlabeled attachment scores of 93.04% and 87.38%.
    In summary, we make three main contributions: The remainder of this paper is divided as follows: Sections 2 and 3 give background, Sections 4 and 5 describe our new parsing algorithms, Section 6 discusses related work, Section 7 presents our experimental results, and Section 8 concludes.
