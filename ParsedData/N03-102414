 equivalent translation set of cardinality 11 was mapped into (2) equivalent translation pairs.).
    Regina Barzilay kindly provided us the list of paraphrases extracted by their algorithm from this parallel corpus, from which we randomly selected another set of 300 paraphrases (Scotr). phrases produced by the syntax-based alignment (Ssyn) and co-training-based (Scotr) algorithms.
    The resulting 600 paraphrase pairs were mixed and presented in random order to four human judges.
    Each judge was asked to assess the correctness of 150 paraphrase pairs (75 pairs from each system) based on the context, i.e., the sentence group, from which the paraphrase pair was extracted.
    Judges were given three choices: &#8220;Correct&#8221;, for perfect paraphrases, &#8220;Partially correct&#8221;, for paraphrases in which there is only a partial overlap between the meaning of two paraphrases (e.g. while {saving set, aid package} is a correct paraphrase pair in the given context, {set, aide package} is considered par
