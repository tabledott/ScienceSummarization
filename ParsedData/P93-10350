  Automatic Grammar Induction And Parsing Free Text: A Transformation-Based Approach
  
    In this paper we describe a new technique for parsing free text: a transformational grammar' is automatically learned that is capable of accurately parsing text into binary-branching syntactic trees with nonterminals unlabelled.
    The algorithm works by beginning in a very naive state of knowledge about phrase structure.
    By repeatedly comparing the results of bracketing in the current state to proper bracketing provided in the training corpus, the system learns a set of simple structural transformations that can be applied to reduce error.
    After describing the algorithm, we present results and compare these results to other recent results in automatic grammar induction.
  
  
    There has been a great deal of interest of late in the automatic induction of natural language grammar.
    Given the difficulty inherent in manually building a robust parser, along with the availability of large amounts of training
