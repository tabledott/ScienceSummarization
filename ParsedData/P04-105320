he NE pairs A and B and the NE pairs C and D, we must calculate both the similarity with and the similarity with .
    Sometimes the wrong correspondence ends up being favored.
    This kind of error was observed in 2 out of the 15 clusters, due to the fact that words happened to be shared by NE pairs aligned in the wrong direction more than in right direction.
    The main reason for undetected or mis-clustered NE pairs in both domains is the absence of common words in the pairs&#8217; context which explicitly represent the particular relations.
    Mis-clustered NE pairs were clustered based on another common word which occurred by accident.
    If the maximum context length were longer than the limit of 5 words which we set in the experiments, we could detect additional common words, but the noise would also increase.
    In our experiments, we used only the words between the two NEs.
    Although the outer context words (preceding the first NE or following the second NE) may be helpful, extending the cont
