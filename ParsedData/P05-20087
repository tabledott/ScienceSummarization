ance of the models first against movie reviews from the same time-period as the training set and then against reviews from the other time-period.
    Figure 3 shows the resulting accuracies.
    These results show that while the models perform well on reviews from the same time-period as the training set, they are not so effective on reviews from other time-periods (confidence interval 95%).
    It is also apparent that the Polarity 2004 dataset performs worse than the Polarity 1.0 dataset (confidence interval 99.9%).
    A possible reason for this is that Polarity 2004 data is from a much smaller time-period than that represented by Polarity 1.0.
  
  
    One way of overcoming the domain, topic and time problems we have demonstrated above would be to find a source of much larger and diverse amounts of general text, annotated for sentiment.
    Users of electronic methods of communication have developed visual cues that are associated with emotional states in an attempt to state the emotion that their text r
