rtunately, recent annotation projects have taken significant steps towards developing semantic (Fillmore et al., 2002; Kingsbury and Palmer, 2002) and discourse (Carlson et al., 2003) annotated corpora.
    Some of these annotation efforts have already had a computational impact.
    For example, Gildea and Jurafsky (2002) developed statistical models for automatically inducing semantic roles.
    In this paper, we describe probabilistic models and algorithms that exploit the discourseannotated corpus produced by Carlson et al. (2003).
    A discourse structure is a tree whose leaves correspond to elementary discourse units (edu)s, and whose internal nodes correspond to contiguous text spans (called discourse spans).
    An example of a discourse structure is the tree given in Figure 1.
    Each internal node in a discourse tree is characterized by a rhetorical relation, such as ATTRIBUTION and ENABLEMENT.
    Within a rhetorical relation a discourse span is also labeled as either NUCLEUS or SATELLITE.
