hat semantic roles are defined at the frame level means, for example, that the verbs send and receive would share the semantic roles (SENDER, RECIPIENT, GOODS, etc.) defined with respect to a common TRANSFER frame.
    Such common frames might allow a question-answering system to take a question like (5) and discover that (6) is relevant in constructing an answer to the question: This shallow semantic level of interpretation has additional uses outside of generalizing information extraction, question answering, and semantic dialogue systems.
    One such application is in word sense disambiguation, where the roles associated with a word can be cues to its sense.
    For example, Lapata and Brew (1999) and others have shown that the different syntactic subcategorization frames of a verb such as serve can be used to help disambiguate a particular instance of the word.
    Adding semantic role subcategorization information to this syntactic information could extend this idea to use richer semantic knowledge.
