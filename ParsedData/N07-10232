In this paper, we present a head-driven Markovization of SCFG compression rules, an approach that was successfully used in syntactic parsing (Collins, 1999; Klein and Manning, 2003) to alleviate issues intrinsic to relative frequency estimation of treebank productions.
    Markovization for sentence compression provides several benefits, including the ability to condition deletions on a flexible amount of syntactic context, to treat head-modifier dependencies independently, and to lexicalize SCFG productions.
    Another part of our effort focuses on better alignment models for extracting SCFG compression rules from parallel data, and to improve upon (Knight and Marcu, 2000), who could only exploit 1.75% of the Ziff-Davis corpus because of stringent assumptions about human abstractive behavior.
    To alleviate their restrictions, we rely on a robust approach for aligning trees of arbitrary document-abstract sentence pairs.
    After accounting for sentence pairs with both substitutions and deletions, we reac
