explicitly taken into ac- count.
  We typically observe that this approach pro- duces better translations than the single-word based models.
  The alignment templates are automatically trailmd using a parallel trailxing corlms.
  For more information about the alignment template approach see (Och et at., 1999).
  7 Resu l ts We present results on the Verbmobil Task which is a speech translation task ill the donmin of appoint- nxent scheduling, travel planning, and hotel reserva- tion (Wahlster, 1993).
  We measure the quality of tile al)ove inentioned aligmnent models with xespect to alignment quality and translation quality.
  To obtain a refereuce aligmnent for evaluating alignlnent quality, we manually aligned about 1.4 percent of onr training corpus.
  We allowed the hu- mans who pertbrmed the alignment o specify two different kinds of alignments: an S (sure) a, lignment which is used for alignmelxts which are unambigu- ously and a P (possible) alignment which is used for alignments which might or might n
