    IBM system in the BLEU score, the obtained gain was less than what we expected.
    We have thought the following three reasons.
    First, the syntax of Chinese is not extremely different from English, compared with other languages such as Japanese or Arabic.
    Therefore, the TM could not take advantage of syntactic reordering operations.
    Second, our decoder looks for a decoded tree, not just for a decoded sentence.
    Thus, the search space is larger than IBM models, which might lead to more search errors caused by pruning.
    Third, the LM used for our system was exactly the same as the LM used by the IBM system.
    Decoding performance might be heavily influenced by LM performance.
    In addition, since the TM assumes an English parse tree as input, a trigram LM might not be appropriate.
    We will discuss this point in the next section.
    Phrasal translation worked pretty well.
