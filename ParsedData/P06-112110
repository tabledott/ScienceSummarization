 to any word of e, thus disconnectedfrom the rest of the graph.
			This case is highly frequent: 24.1% of Chinese words in our 179 mil lion word English-Chinese bilingual corpus areunaligned, and 84.8% of Chinese sentences con tain at least one unaligned word.
			The question is what to do with such lexical items, e.g., ? inFigure 2(a).
			The approach of building one mini mal derivation for G as in the algorithm described in GHKM assumes that we commit ourselves to a particular heuristic to attach the unaligned itemto a certain constituent of pi, e.g., highest attach ment (in the example, ? is attached to NP[4-8]and the heuristic generates rule (f)).
			A more reasonable approach is to invoke the principle of insufficient reason and make no a priori assump tion about what is a ?correct?
			way of assigning the item to a constituent, and return all derivations that are consistent with G. In Section 4, we will see how to use corpus evidence to give preference to unaligned-word attachments that are the most con
