r the log likelihood ratio threshold.
    An initial setting of 8 showed an improvement in performance, as lower values enabled too many early role assignments, so we used the value of 8 in our test experiments.
    In all experiments, a decrement of .5 was used to gradually reduce the log likelihood ratio threshold.
  
  
    Of over 960K slots we extracted from the corpus, 120K occurred with one of 54 target verbs.
    Of these, our validation data consisted of 278 slots, and our test data of 554 slots.
    We focus on the analysis of test data; the pattern on the validation data was nearly identical in all respects.
    The target slots fall into several categories, depending on the human judgements: argument slots, adjunct slots, and &#8220;bad&#8221; slots (chunking errors).
    We report detailed analysis over the slots identified as arguments.
    We also report overall accuracy if adjunct and &#8220;bad&#8221; slots are included in the slots to be labelled.
    This comparison is similar to that made
