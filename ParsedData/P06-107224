rameter estimation method, structural annealing, for learning hidden structure that biases toward simplicity and gradually weakens (anneals) the bias over time.
    We applied the technique to weighted dependency grammar induction and achieved a significant gain in accuracy over EM and CE, raising the state-of-the-art across six languages from 42&#8211; 54% to 58&#8211;73% accuracy.
