e seven of the thirteen senses of pen have the same number of overlaps with senses of page.
			Six of the senses of pen share only the word write with the correct sense of page (1.1: "leaf of a book").
			However, pen 1.1 also contains words such as draw and ink, and page 1.1 contains book, newspaper, letter, and print.
			These other words are heavily interconnected in a complex network which cannot be discovered by simply counting overlaps.
			Wilks et al (forthcoming) build on Lesk's method by computing the degree of overlap for related word-sets constructed using co-occurrence data from definition texts, but their method suffers from the same problems, in addition to combinatorial problems thai prevent disambiguating more than one word at a time.

			Neural networks for WSD.
			Neural network approaches to WSD have been suggested (Cottrell and Small, 1983; Waltz and Pollack, 1985).
			These models consist of networks in which the nodes ("neurons") represent words or concepts, connected by "activato
