	Hierarchical Phrase-Based Translation with Suffix Arrays
		A major engineering challenge in statistical machine translation systems is the efficient representation of extremely large translationrulesets.
		In phrase-based models, this prob lem can be addressed by storing the training data in memory and using a suffix array asan efficient index to quickly lookup and extract rules on the fly.
		Hierarchical phrasebased translation introduces the added wrin kle of source phrases with gaps.
		Lookup algorithms used for contiguous phrases nolonger apply and the best approximate pat tern matching algorithms are much too slow, taking several minutes per sentence.
		Wedescribe new lookup algorithms for hierar chical phrase-based translation that reduce the empirical computation time by nearly two orders of magnitude, making on-the-fly lookup feasible for source phrases with gaps.
