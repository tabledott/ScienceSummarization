e select the precision, recall, and F values at the recall level that results in the highest F score (i.e., in the best precision&#8211;recall trade-off).
    We then average across the roles, and then across target nouns.
    The task, as framed here, cannot be run with the LRA model, and, because of its open-ended nature (we do not start from a predefined list of pairs), we do not smooth the models.
    Table 11 reports the performance of our models, as well as the F scores reported by Cimiano and Wenderoth.
    For our models, where we have access to the itemized data, we also report the standard deviation of F across the target nouns.
    All the DM models perform well (including DepDM, which is disfavored by the lack of Formal links), and once more TypeDM emerges as the best among them, with an F value that is also (slightly) above the best Cimiano and Wenderoth models (that are based on co-occurrence counts from the whole Web).
    Despite the large standard deviations, the difference in F across concep
