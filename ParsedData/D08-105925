ency parser using beam-search, demonstrating that beam-search is a competitive choice for both parsing approaches.
    We then combined the two parsers into a single system, using discriminative perceptron training and beam-search decoding.
    The appealing aspect of the combined parser is the incorporation of two largely different views of the parsing problem, thus increasing the information available to a single statistical parser, and thereby significantly increasing the accuracy.
    When tested using both English and Chinese dependency data, the combined parser was highly competitive compared to the best systems in the literature.
    The idea of combining different approaches to the same problem using beam-search and a global model could be applied to other parsing tasks, such as constituent parsing, and possibly other NLP tasks.
