  a 120K sub- set of the French Hansards) still yields a respectable 93.2% (type) and 98.9% (token) precision on the verb-lemmatization test set for the full Hansards.
  Given that the Bible is actually larger (approxi- mately 300K words, depending on version and language) and avail- able on-line or via OCR for virtually all languages (Resnik et al., 2000), we also conducted several experiments on Bible-based mor- phology induction, further detailed in Table 3.
  7.2.1 Boosting Performance via Multiple Parallel Translations Even though at most one translation of the Bible is typically available in a given foreign language, numerous English Bible ver- sions are freely available and a performance increase can be achie- ved by simultaneously utilizi
