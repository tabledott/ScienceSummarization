ance evaluation were based on the number of constituents correct, using measures similar to the crossing brackets measure, we would want the parse tree that was most likely to have the largest number of correct constituents.
    With this criterion and the example grammar of Figure 3, the best parse tree would be The probability that the S constituent is correct is 1.0, while the probability that the A constituent is correct is 1, and the probability that the B constituent is correct is Thus, this tree has on average 2 constituents correct.
    All other trees will have fewer constituents correct on average.
    We call the best parse tree under this criterion the Maximum Constituents Parse.
    Notice that this parse tree cannot even be produced by the grammar: each of its constituents is good, but it is not necessarily good when considered as a full tree.
    Bod (1993a, 1995a) shows that the most probable derivation does not perform as well as the most probable parse for the DOP model, getting 65% exact ma
