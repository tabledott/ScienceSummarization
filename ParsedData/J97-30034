rainable, the tagging performance on unknown words is reported to be only about 66% correct for English.2 More advanced word-guessing methods use word features such as leading and trailing word segments to determine possible tags for unknown words.
    Such methods can achieve better performance, reaching tagging accuracy of up to 85% on unknown words for English (Brill 1994; Weischedel et al. 1993).
    The Xerox tagger (Cutting et al. 1992) comes with a set of rules that assign an unknown word a set of possible POS-tags (i.e., Pos-class) on the basis of its ending segment.
    We call such rules endingguessing rules because they rely only on ending segments in their predictions.
    For example, an ending-guessing rule can predict that a word is a gerund or an adjective if it ends with ing.
    The ending-guessing approach was elaborated in Weischedel et al. (1993), where an unknown word was guessed by using the probability for an unknown word to be of a particular POS-tag, given its capitalization feature
