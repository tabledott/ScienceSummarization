n from not-closed to closed is still entailed.
    In 2k, the event that brings about the closed state of the door is made more explicit by specifying the actor involved.
    These differences constitute what I call the event structure of a lexical item.
    Both the opposition of predicates and the specification of causation are part of a verb's semantics, and are structurally associated with slots in the event template for the word.
    As we will see in the next section, there are different inferences associated with each event type, as well as different syntactic behaviors (cf.
    Grimshaw 1990 and Pustejovsky 1991).
    Because the lexical semantic representation of a word is not an isolated expression, but is in fact linked to the rest of the lexicon, in Section 7, I suggest how the global integration of the semantics for a lexical item is achieved by structured inheritance through the different qualia associated with a word.
    I call this the lexical inheritance structure for the word.
    Finally,
