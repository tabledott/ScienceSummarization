  Parser Combination By Reparsing
  
    We present a novel parser combination scheme that works by reparsing input sentences once they have already been parsed by several different parsers.
    We apply this idea to dependency and constituent parsing, generating results that surpass state-of-theart accuracy levels for individual parsers.
  
  
    Over the past decade, remarkable progress has been made in data-driven parsing.
    Much of this work has been fueled by the availability of large corpora annotated with syntactic structures, especially the Penn Treebank (Marcus et al., 1993).
    In fact, years of extensive research on training and testing parsers on the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) corpus of the Penn Treebank have resulted in the availability of several high-accuracy parsers.
    We present a framework for combining the output of several different accurate parsers to produce results that are superior to those of each of the individual parsers.
    This is done in a two stage process of reparsing.
