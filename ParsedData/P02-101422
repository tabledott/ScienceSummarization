less, there is substantial room for improvement.
    As noted above, for example, it is important to automate the precision-oriented feature selection procedure as well as to investigate other methods for feature selection.
    We also plan to investigate previous work on common noun phrase interpretation (e.g.
    Sidner (1979), Harabagiu et al. (2001)) as a means of improving common noun phrase resolution, which remains a challenge for state-of-the-art coreference resolution systems.
  
  
    Thanks to three anonymous reviewers for their comments and, in particular, for suggesting that we investigate data fragmentation issues.
