apers cited below aim at the construction of hyponym (is-a) hierarchies.
    Note that they can also be viewed as algorithms for category discovery, because a subtree in such a hierarchy defines a lexical category.
    A first major algorithmic approach is to represent word contexts as vectors in some space and use similarity measures and automatic clustering in that space (Curran and Moens, 2002).
    Pereira (1993) and Lin (1998) use syntactic features in the vector definition.
    (Pantel and Lin, 2002) improves on the latter by clustering by committee.
    Caraballo (1999) uses conjunction and appositive annotations in the vector representation.
    The only previous works addressing our problem and not requiring any syntactic annotation are those that decompose a lexically-defined matrix (by SVD, PCA etc), e.g.
    (Sch&#168;utze, 1998; Deerwester et al, 1990).
    Such matrix decomposition is computationally heavy and has not been proven to scale well when the number of words assigned to categories grow
