 of a is substituted at a frontier nonterminal node (a node) and all components of a that are above the substituted component are inserted into d-edges above the substituted node or placed above the root node.
    For example, consider the d-trees a and shown in Figure 3.
    Note that components are shown as triangles.
    In the composed d-tree 7 the component a(5) is substituted at a substitution node in /3.
    The components, a(1), a(2), and a(4) of a above a(5) drift up the path in which runs from the substitution node.
    These are then into in # or above the root of #.
    In general, when a component some d-tree a is inserted into a d-edge betnodes and two new d-edges are created, the first of which relates and the root node of the second of which relates the frontier 'Santorini and Mahootian (1995) provide additional evidence against the standard TAG approach to modification from code switching data, which can be accounted for by using sister-adjunction.
