 DEP-PCFG, which does exhibit a drop in F1 over larger spans.
    The top row of figure 8 shows the recall of nontrivial brackets, split according the brackets&#8217; labels in the treebank.
    Unsurprisingly, NP recall is highest, but other categories are also high.
    Because we ignore trivial constituents, the comparatively low S represents only embedded sentences, which are somewhat harder even for supervised systems.
    To facilitate comparison to other recent work, figure 6 shows the accuracy of our system when trained on the same WSJ data, but tested on the ATIS corpus, and evaluated according to the EVALB program.6 The F1 numbers are lower for this corpus and evaluation method.7 Still, CCM beats not only RBRANCH (by 8.3%), but also the previous conditional COND-CCM and the next closest unsupervised system (which does not beat RBRANCH in F1).
    Parsing figures can only be a component of evaluating an unsupervised induction system.
    Low scores may indicate systematic alternate analyses rather th
