   This is also true of some of the uses Hawkins classified as unfamiliar, such as his nominal modifiers and associative clause classes.
    Attempts at making this intuition more precise include Christophersen's (1939) familiarity theory, Strawson's (1950) presuppositional theory of definite descriptions, Hawkins's (1978) location theory and its revision, Clark and Marshall's (1981) theory of definite reference and mutual knowledge, as well as more formal proposals such as Heim (1982).
    Neither the uniqueness nor the familiarity approach have yet succeeded in providing a satisfactory account of all uses of definite descriptions (Fraurud 1990; Birner and Ward 1994).
    However, the theories based on familiarity address more directly the main concern of NLP system designers, which is to identify the connections between discourse entities.
    Furthermore, the prior corpus-based studies of definite descriptions use that we are aware of (Prince 1981, 1992; Fraurud 1990) are based on theories of this type.
