t cognates for bitext mapping purposes (Simard, Foster, and Isabelle 1992) deemed two alphabetic tokens cognates if their first four characters were identical.
    This criterion proved surprisingly effective, given its simplicity However, like all heuristics, it produced some false positives and some false SIMR's &amp;quot;expanding rectangle&amp;quot; search strategy.
    The search rectangle is anchored at the top right corner of the previously accepted chain.
    Its diagonal remains parallel to the main diagonal. negatives.
    An example of a false negative is the word pair government and gouvernement .
    The false positives were often words with a big difference in length, like conseil and conservative.
    These examples suggest that a more accurate cognate criterion can be driven by approximate string matching.
    For example, McEnery and Oakes (1995) threshold the Dice coefficient of matching character bigrams in each pair of candidate cognates.
    The matching predicates in SIMR's current imple
