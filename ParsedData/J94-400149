tain similarity measure and that information about conjunctive structures enables the syntactic analysis to be more robust and successful in handling long and complex sentences.
    There are still some expressions that cannot be recognized by the proposed method, and one might hasten to rely on semantic information in the hope of getting proper analyses for these remaining cases.
    Semantic information, however, is not as reliable as syntactic information, and we have to make further efforts to find some syntactic rather than semantic relations even in these difficult cases.
    Phrase structure grammar or other existing grammar formalisms may not be applicable in detecting the subtle syntactic relations among several words in a sentence.
    We have to find new methods to detect them.
    To make further progress in this field, we feel it is necessary to be able to take into consideration more possible interactions among a wider range of components of long sentences.
