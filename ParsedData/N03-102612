as to maximize a discriminative criterion, namely the conditional likelihood L(A) of a summarized f-structure given the sentence.
    Optimization of the function shown below was performed using a conjugate gradient optiAt the core of the exponential probability model is a vector of property-functions f to be weighted by parameters A.
    For the application of sentence condensation, 13,000 property-functions of roughly three categories were used: A trained probability model is applied to unseen data by selecting the most probable transferred f-structure, yielding the string generated from the selected structure as the target condensation.
    The transfered f-structure chosen for our current example is shown in Fig.
    3.
    This structure was produced by the following set of transfer rules, where var refers to the indices in the representation of the f-structure: rtrace(r13,keep(var(98),of)), rtrace(r161,keep(system,var(85))), rtrace(r1,del(var(91),set,by)), rtrace(r1,del(var(53),be,for)), rtrace(r20,equa
