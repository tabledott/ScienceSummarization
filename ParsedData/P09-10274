    Sentiment classification can be performed on words, sentences or documents.
    In this paper we focus on document sentiment classification.
    The methods for document sentiment classification can be generally categorized into lexicon-based and corpus-based.
    Lexicon-based methods usually involve deriving a sentiment measure for text based on sentiment lexicons.
    Turney (2002) predicates the sentiment orientation of a review by the average semantic orientation of the phrases in the review that contain adjectives or adverbs, which is denoted as the semantic oriented method.
    Kim and Hovy (2004) build three models to assign a sentiment category to a given sentence by combining the individual sentiments of sentimentbearing words.
    Hiroshi et al. (2004) use the technique of deep language analysis for machine translation to extract sentiment units in text documents.
