  ruth-aachen, de Abst ract In this paper, we t)resent and compare various align- nmnt models for statistical machine translation.
  We propose to measure tile quality of an aligmnent model using the quality of the Viterbi alignment comt)ared to a manually-produced alignment and de- scribe a refined mmotation scheme to produce suit- able reference alignments.
  We also con,pare the im- pact of different; alignment models on tile translation quality of a statistical machine translation system.
  1 I n t roduct ion In statistical machine translation (SMT) it is neces- smy to model the translation probability P r ( f l  a Ic~).
  Here .fi = f denotes tile (15ench) source and e{ = e denotes the (English) target string.
