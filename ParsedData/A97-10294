; and &amp;quot;how&amp;quot; of a sentence or body of text.
    Furthermore, name-finding can be useful in its own right: an Internet query system might use namefinding to construct more appropriately-formed queries: &amp;quot;When was Bill Gates born?&amp;quot; could yield the query &amp;quot;Bill Gates&amp;quot;+born.
    Also, name-finding can be directly employed for link analysis and other information retrieval problems.
  
  
    We will present the model twice, first in a conceptual and informal overview, then in a moredetailed, formal description of it as a type of HMM.
    The model bears resemblance to Scott Miller's novel work in the Air Traffic Information System (ATIS) task, as documented in (Miller et al., 1994).
    Figure 3.1 is a pictorial overview of our model.
    Informally, we have an ergodic HMM with only eight internal states (the name classes, including the NOT-A-NAME class), with two special states, the START- and END-OF-SENTENCE states.
    Within each of the name-class states, we u
