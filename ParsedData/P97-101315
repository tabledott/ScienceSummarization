were supposed to rely on their intuition and preferred definition of clause.
    The locations in texts that were labelled as clause boundaries by at least two of the three judges were considered to be &amp;quot;valid clause boundaries&amp;quot;.
    We used the valid clause boundaries assigned by judges as indicators of discourse usages of cue phrases and we determined manually the cue phrases that signalled a discourse relation.
    For example, if an &amp;quot;and&amp;quot; was used in a sentence and if the judges agreed that a clause boundary existed just before the &amp;quot;and&amp;quot;, we assigned that &amp;quot;and&amp;quot; a discourse usage.
    Otherwise, we assigned it a sentential usage.
    Hence, we manually determined all discourse usages of cue phrases and all discourse boundaries between elementary units.
    We then applied our marker and clause identification algorithm on the same texts.
    Our algorithm found 80.8% of the discourse markers with a precision of 89.5% (see INPUT: a text T
