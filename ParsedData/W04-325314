    A resultant feature vector representing a text may be composed of a combination of boolean unigramstyle features and real-valued favorability measures in the form of the Osgood values and the PMI derived values.
    SVMs are a machine learning classification technique which use a function called a kernel to map a space of data points in which the data is not linearly separable onto a new space in which it is, with allowances for erroneous classification.
    For a tutorial on SVMs and details of their formulation we refer the reader to Burges (1998) and Cristiani and Shawe-Tailor (2000).
    A detailed treatment of these models&#8217; application to text classification may be found in Joachims (2001).
  
  
    First, value phrases were extracted and their values were derived using the method described in section 3.1.
    After this, supervised learning was performed using these values as features.
    In training data, reviews corresponding to a below average rating were classed as negati
