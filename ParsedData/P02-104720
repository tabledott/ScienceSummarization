from this manually annotated corpus all CONTRAST, CAUSE-EXPLANATION-EVIDENCE, CONDITION and ELABORATION relations that hold between two adjacent elementary discourse units.
    Since RST (Mann and Thompson, 1988) employs a finer grained taxonomy of relations than we used, we applied the definitions shown in Table 1.
    That is, we considered that a CONTRAST relation held between two text spans if a human annotator labeled the relation between those spans as ANTITHESIS, CONCESSION, OTHERWISE or CONTRAST.
    We retrained then all classifiers on the Raw corpus, but this time without removing from the corpus the cue phrases that were used to generate the training examples.
    We did this because when trying to determine whether a CONTRAST relation holds between two spans of texts separated by the cue phrase &#8220;but&#8221;, for example, we want to take advantage of the cue phrase occurrence as well.
    We employed our classifiers on the manually labeled examples extracted from Carlson et al.&#8217;s corpus
