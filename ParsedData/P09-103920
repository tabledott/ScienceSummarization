ctivity indicators and alternative definitions of &#8220;nonprojective arc.&#8221; For example, by using dynamic constraints of the same kind as those in &#167;3.3, we can indicate arcs that &#8220;cross&#8221; other arcs with O(n3) variables and constraints, and a cubic number of non-zero elements in the constraint matrix (omitted for space).
    It would be straightforward to adapt the constraints in &#167;3.5 to allow only projective parse trees: simply force znp a = 0 for any a &#8712; A.
    But there are more efficient ways of accomplish this.
    While it is difficult to impose projectivity constraints or cycle constraints individually, there is a simpler way of imposing both.
    Consider 3 (or 30) from &#167;3.1.
    300.
    If hi, ji &#8712; B, then, for any k = 1, ... , n such that k =6 j, the parent of k must satisfy (defining i0 , min(i, j) and j0 , max(i, j)): Then, Y(x) will be redefined as the set ofprojective dependency parse trees.
    We omit the proof for space.
    Conditions 1, 2, and 3
