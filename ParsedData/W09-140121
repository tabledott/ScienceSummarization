ote by the overall f-score of the system; &#8220;Event Type&#8221; weights each vote by the f-score of the system for the specific event type.
    The best score, 55.96%, was obtained by the &#8220;Event Type&#8221; weighting scheme, showing a 4% unit improvement over the best individual system.
    While using the final scores for weighting uses data that would not be available in practice, similar weighting could likely be obtained e.g. using performance on the development data.
    The experiment demonstrates that an f-score better than 55% can be achieved simply by combining the strengths of the systems.
  
  
    Meeting with the community-wide participation, the BioNLP Shared Task was successful in introducing fine-grained event extraction to the domain.
    The evaluation results of the final submissions from the participants are both promising and encouraging for the future of this approach to IE.
    It has been revealed that state-of-the-art performance in event extraction is approaching a practical
