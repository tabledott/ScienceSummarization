nge the value of the time register.
    An event clause, however, is evaluated with respect to a later but adjacent interval t', and resets the time register to an interval t&amp;quot;, later than but adjacent to t'.
    (Cf.
    Polanyi and Scha, 1981) To show that this gives us the desired semantic consequences, we consider an abbreviated version of a detective story fragment, quoted by Hinrichs (1981): (El) He went to the window The E clauses are events, the C clauses are circumstances.
    The events are evaluated at disjoint, sucsessively later intervals.
