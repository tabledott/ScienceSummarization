  ~.2, 1 + c+var (d ) + r .
  b + vat (d ) , , + a + c  gyp " As ~2 approaches 1, var(~ 2) decreases to 0, which makes the equation for var~,,,at unsuitable as an estimate of the variance.
  We calculate a variance for this case by assuming that bc &lt;&lt; ad, which implies that ~2 = I - (b + c)/a.
  With this assumption, we obtain vara,~,(O2) = a-2(b + c)(1 + b + c ) a We do not have an exact relation to specify when ~2 is large and when it is small.
  Rather, we observe that each estimate produces a value that is small in its domain, so we estimate the variance of ~2 by the minimum of the two cases: var(~ 2) = min(var~,~,,vart~,8 ,).
  Selecting Pairs We have now seen how we could decide that house and chambre are more associated than house and communes.
  But why did we decide to look at these pairs of words and not some others?
  As we mentioned before, we probably cant afford to look at all VzVp pairs unless we limit the vocabulary sizes down to something like the 900
