t constructs headlines from words in a story, taken in order and focusing on the earlier part of the story.
    Next, we describe the application of the parse-and-trim approach to the problem of headline generation.
    We discuss the linguistically-motivated heuristics we use to produce results that are headlinelike.
    Finally, we evaluate Hedge Trimmer by comparing it to our earlier work on headline generation, a probabilistic model for automatic headline generation (Zajic et al, 2002).
    In this paper we will refer to this statistical system as HMM Hedge We demonstrate the effectiveness of our linguistically-motivated approach, Hedge Trimmer, over the probabilistic model, HMM Hedge, using both human evaluation and automatic metrics.
  
  
    Other researchers have investigated the topic of automatic generation of abstracts, but the focus has been different, e.g., sentence extraction (Edmundson, 1969; Johnson et al, 1993; Kupiec et al., 1995; Mann et al., 1992; Teufel and Moens, 1997; Zechner, 1995), p
