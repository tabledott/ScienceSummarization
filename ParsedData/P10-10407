erved in f (Sahlgren, 2005).
    Kaski (1998) uses this technique to produce 100-dimensional representations of documents.
    Sahlgren (2001) was the first author to use random indexing using narrow context.
    Sahlgren (2006) does a battery of experiments exploring different design decisions involved in constructing F, prior to using random indexing.
    However, like all the works cited above, Sahlgren (2006) only uses distributional representation to improve existing systems for one-shot classification tasks, such as IR, WSD, semantic knowledge tests, and text categorization.
    It is not well-understood what settings are appropriate to induce distributional word representations for structured prediction tasks (like parsing and MT) and sequence labeling tasks (like chunking and NER).
    Previous research has achieved repeated successes on these tasks using clustering representations (Section 3) and distributed representations (Section 4), so we focus on these representations in our work.
