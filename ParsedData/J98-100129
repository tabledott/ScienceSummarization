 senses of words by subject (ECONOMICS, ENGINEERING, etc.).
    Guthrie et al. (1991) demonstrate a typical use of this information: in addition to using the Lesk-based method of counting overlaps between definitions and contexts, they impose a correspondence of subject codes in an iterative process.
    No quantitative evaluation of this method is available, but Cowie, Guthrie, and Guthrie (1992) improve the method using simulated annealing and report results of 47% for sense distinctions and 72% for homographs.
    The use of LDOCE box codes, however, is problematic: the codes are not systematic (see, for example, Fontenelle [1990]); in later work, Braden-Harder (1993) showed that simply matching box or subject codes is not sufficient for disambiguation.
    For example, in I tipped the driver, the codes for several senses of the words in the sentence satisfy the necessary constraints (e.g., tip-money + human object or tip-tilt + movable solid object).
