e shared by other members of the cluster.
			In this paper, we propose a clustering algo rithm, CBC (Clustering By Committee), in which the centroid of a cluster is constructed by averaging the feature vectors of a subset of the cluster members.
			The subset is viewed as a committee that determines which other elements belong to the cluster.
			By carefully choosing committee members, the features of the centroid tend to be the more typical features of the target class.
			For example, our system chose the following committee members to compute the centroid of the state cluster: Illinois, Michigan, Minnesota, Iowa, Wisconsin, Indiana, Nebraska and Vermont.
			As a result, the centroid contains only features like those in List A. Evaluating clustering results is a very difficult task.
			We introduce a new evaluation methodol ogy that is based on the editing distance between output clusters and classes extracted from WordNet (the answer key).
