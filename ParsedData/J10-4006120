M results were obtained simply by measuring the verb inter-slot similarities in the W1L&#215;W2 space.
    Conversely, the classifiers in Merlo and Stevenson (2001) rely on a much larger range of knowledge-intensive features selected in an ad hoc fashion for this task (on the other hand, their training corpus is not parsed and it is much smaller than ours).
    Finally, we can notice that in both experiments the mildly (TypeDM) and heavily (LexDM) lexicalized DM models score better than their non-lexicalized counterpart (DepDM), although the difference between the best DM model and DepDM is not significant on either data set (p = 0.23 for the LexDM/DepDM difference in C/I; p = 0.57 for the TypeDM/DepDM difference in MS).
    Verb alternations do not typically appear among the standard tasks on which DSMs are tested.
    Moreover, they involve non-trivial properties of argument structure.
    The good performance of DM in these experiments is therefore particularly significant in supporting its vocation as a g
