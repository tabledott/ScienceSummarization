ween nouns and cluster centroids, the average cluster distortion is subject to normalization of p(n lc) and fixed (5), we obtain the following standard exponential forms (Jaynes, 1983) for the class and membership distributions where the normalization sums (partition functions) are Zc = En exp &#8212; fld(n, c) and Zr, = Ec exp &#8212;)3c/(n, c).
    Notice that d(n, c) does not need to be symmetric for this derivation, as the two distributions are simply related by Bayes's rule.
    Returning to the log-likelihood variation (4), we can now use (7) for p(n1c) and the assumption for the asymmetric model that the cluster membership stays fixed as we adjust the centroids, to obtain where the variation of p(vic) is now included in the variation of d(n, c).
    For a large enough sample, we may replace the sum over observations in (9) by the average over Af.
    At the log-likelihood maximum, this variation must vanish.
    We will see below that the use of relative entropy for similarity measure makes 6 log Zc va
