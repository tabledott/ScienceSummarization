ample, the combination of subject and complement stores for a verb into a clause store is done in one of our test grammars by lexical rules such as which states that the store SC of a clause with main verb 'love' and the stores SS and SO of the subject and object the verb subcategorizes for satisfy the constraint shuffle(SS, SO, SC), meaning that Sc is an interleaving of elements of SS and SO in their original order.
    5 Finally, it is necessary to deal with the noun phrases that create store elements.
    Ignoring the issue of how to treat quantifiers from within complex noun phrases, we need lexical rules for determiners, of the form det(3-sing,X,P,[qterm(every,X,P)])/X ---&gt; [every]. stating that the semantics of a quantified NP is simply the variable bound by the store element arising from the NP.
    For rules of this form to work properly, it is essential that distinct bound logicalform variables be represented as distinct constants in the terms encoding the logical forms.
    This is an instance of
