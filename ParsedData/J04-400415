d around gerunds, as in the flying planes example.8 Removing null elements simply involves pruning the tree to eliminate any subtree that dominates only null elements.
    The special trace tag that is inserted in the step that adds gap information (Section 4.5) is excluded, as it is specifically chosen to be something other than the null-element preterminal marker (which is -NONE- in the Penn Treebank).
    The step in which punctuation is raised is discussed in detail in chapter 7 of Collins&#8217; thesis.
    The main idea is to raise punctuation&#8212;which is any preterminal subtree in which the part of speech is either a comma or a colon&#8212;to the highest possible point in the tree, so that it always sits between two other nonterminals.
    Punctuation that occurs at the very beginning or end of a sentence is &#8220;raised away,&#8221; that is, pruned.
    In addition, any implementation of this step should handle the case in which multiple punctuation elements appear as the initial or final children
