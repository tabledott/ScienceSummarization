y require measuring the goodness of fit of a word/concept as argument filler of another word/concept, including assigning semantic roles, logical metonymy, coercion (Pustejovsky 1995), and many other challenges.
    The selectional preference test sets are based on averages of human judgments on a seven-point scale about the plausibility of nouns as arguments (either subjects or objects) of verbs.
    The McRae data set (McRae, Spivey-Knowlton, and Tanenhaus 1998) consists of 100 noun&#8211;verb pairs rated by 36 subjects.
    The Pad&#180;o set (Pad&#180;o 2007) has 211 pairs rated by 20 subjects.
    For each verb, we first use the W1xLW2 space to select a set of nouns that are highly associated with the verb via a subject or an object link.
    In this space, nouns are represented as vectors with dimensions that are labeled with (link, word) tuples, where the word might be a verb, and the link might stand for, among other things, syntactic relations such as obj (or, in the LexDM model, an expansion thereof
