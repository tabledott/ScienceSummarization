ting the two most probable substrings in order to form the larger unit.
    Since it can be computed rapidly with low memory costs, we use this approximation.
    Two additional issues need addressing before evaluation.
    The first regards document sourcing.
    If an n-gram appears in multiple sources (eg., Congressional Record versus Associated Press), its likelihood of accuracy should increase.
    This is particularly true if we are looking for MWU headwords for a general versus specialized dictionary.
    Phrases that appear in one source may in fact be general MWUs, but frequently, they are text-specific units.
    Hence, precision gained by excluding single-source n-grams may be worth losses in recall.
    We will measure this trade-off.
    Second, evaluating with punctuation as words and applying no filtering mechanism may unfairly bias against some algorithms.
    Pre- or post-processing of n-grams with a linguistic filter has shown to improve some induction algorithms&#8217; performance (Daille,
