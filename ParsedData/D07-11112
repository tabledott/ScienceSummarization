 be used to improve parsing accuracy, even when only a single parsing algorithm is used, as long as variation can be ob tained, for example, by using different learning techniques or changing parsing direction from forward to backward (of course, even greater gains may be achieved when different algo rithms are used, although this is not pursued here); and, finally, 4.

			1044 task (Nivre et al, 2007), which differed from the 2006 edition by featuring two separate tracks, one in multilingual parsing, and a new track on domain adaptation for dependency parsers.
			In the multi lingual parsing track, participants train dependency parsers using treebanks provided for ten languages: Arabic
