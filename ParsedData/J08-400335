= (Vx, Ax) (Vx = {0, 1,...,p}).
    As in Proof 1, we may now assume that there exists a transition sequence C0,q for the sentence x' = (w0,w1,wp&#8722;1) and subgraph Gx, = (Vx &#8722; {p},A&#8722;p), where the terminal configuration has the form cq = (&#963;cq, [ ],A&#8722;p).
    For the arc-eager algorithm, if i is a root in Gx, then i E &#963;c ; but if i E &#963;cq then i is either a root or has a head j such that j &lt; i in Gx,.
    6his is because i may have been pushed onto the stack in a RIGHT-ARCel transition and may or may not have been popped in a later REDUCE transition.)
    Apart from the possibility of unreduced right dependents, we can use the same reasoning as in Proof 1 to show that, for any i E &#963;cq that is a root in Gx,, if i is a dependent of p in Gx then any j such that j E &#963;cq, i &lt; j and j is a root in Gx, must also be a dependent of p in Gx (or else Gx would fail to be projective).
    Moreover, if p has a head k in Gx, then k must be in &#963;cq and any j such that j E
