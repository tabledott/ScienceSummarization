ency structures from the parse trees (with flattened verb phrases) and calculated crossings for them.
    Figure 9 shows a parse tree and its corresponding dependency structure.
    The procedure for counting modifier crossings in a dependency structure is identical to the procedure for parse trees.
    For head crossings, the only difference is that rather than comparing spans of two siblings, we compare the spans of a child and its parent.
    Again focusing on the S P alignment case, we see that the average number of head crossings (see Table 4) continues to decrease compared to the previous case (from 2.252 to 1.88), and that the average number of modifier crossings (see Table 5) continues to increase (from 0.86 to 1.498).
    This time, however, the percentages for both types of crossings (see Tables 6 and 7) decrease relative to the case of flattened verb phrases (from 15.12% to 12.62% for heads and from 10.59% to 9.22% for modifiers).
    The percentage of modifier crossings is still higher than in the
