l complexity,4 if the usual memory-processing tradeoff on serial machines is exploited by maintaining redundant data structures such as multiple hash tables and ordered indexed trees.'
    The next task is to determine for each word pair, whether it will actually be entered into the WAT: the WAT is a sorted table where the more reliable pairs are put before less reliable ones.
    For this purpose, each entry contains, as well as the pair of words themselves, the frequencies of those words in their respective texts and the similarity between them.
    The closeness of the association between two words, and thus their rank in the WAT, is evaluated with respect to their similarity and the total number of their occurrences.
    To understand why similarity cannot be used alone, note that there are far more one-frequency words than words of higher frequency.
    Thus, a pair of words with a similarity of 1, each of them occurring only once, may well be the result of a random event.
    If such a pair was proposed
