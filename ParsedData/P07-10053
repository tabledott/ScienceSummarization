    In another work (Vickrey et al., 2005), the WSD problem was recast as a word translation task.
    The translation choices for a word w were defined as the Then, in Section 3, we describe the Hiero MT sysset of words or phrases aligned to w, as gathered tem and introduce the two new features used to intefrom a word-aligned parallel corpus.
    The authors grate the WSD system into Hiero.
    In Section 4, we showed that they were able to improve their model&#8217;s describe the training data used by the WSD system. accuracy on two simplified translation tasks: word In Section 5, we describe how the WSD translations translation and blank-filling. provided are used by the decoder of the MT system.
