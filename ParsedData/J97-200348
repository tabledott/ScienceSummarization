transducer defined on the tropical serniring.
    Ti has the twins property iff V(u, V) E (E*)2,1UVI &lt; Clearly if Ti has the twins property, then (21) holds.
    Conversely, we prove that if (21) holds, then it also holds for any (u, v) E (E* )2, by induction on I uv.
    Our proof is similar to that of Berstel (1979) for string-to-string transducers.
    Consider (u, v) E (E*)2 and (q, q') E l(2112 such that: {q, q'} c I (I, u), q c 61(q, v), q' E (q' , v).
    Assume that luvl &gt; 21(2112 &#8212; 1 with Ivl &gt; 0.
    Then either lul &gt; Assume that I u I &gt; 1(21 12 - 1.
    Since Ti is a trim unambiguous transducer there exists 1(2112 &#8212; 1 or Iv' a unique path 7r in Ti from i E Ito q labeled with the input string u, and a unique path &gt; 1Q112 &#8212; 1.
    7r' from i' E Ito q'.
    In view of lemma 2, there exist strings 141, u2, u3 in E*, and states pi, p2, p, and p12 such that I u2I &gt; 0, u1u2u3 = u and such that ir and ir' be factored in the following way: Next, assume that lvi &gt; 1Q
