odel (Zhao and Xing, 2007).
    Tam, Lane and Schultz (Tam et al., 2007) also show improvements in machine translation using bilingual topic models.
    Both of these translation-focused topic models infer word-to-word alignments as part of their inference procedures, which would become exponentially more complex if additional languages were added.
    We take a simpler approach that is more suitable for topically similar document tuples (where documents are not direct translations of one another) in more than two languages.
    A recent extended abstract, developed concurrently by Ni et al. (Ni et al., 2009), discusses a multilingual topic model similar to the one presented here.
    However, they evaluate their model on only two languages (English and Chinese), and do not use the model to detect differences between languages.
    They also provide little analysis of the differences between polylingual and single-language topic models.
    Outside of the field of topic modeling, Kawaba et al. (Kawaba et al.,
