e the structure of the model in details.
    Consider an anaphor ana and its candidate set candidate_set, {C1, C2, ..., Ck}, where Cj is closer to ana than Ci if j &gt; i.
    Suppose positive_set is the set of candidates that occur in the coreferential chain of ana, and negative_set is the set of candidates not in the chain, that is, negative_set = candidate_set - positive_set.
    The set of training instances based on ana, inst_set, is defined as follows: From the above definition, an instance is formed by an anaphor, one positive candidate and one negative candidate.
    For each instance, inst(ci, cj, ana), the candidate at the first position, Ci, is closer to the anaphor than the candidate at the second position, Cj.
    A training instance inst(ci, cj , ana) is labeled as positive if Ci &#8712; positive-set and Cj &#8712; negative-set; or negative if Ci &#8712; negative-set and Cj &#8712; positiveset.
