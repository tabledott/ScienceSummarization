le x = John saw Mary, with directed graph representation Gx, root saw John Mary 10 9 9 30 3020 3 0 11 The first step of the algorithm is to find, for each word, the highest scoring incoming edge root saw John Mary30 3020 If the result were a tree, it would have to be the maximum spanning tree.
			However, in this case we have a cycle, so we will contract it into a single node and recalculate edge weights according to Figure 3.
			root saw John Mary 40 9 30 31 wjs The new vertex wjs represents the contraction of vertices John and saw.
			The edge from wjs to Mary is 30 since that is the highest scoring edge from any vertex in wjs.
			The edge from root into wjs is set to40 since this represents the score of the best span ning tree originating from root and including only the vertices in wjs.
			The same leads to the edge from Mary to wjs.
			The fundamental property of the Chu-Liu-Edmonds algorithm is that an MST in thisgraph can be transformed into an MST in the orig inal graph (Leonidas, 2003).
			Thus, we r
