n a typical graph-based parser such as MSTParser.
    The distance between S0 and N0 will correspond to the distance between a pair of head and modifier when an LeftArc action is taken, for example, but not when a Shift action is taken.
    Valency of S0 and N0 The number of modifiers to a given head is used by the graph-based submodel of Zhang and Clark (2008) and the models of Martins et al. (2009) and Sagae and Tsujii (2007).
    We include similar information in our model.
    In particular, we calculate the number of left and right modifiers separately, calling them left valency and right valency, respectively.
    Left and right valencies are represented by vl and vr in Table 2, respectively.
    They are combined with the word and POS-tag of S0 and N0 to form new feature templates.
    Again, the use of valency information in our transition-based parser is different from the aforementioned graph-based models.
    In our case, valency information is put into the context of the shift-reduce process, and
