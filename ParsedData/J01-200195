these relationships: for example, while it does break up ments into ment and s, it does not explicitly determine which suffixes s may attach to, etc.
    This must be done in a more adequate version.

    In work in progress, we have added to the capability of the algorithm the ability to posit suffixes that are in part subtractive morphemes.
    That is, in English, we would like to establish a single signature that combines NULL.ed.ing.s and e.ed.es.ing (for jump and love, respectively).
    We posit an operator (x) which deletes a preceding character x, and with the mechanism, we can establish a single signature NULL.(e)ed.
