    The later IBM models are formulated to prefer collocations (Brown et al. 1993).
    In the case of word_align (Dagan, Church, and Gale 1993; Dagan and Church 1994), a penalty is imposed according to the deviation from an ideal matching, as constructed by linear interpolation.'
    From this point of view, the proposed technique is a word alignment method that imposes a more realistic distortion penalty.
    The tree structure reflects the assumption that crossings should not be penalized as long as they are consistent with constituent structure.
    Figure 7 gives theoretical upper bounds on the matching flexibility as the lengths of the sequences increase, where the constituent structure constraints are reflected by high flexibility up to length-4 sequences and a rapid drop-off thereafter.
    In other words, ITGs appeal to a language universals hypothesis, that the core arguments of frames, which exhibit great ordering variation between languages, are relatively few and surface in syntactic proximity.
