 names in Section 4.4, relates to the internal structure of hanzi.
    Following the system devised under the Qing emperor Kang Xi, hanzi have traditionally been classified according to a set of approximately 200 semantic radicals; members of a radical class share a particular structural component, and often also share a common meaning (hence the term 'semantic).
    For example, hanzi containing the INSECT radical tend to denote insects and other crawling animals; examples include wal 'frog,' fengl 'wasp,' and it8 she2 'snake.'
    Similarly, hanzi sharing the GHOST radical tend to denote spirits and demons, such as gui3 'ghost' itself, M mo2 'demon,' and Ri yan3 'nightmare.'
    While the semantic aspect of radicals is by no means completely predictive, the semantic homogeneity of many classes is quite striking: for example 254 out of the 263 examples (97%) of the INSECT class listed by Wieger (1965, 773-76) denote crawling or invertebrate animals; similarly 21 out of the 22 examples (95%) of the GHOST clas
