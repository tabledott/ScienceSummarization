mber of pairs of dependent paths grows with n. Since the derivation tees of TAG's, MCTAG's, and HG's are local sets, the choice of the structure used at each point in a derivation in these systems does not depend on the context at that point within the derivation.
    Thus, as in CFG's, at any point in the derivation, the set of structures that can be applied is determined only by a finite set of rules encapsulated by the grammar.
    We characterize a class of formalisms that have this property in Section 4.
    We loosely describe the class of all such systems as Linear Context-Free Rewriting Formalisms.
    As is described in Section 4, the property of having a derivation tree set that is a local set appears to be useful in showing important properties of the languages generated by the formalisms.
    The semilinearity of Tree Adjoining Languages (TAL's), MCTAL's, and Head Languages (HL's) can be proved using this property, with suitable restrictions on the composition operations.
