l-word weight makes the inital null-word weight redundant.
    In fact, the combined model without the initial null word-weight has the lowest AER on both the trial and test data of any variation tested (note AERs in italics in Figure 1).
    The relative reduction in AER for this model is 29.9% compared to the standard model.
    We tested the significance of the differences in alignment error between each pair of our principal versions of Model 1 by looking at the AER for each sentence pair in the test set using a 2-tailed paired t test.
    The differences between all these models were significant at a level of 10&#8722;7 or better, except for the difference between the standard model and the smoothed model, which was &#8220;significant&#8221; at the 0.61 level&#8212;that is, not at all significant.
    The reason for this is probably the very different balance between precision and recall with the standard and smoothed models, which indicates that the models make quite different sorts of errors, making st
