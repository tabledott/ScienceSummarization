Miller, 1990), are inadequate.
    For example, both Escort and Chinook are (among other things) types of vehicles (a car and a helicopter, respectively), but neither are cited as so in Wordnet.
    Manually building domain-specific lexicons can be a costly, time-consuming affair.
    Utilizing existing resources, such as on-line corpora, to aid in this task could improve performance both by decreasing the time to construct the lexicon and by improving its quality.
    Extracting semantic information from word co-occurrence statistics has been effective, particularly for sense disambiguation (Schiitze, 1992; Gale et al., 1992; Yarowsky, 1995).
    In Riloff and Shepherd (1997), noun co-occurrence statistics were used to indicate nominal category membership, for the purpose of aiding in the construction of semantic lexicons.
    Generically, their algorithm can be outlined as follows: Our algorithm uses roughly this same generic structure, but achieves notably superior results, by changing the specifics of: wh
