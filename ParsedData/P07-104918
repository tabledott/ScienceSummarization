here the strong labels on the left are a result of an inbound link: to For this reason, the learning process is based on the property &#8226;Ax i which indicates where a link is not possible.
    Since an outbound link on one word is inbound on the other, the inbound/outbound properties of each word are then calculated by a simple bootstrapping process as an average of the opposite properties of the neighboring words.
  
  
    At each step, the parser must assign a non-negative weight to every candidate link x &#65533; y which may d be added to an utterance prefix (x1,... , xk), and the link with the largest (non-zero) weight (with a preference for links between xk&#8722;1 and xk) is added to the parse.
    The weight could be assigned directly based on the In and Out properties of either x or y but this method is not satisfactory for three reasons: first, the values of these properties on low frequency words are not reliable; second, the values of the properties on x and y may conflict; third, some words ar
