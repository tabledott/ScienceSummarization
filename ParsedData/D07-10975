			to improve parsing accuracy for Chinese, while the arc-eager order was maintained for all other languages.
			2.
			Stack initialization: In the baseline version.
			the parser is initialized with an artificial root node (with token id 0) on the stack, so that arcsoriginating from the root can be added explicitly during parsing.
			But it is also possible to ini tialize the parser with an empty stack, in whichcase arcs from the root are only added implicitly (to any token that remains a root after pars ing is completed).
			Empty stack initialization (which reduces the amount of nondeterminismin parsing) led to improved accuracy for Cata lan, Chinese, Hungarian, Italian and Turkish.4
	
	
			a single left-to-right pass over the input, but it is possible to allow a second pass where onlyunattached tokens are processed.5 Such post processing was found to improve results for Basque, Catalan, Czech, Greek a
