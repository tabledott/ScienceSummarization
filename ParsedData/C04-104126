 new ap proach, most of the sentences are parsed using the most restrictive setting (?
			= 0.1).
			As well as investigating parser efficiency, we have also evaluated the accuracy of the parser onsection 00 of CCGbank, using both parsing strate gies together with the normal-form constraints.
			Thenew strategy increases the F-score over labelled de pendencies by approximately 0.5%, leading to the figures reported in Clark and Curran (2004).
			5.2 Comparison with Other Work.
			The only other work we are aware of to investigate the impact of supertagging on parsing efficiency is the work of Sarkar et al (2000) for LTAG.
			Sarkar etal.
			did find that LTAG supertagging increased pars ing speed, but at a significant cost in coverage: only 1,324 sentences out of a test set of 2,250 received a parse.
			The parse times reported are also not as good as those reported here: the time taken to parse the 2,250 test sentences was over 5 hours.5Multiplying by an estimate of the outside score may im prove the efficacy
