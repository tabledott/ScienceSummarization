tions produced by these two model variants share many of the same highest-probability words.
			A noteworthy property of the constructed graphs is thatword relatedness can be computed directly by compar ing walks that start at Token nodes.
			By contrast, existing WordNet-based measures require independent similarity judgments for all word senses relevant to a target wordpair (of which the maximum relatedness value is usu ally taken).
			Our algorithm lends itself to comparisonsbetween walks centered at a Synset node, or a Token POS node, or a Token node, or any mixed distributionthereof.
			And because the Synset nodes are strongly con nected, the model also admits direct comparison across parts of speech.

			We have shown how to compute the word-specific sta tionary distribution from any starting distribution in thegraph.
