    Interval expressions like &#8220;From May 1999 to June 1999&#8221;, or &#8220;from 3 pm to 6 pm&#8221; are represented as two separate TIMEX expressions.
    In addition to the values provided by the ISO standard, we have added several extensions, including a list of additional tokens to represent some commonly occurring temporal units; for example, &#8220;summer of &#8216;69&#8221; could be represented as 19:69:SU.
    The intention here is to capture the information in the text while leaving further interpretation of the Values to applications using the markup.
    It is worth noting that there are several kinds of temporal expressions that are not to be tagged, and that other expressions tagged as a time expression are not assigned a value, because doing so would violate the simplicity and preciseness requirements.
    We do not tag unanchored intervals, such as &#8220;half an hour (long)&#8221; or &#8220;(for) one month&#8221;.
