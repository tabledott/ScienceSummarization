#8220;blinker&#8221; are assigned the PER label.
    However, in general, this is not always the case; for example we might see in the same document the word sequences &#8220;Australia&#8221; and &#8220;The bank of Australia&#8221;.
    The first instance should be labeled as LOC, and the second as ORG.
    We consider three approaches proposed in the literature in the following sections.
    Before continuing the discussion, we note that we found that adjacent documents in the CoNLL03 and the MUC7 datasets often discuss the same entities.
    Therefore, we ignore document boundaries and analyze global dependencies in 200 and 1000 token windows.
    These constants were selected by hand after trying a small number of values.
    We believe that this approach will also make our system more robust in cases when the document boundaries are not given.
    (Chieu and Ng, 2003) used features that aggregate, for each document, the context tokens appear in.
    Sample features are: the longest capitilized sequence of
