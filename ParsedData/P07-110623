rove accuracy.
    Therefore, given the flexibility of the feature-based perceptron model, an obvious next step is the study of open features in the segmentor.
    Also, we wish to explore the possibility of incorporating POS tagging and parsing features into the discriminative model, leading to joint decoding.
    The advantage is two-fold: higher level syntactic information can be used in word segmentation, while joint decoding helps to prevent bottomup error propagation among the different processing steps.
