 (2002), Barzilay and Elhadad, (2003), Munteanu et al., (2004) for extracting parallel or paraphrasing sentences from comparable documents, are based on the &#8220;find-topic-extract-sentence&#8221; principle which looks for document pairs with high similarities, and then look for parallel sentences only from these documents.
    Based on our proposed &#8220;find-one-get-more&#8221; principle, we suggest that there are other, dissimilar documents that might contain more parallel sentences.
    We can iterate this whole process for improved results using a Bootstrapping method.
    Figure 2 outlines the algorithm in more detail.
    In the following sections 5.1-5.5, we describe the document pre-processing step followed by the four subsequent iterative steps of our algorithm.
    The documents are word segmented with the Language Data Consortium (LDC) Chinese-English dictionary 2.0.Then the Chinese document is glossed using all the dictionary entries.
    When a Chinese word has multiple possible translations
