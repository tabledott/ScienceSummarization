 a: ~ We similarly define fS(A) on dk in S. Note that we count topics (version sequences), not individual versions: if A appears at some point and is not edited until 50 revisions later, we should not conclude that A is unlikely to be rewritten; for example, the intervening revisions could all be minor additions, or part of an edit war.
    If we assume that the probability of any particular fix operation being applied in SimpleEW is proportional to that in ComplexEW&#8212; e.g., the SimpleEW fix rate might be dampened because already-edited ComplexEW articles are copied over &#8212; we have6 Pb(o1  |A) = &#945;fC(A) where 0 &lt; &#945; &lt; 1.
    Note that in SimpleEW, where P(o1 V o2  |A) is the probability that A is changed to abdifferent word in SimpleEW, which we estimate as P(o1 V o2  |A) = fS(A).
    We then set Next, under our working assumption, we estimate the probability of A being changed to a as a fix by the proportion of ComplexEW edit instances that rewrite A to a: where Q is the set of edit o
