 comparable to log-likelihood.
    These pairings &#8211; log-likelihood and t-test for AdjN, and t-test and frequency for PNV &#8211; are also visible in the recall curves (Figures 3 and 4).
    Moreover, for the PNV data the part of significance list frequency test log-likelihood MI t-test leads to a recall of over 60% when approx.
    20% of the SL has been considered.
    In the Figures above, there are a number of positions on the -axis where the precision and recall values of different measures are almost identical.
    This shows that a simple -best approach will often produce misleading results.
    For instance, if we just look at the first of the SLs for the PNV data, we might conclude that the t-test and frequency measures are equally well suited for the extraction of PNV collocations.
    However, the full curves in Figures 2 and 4 show that t-test is consistently better than frequency.
    While we have previously considered data from a broad frequency range (i.e., frequencies for AdjN and for PN
