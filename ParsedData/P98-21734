ecomes a task akin to building an expert system, requiring collaboration between a domain expert (who understands the subjectmatter of the document) and a knowledge engineer (who understands the knowledge representation formalism).
    Owing to this cost, M-NLG has been applied mainly in contexts where the knowledge base is already available, having been created for another purpose (Iordanskaja et al., 1992; Goldberg et al., 1994); for discussion see Reiter and Mellish (1993).
    Is there any way in which a domain expert might author a knowledge base without going through this time-consuming and costly collaboration with a knowledge engineer?
    Assuming that some kind of mediation is needed between domain expert and knowledge formalism, the only alternative is to provide easier tools for editing knowledge bases.
    Some knowledge management projects have experimented with graphical presentations which allow editing by direct manipulation, so that there is no need to learn the syntax of a programming langu
