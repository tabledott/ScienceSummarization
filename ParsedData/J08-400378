rved quite strong language-specific effects for the difference between arc-standard and arc-eager parsing for the stack-based algorithms, effects that can be tied to differences in linguistic structure and annotation style between different data sets, although a much more detailed error analysis is needed before we can draw precise conclusions about the relative merits of different parsing algorithms for different languages and syntactic representations.
    Before we consider the evaluation of efficiency in both learning and parsing, it is worth pointing out that the results will be heavily dependent on the choice of support vector machines for classification, and cannot be directly generalized to the use of deterministic incremental parsing algorithms together with other kinds of classifiers.
    However, because support vector machines constitute the state of the art in classifierbased parsing, it is still worth examining how learning and parsing times vary with the parsing algorithm while parameters of le
