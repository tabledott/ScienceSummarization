rrent state of the art.
    The computational learning community, in general, is also witnessing a move towards evaluations based on joint inference, with the two previous CoNLL tasks (Surdeanu et al., 2008; Haji&#711;c et al., 2009) devoted to joint learning of syntactic and semantic dependencies.
    A principle ingredient for joint learning is the presence of multiple layers of semantic information.
    One fundamental question still remains, and that is &#8211; what would it take to improve the state of the art in coreference resolution that has not been attempted so far?
    Many different algorithms have been tried in the past 15 years, but one thing that is still lacking is a corpus comprehensively tagged on a large scale with consistent, multiple layers of semantic information.
    One of the many goals of the OntoNotes project2 (Hovy et al., 2006; Weischedel et al., 2011) is to explore whether it can fill this void and help push the progress further &#8211; not only in coreference, but with the vario
