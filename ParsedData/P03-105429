 features, and &amp;quot;X to mark external features.
    To illustrate the difference, consider unary productions.
    In the raw grammar, there are many unaries, and once any major category is constructed over a span, most others become constructible as well using unary chains (see Klein and Manning (2001) for discussion).
    Such chains are rare in real treebank trees: unary rewrites only appear in very specific contexts, for example S complements of verbs where the S has an empty, controlled subject.
    Figure 4 shows an erroneous output of the parser, using the baseline markovized grammar.
    Intuitively, there are several reasons this parse should be ruled out, but one is that the lower S slot, which is intended primarily for S complements of communication verbs, is not a unary rewrite position (such complements usually have subjects).
    It would therefore be natural to annotate the trees so as to confine unary productions to the contexts in which they are actually appropriate.
    We tried two ann
