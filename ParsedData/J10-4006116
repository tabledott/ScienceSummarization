d).
    The C/I data set was introduced by Baroni and Lenci (2009), but not tested in a classification task there.
    It consists of 232 causative/inchoative verbs and 170 non-alternating transitive verbs from Levin (1993).
    In a second experiment, we apply the W1LxW2 space to discriminate verbs that belong to three different classes, each corresponding to a different type of transitive alternation.
    We use the MS data set (Merlo and Stevenson 2001), which includes 19 unergative verbs undergoing the induced action alternation (e.g., race), 19 unaccusative verbs that undergo the causative/inchoative alternation (e.g., break), and 20 object-drop verbs participating in the unexpressed object alternation (e.g., play).
    See Levin (1993) for details about each of these transitive alternations.
    The complexity of this task is due to the fact that the verbs in the three classes have both transitive and intransitive variants, but with very different semantic roles.
    For instance, the transitive subject
