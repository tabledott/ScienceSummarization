e to analyze Alexeyeva despite the presence of Alex and Alexei does not seem to me to be an error, while the analysis Anab-el has been scored as an error, but John-son (and a bit less obviously Wat-son) have not been treated as errors.'
    Difficult to classify, too, is the treatment of words such as abet/abetted/abetting.
    The present algorithm selects the uniform stem abet in that case, assigning the signature NULL.ted.ting.
    Ultimately what we would like to have is a means of indicating that the doubled t is predictable, and that the correct signature is NULL.ed.ing.
    At present this is not implemented, and I have chosen to mark this as correct, on the grounds that it is more important to identify words with the same stem than to identify the (in some sense) correct signature.
    Still, unclear cases remain: for example, consider the words accompani-ed/accompani-ment/accompani-st.
    The word accompany does not appear as such, but the stem accompany is identified in the word accompany-ing.
