lness of executing the semantic routine so that we don't spend the time if it is not likely to pay off.
    The analysis above provides a very simple way to estimate the benefit of disambiguating &amp;quot;total.&amp;quot; If it turns out to be a verb, then (16a) trees have been ruled out, and if it turns out to be a noun, then (16b) trees have been ruled out.
    We prefer our declarative algebraic approach over procedural heuristic search strategies (e.g., Kaplan 1972) because we do not have to specify the order of evaluation.
    We can delay the binding of decisions until the most opportune moment.
  
  
    Suppose we have a non-terminal S that is a series combination of two other non-terminals, NP and VP.
    By inspection, the power series of S is: This result is easily verified when there is an unmistakable dividing point between the subject and the predicate.
    For example, the verb &amp;quot;is&amp;quot; separates the PPs in the subject from those in the predicate in (19a), but not in (19b).
