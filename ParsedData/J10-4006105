ning a total of 1,487 word&#8211; quale pairs, instantiating the four roles postulated by Pustejovsky: Formal (the category of the object: door&#8211;barrier), Constitutive (constitutive parts, materials the object is made of: food&#8211;fat), Agentive (what brings the object about: letter&#8211;write), and Telic (the function of the object: novel&#8211;entertain).

    For LexDM, we pick all links that begin with one of the strings in Table 10.
    For the DepDM model, the only attested links are n with q (Constitutive), n sbj intr q, n sbj tr q (Tel
