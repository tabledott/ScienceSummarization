c processing techniques for determining the markers and the textual units and use sentences as minimal units in the discourse structures that they build.
    A detailed comparison of our work with Sumita et al. 's and others' work is given in (Marcu, 1997).
  
  
    We introduced the notion of rhetorical parsing, i.e., the process through which natural language texts are automatically mapped into discourse trees.
    In order to make rhetorical parsing work, we improved previous algorithms for cue phrase disambiguation, and proposed new algorithms for determining the elementary textual units and for computing the valid discourse trees of a text.
    The solution that we described is both general and robust.
