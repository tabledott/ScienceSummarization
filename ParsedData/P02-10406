   Similarly, the modified unigram precision in Example 2 is 2/7, even though its standard unigram precision is 7/7.
    Modified n-gram precision is computed similarly for any n: all candidate n-gram counts and their corresponding maximum reference counts are collected.
    The candidate counts are clipped by their corresponding reference maximum value, summed, and divided by the total number of candidate ngrams.
    In Example 1, Candidate 1 achieves a modified bigram precision of 10/17, whereas the lower quality Candidate 2 achieves a modified bigram precision of 1/13.
    In Example 2, the (implausible) candidate achieves a modified bigram precision of 0.
    This sort of modified n-gram precision scoring captures two aspects of translation: adequacy and fluency.
    A translation using the same words (1-grams) as in the references tends to satisfy adequacy.
    The longer n-gram matches account for fluency.
