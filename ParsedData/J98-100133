    Bryan's earlier work had already demonstrated that homographs can be distinguished by applying a metric based on relationships defined by his chains (Bryan 1973, 1974).
    Similar work is described in Sedelow and Mooney (1988).
    Yarowsky (1992) derives classes of words by starting with words in common categories in Roget's (4th edition).
    A 100-word context of each word in the category is extracted from a corpus (the 1991 electronic text of Grolier's Encyclopedia), and a mutualinformation-like statistic is used to identify words most likely to co-occur with the category members.
    The resulting classes are used to disambiguate new occurrences of a polysemous word: the 100-word context of the polysemous occurrence is examined for words in various classes, and Bayes' Rule is applied to determine the class most likely to be that of the polysemous word.
    Since class is assumed by Yarowsky to represent a p
