 the numerator, however, the counts of rqs are quite irregular, including several zeros (e.g., RAT, none of whose members were seen).
    However, there is a strong relationship between nclis and the number of hanzi in the class.
    For E(n), then, we substitute a smooth S against the number of class elements.
    This smooth guarantees that there are no zeroes estimated.
    The final estimating equation is then: Since the total of all these class estimates was about 10% off from the Turing estimate ni/N for the probability of all unseen hanzi, we renormalized the estimates so that they would sum to in/N.
    This class-based model gives reasonable results: for six radical classes, Table 1 gives the estimated cost for an unseen hanzi in the class occurring as the second hanzi in a double GIVEN name.
    Note that the good classes JADE, GOLD and GRASS have lower costs than the bad classes SICKNESS, DEATH and RAT, as desired, so the trend observed for the results of this method is in the right direction.
