right-context matches against the output.
    Right-to-left optional application can therefore be modeled simply by interchanging the context-checking relations in the cascade above, to yield The transducer corresponding to this regular relation, somewhat paradoxically, models a right-to-left rule application while moving from left to right across its tapes.
    Simultaneous optional rule application, in which the sites of all potential string modifications are located before any rewriting takes place, is modeled by a cascade that identifies both left and right contexts on the input side of the replacement: These compositions model the optional application of a rule.
    Although all potential application sites are located and marked by the context checkers, these compositions do not force a cb-0 replacement to take place for every instance of cb appearing in the proper contexts.
    To model obligatory rules, we require an additional constraint that rejects string pairs containing sites where the conditions
