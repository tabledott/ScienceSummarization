he Charniak (2000) model; future work may consider extending our approach to include non-local features.
    Finally, other recent work (Petrov et al., 2007; Finkel et al., 2008) has had a similar goal of scaling GLMs to full syntactic parsing.
    These models make use of PCFG representations, but do not explicitly model bigram or trigram dependencies.
    The results in this work (88.3%/88.0% F1) are lower than our F1 score of 91.1%; this is evidence of the benefits of the richer representations enabled by our approach.
    Table 2 shows the accuracy of the model in recovering unlabeled dependencies.
    The method shows improvements over the method described in (Koo et al., 2008), which is a state-of-the-art second-order dependency parser similar to that of (McDonald and Pereira, 2006), suggesting that the incorporation of constituent structure can improve dependency accuracy.
    Table 3 shows the effect of the beam-size on the accuracy and speed of the parser on the development set.
