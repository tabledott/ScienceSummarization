 either.
    It would be very interesting to investigate ways to have efficient procedure for training EM models and getting word alignments using word lattices on the source side of the parallel data.
    Along this line of research, we think some kind of tree-to-string model (Liu et.al., 2006) could be interesting directions to pursue.
