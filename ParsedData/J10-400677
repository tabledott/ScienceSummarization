-based semantics has always been interested in investigating whether distributional (attributional) similarity could be used to group words into semantically coherent categories.
    From the computational point of view, this is a particularly crucial issue because it concerns the possibility of using distributional information to assign a semantic class or type to words.
    Categorization requires (at least in current settings) a discrete decision, as in the TOEFL task, but it is based on detecting not only synonyms but also less strictly related words that stand in a coordinate/cohyponym relation.
    We focus here on noun categorization, which we operationalize as a clustering task.
    Distributional categorization has been investigated for other POS as well, most notably verbs (Merlo and Stevenson 2001; Schulte im Walde 2006).
    However, verb classifications are notoriously more controversial than nominal ones, and deeply interact with argument structure properties.
    Some experiments on verb classi
