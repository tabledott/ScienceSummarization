    The table yields some interesting results, showing quite significant variations in class distribution when it is conditioned on various types of contextual information.
    We can see for example, that the proportion of agreements and disagreements (respectively 18.8% and 10.6%) changes to 13.9% and 20.9% respectively when we restrict the counts to spurts that are preceded by a DISAGREE.

    Durational features: duration of the spurt seconds of overlap with any other speaker seconds of silence during the spurt speech rate in the spurt Lexical features: number of words in the spurt number of content words in the spurt perplexity of the spurt with respect to four language models, one for each class first and last word of t
