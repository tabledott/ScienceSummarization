s preferentially performed within the same utterance.
    My algorithm starts with an empty S-list at the beginning of a segment.
    The basic unit for which the centering data structures are generated is the utterance U.
    For the BFPalgorithm, I define U as a simple sentence, a complex sentence, or each full clause of a compound sentence.
    Kameyama's (1998) intra-sentential centering operates at the clause level.
    While tensed clauses are defined as utterances on their own, untensed clauses are processed with the main clause, so that the Cf-list of the main clause contains the elements of the untensed embedded clause.
    Kameyama distinguishes for tensed clauses further between sequential and hierarchical centering.
    Except for reported speech (embedded and inaccessible to the superordinate level), non-report complements, and relative clauses (both embedded but accessible to the superordinate level; less salient than the higher levels), all other types of tensed clauses build a chain of utteran
