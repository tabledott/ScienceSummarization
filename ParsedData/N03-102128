k of one more nonterminal label per dimension than hedges.
    The size of an RTV is bounded by the cardinality of the grammar.
    Thus, the space complexity of Parser B is in 0 (C (G)12D np-F2C(G)N ) On the other hand, The B.ID rules involve only one d-span instead of two, reducing the number of free variables by 0 (C (G)) .
    The B.LP rules again involve only one lexical head instead of two, reducing the number of free variables by a factor of D. Since D &lt; C(G), it turns out that the worst-case running time of Parser B is less than that of Parser A by a factor of nD under L2MTGs of any rank and dimensionality.
  
  
    We have proposed Multitext Grammars (MTGs) as a convenient and relatively expressive foundation for building practical models of translational equivalence.
    To encourage their use for this purpose, we have explored algorithms for parsing bilexical MTGs of arbitrary rank and dimensionality.
    Our exploration highlighted some little-known properties of synchronous parsing: (1) some
