moving such published features as the verb-intervening component of the distance metric, which results in an F-measure error increase of 9.86%, or the subcat feature, which results in a 7.62% increase in F-measure error.33 Therefore, while the collection of unpublished details presented in Sections 4&#8211;7 is disparate, in toto those details are every bit as important to overall parsing performance as certain of the published features.
    This does not mean that all the details are equally important.
    Table 5 shows the effect on overall parsing performance of independently removing or changing certain of the more than 30 unpublished details.34 Often, the detrimental effect of a particular change is quite insignificant, even by the standards of the performance-obsessed world of statistical parsing, and occasionally, the effect of a change is not even detrimental at all.
    That is why we do not claim the importance of any single unpublished detail, but rather that of their totality, given that several o
