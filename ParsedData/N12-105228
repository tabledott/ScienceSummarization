word cluster features yield improvements across the board, with the more complex method providing a significantly larger improvement for NER.
    Although the performance of transfer systems is still substantially below that of supervised systems, this research provides one step towards bridging this gap.
    Further, we believe that it opens up an avenue for future work on multilingual clustering methods, cross-lingual feature projection and domain adaptation for direct transfer of linguistic structure.
  
  
    We thank John DeNero for help with creating the word alignments; Reut Tsarfaty and Joakim Nivre for rewarding discussions on evaluation; Slav Petrov and Kuzman Ganchev for discussions on cross-lingual clustering; and the anonymous reviewers, along with Joakim Nivre, for valuable comments that helped improve the paper.
    The first author is grateful for the financial support of the Swedish National Graduate School of Language Technology (GSLT).
