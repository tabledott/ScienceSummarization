lone, may give high performance but leave much of the text unassigned.
    We address the problem of assigning a time-point to every clause in the text.
    Our approach is to break the news stories into their constituent events and to assign timestamps&#8212;either time-points or time-intervals&#8212;to these events.
    When assigning time-stamps we analyze both implicit time references (mainly through the tense system) and explicit ones (temporal adverbials) such as &#8216;on Monday&#8217;, &#8216;in 1998&#8217;, etc.
    The result of the work is a prototype program which takes as input set of news stories broken into separate sentences and produces as output a text that combines all the events from all the articles, organized in chronological order.
