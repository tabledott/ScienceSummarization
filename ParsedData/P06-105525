superlative adjectives (JJS) are split into three categories, corresponding principally to most, least, and largest, with most frequent parents NP, QP, and ADVP, respectively.
    The relative adjectives (JJR) are split in the same way.
    Relative adverbs (RBR) are split into a different three categories, corresponding to (usually metaphorical) distance (further), degree (more), and time (earlier).
    Personal pronouns (PRP) are well-divided into three categories, roughly: nominative case, accusative case, and sentence-initial nominative case, which each correlate very strongly with syntactic position.
    As another example of a specific trend which was mentioned by Klein and Manning (2003), adverbs (RB) do contain splits for adverbs under ADVPs (also), NPs (only), and VPs (not).
    Functional categories generally show fewer splits, but those splits that they do exhibit are known to be strongly correlated with syntactic behavior.
    For example, determiners (DT) divide along several axes: definite (the)
