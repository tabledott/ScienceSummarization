opriate size and their current part-of-speech tag assignments.
    In the text chunking application, the tags being assigned are chunk structure tags, while the part-of-speech tags are a fixed part of the environment, like the lexical identities of the words themselves.
    This additional class of available information causes a significant increase in the number of reasonable templates if templates for a wide range of the possible combinations of evidence are desired.
    The distributed version of Brill's tagger (Brill, 1993c) makes use of 26 templates, involving various mixes of word and part-of-speech tests on neighboring words.
    Our tests were performed using 100 templates; these included almost all of Brill's combinations, and extended them to include references to chunk tags as well as to words and part-of-speech tags.
    The set of 100 rule templates used here was built from repetitions of 10 basic patterns, shown on the left side of Table 2 as they apply to words.
    The same 10 patterns can als
