    Experimental results indicate that the proposed method improves upon or is at least comparable with existing methods.
  
  
    A new method for automatically acquiring case frame patterns from large corpora is proposed.
    In particular, the problem of generalizing values of a case frame slot for a verb is viewed as that of estimating a conditional probability distribution over a partition of words, and a new generalization method based on the Minimum Description Length (MDL) principle is proposed.
    In order to assist with efficiency, the proposed method makes use of an existing thesaurus and restricts its attention to those partitions that are present as &amp;quot;cuts&amp;quot; in the thesaurus tree, thus reducing the generalization problem to that of estimating a &amp;quot;tree cut model&amp;quot; of the thesaurus tree.
    An efficient algorithm is given, which provably obtains the optimal tree cut model for the given frequency data of a case slot, in the sense of MDL.
