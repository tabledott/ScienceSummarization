  Finally, the template generation module forms the final TE and S T output by a roughly one-to-one mapping from facts in the inferential database to templates .
  THE PREPROCESSORS As noted above, the UNIX-based portion of the system is primarily responsible for part-of-speech tagging .
  Prior to the part-of-speech tagger, however, a text to be processed by Alembic passes through severa l preprocess stages ; each preprocessor "enriches" the text by means of SGML tags .
  All of these preprocess components are implemented with LEX (the lexical analyzer generator) and are very fast .
  An initial preprocessor, the punctoker, makes decisions about word boundaries that are not coincident with whitespace.
  It tokenizes abbreviations (e.g., "Dr .
