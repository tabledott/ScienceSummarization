h research used purely knowledge-based approaches, analogous to knowledge-based approaches in NLP systems today.
    These required much detailed, handcrafted knowledge from several sources (e.g., acoustic and phonetic).
    However, when it became clear that these techniques were too brittle and not scalable, speech researchers turned to probabilistic models.
    These provided a flexible control structure for combining multiple sources of knowledge (providing improved accuracy and ability to deal with more complex domains) and algorithms for training the system on large bodies of data (providing reduced cost in moving the technology to a new application domain).
    Since probability theory offers a general mathematical modeling tool for estimating how likely an event is, probability theory may be applied at all levels in natural language processing, because some set of events can be associated with each algorithm.
    For example, in morphological processing in English (Section 2), the events are the use o
