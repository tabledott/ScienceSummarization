s, the early Raleigh system lacked a complete and unified probabilistic framework.
    In a radical departure from the prevailing attitudes of the time, the Yorktown group turned to Shannon's theory of communication in the presence of noise and recast the speech recognition problem in terms of transmission through a noisy channel.
    Shannon's theory of communication (Shannon 1948), also known as Information Theory, was originally developed at AT&amp;T Bell Laboratories to model communication along a noisy channel such as a telephone line.
    See Fano (1961) for a well-known secondary source on the subject, or Cover and Thomas (1991) or Bell, Cleary, and Witten (1990) for more recent treatments.
    The noisy channel paradigm can be applied to other recognition applications such as optical character recognition (OCR) and spelling correction.
    Imagine a noisy channel, such as a speech recognition machine that almost hears, an optical character recognition (OCR) machine that almost reads, or a typist who a
