eriments, we use a version of the PropBank where the most commonly appearing predicates have been annotated, not all.
    Our extracted TAGs are derived from Sections 02-21 of the PTB.
    Furthermore, training data for our experiments are always derived from these sections.
    Section 23 is used for test data.
    The entire set of semantic roles that are found in the PropBank are not used in our experiments.
    In particular, we only include as semantic roles those instances in the propbank such that in the extracted TAG they are localized in the same elementary tree.
    As a consequence, adjunct semantic roles (ARGM&#8217;s) are basically absent from our test corpus.
    Furthermore, not all of the complement semantic roles are found in our test corpus.
    For example, cases of subject-control PRO are ignored because the surface subject is found in a different tree frame than the predicate.
    Still, a large majority of complement semantic roles are found in our test corpus (more than 87%).
