its scalability to unknown predicates is limited.
    In contrast, the decision tree approach uses predicate lexical information only for 5% of the branching decisions recorded when testing the role assignment task, and only for 0.01% of the branching decisions seen during the argument constituent identification evaluation.
  
  
    Figure 7(a) illustrates an IE architecture that employs predicate argument structures.
    Documents are processed in parallel to: (1) parse them syntactically, and (2) recognize the NEs.
    The full parser first performs part-of-speech (POS) tagging using transformation based learning (TBL) (Brill, 1995).
    Then non-recursive, or basic, noun phrases (NPB) are identified using the TBL method reported in (Ngai and Florian, 2001).
    At last, the dependency parser presented in (Collins, 1997) is used to generate the full parse.
    This approach allows us to parse the sentences with less than 40 words from TreeBank section 23 with an F-measure slightly over 85% at an average of
