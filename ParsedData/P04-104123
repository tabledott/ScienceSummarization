			It seems that the f-structure-based approach is more abstract (99 LDD path types against approximately 9,000 tree-fragment types in (Johnson, 2002)) andfine-grained in its use of lexical information (sub cat frames).
			In contrast to Johnson?s approach, ourLDD resolution algorithm is not biased.
			It computes all possible complete resolutions and orderranks them using LDD path and subcat frame probabilities.
			It is difficult to provide a satisfactory comparison between the two methods,
