location of the topic boundaries.
    The method is based on Reynar's maximisation algorithm (Reynar, 1998; Helfman, 1996; Church, 1993; Church and Helfman, 1993).
    A text segment is defined by two sentences i, j (inclusive).
    This is represented as a square region along the diagonal of the rank matrix.
    Let si,j denote the sum of the rank values in a segment and ai,j = (j &#8212;i +1)2 be the inside area.
    B = {b1, ...,197-4 is a list of in coherent text segments. sk and ak refers to the sum of rank and area of segment k in B.
    D is the inside density of B (see equation 4). ak To initialise the process, the entire document is placed in B as one coherent text segment.
    Each step of the process splits one of the segments in B.
    The split point is a potential boundary which maximises D. Figure 5 shows a working example.
    The number of segments to generate, in, is determined automatically.
    Den) is the inside density of n segments and SD(n) , Den) Den-1) is the gradient.
