 IE and Machine Translation (Moldovan and Rus, 2001; Hermjakob et al., 2003; Jacquemin, 1999) have to recognize that the same meaning can be expressed in the text in a huge variety of surface forms.
    Substantial research has been dedicated to acquiring paraphrase patterns, which represent various forms in which a certain meaning can be expressed.
    Following (Dagan and Glickman, 2004) we observe that a somewhat more general notion needed for applications is that of entailment relations (e.g.
    (Moldovan and Rus, 2001)).
    These are directional relations between two expressions, where the meaning of one can be entailed from the meaning of the other.
    For example &#8220;X acquired Y&#8221; entails &#8220;X owns Y&#8221;.
    These relations provide a broad framework for representing and recognizing semantic variability, as proposed in (Dagan and Glickman, 2004).
    For example, if a QA system has to answer the question &#8220;Who owns Overture?&#8221; and the corpus includes the phrase &#8220;Yahoo
