    Thus, if r = log(tf /te), we assume that with a chosen so that the sum of Pr (If lie) over positive values of tf is equal to unity.
    For an eef-bead, we assume that each of the English sentences is drawn independently from the distribution Pr (4) and that the log of the ratio of the length of the French sentence to the sum of the lengths of the English sentences is normally distributed with the same mean and variance as for an el-bead.
    Finally, for an elf-bead, we assume that the length of the English sentence is drawn from the distribution Pr (is) and that the log of the ratio of the sum of the lengths of the French sentences to the length of the English sentence is normally distributed as 'before.
    Then, given the sum of the lengths of the French sentences, we assume that the probability of a particular pair of lengths, if1 and ef2, is proportional to Pr (ef,) Pr (e12).
    Together, these two random processes form a hidden Markov model [Baum, 1972] for the generation of aligned pairs of cor
