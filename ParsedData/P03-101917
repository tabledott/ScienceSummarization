ng corpus alignment.
    For this purpose, we compute the Viterbi alignment of IBM Model 5 with GIZA++ (Och and Ney, 2000).
    This alignment is produced without any restrictions on word-reorderings.
    Then, we check for every sentence if the alignment satisfies each of the constraints.
    The ratio of the number of satisfied alignments and the total number of sentences is referred to as coverage.
    Tab.
    4 shows the results for the Verbmobil task and for the Canadian Hansards task.
    It contains the results for both translation directions German-English (S&#8212;*T) and English-German (T&#8212;*S) for the Verbmobil task and French-English (S&#8212;*T) and English-French (T&#8212;*S) for the Canadian Hansards task, respectively.
    For the Verbmobil task, the baseline ITG constraints and the IBM constraints result in a similar coverage.
    It is about 91% for the German-English translation direction and about 88% for the EnglishGerman translation direction.
    A significantly higher coverage of
