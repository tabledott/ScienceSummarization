  16 Budanitsky and Hirst Lexical Semantic Relatedness and its inverse, hypernymy; six meronymic (PART-OF) relations ?
  COMPONENT-OF, MEMBER-OF and SUBSTANCE-OF and their inverses; and antonymy, the COMPLEMENT- OF relation.
  
  We stipulate a global root root above the 11 unique beginners to ensure the existence of a path between any two nodes.
  
  
  
  That is, the relatedness of two words is equal to that of the most-related pair of concepts that they denote.
  2.4 Computing Taxonomic Path Length A simple way to compute semantic relatedness in a taxonomy such as WordNet is to view it as a graph and identify relatedness with path length between the concepts: ?The shorter the path from one node to another, the more similar they are?
  This approach was taken, for example, by Rada and colleagues (Rada et al.
  1989; Rada and Bicknell 1989), not on WordNet but on MeSH (Medical Subject Headings), a semantic hierarchy of terms used for indexing articles in the bibliographic retrieval system Medline.
