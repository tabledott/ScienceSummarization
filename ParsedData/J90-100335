    The proposed association ratio score provides a practical and objective measure that is often a fairly good approximation to the &amp;quot;art.&amp;quot; Since the proposed measure is objective, it can be applied in a systematic way over a large body of material, steadily improving consistency and productivity.
    But on the other hand, the objective score can be misleading.
    The score takes only distributional evidence into account.
    For example, the measure favors set .

    In addition, the measure is extremely superficial; it cannot cluster words into appropriate syntactic classes without an explicit preprocess such as Church's parts program or Hindle's parser.
    Neither of these preprocesses, though, can help highlight the &amp;quot;natural&amp;quot; similarity between nouns such as picture and photograph.
