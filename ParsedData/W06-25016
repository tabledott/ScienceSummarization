he paintings were displayed in the art gallery.
    The second order context vector would be the resultant of the first order context vectors for painting, display, art, and gallery.
    The words were, in, and the are excluded from the resultant since we consider them as stop words in this example.
    Figure 1 shows how the second order context vector might be visualized in a 2-dimensional space.
    Intuitively, the orientation of each second order context vector is an indicator of the domains or topics (such as biology or baseball) that the context is associated with.
    Two context vectors that lie close together indicate a considerable contextual overlap, which suggests that they are pertaining to the same meaning of the target word.
  
  
    In this research, we create a Gloss Vector for each concept (or word sense) represented in a dictionary.
    While we use WordNet as our dictionary, the method can apply to other lexical resources.
    A Gloss Vector is a second order context vector formed by tre
