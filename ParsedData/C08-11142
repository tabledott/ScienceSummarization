ed:imposed, and X and Y are associated when they are analogous to the pair doctor:hospital.
			There is past work on recognizing analogies(Reitman, 1965), synonyms (Landauer and Dumais, 1997), antonyms (Lin et al, 2003), and asso ciations (Lesk, 1969), but each of these four tasks has been examined separately, in isolation from the others.
			As far as we know, the algorithm proposed here is the first attempt to deal with all four tasks using a uniform approach.
			We believe that it isimportant to seek NLP algorithms that can han dle a broad range of semantic phenomena, becausedeveloping a specialized algorithm for each phe nomenon is a very inefficient research strategy.It might seem that a lexicon, such as Word Net (Fellbaum, 1998), contains all the information we need to handle these four tasks.
			However, weprefer to take a corpus-based approach to seman tics.
			Veale (2004) used WordNet to answer 374 multiple-choice SAT analogy questions, achievingan accuracy of 43%, but the best corpus-based ap proac
