 although it was certainly adequate for the investigation in [Jmhi ,1983J.
  A precise characterization f  that approach still remains an open problem.
  G - -  (I,A) be a TAG with local constraints if for each elementary tree t E l t.J A, and for each node, n, in t, we specify the set ~ of auxiliary trees that nan be adjoined at the node n. Note that if there is no constraint then all auxiliary trees are adjoinable at n (of course, only those whose root has the same label as the label of th* node s).
  Thus, in general, ~ is a subset o( the set of all the auxiliary trees adjoiuable at n. We will adopt the following conventions.
  by definition, no auxiliary trees are adjoinable to a node labelled by a terminal symbol, no constraint has to be stated for node labelled by a terminal.
  If there is no constraint, i.e., all auxiliary trees (with the appropriate root label} are adioinable at a node, say, u, then we will not state this explicitly.
  3. if no auxiliary trees are adjoinable at a node n, then we will
