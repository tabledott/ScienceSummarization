t; grammar that contains purely syntactic rules only.
    We define a CDG G2a =&lt; E2, R2, L2, C2&gt; as follows: where the formula P2 is the conjunction of the following unary and binary constraints : &amp;quot;If a PP modifies a PP or an NP, its label should be POSTNOD.&amp;quot; (G2a-3) word(pos(x))=PP, word(ntod(x))=V iab(x)=LOC &amp;quot;If a PP modifies a V, its label should be LOC.&amp;quot; 2In linguistics, arrows are usually drawn in the opposite direction in a dependency diagram: from a governor (modifiee) to its dependent (modifier).
    In this paper, however, we draw an arrow from a modifier to its modifiee in order to emphasize that this information is contained in a modifier's role.
    &amp;quot;Modification links do not cross each other.&amp;quot; According to the grammar G2a, sentence (5) has 14 (= Catalan(4)) different syntactic structures.
    We do not generate these syntactic structures one by one, since the number of the structures may grow more rapidly than exponentially when the sent
