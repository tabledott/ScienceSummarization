    We first evaluate the model by attempting to reproduce the structure of unseen texts from the BLLIP corpus, i.e., the corpus on which the model is trained on.
    We next obtain an upper bound for the task by conducting a sentence ordering experiment with humans and comparing the model against the human data.
    Finally, we assess whether this model can be used for multi-document summarization using data from Barzilay et al. (2002).
    But before we outline the details of our experiments we discuss our choice of metric for comparing different orders.
    Our task is to produce an ordering for the sentences of a given text.
    We can think of the sentences as objects for which a ranking must be produced.
    Table 2 gives an example of a text containing 10 sentences (A&#8211;J) and the orders (i.e., rankings) produced by three hypothetical models.
    A number of metrics can be used to measure the distance between two rankings such as Spearman&#8217;s correlation coefficient for ranked data, Cayley d
