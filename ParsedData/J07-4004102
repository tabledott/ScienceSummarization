    Table 8 gives the results for the hybrid dependency model, broken down by relation type, using the same relations given in Clark, Hockenmaier, and Steedman (2002).
    Automatically assigned POS tags were used.
    10.2.2 Final Test Results.
    Table 9 gives the final test results on Section 23 for the hybrid dependency model.
    The coverage for these results is 99.63% (for gold-standard POS tags), which corresponds to 2,398 of the 2,407 sentences in Section 23 receiving an analysis.
    When using automatically assigned POS tags, the coverage is slightly lower: 99.58%.
    We used version 1.2 of CCGbank to obtain these results.
    Results are also given for Hockenmaier&#8217;s parser (Hockenmaier 2003a) which used an earlier, slightly different version of the treebank.
    We wanted to use the latest version to enable other researchers to compare with our results.
    The results in this section were obtained using a 3.2 GHz Intel Xeon P4.
