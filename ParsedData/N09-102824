er reordering.
    Therefore, even monotone decoding should be able to produce better translations.
    To see this, we carried out a controlled experiment, using Korean as an example.
    Clearly, after applying the precedence reordering rules, our English to Korean system is not sensitive to the maximum allowed reordering distance anymore.
    As shown in Figure 5, without the rules, the blindtest BLEU scores improve monotonically as the allowed reordering distance increases.
    This indicates that the order difference between English and Korean is very significant.
    Since smaller allowed reordering distance directly corresponds to decoding time, we can see that with the same decoding speed, our proposed approach can achieve almost 5% BLEU score improvements on blindtest set.
    The hierarchical phrase-based approach has been successfully applied to several systems (Chiang, 2005; Zollmann et.al., 2008).
    Since hierarchical phrase-based systems can capture long distance reordering by using a PSCFG mo
