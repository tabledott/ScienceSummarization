data set, without loss of generality, it well applies to transliteration of other language pairs such as English/Korean and English/Japanese.
    It is noted that place and company names are sometimes translated in combination of transliteration and meanings, for example, /Victoria-Fall/ becomes ff &#65533; f1 R 4 &#65533;ti (Pinyin:Wei Duo Li Ya Pu Bu).
    As the proposed framework allows direct orthographical mapping, it can also be easily extended to handle such name translation.
    We expect to see the proposed model to be further explored in other related areas.
