e goals of this work.
  
  
    There has been other work to automatically discover NE with minimal supervision.
    Both (Cucerzan and Yarowsky, 1999) and (Collins and Singer, 1999) present algorithms to obtain NEs from untagged corpora.
    However, they focus on the classification stage of already segmented entities, and make use of contextual and morphological clues that require knowledge of the language beyond the level we want to assume with respect to the target language.
    The use of similarity of time distributions for information extraction, in general, and NE extraction, in particular, is not new.
    (Hetland, 2004) surveys recent methods for scoring time sequences for similarity.
    (Shinyama and Sekine, 2004) used the idea to discover NEs, but in a single language, English, across two news sources.
    A large amount of previous work exists on transliteration models.
    Most are generative and consider the task of producing an appropriate transliteration for a given word, and thus require co
