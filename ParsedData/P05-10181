ity text, almost indistinguishable from human writing, makes the incorporation of coherence theories in robust large-scale systems particularly appealing.
    The task is, however, challenging considering that most previous efforts have relied on handcrafted rules, valid only for limited domains, with no guarantee of scalability or portability (Reiter and Dale, 2000).
    Furthermore, coherence constraints are often embedded in complex representations (e.g., Asher and Lascarides, 2003) which are hard to implement in a robust application.
    This paper focuses on local coherence, which captures text relatedness at the level of sentence-tosentence transitions, and is essential for generating globally coherent text.
    The key premise of our work is that the distribution of entities in locally coherent texts exhibits certain regularities.
    This assumption is not arbitrary &#8212; some of these regularities have been recognized in Centering Theory (Grosz et al., 1995) and other entity-based theories of disco
