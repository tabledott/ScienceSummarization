 In order to see how much of the performance degradation is caused by the difficulty of finding exact argument boundaries in the chunked representation, we can relax the scoring criteria to count as correct all cases where the system correctly identifies the first chunk belonging to an argument.
    For example, if the system assigns the correct label to the preposition beginning a prepositional phrase, the argument will be counted as correct, even though the system does not find the argument's righthand boundary.
    With this scoring regime, the chunk-based system performs at 49.5% precision and 35.1% recall, still significantly lower than the 57.7% precision/50.0% recall for exact matches using automatically generated parses.
    Results for the unknown boundary condition are summarized in Table 5. gold parse auto parse chunk chunk, relaxed scoring Table 5: Summary of results for unknown boundary condition As an example for comparing the behavior of the tree-based and chunk-based systems, consider the foll
