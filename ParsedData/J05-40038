 we give a high-level overview of our parallel sentence extraction system.
    In Section 3, we describe in detail the core of the system, the parallel sentence classifier.
    In Section 4, we discuss several data extraction experiments.
    In Section 5, we evaluate the extracted data by showing that adding it to out-of-domain parallel data improves the in-domain performance of an out-of-domain MT system, and in Section 6, we show that in certain cases, even larger improvements can be obtained by using bootstrapping.
    In Section 7, we present examples of sentence pairs extracted by our method and discuss some of its weaknesses.
    Before concluding, we discuss related work.
  
  
    The general architecture of our extraction system is presented in Figure 2.
    Starting with two large monolingual corpora (a non-parallel corpus) divided into documents, we begin by selecting pairs of similar documents (Section 2.1).
    From each such pair, we generate all possible sentence pairs and pass them through a
