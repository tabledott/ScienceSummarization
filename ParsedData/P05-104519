 for comparison, and note that we are again achieving gains against a more competitive baseline system.
    For all experiments involving Gibbs sampling, we used a linear cooling schedule.
    For the CoNLL dataset we collected 200 samples per trial, and for the CMU Seminar Announcements we collected 100 samples.
    We report the average of all trials, and in all cases we outperform the baseline with greater than 95% confidence, using the standard t-test.
    The trials had low standard deviations - 0.083% and 0.007% and high minimun F-scores - 86.72%, and 92.28% - for the CoNLL and CMU Seminar Announcements respectively, demonstrating the stability of our method.
    The biggest drawback to our model is the computational cost.
    Taking 100 samples dramatically increases test time.
    Averaged over 3 runs on both Viterbi and Gibbs, CoNLL testing time increased from 55 to 1738 seconds, and CMU Seminar Announcements testing time increases from 189 to 6436 seconds.
