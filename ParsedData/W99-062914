ined importance, probably because more structure is available in the input to represent.
    In principle, we would have to construct one instance for each possible pair of a verb and a focus word in the sentence.
    However, we restrict instances to those where there is at most one other verb/VP chunk between the verb and the focus, in case the focus precedes the verb, and no other verb in case the verb precedes the focus.
    This restriction allows, for example, for a relative clause on the subject (as in our example sentence).
    In the training data, 97.9% of the related pairs fulfill this condition (when counting VP chunks).
    Experiments on the training data showed that increasing the admitted number of intervening VP chunks slightly increases recall, at the cost of precision.
    Having constructed all instances from the test data and from a training set with the same level of partial structure, we first train the IGTree algorithm, and then let it classify the test instances.
    Then, for each te
