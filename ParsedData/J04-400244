and Waibel (1997) have described a simple heuristic function for Model 2 of Brown et al. (1993) that was not admissible.
    Och, Ueffing, and Ney (2001) have described an admissible heuristic function for Model 4 of Brown et al. (1993) and an almost-admissible heuristic function that is empirically obtained.
    We have to keep in mind that a heuristic function is helpful only if the overhead introduced in computing the heuristic function is more than compensated for by the gain obtained through a better pruning of search hypotheses.
    The heuristic functions described in the following are designed such that their computation can be performed efficiently.
    The basic idea for developing a heuristic function for an alignment model is that all source sentence positions that have not been covered so far still have to be translated to complete the sentence.
    If we have an estimation rX(j) of the optimal score for translating position j, then the value of the heuristic function RX(n) for a node n can be in
