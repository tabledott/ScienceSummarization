 mi, we select either a single-best antecedent amongst the previous mentions m1, ... , mi&#8722;1, or the NULL mention to indicate the underlying entity has not yet been evoked.
    Mentions are linearly ordered according to the position of the mention head with ties being broken by the larger node coming first.
    While much research (Ng and Cardie, 2002; Culotta et al., 2007; Haghighi and Klein, 2007; Poon and Domingos, 2008; Finkel and Manning, 2008) has explored how to reconcile pairwise decisions to form coherent clusters, we simply take the transitive closure of our pairwise decision (as in Ng and Cardie (2002) and Bengston and Roth (2008)) which can and does cause system errors.
    In contrast to most recent research, our pairwise decisions are not made with a learned model which outputs a probability or confidence, but instead for each mention mi, we select an antecedent amongst m1, ... , mi_1 or the NULL mention as follows: Initially, there is no syntactic constraint (improved in Section 3.1.3), th
