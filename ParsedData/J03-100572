ber after S and M denotes the number of positions that may be skipped or moved, respectively (e.g., for the translation direction German to English [GE in the chart below], one position may be skipped and two positions may be moved).
    The second number after S and M restricts the distance a word may be skipped or moved, respectively.
    These &#8220;width&#8221; parameters restrict the word reordering to take place within a &#8220;window&#8221; of a certain size, established by the distance between the positions lmin(C) and rmax(C) as defined in Section 3.5.
    In the notation, either the substring headed by S or that headed by M (or both) may be omitted altogether to indicate that the corresponding reordering is not allowed.
    Any numerical value in the string may be set to INF, denoting that an arbitrary number of positions may be skipped/moved or that the moving or skipping distance may be arbitrarily large.
    The following reordering strings are used in this article: Word reordering Description s
