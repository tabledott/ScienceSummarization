    A general deficiency of the baseline alignment models is that they are only able to model correspondences between single words.
    A first countermeasure was the refined alignment model described in section 2.2.
    A more systematic approach is to consider whole phrases rather than single words as the basis for the alignment models.
    In other words, a whole group of adjacent words in the source sentence may be aligned with a whole group of adjacent words in the target language.
    As a result the context of words has a greater influence and the changes in word order from source to target language can be learned explicitly.
    3.1 The word level alignment: alignment templates In this section we will describe how we model the translation of shallow phrases.
    The key element of our translation model are the alignment templates._ An alignment template z is a triple (F, E, A) which describes the alignment A between a source class sequence F and a target class seque
