s (Luo et al., 2004) or as probabilistic features indicating the probability that the two heads are coreferent according to the training data (Ng, 2007b).
    An anaphoricity feature indicates whether an NP to be resolved is anaphoric, and is typically computed using an anaphoricity classifier (Ng, 2004), hand-crafted patterns (Daum&#180;e III and Marcu, 2005), and automatically acquired patterns (Bean and Riloff, 1999).
    Finally, the outputs of rule-based pronoun and coreference resolvers have also been used as features for learning-based coreference resolution (Ng and Cardie, 2002c).
    For an empirical evaluation of the contribution of a subset of these features to the mention-pair model, see Bengtson and Roth (2008).
  
  
    Two important issues surround the evaluation of a coreference resolver.
    First, how do we obtain the set of NPs that a resolver will partition?
    Second, how do we score the partition it produces?
    To obtain the set of NPs to be partitioned by a resolver, three methods a
