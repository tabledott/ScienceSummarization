d patterns such as &amp;quot;have NP tenseless&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;have NP past-participle,&amp;quot; most of Fidditch's diagnostic rules are less ambitious and look only for the start of a noun phrase and do not attempt to look past an arbitrarily long noun phrase.
    For example, Fidditch has the following lexical disambiguation rule: which says that a preposition is more likely than a noun before a noun phrase.
    More precisely, the rule says that if a noun/preposition ambiguous word (e.g., &amp;quot;out&amp;quot;) is followed by something that starts a noun phrase (e.g., a determiner), then rule out the noun possibility.
    This type of lexical diagnostic rule can be captured with bigram and trigram statistics; it turns out that the sequence ...preposition determiner.., is much more common in the Brown Corpus (43924 observations) than the sequence ...noun determiner... (1135 observations).
    Most lexical disambiguation rules in Fidditch can be reformulated in terms of bigram and trigram statisti
