mely a set of strings of terminals and nonterminals with specified properties.
    D-theory Structures are expressed directly in terms of dominance relations; the linear order of constituents is only directly expressed for items in the lexical string.
    Despite appearances, D-theory and the Lasnik-Kupin formalization are not interdefinable.
    We discuss the properties of the Lasnik-Kupin formalization at length in a forthcoming paper.
  
  
    0-theory grows out of earlier work on deterministic parsing as deterministic tree building (as in e.g.
    (Marcus 19801, (Church 801 and (Berwick 821).
    The essence of that work is the hypothesis that natural language can be analyzed by some process which builds a syntactic analysis indelibly (borrowing a term from (McDonald 831); i.e. that any structure built by the parser is part of the correct analysis of the input.
    Again, in the context of this earlier theory, the form of the indelible syntactic analysis was that of a tree.
    One key idea of this earl
