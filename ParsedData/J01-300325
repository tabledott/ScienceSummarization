  Note the importance of our use of frequency distributions: the claim is not that only Agents can be animate, but rather that nouns that receive an Agent role will more often be animate than nouns that receive a Theme role.
    Additional Features The above interactions between thematic roles and the syntactic expressions of arguments thus lead to three features whose distributional properties appear promising for distinguishing unergative, unaccusative and object-drop verbs: transitivity, causativity, and animacy of subject.
    We also investigate two additional syntactic features: the use of the passive or active voice, and the use of the past participle or simple past part-of-speech (POS) tag (VBN or VBD, in the Penn Treebank style).
    These features are related to the transitive/intransitive alternation, since a passive use implies a transitive use of the verb, as well as to the use of a past participle form of the verb.'
    Table 4 summarizes the features we derive from the thematic properties, and
