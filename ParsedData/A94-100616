ords of the two texts, skipping words that cannot be aligned at a given confidence level (see Figure 2).
    For each occurrence of a source term, termight identifies a candidate translation based on the alignment of its words.
    The candidate translation is defined as the sequence of words between the first and last target positions that are aligned with any of the words of the source term.
    In the example of Figure 2 the candidate translation of Optional Parameters box is zone Parametres optionnels, since zone and optionnels are the first and last French words that are aligned with the words of the English term.
    Notice that in this case the candidate translation is correct even though the word Parameters is aligned incorrectly.
    In other cases alignment errors may lead to an incorrect candidate translation for a specific occurrence of the term.
    It is quite likely, however, that the correct translation, or at least a string that overlaps with it, will be identified in some occurrences of the
