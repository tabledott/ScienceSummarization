sampled rules is shown in parentheses.
			Reason % mentions Incorrect Rule learned 39.0 Context mismatch 27.0 Match error 19.0 Annotation problem 15.0 Table 2: Distribution of reasons for false positives (incorrect argument extractions) by BInc at K=20.
			Reason % mentions Rule not learned 61.5 Match error 25.0 Discourse analysis needed 12.0 Argument is predicative 1.5 Table 3: Distribution of reasons for false negatives (missed argument mentions) by BInc at K=20.
			Table 3 presents the analysis of false negatives.
			First, we note that 12% of the arguments cannotbe extracted by rules alone, due to necessary discourse analysis.
			Thus, a recall upper bound for en tailment rules is 88%.
			Many missed extractions aredue to rules that were not learned (61.5%).
			How ever, 25% of the mentions were missed because of incorrect syntactic matching of correctly learned rules.
			By assuming correct matches in these cases we isolate the recall of the rule-set (along with the seeds), which yields 39% recall.
