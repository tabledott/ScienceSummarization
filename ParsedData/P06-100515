comprises 85 GB of news articles taken from the world wide web over a 1-year period.
    Bergsma (2005) learns noun gender (and number) from two principal sources: 1) mining it from manually-defined lexico-syntactic patterns in parsed corpora, and 2) acquiring it on the fly by counting the number of pages returned for various gender-indicating patterns by the Google search engine.
    The web-based approach outperformed the corpus-based approach, while a system that combined the two sets of information resulted in the highest performance (Table 3).
    The combined gender-classifying system is a machine-learned classifier with 20 features.
    The time delay of using an Internet search engine within a large-scale anaphora resolution effort is currently impractical.
    Thus we attempted to duplicate Bergsma&#8217;s corpus-based extraction of gender and number, where the information can be stored in advance in a table, but using a much larger data set.
    Bergsma ran his extraction on roughly 6 GB of text; we
