of morpho- logical agreement filters, which eliminate from consid- eration any discourse referent which disagrees in per- son, numbeb or gender with the pronoun, and a set of disjoint reference filters.
			The determination f disjoint reference represents a significant point of divergence between our algorithm and the Lappin/Leass algorithm, because, as is well known, configurational relations play a prominent role in determining which constituents in a sentence a pro- noun may refer to.
			Three conditions are of particular relevance to the anaphora resolution algorithm: Condition \]: A pronoun cannot corefer with a coargument.
			Condition 2: A pronoun cannot corefer with a nonpronominal constituent which it both commands and precedes.
			Condition 3: A pronoun cannot corefer with a constituent which contains it.
			In the absence of configurafional information, our al- gorithm relies on inferences from grammatical func- tion and precedence todetermine disjoint reference.
			In practice, even without accura
