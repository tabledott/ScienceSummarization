rporating syntactic evidence that is new to the sentence compression literature, such as head-modifier bilexical dependencies, and nth-order sister and vertical annotation.
    We think this work leads to a better understanding of what type of syntactic and lexical evidence makes sentence compression work.
    Furthermore, our work leaves the door open to uses of our factored model in a constituent-based or word-based discriminative framework, in which each elementary lexico-syntactic structure of this paper can be discriminatively weighted to directly optimize compression quality.
    Since McDonald&#8217;s approach does not incorporate SCFG deletion rules, and conditions deletions on less lexico-syntactic context, we believe this will lead to levels of performance superior to both papers.
  
  
    We presented a sentence compression system based on SCFG deletion rules, for which we defined a head-driven Markovization formulation.
    This Markovization enabled us to incorporate lexical conditioning variabl
