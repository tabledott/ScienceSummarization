make a note of its collocates and store them along with their position relative to w, their part of speech, and their frequency of appearance.
    More precisely, for each prospective lexical relation, or for each potential collocate wi, we maintain a data structure containing this information.
    The data structure is shown in Figure 5.
    It contains freq&#8222; the frequency of appearance of w, with w so far in the corpus, PP, the part of speech of wi, and pij, (-5 &lt;j &lt; 5, j 0), the frequency of appearance of w, with w such that they are j words apart.
    The p;s represent the histogram of the frequency of appearances of w and w, in given positions.
    This histogram will be used in later stages.
    As an example, if sentence (9) is the current input to step 1.2 and w = takeover, then, the prospective lexical relations identified in sentence (9) are as shown in Table 3.
    In Table 3, distance is the distance between &amp;quot;takeover&amp;quot; and wi, and PP is the part of speech of w,.
