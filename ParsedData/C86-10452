			Grammars Both terms, unification grammar (UG) and categorial grammar (CG), stand for whole families of related grammar formalisms whose basic notions are widely known.l Yet, for the characterization f the class of formalisms I want to discuss, it will be useful to review the most central concepts of both UG and CG.
			Unification grammar formalisms employ complex feature structures as their syntactic representations.
			These structures encode partial information about constituents.
			Either term or graph unification is utilized as the main operation for checking, propagating, and merging of the information in these complex representations.
			Most unification grammars also use the complex feature structures for the linking of syntactic and semantic infor
