    Hence they can be used with a higher degree of confidence, especially when applied to data that is heterogeneous with regard to frequency.
    This is important because while some VNICs are very common, others have very low frequency.
    Table 4 presents the performance of the hybrid measure, , repeating that of and for comparison. outperforms both lexical and syntactic fixedness measures, with a substantial improvement over , and a small, but notable, improvement over .
    Each of the lexical and syntactic fixedness measures is a good indicator of idiomaticity on its own, with syntactic fixedness being a better predictor.
    Here we demonstrate that combining them into a single measure of fixedness, while giving more weight to the better measure, results in a more effective predictor of idiomaticity.
  
  
    Our evaluation of the fixedness measures demonstrates their usefulness for the automatic recognition of idiomatic verb&#8211;noun pairs.
    To represent such pairs in a lexicon, however, we mus
