  At least @+FAUXV, @+FMAINV, @SUBJ, @OBJ, @I-OBJ, @PCOMPL-S, and @PCOMPL-O obey this restric- tion.
  Many constraints may be based on consequen- ces of the Uniqueness Principle.
  E.g., if a morphologically and syntactically unambiguous @SUBJ has been identified in a clause, all other instances of @SUBJ occurring in syntactically am- biguous readings of that clause may be discarded.
