rom that node to v is taken as a template.
			We stop when the first verb orclause boundary (e.g. a relative clause) is encountered, which typically represent the syn tactic boundary of a specific predicate.

			To enable templates with control verbs and.
			light verbs, e.g. ?X help preventing?, ?Xmake noise?, whenever a verb is encountered we generate templates that are paths between v and the verb?s modifiers, either ob jects, prepositional complements or infinite or gerund verb forms (paths ending at stop words, e.g. pronouns, are not generated).
			3.
			To capture noun modifiers that act as predi-.
			cates, e.g. ?the losingX?, we extract template paths between v and each of its modifiers, nouns or adjectives, that are derived from a verb.
			We use the Catvar database to identify verb derivations (Habash and Dorr, 2003).
			As an example for the procedure, the templates extracted from the sentence ?The losing party played it safe?
			with ?party?
			as the variable are: ?losing X?, ?X play?
