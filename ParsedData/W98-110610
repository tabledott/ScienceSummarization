re scored as duplicates, as well as correct but underspecified extractions such as instead of &amp;quot;John F. An item it did not appear in the answer keys.
    All items extracted from irrelevant texts were spurious.
    Finally, items in the answer keys that were not were counted as Correct + missthe total number of items in the answer 1 shows the for AutoSlog-TS' extraction patterns, and Table 2 shows the results for case frames.
    We computed (R) cor- I (correct + missing), (P) (correct duplicate) I (correct + duplicate + misla- + spurious). extraction patterns and case frames achieved similar recall results, although the case frames missed seven correct extractions.
    However the case frames produced substantially fewer false hits, producing 82 fewer spurious extractions.
    Note that perpetrators exhibited by far the lowest precision.
    The reason is that the perpetrator slot received highest precedence among competing slots for unknown words.
