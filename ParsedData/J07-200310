res are rewrite rules with aligned pairs of right-hand sides: where X is a nonterminal, &#947; and &#945; are both strings of terminals and nonterminals, and &#8212; is a one-to-one correspondence between nonterminal occurrences in &#947; and nonterminal occurrences in &#945;.
    For example, the hierarchical phrase pairs (3), (4), and (5) previously presented could be formalized in a synchronous CFG as: where we have used boxed indices to indicate which nonterminal occurrences are linked by &#8212;.
    The conventional phrase pairs would be formalized as: A synchronous CFG derivation begins with a pair of linked start symbols.
    At each step, two linked nonterminals are rewritten using the two components of a single rule.
    When denoting links with boxed indices, we must consistently reindex the newly introduced symbols apart from the symbols already present.
    For an example using these rules, see Figure 1.
    The bulk of the grammar consists of automatically extracted rules.
