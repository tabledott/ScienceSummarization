 no significant relation to compositionality judgements.
    This is interesting because Krenn and Evert found that co-occurrence frequency was a good indication of the German multiwords, although the task there was identification of the multiwords, as opposed to measuring compositionality.
  
  
    MI is the statistic with the strongest value of T., and the thesaurus measure with the strongest relationship was sameparticle-simplex.
    These two measures correlated well together (T., = -0.51, z = -5.37) and both are significantly correlated (using the Mann Whitney U test) with whether the candidate is found in either WordNet or ANLT, see table 3, although the relationship using the automatic thesaurus is slightly higher.
    Lin uses a log-likelihood ratio to filter multiword candidates before using his automatic thesaurus to detect compositionality in multiwords containing 2 or more open class words.
    For phrasal candidates at least, it might be worth using evidence from the thesaurus on the unfiltered
