traint back into the structure of the head daughter.
    NP-NP modification, depicted in NNM&#177; in Figure 4, was the most common error seen; the greater prevalence of false positives is likely a result of the overall PCFG parsing preference for flatter structures.
    This type of parse ambiguity is grounded in the semantic ambiguity of compound noun interpretation.
    This semantic ambiguity exists in English as well, as in the NNM{&#177;/&#8212;} NP-NP modification false positive/negative PNM{+/&#8212;} (non-NP) prenominal mod. false positive/negative CRD{H,L}{V,N} incorrect {high/low} coordination attachment of righthand {verbal/nominal} material Adj X/Y incorrect adjunction into X; correct site was Y mistag X/Y category Y mistagged as X &#176;Note that only mistaggings leading to constituentlevel parse errors were tallied.
    ETB string commodity speculator Richard Dennis, but these structures are typically bracketed flat in the ETB, underspecifying the semantic relations relative to the CTB.
