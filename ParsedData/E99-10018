: Number of correct tags in the answer file over total number of tags in the answer file.
    Recall and precision are generally accepted ways of measuring system performance in this field.
    For example, suppose you have a text which is 1000 words long, and 20 of these words express a location.
    Now imagine a system which assigns the LOCATION tag to every single word in the text.
    This system will have tagged correctly all 20 locations, since it tagged everything as LOCATION; its recall score is 20/20, or 100%.
    But of the 1000 LOCATION tags it assigned, only those 20 were correct; its precision is therefore only 20/1000, or 2%.
  
  
    We decided first to test to what extent NE recognition can be carried out merely by recourse to list lookup.
    Such a system could be domain and language independent.
    It would need no grammars or even information about tokenization but simply mark up known strings in the text.
    Of course, the development and maintenance of the name lists would become mor
