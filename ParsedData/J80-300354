tor definitions for speech acts used here are intended to facilitate the statement of the plan construction and inference rules.
    However, their expressive power is insufficient to handle complex actions involving sequencing, conditionals, disjunctions, iterations, parallelism, discontinuity, and a fortiori requests and promises to do such acts.
    They are also inadequate, as Moore [1979] points out, to express what the agent of an action knows (and does not know) after the success or failure of an act.
    Moore's logic of action includes sequencing, conditionals, and iterations, and is being applied to speech acts by Appelt [1980].
    Much remains to be done to extend it to parallel and discontinuous actions typical of multiple agent situations.
    These difficulties notwithstanding, we hope that we have helped show that the interaction of logic, philosophy of language, linguistics and artificial intelligence is productive and that the whole will shed light on each of the parts.
