en quite favorable, there is still much that can be done potentially to improve performance and completely close the gap between learned and rule-based name-finding systems.
    We would like to incorporate the following into the current model:
  
  
    We have shown that using a fairly simple probabilistic model, finding names and other numerical entities as specified by the MUC tasks can be performed with &amp;quot;near-human performance&amp;quot;, often likened to an F of 90 or above.
    We have also shown that such a system can be trained efficiently and that, given appropriately and consistently marked answer keys, it can be trained on languages foreign to the trainer of the system; for example, we do not speak Spanish, but trained Nymble on answer keys marked by native speakers.
    None of the formalisms or techniques presented in this paper is new; rather, the approach to this task&#8212;the model itself&#8212;is wherein lies the novelty.
    Given the incredibly difficult nature of many NLP tasks,
