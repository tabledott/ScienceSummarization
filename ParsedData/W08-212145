cates that, generally, systems performed much worse on nominal predicates than on verbal predicates.
    This is to be expected considering that there is significant body of previous work that analyzes the SRL problem on PropBank, but minimal work for NomBank.
    On average, the difference between the labeled F1 scores for verbal predicates and nominal predicates on the WSJ+Brown corpus is 7.84 points.
    Furthermore, the average difference between labeled F1 scores on the Brown corpus alone is 12.36 points.
    This indicates that the problem of SRL for nominal predicates is more sensitive to domain changes than the equivalent problem for verbal predicates.
    Our conjecture is that, because there is very little syntactic structure between nominal predicates and their arguments, SRL models for nominal predicates select mainly lexical features, which are more brittle than syntactic or other non-lexicalized features.
    Remarkably, there is one system (baldridge) which performed better on the WSJ+Brown for
