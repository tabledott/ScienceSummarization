ra et al., 1993; Lee and Pereira, 1999).
    The resulting clusters appeared to contain a great deal of implicit semantic information.
    This implicit information, we believed, could serve to augment a small amount of annotated data.
    Particularly promising were techniques for producing hierarchical clusters at various scales, from small and highly specific to large and more general.
    To benefit from such information, however, we would need an automatic learning mechanism that could effectively exploit it.
    Fortunately, a second line of recent research provided a potential solution.
    Recent work in discriminative methods (Lafferty et al., 2001; Sha and Pereira, 2003, Collins 2002) suggested a framework for exploiting large numbers of arbitrary input features.
    These methods seemed to have exactly the right characteristics for incorporating the statistically-correlated hierarchical word clusters we wished to exploit.
    Combining these two methods, we suspected, would be sufficient to drastic
