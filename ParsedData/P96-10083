ational linguistics, such as quantification, reference and the like, are thus ignored.
    To evaluate our approach, we trained an experimental system using data from the Air Travel Information (ATIS) domain (Bates et al. 1990; Price 1990).
    The selection of ATIS was motivated by three concerns.
    First, a large corpus of ATIS sentences already exists and is readily available.
    Second, ATIS provides an existing evaluation methodology, complete with independent training and test corpora, and scoring programs.
    Finally, evaluating on a common corpus makes it easy to compare the performance of the system with those based on different approaches.
    We have evaluated our system on the same blind test sets used in the ARPA evaluations (Pallett et al. 1995), and present a preliminary result at the conclusion of this paper.
    The remainder of the paper is divided into four sections, one describing the overall structure of our models, and one for each of the three major components of parsing, semantic i
