include random annotation with uniform distribution (K = &#8722;.10; accuracy of 14%) and random annotation with observed distribution.
    The latter baseline is built into the definition of kappa (K = 0; accuracy of 48%).
    Although our system outperforms an ambitious baseline (macro-F shows that our system performs roughly 20% better than text classification) and also performs much above chance, there is still a big gap in performance between humans and machine.
    Macro-F shows a 20% difference between our system and human performance.
    If the system is put into a pool of annotators for the 25 articles for which three-way human judgment exists, agreement drops from K = .71 to K = .59.
    This is a clear indication that the system&#8217;s annotation is still distinguishably different from human annotation. the optimal feature combination (as determined by an exhaustive search in the space of feature combinations).
    The most distinctive single feature is Location (achieving an agreement of K = .22
