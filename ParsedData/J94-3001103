n the rule by the boundary symbol #.
    The string abc is thus rewritten by this rule to goabc.
    The following sets of rules are defined to represent the state-to-state transitions and the final states of the transducer: The second rule of the grammar is an obligatory, left-to-right batch rule consisting of all the rules in Transitions U Final.
    If the transition function carries the transducer from g, to g1 over the pair (u, v), there will be a rule in Transitions that applies to the string .. . g,u ... at the position just after the substring beginning with g, and produces ...g,vgi ... as its output.
    Because 6 is a total function on Q x E' x E', some subrule will apply at every string position in the left-to-right batch scan.
    The state-context for the left-most application of this rule is the start-state go, and subrules corresponding to start-state transitions are selected.
    This introduces a state-symbol that makes available at the next position only subrules corresponding to transitions
