ust a pronoun.
    Having separate symbols for subject and object NPs allows this variation to be captured and used to improve parse scoring.
    One way of capturing this kind of external context is to use parent annotation, as presented in Johnson (1998).
    For example, NPs with S parents (like subjects) will be marked NP&amp;quot;S, while NPs with VP parents (like objects) will be NP&amp;quot;VP.
    The second basic deficiency is that many rule types have been seen only once (and therefore have their probabilities overestimated), and many rules which occur in test sentences will never have been seen in training (and therefore have their probabilities underestimated &#8211; see Collins (1999) for analysis).
    Note that in parsing with the unsplit grammar, not having seen a rule doesn&#8217;t mean one gets a parse failure, but rather a possibly very weird parse (Charniak, 1996).
    One successful method of combating sparsity is to markovize the rules (Collins, 1999).
    In particular, we follow that w
