ivated inflections are placed in an equivalent class.
    For example, cooking, cooked, cooks, cooker are all instances of the class cook.
    Unlike morphological analysers (Koskenniemi, 1983, for example), a stemming algorithm does not identify the morphemes.
    Its simply removes common affixes from a word, e.g. combines, combine &#8212;&gt; combin, depart, department &#8212;&gt; depart.
    Thus, similar surface forms are considered positive evidence in the similarity estimate.
    We propose that latent semantic analysis offers a better solution to the term matching problem.
    LSA (Deerwester et al., 1990) stems from work in information retrieval, where the main difficulty is formulating a similarity metric that associates a user query with the relevant documents in a database.
    The basic keyword search approach retrieves all documents which contain some or all of the query terms.
    This is inaccurate since the same concept may be described using different terms.
    To circumvent this, Jing and
