removing some distractors.
    This could be done as follows: whenever a Value Vi,j of an Attribute Ai is selected for inclusion in L, search for other Values of the same Attribute that have the target r as an element; if such a Value Vi,k is found, check whether it stands in the subset relation to Vi,j (i.e., either [[Vi,j]] &#57736; [[Vi,k]] or [[Vi,k]] &#57736; [[Vi,j]]); if not, then include Vi,k as well; next, search for yet another Value Vi,l of the same Attribute that has r as an element, and include Vi,l if it does not stand in the subset relation to Vi,j or Vi,k; and so on until no other Values of Ai exist that have r as an element; then move on to the next Attribute.
    This algorithm has a worst-case running time of O(nan2v).4 In our example, this algorithm would produce a set consisting of the properties BOUGHT BY SONY and BOUGHT BY PHILIPS, which can be realized as the desk bought by Sony and by Philips; if we change the example by letting Philips buy c as well as a, the algorithm will go on to
