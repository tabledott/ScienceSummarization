 compared with the dependency F-scores obtained by evaluating on the Parc Dependency Bank.
    Second, using the same resource for development and testing can lead to an over-optimistic view of parser performance.
    In this paper we evaluate a CCG parser (Clark and Curran, 2004b) on the Briscoe and Carroll version of DepBank (Briscoe and Carroll, 2006).
    The CCG parser produces head-dependency relations, so evaluating the parser should simply be a matter of converting the CCG dependencies into those in DepBank.
    Such conversions have been performed for other parsers, including parsers producing phrase structure output (Kaplan et al., 2004; Preiss, 2003).
    However, we found that performing such a conversion is a time-consuming and non-trivial task.
    The contributions of this paper are as follows.
    First, we demonstrate the considerable difficulties associated with formalism-independent parser evaluation, highlighting the problems in converting the output of a parser from one representation to
