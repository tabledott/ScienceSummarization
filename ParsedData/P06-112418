u) assigned xul.
    In the Chinese restaurant metaphor, this is the index of the table which the lth customer sat at in the restaurant corresponding to Gu.
    If xul has value w, it can only be assigned to draws from G&#960;(u) that has value w as well.
    This can either be a preexisting draw with value w, or it can be a new draw taking on value w. The relevant probabilities are given in the functions DrawWord(u) and WordProb(u,w), where we treat xul as the last word drawn from Gu.
    This gives: where the superscript &#8722;ul means the corresponding set of variables or counts with xul excluded.
    The parameters &#920; are sampled using an auxiliary variable sampler as detailed in (Teh, 2006).
    The overall sampling scheme for an n-gram hierarchical Pitman-Yor language model takes O(nT) time and requires O(M) space per iteration, where T is the number of words in the training set, and M is the number of unique n-grams.
    During test time, the computational cost is O(nI), since the predictive proba
