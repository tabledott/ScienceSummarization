th LFG f-equations: NP[?OBJ=?]
			DT[?SPEC=?]
			NN[?=?]
			Nodes followed by annotations are treated as a monadic category for grammar extraction and parsing.
			Post-parsing, equations are collected from parse trees and resolved into f-structures.Both architectures parse raw text into ?proto?
			fstructures with LDDs unresolved resulting in in complete argument structures as in Figure 4.

			Theoretically, LDDs can span unbounded amounts of intervening linguistic material as in [U.N. signs treaty]1 the paper claimed . . .
			a source said []1.
			In LFG, LDDs are resolved at the f-structure level, obviating the need for empty productions and tracesin trees (Dalrymple, 2001), using functional uncer tainty (FU) equations.
