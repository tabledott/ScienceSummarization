    The answers of the systems were then sent to organisers for evaluation.
  
  
    Figure 1 provides an overview of the task.
    As can be observed, the task consisted of three separate phases.
    In the first phase, training phase, participating systems were provided with a training dataset that consisted of a set of target word (noun/verb) instances (sentences/paragraphs).
    Participants were then asked to use this training dataset to induce the senses of the target word.
    No other resources were allowed with the exception of NLP components for morphology and syntax.
    In the second phase, testing phase, participating systems were provided with a testing dataset that consisted of a set of target word (noun/verb) instances (sentences/paragraphs).
    Participants were then asked to tag (disambiguate) each testing instance with the senses induced during the training phase.
    In the third and final phase, the tagged test instances were received by the organisers in order to evaluate the answers
