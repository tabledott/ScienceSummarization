 incorrect lengths are chosen.
    However, we can renormalize by dividing by the mass placed on proper sentences and zeroing the probability of improper bracketings.
    The rest of the paper, and results, would be unchanged except for notation to track the renormalization constant. the model are the constituency-conditional yield and context distributions P(&#945;|b) and P(x|b).
    If P(B) is uniform over all (possibly crossing) bracketings, then this procedure will be equivalent to softclustering with two equal-prior classes.
    There is reason to believe that such soft clusterings alone will not produce valuable distinctions, even with a significantly larger number of classes.
    The distituents must necessarily outnumber the constituents, and so such distributional clustering will result in mostly distituent classes.
    Clark (2001) finds exactly this effect, and must resort to a filtering heuristic to separate constituent and distituent clusters.
    To underscore the difference between the bracketi
