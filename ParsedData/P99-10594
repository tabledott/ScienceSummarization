    A &amp;quot;derives&amp;quot; relation, written is associated with a CFG as usual.
    We also use the reflexive and transitive closure of written and define L(G) accordingly.
    We write a 8 =* a-0 for a derivation in which only /3 is rewritten.
  
  
    We introduce next a grammar formalism that captures lexical dependencies among pairs of words in VT.
    This formalism closely resembles stochastic grammatical formalisms that are used in several existing natural language processing systems (see &#167;1).
    We will specify a nonstochastic version, noting that probabilities or other weights may be attached to the rewrite rules exactly as in stochastic CFG (Gonzales and Thomason, 1978; Wetherell, 1980).
    (See &#167;4 for brief discussion.)
    Suppose G = (VN, VT , P,T[$]) is a CFG in CNF.3 We say that G is bilexical if there exists a set of &amp;quot;delexicalized nonterminals&amp;quot; VD such that VN = {A[a] : A E VD, a E VT} and eve
