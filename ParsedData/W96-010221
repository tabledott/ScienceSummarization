atic integration of information about the form and the context of a focus word not encountered before.
    In general, the top levels of the tree represent the morphological information (the three suffix letter features and the prefix letter), while the deeper levels contribute contextual disambiguation.
  
  
    In this section, we report first results on our memory-based tagging approach.
    In a first set of experiments, we compared our IGTree implementation of memory-based learning to more traditional implementations of the approach.
    In further experiments we studied the performance of our system on predicting the category of both known and unknown words.
    The experimental methodology was taken from Machine Learning practice (e.g.
    Weiss &amp; Kulikowski, 1991): independent training and test sets were selected from the original corpus, the system was trained on the training set, and the generalization accuracy (percentage of correct category assignments) was computed on the independent test se
