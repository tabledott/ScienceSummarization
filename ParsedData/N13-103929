ined on a mix of several POS-annotated corpora.
    We also perform the ablation experiments on this corpus, with a slightly different experimental setup: we first filter out system messages then split data 24Release 1.0: http://faculty.nps.edu/ cmartell/NPSChat.htm 25Forsyth actually used 30 different 90/10 random splits; we prefer cross-validation because the same test data is never repeated, thus allowing straightforward confidence estimation of accuracy from the number of tokens (via binomial sample variance, footnote 19).
    In all cases, the models are trained on the same amount of data (90%). into 5,067 training and 2,868 test messages.
    Results show a similar pattern as the Twitter data (see final column of Table 2).
    Thus the Twitter word clusters are also useful for language in the medium of text chat rooms; we suspect these clusters will be applicable for deeper syntactic and semantic analysis in other online conversational text mediums, such as text messages and instant messages.
