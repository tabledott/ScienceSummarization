    However, we find that features that also perform well are those that capture when a word is (or is not) modifying or being modified by other polarity terms.
    This suggests that identifying features that represent more complex interdependencies between polarity clues will be an important avenue for future research.
    Another direction for future work will be to expand our lexicon using existing techniques for acquiring the prior polarity of words and phrases.
    It follows that a larger lexicon will have a greater coverage of sentiment expressions.
    However, expanding the lexicon with automatically acquired prior-polarity tags may result in an even greater proportion of neutral instances to contend with.
    Given the degradation in performance created by the neutral instances, whether expanding the lexicon automatically will result in improved performance for recognizing contextual polarity is an empirical question.
    Finally, the overall goal of our research is to use phrase-level senti
