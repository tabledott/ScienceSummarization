entence in language L1 translates into a sentence in L2 in a very different form (i.e., differently shaped parse trees or similarly shaped trees with different basic categories).
  This definition implies that a divergence may arise between two languages L1 and L2, independent of the way the translation is done (i.e., direct, transfer, or interlingual).
  However, it is also possible to define a divergence from an interlingual point of view, i.e., with respect to an underlying representation (lexical conceptual structure) that has been chosen to describe the source and target language sentences.
  From this point of view, a divergent mapping may apply even in cases in which the source- and target-language pairs do not exhibit any distinctions on the surface (e.g., the translation of the German sentence Hans kuflt Marie gern as the equivalent Dutch sentence Hans kust Marie graag, both of which literally translate to Hans kisses Mary likingly).
