t dropped is the head of the complement S[dcl]: wh-extraction, which use the same lexical categories as for in situ complements, they also provide an analysis of right node raising constructions without introducing any new lexical categories.
    In the Treebank analysis of right node raising, the shared constituent is coindexed with two *RNR* traces in both of its canonical positions: We need to alter the translation algorithm slightly to deal with *RNR* traces in a manner essentially equivalent to the earlier treatment of *T* wh-traces.
    Details are in the CCGbank manual.
    The CCG derivation for the above example is as follows: The right node raising dependencies are as follows: Our algorithm works also if the shared constituent is an adjunct, or if two conjoined noun phrases share the same head, which is also annotated with *RNR* traces.
    Although there are only 209 sentences with *RNR* traces in the entire Treebank, right node raising is actually far more frequent, because *RNR* traces are not us
