y results should be compared to a baseline (chance) accuracy of 35%, the relative frequency of the most frequent DA type (STATEMENT) in our test set.4 5.1 Dialogue Act Classification Using Words DA classification using words is based on the observation that different DAs use distinctive word strings.
    It is known that certain cue words and phrases (Hirschberg and Litman 1993) can serve as explicit indicators of discourse structure.
