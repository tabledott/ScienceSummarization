 be recognized.
    Quite the opposite may be true in the case of impressing, as the ICP may not want the OCP to be aware of his intention.
    When teaching, the ICP may not care whether the OCP knows the ICP is teaching him or her.
    Thus, the intention that motivates the ICP to engage in a discourse may be private.
    By contrast, the discourse segment purpose is always intended to be recognized.
    DPs and DSPs are basically the same sorts of intentions.
    If an intention is a DP, then its satisfaction is a main purpose of the discourse, whereas if it is a DSP, then its satisfaction contributes to the satisfaction of the DP.
    The following are some of the types of intentions that could serve as DP/DSPs, followed by one example of each type.
    We have identified two structural relations that play an important role in discourse structure: dominance and satisfaction-precedence.
    An action that satisfies one intention, say DSP1, may be intended to provide part of the satisfaction of another, say
