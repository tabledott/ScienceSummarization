explore using our smoothing technique in other models such as HMMs.
    For instance, we could do unsupervised HMM part-of-speech induction by smooth a tritag model with a bitag model.
    Finally, we would like to learn the parts-of-speech in our dependency model from text and not rely on the gold-standard tags.
