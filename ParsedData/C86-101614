ereira,  was implemented for gaps in z PATR by Stuar t  Shieber.
  The scheme in I)-t)AIR is an improvement  in that  it also handles sentences with nested fi l ler-gap dependencies.
  77 The default  mechan ism uses four special features: gapln, gapOut, relIn and relOut.
  These features need to be ment ioned explicit ly only in rules that  introduce fillers, such as the relat ive-clause rule, and in the lexical entr ies of relat ive and interrogat ive pronouns.
  Other  rules are automat ica l ly  augmented  by I)-PAIR in the appropr iate manner  when they are compiled to feature sets used by the parser.
  By deact ivat ing this facility, the grammar writer can also take care of fi l lers and gaps in a manner  of his own choosing.
  3 Pars ing  and  Un i f i ca t ion D PATR uses an active chart  parser that  proceeds in a top-down, breadth-f i rst  manner .
  Because the const i tuents  in a rule are feature sets ra ther  than atomic symbols, the task is a bit  more complicated than in s tandard implementat
