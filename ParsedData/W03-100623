nt is chosen to be correct.
    Table 4 show the results when we use SEM-TAG in order to supertag the input and perform LDA.
    When the boundaries are found, finding the head word additionally does not result in a decrease of performance.
    However, correctly identifying the head word instead of the boundaries leads to an important increase in performance.
    Furthermore, note the low recall and high precision of the &#8220;base + arg&#8221; evaluation.
    In part this is due to the nature of the PropBank corpus that we are using.
    In particular, because not all predicates in our version of the PropBank are annotated with semantic roles, the supertagger for SEM-TAG will sometimes annotate text without semantic roles when in fact it should contain them.
    Table 5 shows the results of first supertagging the input with SYNT-TAG and then using a model trained on the DEEP feature set to annotate the resulting syntactic structure with semantic roles.
    This two-step approach greatly increases performan
