ndency analyses for each phrase/clause of the conjunctive structures and the dependency analysis for the whole sentence after all the conjunctive structures have been reduced into single nodes.
    The dependency analysis of Japanese is rather simple.
    A component depends on a component to its right (not necessarily the adjacent component), and the suffix (postposition) of a component indicates what kind of element it can depend on.
    More than one head-dependent relation may exist between components, but by introducing some heuristics, we can easily get a unique dependency analysis result that is correct for a high percentage of cases.
    A serious problem regarding conjunctive structures, in addition to the ambiguity of their scopes, is the ellipses in some of their components.
    Through the dependency analysis process outlined, we are able to find the ellipses occurring in the conjunctive structures and supplement them with the omitted components.
