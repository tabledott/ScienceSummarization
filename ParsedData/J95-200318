an utterance of some phrase' for which c is the semantic interpretation.
    Realizes is a generalization of directly realizes.
    This generalization is important for capturing certain regularities in the use of definite descriptions and pronouns.
    The precise definition of depends on the semantic theory one adopts.'
    One feature that distinguishes centering from other treatments of related discourse phenomena is that the realization relation combines syntactic, semantic, discourse, and intentional factors.
    That is, the centers of an utterance in general, and the backward-looking center specifically, are determined on the basis of a combination of properties of the utterance, the discourse segment in which it occurs, and various aspects of the cognitive state of the participants of that discourse.
    Thus, for a semantic theory to support centering, it must provide an adequate basis for computing the realization relation.
    For example, NP directly realizes c may hold in cases where NP is a def
