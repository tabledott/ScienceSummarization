    Within those columns, &amp;quot;majority&amp;quot; lists the opinion of the majority of judges, and &amp;quot;any&amp;quot; indicates the hypernyms that were accepted by even one of the judges.
    The &amp;quot;Hypernym 1/any&amp;quot; column can be used to compare results to Riloff and Shepherd (1997).

    Using randomly-selected categories and randomly-selected category members we achieved 39%.
    By the strictest criteria, our algorithm produces correct hyponyms for a randomlyselected h
