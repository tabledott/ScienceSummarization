ikelihood-ratio would be a cheaper and accurate enough alternative, for example.We will now return to the interaction of the se lection in our beam search of the top 30 candidates based on forward conditional probabilities.
			This will affect our results but most likely in the following manner: 1.
			For very small thresholds, the beam will be-.
			come much wider and the search will take much longer.
			In order to allow the experiments to complete in a reasonable time, other means will need to be employed to reduce the choices.This reduction will also interact with the sig nificance pruning but in a less understandable manner.
			2.
			For large thresholds, there will not be 30.
			973 choices and so there will be no effect.
			3.
			For intermediate thresholds, the extra prun-.
			ing might reduce BLEU score but by a small amount because most of the best choices are included in the search.Using thresholds that remove most of the phrase table would no doubt qualify as large thresholds so the question is ad
