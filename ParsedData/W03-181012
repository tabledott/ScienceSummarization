s scale and ask human judges to rank multiword candidates along this.
    We investigate the use of these ranked judgements for evaluating compositionality measures.
    We also look at the relation between these judgements and appearance of the candidates in gold-standard resources such as WordNet (Miller et al., 1993) or the ANLT lexicon (Grover et al., 1993), on the premise that non-compositional phrases are more likely to be listed as multiwords in man-made resources.
  
  
    For these experiments we use data from the ninety million words of the written portion of the British National Corpus parsed with the RASP parser (Briscoe and Carroll, 2002).
    The output of the parser is a set of grammatical relations (Carroll et al., 1998) specifying the syntactic dependency between each head and its dependent(s), read off from the phrase structure tree that is returned from the disambiguation phase.
    The parser uses information from ANLT such as phrasals in its dictionary.
    This makes it more likely to s
