e pattern X is a Y (which is highly indicative that X and Y are coreferent), we can instantiate it with a pair of NPs and search for the instantiated pattern in a large corpus or the Web (Daum&#180;e III and Marcu, 2005; Haghighi and Klein, 2009).
    The more frequently the pattern occurs, the more likely they are coreferent.
    This technique has been applied to resolve different kinds of anaphoric references, including other-anaphora (Modjeska et al., 2003; Markert and Nissim, 2005) and bridging references (Poesio et al., 2004a).
    While these patterns are typically hand-crafted (e.g., Garera and Yarowsky (2006)), they can also be learned from an annotated corpus (Yang and Su, 2007) or bootstrapped from an unannotated corpus (Bean and Riloff, 2004).
    Despite the large amount of work on discoursebased anaphora resolution in the 1970s and 1980s (see Hirst (1981)), learning-based resolvers have only exploited shallow discourse-based features, which primarily involve characterizing the salience of a cand
