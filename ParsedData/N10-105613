rrect pairs) not included in SPLIST.
    We also found the pairs produced by these two systems to be complementary to each other.
    We believe that these two approaches provide a good starting point for further explorations.
    Finally, some examples of simplifications found by our methods: &#8220;stands for&#8221; &#8594; &#8220;is the same as&#8221;, &#8220;indigenous&#8221; &#8594; &#8220;native&#8221;, &#8220;permitted&#8221; &#8594; &#8220;allowed&#8221;, &#8220;concealed&#8221; &#8594; &#8220;hidden&#8221;, &#8220;collapsed&#8221; &#8594; &#8220;fell down&#8221;, &#8220;annually&#8221; &#8594; &#8220;every year&#8221;.
  
  
    Further evaluation could include comparison with machine-translation and paraphrasing algorithms.
    It would be interesting to use our proposed estimates as initialization for EM-style iterative re-estimation.
    Another idea would be to estimate simplification priors based on a model of inherent lexical complexity; some possible starting points are number of syllables (wh
