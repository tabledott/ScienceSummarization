to 23.28 % in the papers subcorpus and to 16.41 % in the abstracts subcorpus, and the average scope to the left is 5.6 tokens in the papers subcorpus and 8.82 in the abstracts subcorpus.
    As for the results per negation signal on the abstracts corpus, the negation signals that score higher PCS have a low (none) or null (absence, fail, lack, neither, no, rather than, without) percentage of scopes to the left.
    An exception is not with a high score and 16.41% of scopes to the left.
    The negation signals with lower PCS have a higher percentage of scopes to the left (absent, can not, nor, unable).
    A typical error for the negation signal unable is exemplified by the sentence VDR DNA-binding mutants were unable to either bind to this element in vitro or repress in vivo, in which the gold scope starts at the beginning of the sentence, where the predicted scopes starts at the negation signal.
