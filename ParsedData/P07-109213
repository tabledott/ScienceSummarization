ributions in (3) to stop zeros from propagating.
    For this we use Simple Good-Turing smoothing (Gale and Sampson, 1995) for each distribution, which provides estimates for zero count events.
  
  
    Corpora We used the Europarl corpus (Koehn, 2005) for experimentation.
    This corpus consists of about 700,000 sentences of parliamentary proceedings from the European Union in eleven European languages.
    We present results on the full corpus for a range of language pairs.
    In addition, we have created smaller parallel corpora by sub-sampling 10,000 sentence bitexts for each language pair.
    These corpora are likely to have minimal overlap &#8212; about 1.5% of the sentences will be shared between each pair.
    However, the phrasal overlap is much greater (10 to 20%), which allows for triangulation using these common phrases.
    This training setting was chosen to simulate translating to or from a &#8220;low density&#8221; language, where only a few small independently sourced parallel corpora are
