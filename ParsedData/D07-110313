sed on the Europarl resources (Europarl, 2003).
			The only change made to these corpora was to convert them to lowercase and to Unicode UTF-8.
			Phrasetables were produced by symmetrizing IBM2 conditional probabilities as described above.
			The phrasetables were then used as a list of n,m-grams for which counts C(s?, t?), C(s?), and C(t?) were obtained.
			Negative-log-p-values under Fisher?s exact test were computed for each of the phrase pairs in the phrasetable and the entry was censored if the negative-log-p-value for the test was below the pruning threshold.
			The entries that are kept are ones that are highly significant.A number of combinations involving many differ ent pruning thresholds were considered: no pruning,10, ??, ?+, 15, 20, 25, 50, 100, and 1000.
			In ad dition, a number of different phrasetable smoothing algorithms were used: no smoothing, Good-Turing smoothing, Kneser-Ney 3 parameter smoothing and the loglinear mixture involving two features called Zens-Ney (Foster et al, 2006).
