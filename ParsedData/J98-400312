nese sound sequences, e.g., ((S AA K ER) (s a kk a a)).
    We were able to produce these pairs by manipulating a small English-katakana glossary.
    For each glossary entry, we converted English words into English sounds using the model described in the previous section, and we converted katakana words into Japanese sounds using the model we describe in the next section.
    We then applied the estimation-maximization (EM) algorithm (Baum 1972; Dempster, Laird, and Rubin 1977) to generate symbol-mapping probabilities, shown in Figure 2.
    Our EM training goes like this: alignments between their elements.
    In our case, an alignment is a drawing that connects each English sound with one or more Japanese sounds, such that all Japanese sounds are covered and no lines cross.
    For example, there are two ways to align the pair ( (L OW) &lt;-&gt; (r o 0)): In this case, the alignment on the left is intuitively preferable.
    The algorithm learns such preferences.

    For each pair, assign an equal w
