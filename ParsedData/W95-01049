    One clue about the identity of an ambiguous target word comes from the words around it.
    For instance, if the target word is ambiguous between desert and dessert, and we see words like arid, sand, and sun nearby, this suggests that the target word should be desert.
    On the other hand, words such as chocolate and delicious in the context imply dessert.
    This observation is the basis for the method of context words.
    The idea is that each word wi in the confusion set will have a characteristic distribution of words that occur in its context; thus to classify an ambiguous target word, we look at the set of words around it and see which wi's distribution they most closely follow.
