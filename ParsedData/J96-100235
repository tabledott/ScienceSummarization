terative technique for maximum likelihood training of a model involving hidden statistics.
    For the basic translation model, the hidden information is the alignment A between E and F. We employed the EM algorithm to estimate the parameters of the basic translation model so as to maximize the likelihood of a bilingual corpus obtained from the proceedings of the Canadian Parliament.
    For historical reasons, these proceedings are sometimes called &amp;quot;Hansards.&amp;quot; Our Hansard corpus contains 3.6 million EnglishFrench sentence pairs, for a total of a little under 100 million words in each language.
    Table 2 shows our parameter estimates for the translation probabilities p(ylin).
    The basic translation model has worked admirably: given only the bilingual corpus, with no additional knowledge of the languages or any relation between them, it has uncovered some highly plausible translations.
    Nevertheless, the basic translation model has one major shortcoming: it does not take the English c
