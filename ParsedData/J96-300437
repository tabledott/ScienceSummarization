 need an estimate of the cost of the resulting word.
    For derived words that occur in our corpus we can estimate these costs as we would the costs for an underived dictionary entry.
    So, xue2-shengl+men0 (student+PL) 'students' occurs and we estimate its cost at 11.43; similarly we estimate the cost of MI jiang4+men0 (general+PL) 'generals' (as in /1\44 flu xiao3-jiang4+men0 'little generals'), at 15.02.
    But we also need an estimate of the probability for a non-occurring though possible plural form like %/ill nan2-gual-men0 'pumpkins!'
    Here we use the Good-Turing estimate (Baayen 1989; Church and Gale 1991), whereby the aggregate probability of previously unseen instances of a construction is estimated as n1/N, where N is the total number of observed tokens and n1 is the number of types observed only once.
    Let us notate the set of previously unseen, or novel, members of a category X as unseen(X); thus, novel members of the set of words derived in 11 men() will be denoted unseen(111).
