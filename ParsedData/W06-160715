s, we used a discounting coefficient derived by (Ney et al., 1994) on the basis of a leaveone-out analysis: D = n1/(n1 + 2n2).
    For the Kneser-Ney smoothing distribution, we also tested the &#8220;Modified Kneser-Ney&#8221; extension suggested in (Chen and Goodman, 1998), in which specific coefficients Dc are used for small count values c up to a maximum of three (ie D3 is used for c &#8805; 3).
    For c = 2 and c = 3, we used formulas given in that paper.
    The two glass-box techniques that we considered involve decomposing source phrases with independence assumptions.
    The simplest approach assumes that all source words are conditionally independent, so that: We implemented two variants for p(sj|&#732;t) that are described in previous work.
    (Zens and Ney, 2004) describe a &#8220;noisy-or&#8221; combination: where &#175;sj is the probability that sj is not in the translation of &#732;t, and p(sj|ti) is a lexical probability.
    (Zens and Ney, 2004) obtain p(sj|ti) from smoothed relative-frequen
