t was excluded from the data set on the grounds that the severely &amp;quot;mangled&amp;quot; sentence happened to turn out well-formed and with nearly the same meaning as the target sentence.
    The results are shown in Table 3.
    We first tested models using one of our metrics as a single intrinsic factor to explain the dependent variable.
    We then added the &amp;quot;problem- variables.' and could boost the explanatory power while maintaining significance.
    In Table 3. we show only some combinations. which show that the best results were obtained by combining the simple tree accuracy with the number of Substitutions (S) and the sentence length.
    As we can see, the number of substitutions has an-important effect-on.

    Furthermore, the number of substitutions has more explanatory power than the number of moves (and in fact than any of the other &amp;quot;problem&am
