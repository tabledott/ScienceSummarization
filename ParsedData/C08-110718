	First, our evaluation aims at assessing the correctness of inferring a specific target semantic meaning, which is denoted by a specific predicate, using rules.
			Thus, four events that correspond ambiguously tomultiple distinct predicates were ignored.
			For instance, the Transfer-Money event refers to both do nating and lending money, and thus annotations ofthis event cannot be mapped to a specific seed tem plate.
			We also omitted 3 events with less than 10mentions, and were left with 26 events (6380 argu ment mentions).
			Additionally, we regard all entailing mentions under the textual entailment definition as correct.
			However, event mentions are annotated as correct in ACE only if they explicitly describe the targetevent.
			For instance, a Divorce mention does entail a preceding marriage event but it does not ex plicitly describe it, and thus it is not annotated as a Marry event.
			To better utilize the ACE dataset, we considered for a target event the annotations of other events that entail it
