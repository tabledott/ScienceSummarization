an NP partition.
    Below we describe some commonly used coreference clustering algorithms.
    Despite their simplicity, closest-first clustering (Soon et al., 2001) and best-first clustering (Ng and Cardie, 2002c) are arguably the most widely used coreference clustering algorithms.
    The closest-first clustering algorithm selects as the antecedent for an NP, NPk, the closest preceding noun phrase that is classified as coreferent with it.4 However, if no such preceding noun phrase exists, no antecedent is selected for NPk.
    The best-first clustering algorithm aims to improve the precision of closest-first clustering, specifically by selecting as the antecedent of NPk the most probable preceding NP that is classified as coreferent with it.
    One criticism of the closest-first and best-first clustering algorithms is that they are too greedy.
    In particular, clusters are formed based on a small subset of the pairwise decisions made by the model.
    Moreover, positive pairwise decisions are unjustifi
