 constructions are not concentrated around any one present participle but rather distributed randomly among a large population.
    If those expectations are true then a frequency-modeling mechanism like the one being developed for adjuncts ought to prevent the mistaken copula from doing any harm.
    In that case it might be worthwhile to admit &amp;quot;is V-ing&amp;quot;, where V is known to be a (possibly ambiguous) verb root, as a verb, independent of the Case Filter mechanism.
