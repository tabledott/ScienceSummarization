e strong assumption that a token tz E T only depends on sz E S, ignoring the context around the token, which could be utilised to help in resolving ambiguity.
    Statistical machine translation (SMT) has been proposed as a means of context-sensitive text normalisation, by treating the ill-formed text as the source language, and the standard form as the target language.
    For example, Aw et al. (2006) propose a phrase-level SMT SMS normalisation method with bootstrapped phrase alignments.
    SMT approaches tend to suffer from a critical lack of training data, however.
    It is labor intensive to construct an annotated corpus to sufficiently cover ill-formed words and context-appropriate corrections.
    Furthermore, it is hard to harness SMT for the lexical normalisation problem, as even if phrase-level re-ordering is suppressed by constraints on phrase segmentation, word-level re-orderings within a phrase are still prevalent.
    Some researchers have also formulated text normalisation as a speech recogn
