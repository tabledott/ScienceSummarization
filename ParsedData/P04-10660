  Improving IBM Word Alignment Model 1
  
    We investigate a number of simple methods for improving the word-alignment accuracy of IBM Model 1.
    We demonstrate reduction in alignment error rate of approximately 30% resulting from (1) giving extra weight to the probability of alignment to the null word, (2) smoothing probability estimates for rare words, and (3) using a simple heuristic estimation method to initialize, or replace, EM training of model parameters.
  
  
    IBM Model 1 (Brown et al., 1993a) is a wordalignment model that is widely used in working with parallel bilingual corpora.
    It was originally developed to provide reasonable initial parameter estimates for more complex word-alignment models, but it has subsequently found a host of additional uses.
    Among the applications of Model 1 are segmenting long sentences into subsentental units for improved word alignment (Nevado et al., 2003), extracting parallel sentences from comparable corpora (Munteanu et al., 2004), bilingual sentenc
