ource and target languages to the respective sides of a probabilistic SCFG it is possible to describe translation as the process of parsing the source sentence, which induces a parallel tree structure and translation in the target language (Chiang, 2007).
    Figure 1 shows an example derivation for Japanese to English translation using an SCFG.
    For efficiency reasons we only consider binary or ternary branching rules and don&#8217;t allow rules to mix terminals and nonterminals.
    This allows our sampler to more efficiently explore the space of grammars (Section 4.2), however more expressive grammars would be a straightforward extension of our model.
  
  
    Most machine translation systems adopt the approach of Koehn et al. (2003) for &#8216;training&#8217; a phrase-based translation model.2 This method starts with a word-alignment, usually the latent state of an unsupervised word-based aligner such &#8658; hJohn-ga X4 X5, John X5 X4i &#8658; hJohn-ga ringo-o X5, John X5 an applei &#8658; hJohn-ga r
