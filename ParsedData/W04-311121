the treebanking guidelines are relatively stable (once they were adjusted for the biomedical domain as described in Section 3), while the entity definitions can require a significant period of study before stabilizing, and with the parallel treatment the treebanking can proceed without waiting for the entity annotation.
    However, this does mean that to produce the desired integrated annotation, the entity and treebanking annotations need to be merged into one representation.
    The consideration of the issues described in Section 3 has been carried out for the purpose of allowing this integration of the treebanking and entity annotation.
    This has been completed for some pilot documents, but the full merging remains to be integrated into the workflow system.
    Until recently (Feb. 10), the part-of-speech annotation was done by hand-correcting the results of tagging the data with a part-of-speech tagger trained on a modified form of the Penn Treebank.6 The tagger is a maximumentropy model utilizing th
