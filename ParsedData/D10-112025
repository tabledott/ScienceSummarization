rea of future research.
    Finally, we note that our model exhibits low variance for most languages.
    This result attests to how the expectation constraints consistently guide inference toward high-accuracy areas of the search space.
    Ablation Analysis Our next experiment seeks to understand the relative importance of the various universal rules from Table 1.
    We study how accuracy is affected when each of the rules is removed one at a time for English and Spanish.
    Table 5 lists the rules with the greatest impact on performance when removed.
    We note the high overlap between the most significant rules for English and Spanish.
    We also observe that the relationship between a rule&#8217;s frequency and its importance for high accuracy is not straightforward.
    For example, the &#8220;Preposition &#8594; Noun&#8221; rule, whose removal degrades accuracy the most for both English and Spanish, is not the most frequent rule in either language.
    This result suggests that some rules are harde
