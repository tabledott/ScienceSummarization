larity remains quite high.
    For example, if we change the tense of the verb to deliver (Figure 2) in delivered, the [VP [V delivers] [NP]] subtree will be transformed in [VP [VBD delivered] [NP]], where the NP is unchanged.
    Thus, the similarity with the previous structure will be quite high as: (1) the NP with all sub-parts will be matched and (2) the small difference will not highly affect the kernel norm and consequently the final score.
    The above property also holds for the SCF structures.
    For example, in Figure 3, KPAK (0(Fflush), 0(Fbuckle)) is quite high as the two verbs have the same syntactic realization of their arguments.
    In general, flat features do not possess this conservative property.
    For example, the Parse Tree Path is very sensible to small changes of parse-trees, e.g. two predicates, expressed in different tenses, generate two different Path features.
    Second, some information contained in the standard features is embedded in PAF: Phrase Type, Predicate Word and Hea
