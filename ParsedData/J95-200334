    The next example illustrates that this effect is 16 These rules and constraints have also been used by others as the basis for pronoun resolution algorithms based on centering.
    The earliest such attempt (Brennen, Friedman, and Pollard 1987) used the uniqueness and locality of Cb constraints and ranked the Cf by grammatical role; it employed a variant of Rule 2 in which the stated preferences on transitions were restricted to transitions between individual pairs of utterances (rather than the longer sequences in the original formulation) and used to decide between possible interpretations of pronouns.
    Section 9 provides references to other work on centering algorithms. independent of the grammatical position of the Cb and also demonstrates that Rule 1 operates independently of the type of centering transition.
    Without utterance (16c), this sequence, like the se
