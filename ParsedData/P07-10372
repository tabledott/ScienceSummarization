ct lexical descriptions into both the target side of the phrase translation table and the target language model.
    Crucially, the kind of lexical descriptions that we employ are those that are commonly devised within lexicon-driven approaches to linguistic syntax, e.g.
    Lexicalized Tree-Adjoining Grammar (Joshi &amp; Schabes, 1992; Bangalore &amp; Joshi, 1999) and Combinary Categorial Grammar (Steedman, 2000).
    In these linguistic approaches, it is assumed that the grammar consists of a very rich lexicon and a tiny, impoverished1 set of combinatory operators that assemble lexical entries together into parse-trees.
    The lexical entries consist of syntactic constructs (&#8216;supertags&#8217;) that describe information such as the POS tag of the word, its subcategorization information and the hierarchy of phrase categories that the word projects upwards.
    In this work we employ the lexical entries but exchange the algebraic combinatory operators with the more robust and efficient supertagging appr
