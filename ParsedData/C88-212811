to arbitrary numbers of cousequents through repeated application when used with a grammar formalism with an infinite [structured] nonterminal domain.
  The solution proposed in that paper is to restrict the information passed from the predicting to the pre- dicted item, corresponding to the rule [i,A 4- BC~ ?..Cry,j] B .--* Da .?.
  Dn 0 = mgu(B~,  B) [j, BO ~ DIO" DuO,j] where B~ is a aonterminal with a bounded subset of the information of B.
  This inference rule is the one actually used in the implemented system.
  The reader is directed to the earlier paper for further discussion.
  new lemma and existing ones in the table may be deduced?
  These are themselves assigned priorities, and so forth.
  The technique chosen for implementing this facet of the process is the use of an agenda struc- tured as a priority queue to store the lemmas that have not yet been added to the table.
  Finally, depending on the kind of language processing we are inter- ested in, the premises of the problem and the types of goal
