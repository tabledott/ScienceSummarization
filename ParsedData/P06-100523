atibility, and path coreference information.
    We refer to these features as our &#8220;probabilistic features&#8221; (Prob.
    Features) and run experiments using the full system trained and tested with each absent, in turn (Table 5).
    We have 29 features in total, including measures of candidate distance, frequency, grammatical role, and different kinds of parallelism between the pronoun and the candidate noun.
    Several reliable features are used as hard constraints, removing candidates before consideration by the scoring algorithm.
    All of the parsing, noun-phrase identification, and named-entity recognition are done automatically with Minipar.
    Candidate antecedents are considered in the current and previous sentence only.
    We use SVMUght (Joachims, 1999) to learn a linear-kernel classifier on pairwise examples in the training set.
    When resolving pronouns, we select the candidate with the farthest positive distance from the SVM classification hyperplane.
    Our training set is the a
