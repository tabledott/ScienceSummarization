 is the argument slot, ha is the head word of the argument, and l encodes whether the dependency is non-local.
    For example, the dependency encoding company as the object of bought (as in IBM bought the company) is represented as follows: The subscripts on the lexical items indicate sentence position, and the final field (&#8722;) indicates that the dependency is a local dependency.
    Head and dependency information is represented on the lexical categories, and dependencies are created during a derivation as argument slots are filled.
    Long-range dependencies are created by passing head information from one category to another using unification.
    For example, the expanded category for the control verb persuade is: The head of the infinitival complement&#8217;s subject is identified with the head of the object, using the variable X. Unification then passes the head of the object to the subject of the infinitival, as in standard unification-based accounts of control.
