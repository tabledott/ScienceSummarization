    Interesting algorithms are presented in (Pang et al., 2003; Barzilay and Lee, 2003).
    They learn linear patterns within similar contexts represented as finite state automata.
    Three classes of syntactic template learning approaches are presented in the literature: learning ofpredicate argument templates (Yangarber et al., 2000), learning of syntactic chains (Lin and Pantel, 2001) and learning of sub-trees (Sudo et al., 2003).
    The last approach is the most general with respect to the template form.
    However, its processing time increases exponentially with the size of the templates.
    As a conclusion, state of the art approaches still learn templates of limited form and size, thus restricting generality of the learning process.
  
  
    Motivated by prior experience, we identify two major goals for scaling Web-based acquisition of entailment relations: (a) Covering the broadest possible range of meanings, while requiring minimal input and (b) Keeping template structures as general as pos
