			The parsing time (pars.)
			are expressed in milliseconds per sentence and the training (train.)
			time in hours.
			The last row shows the times for 8 threads on a 4 core CPU with Hyper-threading.
			For these experiment, we set the clock speed to 3.46 Ghz in order to have the same clock speed for all experiments.
	
	
			ThresholdFor non-projective parsing, we use the NonProjective Approximation Algorithm of McDon ald and Pereira (2006).
			The algorithm rearranges edges in a dependency tree when they improve the score.
			Bohnet (2009) extended the algorithm by a threshold which bias
