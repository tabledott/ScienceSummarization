ses from each system may be used to improve the quality of cat sat the mat cat sitting on the mat hat on a mat the combination output (Sim et al., 2007).
    When using -best lists from each system, the words may be assigned a different score based on the rank of the hypothesis.
    In (Rosti et al., 2007), simple score was assigned to the word coming from the thbest hypothesis.
    Due to the computational burden of the TER alignment, only-best hypotheses were considered as possible skeletons, and hypotheses per system were aligned.
    Similar approach to estimate word posteriors is adopted in this work.
    System weights may be used to assign a system specific confidence on each word in the network.
    The weights may be based on the systems&#8217; relative performance on a separate development set or they may be automatically tuned to optimize some evaluation metric on the development set.
    In (Rosti et al., 2007), the total confidence of the th best confusion network hypothesis , including NULL word
