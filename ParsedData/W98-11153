tical approach to language processing and the use of probabilistic context-free grammars (PCFGs) has suggested using the PCFG probabilities to create a FOM.
    Bobrow (1990) and Chitrao and Grishman (1990) introduced best-first PCFG parsing, the approach taken here.
    Subsequent work has suggested different FOMs built from PCFG probabilities (Miller and Fox.
    1994: Kochman and Kupin.
    1991: N1agerman and Marcus, 1991).
    Probably the most extensive comparison of possible metrics for best-first PCFG parsing is that of Caraballo and Charniak (henceforth C&amp;C) (Forthcoming).
    They consider a large number of FOMs, and view them as approximations of some &amp;quot;ideal&amp;quot; (but only computable after the fact) FOM.
    Of these they recommend one as the best of the lot.
    In this paper we basically adopt both their framework and their recommended FOM.
    The next section describes their work in more detail, Besides C&amp;C the work that is most directly comparable to ours is that of Goodm
