			4.2 Sequence Models Over Supertags.
			Our first Dutch-English experiment seeks to estab lish what effect sequence models have on machinetranslation.
			We show that supertags improve trans lation quality.
			Together with Shen et al (2006) it is one of the first results to confirm the potential of the factored model.

			The effect of sequence models on Dutch-EnglishBLEU score.
			Factors are (w)ords, (p)os tags, (c)cg su pertags on the source s or the target tTable 1 shows that sequence models over CCG su pertags in the target (model sw, twc) improves over the baseline (model sw, tw) which has no supertags.
			Supertag sequence models also outperform models which apply POS tag sequence models (sw, twp) and, interestingly do just as well as models which
