d).
    We hypothesized that the problem could be that the choice of constant &#945; is inappropriate.
    So we tried varying &#945; instead of computing it using absolute discounting, but found the alternatives to perform worse.
    These results suggest that Gaussian prior is a safer prior non-regularized, Gaussian variance = X sets variance to be X. Gaussian cut 7 refers to the Threshold Cut method, Gaussian divide count refers to the Divide Count method, Gaussian bin N refers to the Bin-Based method with bin size equals N, as described in 2.1.1 to use in practice.
    State transition features and unsupported features.
    We summarize the comparison of different state transition models using or not using unsupported features in Table 4.
    The first column describes the four different state transition models, the second column contains the overall word accuracy of these models using only support features, and the third column contains the result of using all features, including unsupported features.
