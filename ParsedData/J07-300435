    Using the verb form itself and the surrounding context, we have attempted to correct such errors automatically.
    In 7% of all sentences, our algorithm modifies at least one POS tag.

    Although not strictly coming under the heading of noise, quotation marks cause a number of problems for the translation algorithm.
    Although it is tempting to analyze them similarly to parentheticals, quotations often span sentence boundaries, and consequently quotation marks appear to be unbalanced at the sentence level.
    We therefore decided to eliminate them during the preprocessing stage.
    Unlike a hand-written grammar, the grammar that is
