een given to the reasons for the analysis failure.
    A long sentence, particularly in Japanese, very often contains conjunctive structures.
    These may be either conjunctive noun phrases or conjunctive predicative clauses.
    Among the latter, those made by the renyoh forms of predicates (the ending forms that mean connection to another right predicate) are called renyoh chuushi-ho (see example sentence (iv) of Table 1).
    A renyoh chuushi-ho appears in an embedded sentence to modify nouns and is also used to connect two or more sentences.
    This form is used frequently in Japanese and is a major cause of structural ambiguity.
    Many major sentential components are omitted in the posterior part of renyoh chuushi expressions, thus complicating the analysis.
    For the successful analysis of long sentences, these conjunctive phrases and clauses, including renyoh chuushi-ho, must be recognized correctly.
    Nevertheless, most work in this area (e.g., Dahl and McCord 1983; Fong and Berwick 1985; Hirs
