eters: This is the probability of sister-adjoining y between the ith and i + 1th children of rl (as before, allowing for two imaginary children beyond the leftmost and rightmost children).
    Since multiple modifier trees can adjoin at the same location, Psa(-Y) is also conditioned on a flag f which indicates whether y is the first modifier tree (i.e., the one closest to the head) to adjoin at that location.
    The probability of a derivation can then be expressed as a product of the probabilities of address i has address i &#8226; j. the individual operations of the derivation.
    Thus the probability of the example derivation of Figure 1 would be where a(i) is the node of a with address i.
    We want to obtain a maximum-likelihood estimate of these parameters, but cannot estimate them directly from the Treebank, because the sample space of PTAG is the space of TAG derivations, not the derived trees that are found in the Treebank.
    One approach, taken in (Hwa, 1998), is to choose some grammar general
