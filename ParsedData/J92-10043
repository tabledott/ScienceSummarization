essage.
    In fact, to be truly effective, many potential applications demand that the system carry on a dialog with the user, using its knowledge base and information gleaned from previous sentences to achieve proper response generation.
    Current advances in research and development of spoken language systems2 can be found, for example, in the proceedings of the DARPA speech and natural language workshops, as well as in publications from participants of the ESPRIT SUNDIAL project.
    Representative systems are described in Boisen et al. (1989), De Mattia and Giachin (1989), Niedermair (1989), Niemann (1990), and Young (1989).
    A spoken language system relies on its natural language component to provide the meaning representation of a given sentence.
    Ideally, this component should also be useful for providing powerful constraints to the recognizer component in terms of permissible syntactic and semantic structures, given the limited domain.
    If it is to be useful for constraint, however, it mus
