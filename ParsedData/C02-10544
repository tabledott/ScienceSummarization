indicates the decision hyperplaneand two parallel dotted lines indicate the margin be tween positive and negative examples.
			Since such aseparating hyperplane may not exist, a positive pa rameter S is introduced to allow misclassifications.

			1.2 SVM-based NE recognition.
			As far as we know, the first SVM-based NE system was proposed by Yamada et al (2001) for Japanese.His system is an extension of Kudo?s chunking sys tem (Kudo and Matsumoto, 2001) that gave the best performance at CoNLL-2000 shared tasks.
			In theirsystem, every word in a sentence is classified sequentially from the beginning or the end of a sen tence.
			However, since Yamada has not compared it with other methods under the same conditions, it is not clear whether his NE system is better or not.
			Here, we show that our SVM-based NE system ismore accurate than conventional systems.
			Our sys tem uses the Viterbi search (Allen, 1995) instead of sequential determination.For training, we use ?CRL data?, which was
