equency collocations.
    The statistics we used do not produce good results when the frequencies are low.
    This shows up clearly when our evaluation results on the first two experiments are compared.
    Running the collocation set C2 over the database DB1 produced our worst results, and this can be attributed to the low frequency in DBI of many collocations in C2.
    Recall that C2 was extracted from a different (and larger) corpus from DBI.
    This problem is due not only to the frequencies of the source collocations or of the words involved but also to the frequencies of their &amp;quot;official&amp;quot; translations.
    Indeed, while most collocations exhibit unique senses in a given domain, sometimes a source collocation appearing multiple times in the corpus is not consistently translated into the same target collocation in the database.
    This sampling problem, which generally affects all statistical approaches, was not addressed in the paper.
    We reduced the effects of low frequencies by
