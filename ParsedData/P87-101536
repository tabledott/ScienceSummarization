ore general definition of LCFRS's containing formalisms whose tree sets have path sets that are themselves LCFRL's (as in the case of the restricted indexed grammars, and the hierarchy defined by Weir).
    LCFRS's have only been loosely defined in this paper; we have yet to provide a complete set of formal properties associated with members of this class.
    In this paper, our goal has been to use the notion of LCFRS's to classify grammatical systems on the basis of their strong generative capacity.
    In considering this aspect of a formalism, we hope to better understand the relationship between the structural descriptions generated by the grammars of a formalism, and the properties of semilinearity and polynomial recognizability.
