answer keys.
    An item was mislabeled if it matched against the answer keys but was extracted as the wrong type of object (e.g., if a victim was extracted as a perpetrator).
    An item was a duplicate if it was coreferent with an item in the answer keys.
    Correct items extracted more than once were scored as duplicates, as well as correct but underspecified extractions such as &amp;quot;Kennedy&amp;quot; instead of &amp;quot;John F. Kennedy&amp;quot;.7 An item was spurious if it did not appear in the answer keys.
    All items extracted from irrelevant texts were spurious.
    Finally, items in the answer keys that were not extracted were counted as missing.
    Correct + missing equals the total number of items in the answer keys.8 Table 1 shows the results8 for AutoSlog-TS' extraction patterns, and Table 2 shows the results for the case frames.
    We computed Recall (R) as correct I (correct + missing), and Precision (P) as (correct duplicate) I (correct + duplicate + mislabeled + spurious).
