20;soft&#8221; match between feature values will sharpen the granularity of the kernel and enhance its modeling power.
    Further investigation is also needed to understand why the sparse kernel performs worse than the contiguous kernel.
    These results contradict those given in Zelenko et al. (2003), where the sparse kernel achieves 2-3% better F1 performance than the contiguous kernel.
    It is worthwhile to characterize relation types that are better captured by the sparse kernel, and to determine when using the sparse kernel is worth the increased computational burden.
