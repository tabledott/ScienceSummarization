age-independent.
    Both English-French and English-German data were processed using the same parameters.
    If necessary, it is possible to fit the six parameters in the model with language-specific values, though, thus far, we have not found it necessary (or even helpful) to do so.
    We have examined a number of variations.
    In particular, we found that it is better to use characters rather than words in counting sentence length.
    Apparently, the performance is better with characters because there is less variability in the ratios of sentence lengths so measured.
    Using words as units increases the error rate by half, from 4.2% to 6.5%.
    In the future, we would hope to extend the method to make use of lexical constraints.
    However, it is remarkable just how well we can do without such constraints.
    We might advocate the simple character length alignment procedure as a useful first pass, even to those who advocate the use of lexical constraints.
    The character length procedure might
