x trees can be processed in time linear on the size of the corpus and, more importantly, they do not restrict the length of substrings.
    We then test the patterns learned by our system on new unseen questions from the TREC-10 set and evaluate their results to determine the precision of the patterns.
  
  
    We describe the pattern-learning algorithm with an example.
    A table of patterns is constructed for each individual question type by the following procedure (Algorithm 1).
    (1756&#8211;1791)&#8221;, which the suffix tree would extract as one of the outputs along with the score of 3.
    7.
    Pass each phrase in the suffix tree through a filter to retain only those phrases that contain both the question and the answer term.
    For the example, we extract only those phrases from the suffix tree that contain the words &#8220;Mozart&#8221; and &#8220;1756&#8221;.
    8.
    Replace the word for the question term by the tag &#8220;&lt;NAME&gt;&#8221; and the word for the answer term by the term &#
