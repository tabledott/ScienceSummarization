 of news sources manually annotated for subjectivity.
    Although the corpus was originally annotated at clause and phrase level, we use the sentence-level annotations associated with the dataset (Wiebe and Riloff, 2005).
    From the total of 9,700 sentences in this corpus, 55% of the sentences are labeled as subjective while the rest are objective.
    After the automatic translation of the corpus and the projection of the annotations, we obtain a large corpus of 9,700 subjectivity-annotated sentences in the target language, which can be used to train a subjectivity classifier.
    In the second experiment, we assume that the only resources available are a tool for subjectivity annotation in the source language and a collection of raw texts, also in the source language.
    The source language text is automatically annotated for subjectivity and then translated into the target language.
    In this way, we produce a subjectivity annotated corpus that we can use to train a subjectivity annotation tool for t
