   If we start with the rule VP &#8594; VBZ NP PP PP, it will be broken into several stages, each a binary or unary rule, which conceptually represent a head-outward generation of the right hand size, as shown in figure 1.
    The bottom layer will be a unary over the head declaring the goal: (VP: [VBZ]) &#8594; VBZ.
    The square brackets indicate that the VBZ is the head, while the angle brackets (X) indicates that the symbol (X) is an intermediate symbol (equivalently, an active or incomplete state).
    The next layer up will generate the first rightward sibling of the head child: (VP: [VBZ]... NP) &#8594; (VP: [VBZ]) NP.
    Next, the PP is generated: (VP: [VBZ]... PP) &#8594; (VP: [VBZ]... NP) PP.
    We would then branch off left siblings if there were any.7 Finally, we have another unary to finish the VP.
    Note that while it is convenient to think of this as a head-outward process, these are just PCFG rewrites, and so the actual scores attached to each rule will correspond to a downward generation
