moothing (Brown et al, 1992; Dagan et al, 1999) is an intuitivelyappealing approach to this problem where prob abilities of unseen co-occurrences are estimatedfrom probabilities of seen co-occurrences of dis tributionally similar events.Other potential applications apply the hy pothesised relationship (Harris, 1968) betweendistributional similarity and semantic similar ity; i.e., similarity in the meaning of words can be predicted from their distributional similarity.One advantage of automatically generated the sauruses (Grefenstette, 1994; Lin, 1998; Curranand Moens, 2002) over large-scale manually cre ated thesauruses such as WordNet (Fellbaum,1998) is that they might be tailored to a partic ular genre or domain.However, due to the lack of a tight defini tion for the concept of distributional similarity and the broad range of potential applications, alarge number of measures of distributional similarity have been proposed or adopted (see Section 2).
