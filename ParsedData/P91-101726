orrect translation should be 'state', as determined by the second relation.
    This example suggests that while ordering the involved relations (or using any other weighting mechanism) it may be necessary to give different weights to the different types of syntactic relations.
    For instance, it seems reasonable that the object of a noun should receive greater weight in selecting the noun's sense than the verb for which this noun serves as a complement.
    Confusing senses.
    In another example, the Hebrew word `qatann', which two of its meanings are 'small' and 'young', modified the word `sikkuy', which means 'prospect' or 'chance'.
    In this context, the correct sense is necessarily 'small'.
    However, the relation that was observed in the corpus was 'young prospect', relating to the human sense of 'prospect' which appeared in sport articles (a promising young person).
    This borrowed sense of 'prospect' is necessarily inappropriate, since in Hebrew it is represented by the equivalent of 'hope'
