rnations provide a means of reducing redundancy in the lexicon since the alternating scFs need not be enumerated for each individual verb if a marker is used to specify which verbs the alternation applies to.
    Alternations also provide a means of generalizing patterns of behaviour over groups of verbs, typically the group members are semantically related.
    Levin (1993) provides a classification of over 3000 verbs according to their participation in alternations involving NP and PP constituents.
    Levin's classification is not intended to be exhaustive.
    Automatic identification of alternations would be a useful tool for extending the classification with new participants.
    Levin's taxonomy might also be used alongside observed behaviour, to predict unseen behaviour.
    Levin's classification has been extended by other NLP researchers (Dorr and Jones, 1996; Dang et al., 1998).
    Dang et al. (1998) modify it by adding new classes which remove the overlap between classes from the original scheme.
