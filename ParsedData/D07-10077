			choice for SMTTo the best of our knowledge, there has been no pre vious attempt at integrating a state-of-the-art WSD system for fully phrasal multi-word lexical choiceinto phrase-based SMT, with evaluation of the re sulting system on a translation task.
			While there are many evaluations of WSD quality, in particular the Senseval series of shared tasks (Kilgarriff and Rosenzweig (1999), Kilgarriff (2001), Mihalcea et al.
			(2004)), very little work has been done to addressthe actual integration of WSD in realistic SMT ap plications.
			To fully integrate WSD into phrase-based SMT, it is necessary to perform lexical disambiguation on multi-word phrasal lexical units; in contrast, the model reported in Cabezas and Resnik (2005)can only perform lexical disambiguation on sin gle words.
			Like the model proposed in this paper,Cabezas and Resnik attempted to integrate phras
