 of entities poses additional challenges in grid construction for Chinese where word boundaries are not denoted orthographically (by space).
    Similar challenges arise in German, a language with a large number of inflected forms and productive derivational processes (e.g., compounding) not indicated by orthography.
    In the discourse literature, entity-based theories are primarily applied at the level of local coherence, while relational models, such as Rhetorical Structure Theory (Mann and Thomson 1988; Marcu 2000), are used to model the global structure of discourse.
    We plan to investigate how to combine the two for improved prediction on both local and global levels, with the ultimate goal of handling longer texts.
