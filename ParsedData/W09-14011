been the case in bio-TM.
    Examples include the TREC Genomics track (Hersh et al., 2007), JNLPBA (Kim et al., 2004), LLL (N&#180;edellec, 2005), and BioCreative (Hirschman et al., 2007).
    While the first two addressed bio-IR (information retrieval) and bio-NER (named entity recognition), respectively, the last two focused on bio-IE (information extraction), seeking relations between bio-molecules.
    With the emergence of NER systems with performance capable of supporting practical applications, the recent interest of the bio-TM community is shifting toward IE.
    Similarly to LLL and BioCreative, the BioNLP&#8217;09 Shared Task (the BioNLP task, hereafter) also addresses bio-IE, but takes a definitive step further toward finer-grained IE.
    While LLL and BioCreative focus on a rather simple representation of relations of bio-molecules, i.e. protein-protein interactions (PPI), the BioNLP task concerns the detailed behavior of bio-molecules, characterized as bio-molecular events (bio-events).
