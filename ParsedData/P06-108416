    An emission is denoted in this figure by its symbol, its state index, directed edges from its previous emissions, and directed edges to its next emissions.
    In order to meet the condition of Baum-Eagon inequality (Baum, 1972) that the polynomial P(O|&#181;) &#8211; which represents the probability of an observed sequence O given a model &#181; &#8211; be homogeneous, we must add a sequence of special EOS (end of sentence) symbols at the end of each path up to the last vector, so that all the paths reach the same length.
    The above text representation can be used to model multi-word expressions (MWEs).
    Consider the Hebrew sentence: hw' `wrk dyn gdwl, which can be interpreted as composed of 3 units (he lawyer great / he is a great lawyer) or as 4 units (he edits law big / he is editing an important legal decision).
