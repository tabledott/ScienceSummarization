e grammar using inside probability (unnormalized) as a figure of merit outperforms both a context-free grammar and a context-dependent grammar.
    Kochman and Kupin (1991) propose a figure of merit closely related to our prefix estimate.
    They do not actually incorporate this figure into a best-first parser.
    Magerman and Marcus (1991) use the geometric mean to compute a figure of merit that is independent of constituent length.
    Magerman and Weir (1992) use a similar model with a different parsing algorithm.
  
  
    We have presented and evaluated several figures of merit for best-first parsing.
    The best performer according to all of our measures was the parser using the boundary trigram estimate as a figure of merit, and this result holds for two different grammars.
    This figure has the additional advantage that it can be easily incorporated into existing best-first parsers using a figure of merit based on inside probability.
