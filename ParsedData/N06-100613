 pattern language.
    The nodes in the final graph are then annotated with their associated word, part-of-speech (given by the parser), lemma (given by a finite-state transducer described by Minnen et al. (2001)) and named-entity tag.
    The purpose of the second phase is to find a good partial alignment between the typed dependency graphs representing the hypothesis and the text.
    An alignment consists of a mapping from each node (word) in the hypothesis graph to a single node in the text graph, or to null.3 Figure 1 gives the alignment for ID 971.
    The space of alignments is large: there are O((m + 1)') possible alignments for a hypothesis graph with n nodes and a text graph with m nodes.
    We define a measure of alignment quality, and a procedure for identifying high scoring alignments.
    We choose a locally decomposable scoring function, such that the score of an alignment is the sum of the local node and edge alignment scores.
    Unfortunately, there is no polynomial time algorithm for findi
