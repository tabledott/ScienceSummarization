hich the effect of hand tuning the tag dictionary was quantified as a combination of labeled and unlabeled data.
    The experiments in (Merialdo, 1994; Elworthy,1994) showed that only in very specific cases HMMs were effective in combining labeled and unlabeled data.
    However, (Brill, 1997) showed that aggressively using tag dictionaries extracted from labeled data could be used to bootstrap an unsupervised POS tagger with high accuracy (approx 95% on WSJ data).
    We exploit this approach of using tag dictionaries in our method as well (see Section 3.2 for more details).
    It is important to point out that, before attacking the problem of parsing using similar machine learning techniques, we face a representational problem which makes it difficult to define the notion of tag dictionary for a statistical parser.
    The problem we face in parsing is more complex than assigning a small fixed set of labels to examples.
    If the parser is to be generally applicable, it has to produce a fairly complex &#
