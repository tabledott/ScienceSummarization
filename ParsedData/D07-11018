 Closed structures: For each span from s to e and each token m ? [s . . .
			e], the algorithm maintains an entry [s, e, m]C associated to a partial dependency tree rooted at s in which m is the last modifier of s. The algorithm chooses the optimal dependency label l and grand-child cmo in O(nL), using parameters wlmo.
			Similarentries [e, s, m]C are maintained for dependen cies headed at e. We implemented two variants of the algorithm.The first forces the root token to participate in exactly one dependency.
			The second allows many dependencies involving the root token.
			For the singleroot case, it is necessary to treat the root token dif ferently than other tokens.
			In the experiments, weused the single-root variant if sentences in the train ing set satisfy this property.
			Otherwise we used the multi-root variant.
			2.2 Features.
			The first-order features ?1(x, h, m) are the exactsame implementation as in previous CoNLL sys tem (Carreras et al, 2006).
			In turn, those featureswere inspired by su
