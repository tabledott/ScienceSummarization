e n-tuples of strings, then the concatenation of X and Y, written X &#8226; Y or simply XY, is defined by That is, the n-way concatenation of two string-tuples is the tuple of strings formed by string concatenation of corresponding elements.
    The length of a string-tuple I XI can be defined in terms of the lengths of its component strings: This has the expected property that IX &#8226; Yl = I + I Yl, even if the elements of X or of Y are of different lengths.
    Just as the empty string c is the identity for simple string concatenation, the n-tuple all of whose elements are &#8364; is the identity for n-way concatenation, and the length of such a tuple is zero.
    With these definitions in hand, it is immediately possible to construct families of string relations that parallel the usual classes of formal languages.
    Recall, for example, the usual recursive definition of a regular language over an alphabet E (superscript i denotes concatenation repeated i times, according to the usual convention, and w
