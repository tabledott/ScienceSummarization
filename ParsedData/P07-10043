SMT system to a new type of text.
    Say a system trained on newswire is used to translate weblog texts.
    The proposed method adapts the trained models to the style and domain of the new input.
  
  
    The SMT system we applied in our experiments is PORTAGE.
    This is a state-of-the-art phrase-based translation system which has been made available to Canadian universities for research and education iteration and added to the training data.
    These sepurposes.
    We provide a basic description here; for a lected sentence pairs are replaced in each iteration, detailed description see (Ueffing et al., 2007). and only the original bilingual training data, L, is The models (or features) which are employed by kept fixed throughout the algorithm.
    The process the decoder are: (a) one or several phrase table(s), of generating sentence pairs, selecting a subset of which model the translation directionp(s  |t), (b) one good sentence pairs, and updating the model is conor several n-gram language model(s) t
