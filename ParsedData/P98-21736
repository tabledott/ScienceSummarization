e a new possibility, at first sight paradoxical: that of a symbolic authoring system in which the current knowledge base is presented through a natural language text generated by the system.
    This kills two birds with one stone: the source is still a knowledge base, not a text, so no problem of analysis arises; but this source is presented to the author in natural language, through what we will call a feedback text.
    As we shall see, the feedback text has some special features which allow the author to edit the knowledge base as well as viewing its contents.
    We have called this editing method `WYSIWYM', or 'What You See Is What You Meant': a natural language text ('what you see') presents a knowledge base that the author has built by purely semantic decisions (' what you meant'). feedback texts to the author.
    The feedback texts will include mouse-sensitive 'anchors' allowing the author to make semantic decisions, e.g. by selecting options from pop-up menus.
    The WYSIWYM system allows a domain
