tags in our data tend to occur relative to the middle word of the tweet.
    We see that Twitter-specific tags have strong positional preferences: at-mentions (@) and Twitter discourse markers (&#8212;) tend to occur towards the beginning of messages, whereas URLs (U), emoticons (E), and categorizing hashtags (#) tend to occur near the end.
  
  
    Our tagger is a conditional random field (CRF; Lafferty et al., 2001), enabling the incorporation of arbitrary local features in a log-linear model.
    Our base features include: a feature for each word type, a set of features that check whether the word contains digits or hyphens, suffix features up to length 3, and features looking at capitalization patterns in the word.
    We then added features that leverage domainspecific properties of our data, unlabeled in-domain data, and external linguistic resources.
    TWOxTH: Twitter orthography.
    We have features for several regular expression-style rules that detect at-mentions, hashtags, and URLs.
