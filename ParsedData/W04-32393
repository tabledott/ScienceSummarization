;optimal&#8221; feature set for each task.
    Generally speaking, by using text processing systems, a text can be converted into a semi-structured text annotated with parts-of-speech, base-phrase information or syntactic relations.
    This information is useful in identifying opinions or modalities contained in the text.
    We think that it is more useful to propose a learning algorithm that can automatically capture relevant structural information observed in text, rather than to heuristically add this information as new features.
    From these points of view, this paper proposes a classification algorithm that captures sub-structures embedded in text.
    To simplify the problem, we first assume that a text to be classified is represented as a labeled ordered tree, which is a general data structure and a simple abstraction of text.
    Note that word sequence, base-phrase annotation, dependency tree and an XML document can be modeled as a labeled ordered tree.
    The algorithm proposed here has the fol
