e naive Bayes model.
    S is naturally modeled as a binomial variable, where &#964; is the parameter of S. S represents how likely it is that a sentence strongly conveys a perspective.
    We call this model the Latent Sentence Perspective Model (LSPM) because S is not directly observed.
    The graphical model representation of LSPM is shown in Figure 2.
    To use LSPM to identify the perspective of a new document D with unknown sentence perspectives S, we calculate posterior probabilities by summing out possible combinations of sentence perspective in the document and parameters.
    As before, we resort to MCMC methods to sample from the posterior distributions, given in Equations (5) and (6).
    As is often encountered in mixture models, there is an identifiability issue in LSPM.
    Because the values of S can be permuted without changing the likelihood function, the meanings of s0 and s1 are ambiguous.
    In Figure 3a, four &#952; values are used to represent the four possible combinations of docume
