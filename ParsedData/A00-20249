    Input to the system is a single document from any domain.
    In the first stage, extraction, key sentences in the article are identified, as in most current summarizers.
    In the second stage, cut and paste based generation, a sentence reduction module and a sentence combination module implement the operations we observed in human-written abstracts.
    The cut and paste based component receives as input not only the extracted key sentences, but also the original article.
    This component can be ported to other single-document summarizers to serve as the generation component, since most current summarizers extract key sentences - exactly what the extraction module in our system does.
    Other resources and tools in the summarization system include a corpus of articles and their humanwritten abstracts, the automatic decomposition program, a syntactic parser, a co-reference resolution system, the WordNet lexical database, and a largescale lexicon we combined from multiple resources.
