			Models describ- ing these types of dependencies are referred to as alignment models.
			In this section, we describe two models for word alignrnent in detail: ,.
			a mixture-based alignment model, which was introduced in (Brown et al, 1990); ? an HMM-based alignment model.
			In this paper, we address the question of how to define specific models for the alignment probabil- ities.
			The notational convention will be as fol- lows.
			We use the symbol Pr(.)
			to denote general 836 probability distributions with (nearly) no Sl)eeitic asSUml)tions.
			In contrast, for modcl-t)ased prol)-- ability distributions, we use the generic symbol v(.).

			Here, we describe the mixture-based alignment model in a fornmlation which is different fronl the original formulation ill (Brown el, a\[., 1990).
			We will ,is(: this model as reference tbr the IIMM- based alignments to lie 1)resented later.
			The model is based on a decomposition of the joint probabilit
