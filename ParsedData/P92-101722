ocabularies.
    As is well known, this raises both computational and data sparseness problems, so clustering of terminal symbols will be essential.
    Finally, this work does not address a central weakness of SCFGs, their inability to represent lexical influences on distribution except by a statistically and computationally impractical proliferation of nonterminal symbols.
    One might instead look into versions of the current algorithm for more lexically-oriented formalisms such as stochastic lexicalized tree-adjoining grammars (Schabes, 1992).
