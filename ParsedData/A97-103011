, this is what many commercially available name identification applications use (e.g., Hayes 1994).
    A reliable database provides both accuracy and efficiency, if fast look-up methods are incorporated.
    A database also has the potential to resolve structural ambiguity; for example, if IBM and Apple Computers are listed individually in the database but IBM and Apple Computers is not, it may indicate a conjunction of two distinct names.
