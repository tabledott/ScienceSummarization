 discourse semantics, the level of the dcu's (including the adjacency structures) plays the most central role: at this level the system defines how the semantic representation of a complex discourse constituent is constructed out of the semantic representations of its parts.
    The other levels of structure are also of some relevance, however: - The Discourse Unit establishes higher level semantic coherence.
    For instance, the semantics of different episodes of one story are integrated at this level.
    - The Topic provides a frame which determines the interpretation of many lexical items and descriptions.
    - The Speech Event provides a script which describes the conventional development of the discourse, and justifies assumptions about the purposesofdiscourse participants.
    - The Interaction specifies referents for indexicals like &amp;quot;I&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;you&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;here&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;now&amp;quot;.
