imating the parameters of a probabilistic model.
    One by one, pieces of the system that had been assiduously assembled by speech experts yielded to probabilistic modeling.
    Even the elaborate set of hand-tuned rules for segmenting the frequency bank outputs into phoneme-sized segments would be replaced with training (Bakis 1976; Bahl et al. 1978).
    By the summer of 1977, performance had reached 95% correct by sentence and 99.4% correct by word, a considerable improvement over the same system with hand-tuned segmentation rules (73% by sentence and 95% by word).
    Progress in speech recognition at Yorktown and almost everywhere else as well has continued along the lines drawn in these early experiments.
    As computers increased in power, ever greater tracts of the heuristic wasteland opened up for colonization by probabilistic models.
    As greater quantities of recorded data became available, these areas were tamed by automatic training techniques.
