    Turney uses the relational space to implement tasks such as solving analogies and harvesting instances of relations.
    Although they are not explicitly expressed in these terms, relation extraction algorithms (Hearst 1992, 1998; Girju, Badulescu, and Moldovan 2006; Pantel and Pennacchiotti 2006) also rely on relational similarity, and focus on learning one relation type at a time (e.g., finding parts).
    Although semantic similarity, either attributional or relational, has the lion&#8217;s share in DSMs, similarity is not the only aspect of meaning that is addressed by distributional approaches.
    For instance, the notion of property plays a key role in cognitive science and linguistics, which both typically represent con
