o generate 128 dimensional vectors (Turney and Littman 2005), whereas LRA uses a dynamically generated set of 4,000 patterns, resulting in 8,000 dimensional vectors.
    We can see the value of the automatically generated patterns by comparing LRA without synonyms and SVD (column 4) to VSM-WMTS (column 5).
    The difference in both precision and recall is statistically significant with 95% confidence, according to the Fisher Exact Test (Agresti 1990).
    The ablation experiments support the value of the patterns (step 4) and synonyms (step 1) in LRA, but the contribution of SVD (step 9) has not been proven, although we believe more data will support its effectiveness.
    Nonetheless, the three components together result in a 16% increase in F (compare column 1 to 5).
    We know a priori that, if A:B::C:D, then B:A::D:C. For example, mason is to stone as carpenter is to wood implies stone is to mason as wood is to carpenter.
    Therefore, a good measure of relational similarity, simr, should obey the foll
