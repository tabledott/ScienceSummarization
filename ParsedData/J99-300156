a more reliable picture, since depending on the text genre considered (e.g., technical vs. news magazine vs. literary texts), certain sequences of transition types may be entirely plausible though they include transitions which, when viewed in isolation, seem to imply considerable inferencing load (Table 18).
    For instance, a CONTINUE transition that follows a CONTINUE transition is a sequence that requires the lowest processing costs.
    But a CONTINUE transition that follows a RETAIN transition implies higher processing costs than a SMOOTH-SHIFT transition following a RETAIN transition.
    This is due to the fact that a RETAIN transition ideally predicts a SMOOTH-SHIFT in the following utterance.
    Hence, we claim that no one particular centering transition should be preferred over another.
    Instead, we advocate the idea that certain centering transition pairs are to be preferred over others.
    Following this line of argumentation, we propose here to classify all occurrences of centering transit
