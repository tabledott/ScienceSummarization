pecifications of the relation type for some relations and the initial or underlying logical relation of the grammatical subject in constructions such as passive.
    We determine for each sentence the relations in the test set which are correct at each level of the relational hierarchy.
    A relation is correct if the head and dependent slots are equal and if the other slots are equal (if specified).
    If a relation is incorrect at a given level in the hierarchy it may still match for a subsuming relation (if the remaining slots all match); for example, if a ncmod relation is mislabelled with zmod, it will be correct for all relations which subsume both ncmod and zmod, e.g. mod.
    Similarly, the GR will be considered incorrect for zmod and all relations that subsume zmod but not ncmod.
    Thus, the evaluation scheme calculates unlabelled dependency accuracy at the dependency (most general) level in the hierarchy.
    The micro-averaged precision, recall and F1 score are calculated from the counts for al
