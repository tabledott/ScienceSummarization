 the test texts: true alignment (dots) and hypothesis of the SAT after the first pass (circles) and after the second pass (crosses).
    Table 3 summarizes the accuracy of the algorithm as a function of the number of passes.
    The (thresholded) SAT is evaluated by two criteria: the number of correct by the total number alignments, and&#8212;since the SAT does not necessarily give an alignment for every sentence&#8212;the coverage, i.e., the number of sentences with at least one entry relative to the total number of sentences.
    An alignment is said to be correct if the SAT contains exactly the numbers of the sentences that are complete or partial translations of the original sentence.
    The coverage of 96% of the SAT in pass 4 is as much as one would expect, since the remaining nonaligned sentences are one-zero alignments, most of them due to the German subheadings that are not part of the English version.
    The table also shows that the AST always provides a significant number of candidates for align
