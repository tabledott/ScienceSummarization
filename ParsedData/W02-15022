ficult to mine for information, as they contain layers upon layers of interacting analyses and decisions made in light of various intermediate stages of the grammar.
    As a result, when embarking on the creation of a new grammar for another language, it seems almost easier to start from scratch than to try to model it on an existing grammar.
    This is unfortunate&#8212;being able to leverage the knowledge and infrastructure embedded in existing grammars would greatly accelerate the process of developing new ones.
    At the same time, these grammars represent an untapped resource for the bottom-up exploration of language universals.
    As part of the LinGO consortium&#8217;s multi-lingual grammar engineering effort, we are developing a &#8216;grammar matrix&#8217; or starter-kit, distilling the wisdom of existing grammars and codifying and documenting it in a form that can be used as the basis for new grammars.
    In the following sections, we outline the inventory of a first, preliminary version of the
