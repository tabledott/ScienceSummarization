 classes in Wordnet (Fellbaum, 1998) and a measure of conceptual association to generalize over the nouns.
    Brill and Resnik (1994) use Brill&#8217;s transformation-based algorithm along with simple counts within a lexical hierarchy in order to generalize over individual words.
    Li and Abe (1998) use a minimum description length-based algorithm to find an optimal tree cut over WordNet for each classification problem, finding improvements over both lexical association (Hindle and Rooth, 1993) and conceptual association, and equaling the transformation-based results.
    Our approach differs from these in that we are using machine learning techniques to determine which level of the lexical hierarchy is appropriate for generalizing across nouns.
  
  
    In this work we aim for a representation that is intermediate in generality between standard case roles (such as Agent, Patient, Topic, Instrument), and the specificity required for information extraction.
    We have created a set of relations that are s
