ature score, but a cutoff value that ignores the sentences shorter than the given threshold.
    Several rerankers are implemented in MEAD.
    We observed the best results with Maximal Marginal Relevance (MMR) (Carbonell and Goldstein, 1998) reranker and the default reranker of the system based on Cross-Sentence Informational Subsumption (CSIS) (Radev, 2000).
    All of our experiments shown in Section 4.3 use CSIS reranker.
    A MEAD policy is a combination of three components: (a) the command lines for all features, (b) the formula for converting the feature vector to a scalar, and (c) the command line for the reranker.
    A sample policy might be the one shown in Figure 4.
    This example indicates the three default MEAD features (Centroid, Position, LengthCutoff), and our new LexPageRank feature used in our experiments.
    Our LexPageRank implementation requires the cosine similarity threshold, in the example, as an argument.
    Each number next to a feature name shows the relative weight of that fe
