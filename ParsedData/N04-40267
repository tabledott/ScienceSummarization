d accordingly.
    The decoding orientation restrictions are illustrated in Fig 3: a monotone block sequence with right ( 'We keep all blocks for which and the phrase length is less or equal .
    No other selection criteria are applied.
    For the model, we keep all blocks for which . order: for each block , we look for left and right adjacent predecessors . orientation is generated.
    If a block is skipped e.g. block in Fig 3 by first generating block then block , the block is generated using left orientation .
    Since the block translation is generated from bottom-to-top, the blocks and do not have adjacent predecessors below them: they are generated by a default model without orientation component.
    The orientation model is given in Eq.
    2, the default model is given in Eq.
    3.
    The block bigram model in Eq.
    1 is defined as: where and the orientation of the predecessor is ignored.
    The are chosen to be optimal on the devtest set (the optimal parameter setting is shown in Table.
