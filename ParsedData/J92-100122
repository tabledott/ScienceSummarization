cal derivations.
    The former, which is NIL in the case of issue to indicate no derivations, encodes the derivations at the word root level, while the latter encodes them at the sense preference level.
    For example, the : S-DERIV constraint allows issuance to derive from either of the first two senses of the verb, with issuer and issuable deriving only from the 'giving' sense.
    The lexical entries for issue.
    The derivation triples encode the form of each affix, the resulting syntactic category (usually redundant), and the &amp;quot;semantic transformation&amp;quot; that applies between the core sense and the resulting sense.
    For example, the triple (-er noun tr_act or) in the entry for issue says that an issuer plays the ACTOR role of the first sense of the verb issue.
    Because derivations often apply to multiple senses and often result in different semantic transformations (for example, the ending -ion can indicate the act of performing some action, the object of the action, or the result
