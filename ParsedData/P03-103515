: First, for each type, we use a set of constraints (which are compiled by linguists and are represented as FSTs) to generate only those &#8216;most likely&#8217; candidates.
    Second, each of the generated candidates is assigned a class model probability.
    These class models are defined as generative models which are respectively estimated on their corresponding named entity lists using maximum likelihood estimation (MLE), together with smoothing methods4.
    We will describe briefly the constraints and the class models below.
    There are two main constraints.
    (1) PN patterns: We assume that a Chinese PN consists of a family name F and a given name G, and is of the pattern F+G.
    Both F and G are of one or two characters long.
    (2) Family name list: We only consider PN candidates that begin with an F stored in the family name list (which contains 373 entries in our system).
    Given a PN candidate, which is a character string S&#8217;, the class model probability P(S&#8217;|PN) is computed
