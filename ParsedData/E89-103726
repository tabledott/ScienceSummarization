 does not require a single integrated source structure to map onto a single integrated target structure.
    An alternative analysis can handle differences of embedding with completely integrated structures.
    If we assign an explicit function to the adverbial in the source sentence, we can reverse the embedding in the target by replacing (22) with (26): In this case the embedded f-structure of the source adverb will be mapped onto the f-structure that corresponds to the root node of the target c-structure, whereas the f-structure of the source S is mapped onto the embedded XCOMP in the target.
    The advantages and disadvantages of these different approaches will be investigated further in Netter and Wedekind (forthcoming).
  
  
    We have sketched and illustrated an approach to machine translation that exploits the potential of simultaneous correspondences between different levels of linguistic representation.
    This is made possible by the equality and description based mechanisms oi LFG.
