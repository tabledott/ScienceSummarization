    Subsequent research identified a number of issues with discourse structure annotation, above all the fact that segmentation, though problematic, is still much easier than marking more complex aspects of discourse structure, such as identifying the most important segments or the &#8220;rhetorical&#8221; relations between segments of different granularity.
    As a result, many efforts to annotate discourse structure concentrate only on segmentation.
    The agreement results for segment coding tend to be on the lower end of the scale proposed by Krippendorff and recommended by Carletta.
    Hearst (1997), for instance, found K = 0.647 for the boundary/not boundary distinction; Reynar (1998), measuring agreement between his own annotation and the TREC segmentation of broadcast news, reports K = 0.764 for the same task; Ries (2002) reports even lower agreement of K = 0.36.
