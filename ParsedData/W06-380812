quivalent of k, &#945; in our model).
    Pang and Lee tuned them on a per-author basis using cross validation but did not report the optimal parameters.
    We were interested in learning a single set of parameters for use with all authors.
    In addition, since we varied labeled set size, it is convenient to tune c = k/|L|, the fraction of labeled reviews used as neighbors, instead of k. We then used the same c, &#945; for all authors at all labeled set sizes in experiments involving PSP.
    Because c is fixed, k varies directly with |L |(i.e., when less labeled data is available, our algorithm considers fewer nearby labeled examples).
    In an attempt to reproduce the findings in (Pang and Lee, 2005), we tuned c, &#945; with cross validation.
    Tuning ranges are c &#8712; {0.05, 0.1, 0.15, 0.2, 0.25, 0.3} and &#945; &#8712; {0.01, 0.1, 0.5,1.0,1.5, 2.0, 2.5, 3.0, 3.5, 4.0, 5.0}.
    The optimal parameters we found are c = 0.2 and &#945; = 1.5.
