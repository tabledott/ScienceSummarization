ith the human judgments of translation quality at the system-level using Spearman&#8217;s rank correlation coefficient &#961;.
    We converted the raw scores assigned to each system into ranks.
    We assigned a human ranking to the systems based on the percent of time that their translations were judged to be better than the translations of any other system in the manual evaluation (Equation 4).
    When there are no ties, &#961; can be calculated using the simplified equation: System-level correlation for translations into English where di is the difference between the rank for systemi and n is the number of systems.
    The possible values of p range between 1(where all systems are ranked in the same order) and &#8722;1 (where the systems are ranked in the reverse order).
    Thus an automatic evaluation metric with a higher absolute value for p is making predictions that are more similar to the human judgments than an automatic evaluation metric with a lower absolute p. The system-level correlations are
