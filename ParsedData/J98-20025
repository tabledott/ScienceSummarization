quot; of the thesaurus tree.
    We then give an efficient algorithm that provably obtains the optimal tree cut model for the given frequency data of a case slot, in the sense of MDL.
    In order to test the effectiveness of our method, we conducted PP-attachment disambiguation experiments using the case frame patterns obtained by our method.
    Our experimental results indicate that the proposed method improves upon or is at least comparable to existing methods.
    The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: In Section 2, we formalize the problem of generalizing values of a case frame slot as that of estimating a conditional distribution.
    In Section 3, we describe our MDL-based generalization method.
    In Section 4, we present our experimental results.
    We then give some concluding remarks in Section 5.
  
  
    Suppose that the data available to us are of the type shown in Table 1, which are slot values for a given verb (verb,slot_name,slot_value triples) automatically extracted from a
