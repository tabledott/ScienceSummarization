tes somewhat under 20%.
    We observe that the alignment quality obtained with a specific model heavily depends on the training scheme that is used to bootstrap the model.
    Comparison of alignment error rate (in percent) for Model 1 and Dice coefficient (left: 34K Verbmobil task, right: 128K Hansards task).
    We pointed out in Section 2 that from a theoretical viewpoint, the main advantage of statistical alignment models in comparison to heuristic models is the well-founded mathematical theory that underlies their parameter estimation.
    Tables 4 and 5 show that the statistical alignment models significantly outperform the heuristic Dice coefficient and the heuristic Dice coefficient with competitive linking (Dice+C).
    Even the simple Model 1 achieves better results than the two Dice coefficient models.
    It is instructive to analyze the alignment quality obtained in the EM training of Model 1.
    Figure 3 shows the alignment quality over the iteration numbers of Model 1.
    We see that the fir
