    The global probabilities, for example p(the_i), are based on counts of closed-class items found at these positions relative to the nouns in a large text corpus.
    The local window width of &#177;2 was selected after pilot testing on the semantically tagged Brown corpus.
    As in (2) above, the local window does not extend beyond a sentence boundary.
    4.
    Part-of-speech tags in the positions j = &#8212;2, &#8212;1,0, 1,2 are also used as cues.
    The probabilities for these tags are computed for specific positions (e.g., p(DT_i I p(DTA) in a manner similar to that described in (3) above.
    When TLC is configured to use only topical information, cue type (1) is employed.
    When it is configured for local information, cue types (2), (3), and (4) are used.
    Finally, in combined mode, the set of cues contains all four types.
    2.3 Results Figures 1 to 3 show the accuracy of the classifier as a function of the size of the training set when using local context, topical context, and a combinati
