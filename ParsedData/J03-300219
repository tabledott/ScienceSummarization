 that it is.
    First, Web-based parallel corpora have already demonstrated their utility in crosslanguage information retrieval experiments.
    Resnik, Oard, and Levow (2001) showed that a translation lexicon automatically extracted from the French-English STRAND data could be combined productively with a bilingual French-English dictionary in order to improve retrieval results using a standard cross-language IR test collection (English queries against the CLEF-2000 French collection, which contains approximately 21 million words from articles in Le Monde).
    During document translation, backing off from the dictionary to the STRAND translation lexicon accounted for over 8% of the lexicon matches (by token), reducing the number of untranslatable terms by a third and producing a statistically significant 12% relative improvement in mean average precision as compared to using the dictionary alone.
    Similarly, Nie and Cai (2001) have demonstrated improved cross-language IR results for English and Chinese
