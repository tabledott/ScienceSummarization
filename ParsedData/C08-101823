			Grammar Extraction Our grammar usedrules extracted directly from our compression cor pus (the training partition, 480 sentences) and a bilingual corpus (see Table 2 for examples).
			Theformer corpus was word-aligned using the Berke ley aligner (Liang et al, 2006) initialised with a lexicon of word identity mappings, and parsed with Bikel?s (2002) parser.
			From this we extracted grammar rules following the technique described in Cohn and Lapata (2007).
			For the pivot grammarwe use the French-English Europarl v2 which con tains approximately 688K sentences.
			Again, the corpus was aligned using the Berkeley aligner and the English side was parsed with Bikel?s parser.
			Weextracted tree-to-string rules using our implementation of the GHKM method.
			To ameliorate the effects of poor alignments on the grammar, we re moved singleton rules before pivoting.
			In addition to the two grammars described, wescanned the source trees in the compression cor pus and included STSG rules to copy
