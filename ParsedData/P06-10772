oses Inversion Transduction Grammars, treating translation as a process of parallel parsing of the source and target language via a synchronized grammar.
    Alshawi et al. (2000) represent each production in parallel dependency tree as a finite transducer.
    Melamed (2004) formalizes machine translation problem as synchronous parsing based on multitext grammars.
    Graehl and Knight (2004) describe training and decoding algorithms for both generalized tree-to-tree and tree-to-string transducers.
    Chiang (2005) presents a hierarchical phrasebased model that uses hierarchical phrase pairs, which are formally productions of a synchronous context-free grammar.
    Ding and Palmer (2005) propose a syntax-based translation model based on a probabilistic synchronous dependency insert grammar, a version of synchronous grammars defined on dependency trees.
    All these approaches, though different in formalism, make use of synchronous grammars or tree-based transduction rules to model both source and target la
