    We used FrameNet II (Baker et al., 2003) which contains 450 semantic frames and more than 3000 frame elements (FE).
    A frame consists of lexical items, called Lexical Unit (LU), and related frame elements.

    FrameNet II contains approximately 7500 lexical units and over 100,000 annotated sentenc
