ference systems to create candidate partitions as in training, and select the highest-ranked partition according to the ranking model to be the final partition.3 The rest of this section describes how we select these learning-based coreference systems and acquire the ranking model.
    A learning-based coreference system can be defined by four elements: the learning algorithm used to train the coreference classifier, the method of creating training instances for the learner, the feature set used to represent a training or test instance, and the clustering algorithm used to coordinate the coreference classification decisions.
    Selecting a coreference system, then, is a matter of instantiating these elements with specific values.
    Now we need to define the set of allowable values for each of these elements.
    In particular, we want to define them in such a way that the resulting coreference systems can potentially generate good candidate partitions.
    Given that machine learning approaches to the prob
