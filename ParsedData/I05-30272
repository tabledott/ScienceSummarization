 were used to prevent overfitting and a quasi-Newton method was used for pa rameter optimization.
			The probability assigned to a label sequence for a particular sequence of characters by a CRF is given by the equation below: ( ) ( )??
			?Cc k c cXYkkXZ XYP f ,,exp)( 1| ??
			Y is the label sequence for the sentence, X is the sequence of unsegmented characters, Z(X) is a normalization term, fk is a feature function, and c indexes into characters in the sequence being labeled.
			A CRF allows us to utilize a large number of n-gram features and different state sequence 168 based features and also provides an intuitive framework for the use of morphological features.
	
	
			3.1 Features.
			The linguistic features used in our model fall into three categories: character identity n-grams,morphological and character reduplication fea tures.
			For each state, the character identity features (Ng &amp; Low 2004, Xue &amp; Shen 2003, Goh et al 2003) are represented using feature functions that key off of the identit
