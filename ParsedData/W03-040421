 sentence-level subjectivity classification (Wiebe et al., 1999).
    Row (1) shows a Naive Bayes classifier that uses unigram bag-ofwords features, with one binary feature for the absence or presence in the sentence of each word that appeared during training.
    Pang et al. (2002) reported that a similar experiment produced their best results on a related classification task.
    The difference in accuracy between Rows (1) and (2) is not statistically significant (Bag-of-Word&#8217;s higher precision is balanced by WBO&#8217;s higher recall).
    Next, we trained a Naive Bayes classifier using only the SubjNoun features.
    This classifier achieved good precision (77%) but only moderate recall (64%).
    Upon further inspection, we discovered that the subjective nouns are good subjectivity indicators when they appear, but not every subjective sentence contains one of them.
    And, relatively few sentences contain more than one, making it difficult to recognize contextual effects (i.e., multiple clues in a
