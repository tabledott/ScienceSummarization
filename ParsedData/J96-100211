 the translation y of in that the process produced.
    For now, we can imagine that these training samples have been generated by a human expert who was presented with a number of random phrases containing in and asked to choose a good translation for each.
    When we discuss real-world applications in Section 5, we will show how such samples can be automatically extracted from a bilingual corpus.
    We can summarize the training sample in terms of its empirical probability distribution /3, defined by number of times that (x, y) occurs in the sample Typically, a particular pair (x, y) will either not occur at all in the sample, or will occur at most a few times.
    Our goal is to construct a statistical model of the process that generated the training sample p(x,y).
    The building blocks of this model will be a set of statistics of the training sample.
    In the current example we have employed several such statistics: the frequency with which in translated to either dans or en was 3/10; the frequency
