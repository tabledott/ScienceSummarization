erse resource: comparable non-parallel corpora.
    Comparable corpora are texts that, while not parallel in the strict sense, are somewhat related and convey overlapping information.
    Good examples are the multilingual news feeds produced by news agencies such as Agence France Presse, Xinhua News, Reuters, CNN, BBC, etc.
    Such texts are widely available on the Web for many language pairs and domains.
    They often contain many sentence pairs that are fairly good translations of each other.
    The ability to reliably identify these pairs would enable the automatic creation of large and diverse parallel corpora.
    However, identifying good translations in comparable corpora is hard.
    Even texts that convey the same information will exhibit great differences at the sentence level.
    Consider the two newspaper articles in Figure 1.
    They have been published by the English and French editors of Agence France Presse, and report on the same event, an epidemic of cholera in Pyongyang.
