  Polylingual Topic Models
  
    Topic models are a useful tool for analyzing large text collections, but have previously been applied in only monolingual, or at most bilingual, contexts.
    Meanwhile, massive collections of interlinked documents in dozens of languages, such as Wikipedia, are now widely available, calling for tools that can characterize content in many languages.

    Statistical topic models have emerged as an increasingly useful analysis tool for large text collections.
    Topic models have been used for analyzing topic trends in research literature (Mann et al., 2006; Hall et al., 2008), inferring captions for images (Blei and Jordan, 2003), social network analysi
