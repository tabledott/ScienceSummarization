ation and a set of rules for transfer of control between discourse participants that were proposed by Whittaker and Stenton[WS88].
  We evaluate the generality of this analysis by applying the control rules to 4 sets of dialogues, including both advi- sory dialogues (ADs) and task-oriented ialogues (TODs).
  We analysed both financial and support ADs.
  The financial ADs are from the radio talk show "Harry Gross: Speaking of Your Money "1 The support ADs resulted from a client phoning an expert o help them diagnose and repair various software faults ~.
  The TODs are about the construc- tion of a plastic water pump in both telephone and keyboard modality S. The application of the control rules to these dia- logues lets us derive domain-independent discourse segments with each segment being controlled by one or other discourse participant.
  We propose that control segments correspond to different subgoals in the evolving discourse plan.
  In addition, we ar- gue that various linguistic devices are necessary f
