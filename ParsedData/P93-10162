o approaches where constraint satisfaction involves tree traversal.
    The next section presents a general framework for parsing by message passing.
    Section 3 shows how linguistic notions, such as dominance and government, can be translated into relationships between descriptions of structures.
    Section 4 describes interpretation of GB principles.
    Familiarity with GB theory is assumed in the presentation.
    Section 5 sketches an object-oriented implementation of the parser.
    Section 6 discusses complexity issues and related work.
  
  
    The message passing algorithm presented here is an extension to a message passing algorithm for context-free grammars (Lin and Goebel, 1993).
    We encode the grammar, as well as the parser, in a network (Figure 1).
    The nodes in the networks represent syntactic categories.
    The links in the network represent dominance and subsumption relationships between the categories: The network is also a parser.
    The nodes in the network are computing agents
