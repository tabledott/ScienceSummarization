e right accepts the language Leftcontext (a, &lt; , &gt;); it requires &lt; to appear after every a or after any 0 that follows an a.
    This particular machine is nondeterministic so that its organization is easier to understand.
    An operator for identifying and marking right-context strings can be defined symmetrically: Thus Rightcontext (p, &lt; , &gt;) includes strings if and only if every substring belonging to p (with appropriate ignoring) is immediately preceded by a right-context bracket &gt;.
    Alternatively, taking advantage of the fact that the reversal of a regular language is also a regular language, we can define Rightcontext in terms of Leftcontext: These context identifiers denote appropriate string-sets even for rules with unspecified contexts, if the vacuous contexts are interpreted as if the empty string had been specified.
    The empty string indicates that adjacent symbols have no influence on the rule application.
    If an omitted A is interpreted as 6, for example, every Leftcon
