son/Org, Physical Object, or Other.
    A syntactic function is labeled as a class if 20% of its arguments appear under the corresponding WordNet synset3, or if the NER system labels them as such.
    Once labeled by type, we separately cluster the syntactic functions for each role type.
    For instance, Person functions are clustered separate from Physical Object functions.
    Figure 2 shows some of the resulting roles.
    Finally, since agglomerative clustering makes hard decisions, related events to a template may have been excluded in the initial event clustering stage.
    To address this problem, we identify the 200 nearby events to each event cluster.
    These are simply the top scoring event patterns with the cluster&#8217;s original events.
    We add their syntactic functions to their best matching roles.
    This expands the coverage of each learned role.
    Varying the 200 amount does not lead to wide variation in extraction performance.
    Once induced, the roles are evaluated by their enti
