lexicons, and it can do so with over 99% accuracy.
  
  
    Over the past decade, researchers at IBM have developed a series of increasingly sophisticated statistical models for machine translation (Brown et al., 1988; Brown et al., 1990; Brown et al., 1993a).
    However, the IBM models, which attempt to capture a broad range of translation phenomena, are computationally expensive to apply.
    Table look-up using an explicit translation lexicon is sufficient and preferable for many multilingual NLP applications, including &amp;quot;crummy&amp;quot; MT on the World Wide Web (Church &amp; Hovy, 1993), certain machine-assisted translation tools (e.g.
    (Macklovitch, 1994; Melamed, 1996b)), concordancing for bilingual lexicography (Catizone et al., 1993; Gale &amp; Church, 1991), computerassisted language learning, corpus linguistics (Melby.
    1981), and cross-lingual information retrieval (Oard &amp; Dorr, 1996).
    In this paper, we present a fast method for inducing accurate translation lexicons.
