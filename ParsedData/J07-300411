    Extensions of CCG to other languages and word-orders are discussed by Hoffman (1995), Kang (1995), Bozsahin (1998), Komagata (1999), Steedman (2000), Trechsel (2000), Baldridge (2002), and C&#184; ak&#305;c&#305; (2005).
    The derivations in CCGbank follow the analyses of Steedman (1996, 2000), except where noted.
    Categorial Grammars are strongly lexicalized, in the sense that the grammar is entirely defined by a lexicon in which words (and other lexical items) are associated with one or more specific categories which completely define their syntactic behavior.
    The set of categories consists of basic categories (e.g., S, NP, PP) and complex categories of the form X/Y or X\Y, representing functors with (basic or complex) argument category Y and result category X. Functor categories of the form X/Y expect their argument Y to its right, whereas those of the form X\Y expect Y to their left.2 These functor categories encode su
