  Minimum Bayes-Risk Decoding For Statistical Machine Translation
  
    We present Minimum Bayes-Risk (MBR) decoding for statistical machine translation.
    This statistical approach aims to minimize expected loss of translation errors under loss functions that measure translation performance.
    We describe a hierarchy of loss functions that incorporate different levels of linguistic information from word strings, word-to-word alignments from an MT system, and syntactic structure from parse-trees of source and target language sentences.
    We report the performance of the MBR decoders on a Chinese-to-English translation task.
    Our results show that MBR decoding can be used to tune statistical MT performance for specific loss functions.
  
  
    Statistical Machine Translation systems have achieved considerable progress in recent years as seen from their performance on international competitions in standard evaluation tasks (NIST, 2003).
    This rapid progress has been greatly facilitated by the dev
