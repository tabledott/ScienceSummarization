ity scale.
    The set of hearer-old discourse entities (OLD) consists of evoked (E) and unused (U) discourse entities, while the set of hearer-new discourse entities (NEW) consists of brand-new (BN) discourse entities.
    For the basic Cf ranking criteria, it is sufficient to assign inferable (I), containing inferable (IC), and anchored brand-new (BNA) discourse entities to the set of hearer-new discourse entities (NEW).11 See Figure 2 for an illustration of Prince's familiarity scale and its relation to the two sets.
    Note that the elements of each set are indistinguishable with respect to their information status.
    Evoked and unused discourse entities, for example, have the same information status because they belong to the set of hearer-old discourse entities.
    So the basic Cf ranking in Figure 2 boils down to the preference of OLD discourse entities over NEW ones.
    For an operationalization of Prince's terms, we state that evoked discourse entities are simply cospecifying (resolved anaphoric
