ng in the context of LTAG, it is applicable to other lexicalized grammar formalisms such as CCG (Steedman 1997), HPSG (Pollard and Sag 1987), and LFG (Kaplan and Bresnan 1983).
    We have implemented a broad coverage CCG grammar (Doran and Srinivas 1994) containing about 80 categories based on the XTAG English grammar.
    These categories have been used to tag the same training and test corpora used in the supertagging experiments discussed in this paper and a supertagger to disambiguate the CCG categories has been developed.
    We are presently analyzing the performance of the supertagger using the LTAG trees and the CCG categories.
    The idea of supertagging can also be applied to a grammar in HPSG formalism indirectly, by compiling the HPSG grammar into an LTAG grammar (Kasper et al. 1995).
    A more direct approach would be to tag words with feature structures that represent supertags (Kempe 1994).
    For LFG, the lexicalized subset of fragments used in the LFG-DOP model (Bod and Kaplan 1998) can b
