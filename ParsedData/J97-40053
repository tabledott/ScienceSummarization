    Proposals have been made for extending stochastic models developed for the regular and context-free cases to grammars with constraints.'
    Brew (1995) sketches a probabilistic version of Head-Driven Phrase Structure Grammar (HPSG).
    He proposes a stochastic process for generating attribute-value structures, that is, directed acyclic graphs (dags).
    A dag is generated starting from a single node labeled with the (unique) most general type.
    Each type S has a set of maximal subtypes T1, .
    .
    , Tn.
    To expand a node labeled S, one chooses a maximal subtype T stochastically.
    One then considers equating the current node with other nodes of type T, making a stochastic yes/no decision for each.
    Equating two nodes creates a re-entrancy.
    If the current node is equated with no other node, one proceeds to expand it.
    Each maximal type introduces types U1,...,Un, corresponding to values of attributes; one creates a child node for each introduced type, and then expands each chi
