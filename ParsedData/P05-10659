 as a low-cost automatic approximation of both syntactic and semantic analysis.
    Statistical language models (LMs) are used successfully in this way in other areas of NLP such as speech recognition and machine translation.
    We also use a standard statistical parser (Charniak, 2000) to provide syntactic analysis.
    In practice, a teacher is likely to be looking for texts at a particular level rather than classifying a group of texts into a variety of categories.
    Thus we construct one classifier per category which decides whether a document belongs in that category or not, rather than constructing a classifier which ranks documents into different categories relative to each other.
    Statistical LMs predict the probability that a particular word sequence will occur.
    The most commonly used statistical language model is the n-gram model, which assumes that the word sequence is an (n&#8722;1)th order Markov process.
    For example, for the common trigram model where n = 3, the probability of sequ
