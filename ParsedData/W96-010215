e known words case base or the unknown words case base.
    A windowing approach (Sejnowski &amp; Rosenberg, 1987) was used to represent the tagging task as a classification problem.
    A case consists of information about a focus word to be tagged, its left and right context, and an associated category (tag) valid for the focus word in that context.
    There are several types of information which can be stored in the case base for each word, ranging from the words themselves to intricate lexical representations.
    In the preliminary experiments described in this paper, we limited this information to the possibly ambiguous tags of words (retrieved from the lexicon) for the focus word and its context to the right, and the disambiguated tags of words for the left context (as the result of earlier tagging decisions).
    Table 1 is a sample of the case base for the first sentence of the corpus (Pierre Vinken, 61 years old, will join the board as a nonexecutiye director nom 29) when using this case representa
