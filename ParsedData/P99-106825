    Inspection of Web sites &#8212; those with bilingual text identified by STRAND and those without &#8212; suggests that the strategy of using Altavista to generate candidate pairs could be improved upon significantly by adding a true Web crawler to &amp;quot;mine&amp;quot; sites where bilingual text is known to be available, e.g. sites uncovered by a first pass of the system using the Altavista engine.
    I would conjecture that for English-French there is an order of magnitude more bilingual text on the Web than that uncovered in this early stage of research.
    A second natural direction is the application of Web-based parallel text in applications such as lexical acquisition and cross-language information retrieval &#8212; especially since a sideeffect of the core STRAND algorithm is aligned &amp;quot;chunks&amp;quot;, i.e. non-markup segments found to correspond to each other based on alignment of the markup.
    Preliminary experiments using even small amounts of these data suggest that standard t
