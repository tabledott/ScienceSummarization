including: The information that two discourse entities are disjoint may come from postmodification, as well, although same head antecedents with different postrnodification are not as common as those with differences in premodification.
    An example from Our Corpus is shown in (11). like himself could run Pinkerton's better than an unfocused conglomerate or investment banker.
    The heuristic method we developed to deal with postmodification is to compare the description and antecedent, preventing resolution in those cases where both are postmodified and the modifications are not the same.
    (These results are also discussed in Section 5.2.)
    As mentioned above, a fundamental characteristic of our system is that it also includes heuristics for recognizing discourse-new descriptions (i.e., definite descriptions that introduce new discourse entities) on the basis of syntactic and lexical features of the noun phrase.
    Our heuristics are based on the discussion in Hawkins (1978), who identified a numbe
