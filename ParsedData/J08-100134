rtheless a key property of well-formed text (documents lacking local coherence are naturally globally incoherent), and a model which takes it into account should be able to discriminate coherent from incoherent texts.
    In our sentence-ordering task we generate random permutations of a test document and measure how often a permutation is ranked higher than the original document.
    A non-deficient model should prefer the original text more frequently than its permutations (see Section 4.2 for details).
    We begin by explaining how a ranking function can be learned for the sentence ordering task.
    Next, we give details regarding the corpus used for our experiments, describe the methods used for comparison with our approach, and note the evaluation metric employed for assessing model performance.
    Our results are presented in Section 4.3.
    Our training set consists of ordered pairs of alternative renderings (xij, xik) of the same document di, where xij exhibits a higher degree of coherence than xi
