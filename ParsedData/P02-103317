einforcement.
    These problems reflect the algorithm's implicit assumption that the source words are monosemous, reflected in its attempt to have every word in a target set influence the semantics of every other word.
    Inspecting the data produces many counterexamples, e.g.
    French canon (cannon, cannonball, canon, theologian) bandes (band, gang, mob, strip, streak, tape), and baie (bay, berry, cove).
    A sensible alternative would be apply automatic clustering techniques to the target sets (e.g.
    (Diab and Finch, 2000; Schiitze, 1992)), providing target sub-clusters of words that should be treated as related, with no crosscluster reinforcement.
    For example, the target set for French canon would have two coherent sub-clusters containing {cannon, cannonball} and {canon, theologian)}, respectively.
    Manual inspection of target sets in our experiments suggests that when target sets are semantically coherent e.g. adversaires (antagonists, opponents, contestants), accident: (accident, crash, wr
