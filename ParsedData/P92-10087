ng to their transcriptions.
    The results are summarized in Table 3.
    For simplicity, in this table we have counted fragments (which always occurred as the second deleted word) as whole words.
    The overall rate of fragments for the length 2 repairs was 34%.
    A major repair type involved matching strings of identical words.
    More than half (339 out of 436) of the nontrivial repairs (more editing necessary than deleting fragments and filled pauses) in the corpus were of this type.
    Table 4 shows the distributions of these repairs with respect to two parameters: the length in words of the matched string, and the number of words between the two matched strings.
    Numbers in parentheses indicate the number of occurrences, and probabilities represent the likelihood that the phrase was actually a repair and not a false positive.
    Two trends emerge from these data.
    First, the longer the matched string, the more likely the phrase was a repair.
    Second, the more words there were intervening
