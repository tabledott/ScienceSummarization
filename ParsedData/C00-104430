tic meflmd for extracting radabil- ity values reliably, complementing earlier work on se- mantic orientation and dynamic adjectives.
  In addition to finding more precise features for auto- marie subjectivity recognition, this kind of analysis could help efforts to encode subjective features in ontologies such as those described in (Knight and Luk, 1994; Ma- hesh and Nirenburg, 1995; Hovy, 1998).
  These on- tologies are useful for many NLP tasks, such as ma- chine translation, word-sense disambiguation, and gen- eration.
  Some subjective features are included in exist- ing ontologies (for example, Mikrokosmos (Mahesh and 304 Nirenburg, 1995) includes atlitude slots).
  Our corpus- based methods could help in idenlifying more or exlend- ing their coverage.
