 event (precision).
			We also mea sured F1, their harmonic average, and report macro average Recall, Precision and F1 over the 26 event types.
			No threshold setting mechanism is suggested inthe literature for the scores of the different algo rithms, especially since rules for different right hand side templates have different score ranges.
			Thus, we follow common evaluation practice (Lin and Pantel, 2001; Geffet and Dagan, 2005) and test each learned rule-set by taking the top K rules for each seed template, whereK ranges from 0 to 100.WhenK=0, no rules are used and mentions are ex tracted only by direct matching of seed templates.
			Our rule application setting provides a rather simplistic IE system (for example, no named entity recognition or approximate template matching).
			It is thus useful for comparing different rule-bases,though the absolute extraction figures do not re flect the full potential of the rules.
			In Secion 5.2 we analyze the full-system?s errors to isolate the rules?
