    In addition, these models are the starting point for refined phrase-based statistical (Och and Weber 1998; Och, Tillmann, and Ney 1999) or example-based translation systems (Brown 1997).
    In such systems, the quality of the machine translation output directly depends on the quality of the initial word alignment (Och and Ney 2000).
    Another application of word alignments is in the field of word sense disambiguation (Diab 2000).
    In Yarowsky, Ngai, and Wicentowski (2001), word alignment is used to transfer text analysis tools such as morphologic analyzers or part-of-speech taggers from a language, such as English, for which many tools already exist to languages for which such resources are scarce.
    In Section 2, we review various statistical alignment models and heuristic models.
    We present a new statistical alignment model, a log-linear combination of the best models of Vogel, Ney, and Tillm
