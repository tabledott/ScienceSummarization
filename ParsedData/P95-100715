o estimate the parameters.
    Since these are expressed in terms of categories rather than words, it is necessary to combine the counts of words to arrive at estimates.
    In all cases the estimates used are: Here ambig(w) is the number of categories in which w appears.
    It has the effect of dividing the evidence from a training instance across all possible categories for the words.
    The normaliser ensures that all parameters for a head noun sum to unity.
    Given the high level descriptions in section 1.3 it remains only to formalise the decision process used to analyse a noun compound.
    Each test compound presents a set of possible analyses and the goal is to choose which analysis is most likely.
    For three word compounds it suffices to compute the ratio of two probabilities, that of a left-branching analysis and that of a right-branching one.
    If this ratio is greater than unity, then the left-branching analysis is chosen.
    When it is less than unity, a right-branching analysis is chos
