syntactic am- biguities, but this will not be described here.
  The *Part of this resemch was conducted wb.ile visiting IBM T. J. Watson Research Center, Yorktown Ileights, NY reader should bare in mind that like the conven- tional use of selectional constraints, our method is inteuded to work in co,tjunction with other disam- biguation means.
  These, such as various syntactic and pragmatic onstraints and heuristics [Carbonetl and Brown P.)88, tlobbs 1978], represent additional levels of knowledge and are essential when selec- tional constraints are not sufficient.
  2 The Statist ical  Approach According to the statistical model, cooccurrence patterns that were observed in tile corpns are used as selection patterns.
  Whenever several alternatives are presented by an ambiguous construct, we prefer the one correspot~ding t.omore frequent patterns.
  When using selectional constraints for anaphora resolution, the referent must satisfy the constraints which are imposed on the anaphor.
  If the anaphor particip
