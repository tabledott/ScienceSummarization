man judgments on DUC 2001 and 2002 100 words single document summarization data.
    The best values in each column are marked with dark (green) color and statistically equivalent values to the best values are marked with gray.
    We found that correlations were not affected by stemming or removal of stopwords in this data set, ROUGE-2 performed better among the ROUGE-N variants, ROUGE-L, ROUGE-W, and ROUGE-S were all performing well, and using multiple references improved performance though not much.
    All ROUGE measures achieved very good correlation with human judgments in the DUC 2002 data.
    This might due to the double sample size in DUC 2002 (295 vs. 149 in DUC 2001) for each system.
    Table 2 shows the correlation analysis results on the DUC 2003 single document very short summary data.
    We found that ROUGE-1, ROUGE-L, ROUGESU4 and 9, and ROUGE-W were very good measures in this category, ROUGE-N with N &gt; 1 performed significantly worse than all other measures, and exclusion of stopwords i
