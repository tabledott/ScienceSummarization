raining data that is used by the underlying phrasebased system.
    Results using the method show an improvement from 25.2% Bleu score to 26.8% Bleu score (a statistically significant improvement), using a phrase-based system (Koehn et al., 2003) which has been shown in the past to be a highly competitive SMT system.
  
  
    The original work on statistical machine translation was carried out by researchers at IBM (Brown et al., 1993).
    More recently, phrase-based models (Och et al., 1999; Marcu and Wong, 2002; Koehn et al., 2003) have been proposed as a highly successful alternative to the IBM models.
    Phrase-based models generalize the original IBM models by allowing multiple words in one language to correspond to multiple words in another language.
    For example, we might have a translation entry specifying that I will in English is a likely translation for Ich werde in German.
    In this paper we use the phrase-based system of (Koehn et al., 2003) as our underlying model.
