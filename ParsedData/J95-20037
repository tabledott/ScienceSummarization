    Grosz (1977) defined two levels of focusing in discourse: global and immediate.
    Participants were said to be globally focused on a set of entities relevant to the overall discourse.
    These entities may either have been explicitly introduced into the discourse or sufficiently closely related to such entities to be considered implicitly in focus (Grosz 1981).
    In contrast, immediate focusing referred to a more local focusing process&#8212;one that relates to identifying the entity that an individual utterance most centrally concerns.
    Sidner (1979) provided a detailed analysis of immediate focusing, including a distinction between the current discourse focus and potential foci.
    She gave algorithms for tracking immediate focus and rules that stated how the immediate focus could be used to identify the referents of pronouns and demonstrative noun phrases (e.g., &amp;quot;this party,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;that party&amp;quot;).
