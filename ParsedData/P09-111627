earning problem.
    However, one can rely on a discriminative classifier to establish the connection by assigning proper weights to the cluster features.
    One advantage of the two-stage approach is that the same clusterings may be used for different problems or different components of the same system.
    Another advantage is that it can be applied to a wider range of domains and problems.
    Although the method in (Suzuki and Isozaki 2008) is quite general, it is hard to see how it can be applied to the query classification problem.
    Compared with Brown clustering, our algorithm for distributional clustering with distributed K-Means offers several benefits: (1) it is more scalable and parallelizable; (2) it has the ability to generate topical as well as categorical clusters for use in different applications; (3) it can create soft clustering as well as hard ones.
    There are two main scenarios that motivate semi-supervised learning.
    One is to leverage a large amount of unsupervised data to trai
