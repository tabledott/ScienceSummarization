: When is topical context superior to local context (and vice versa)?
    Is their combination superior to either type alone?
    Do the answers to these questions depend on the size of the training?

    Manually tagged training materials were used in the development of TLC and the experiments in Section 2.
    The Cognitive Science Laboratory at Princeton University, with support from NSF-ARPA, is producing textual corpora that can be used in developing and evaluating automatic methods for disambiguation.
    Examples of the different meanings of one thousand common, polysemous, open-class English words are being manually tagged.
    The results of this effort will be a useful resource for training statistical classifiers, but what about the next thousand polysemous words, and the next?
