 level on each of the four subcorpora, which is consistent with the result over the whole corpus.
    There is quite a difference in the tagger's results across the different subcorpora91% for nouns and 70% for adverbs.
    Perhaps the learning algorithm does not perform as well on adverbs because that corpus is significantly smaller than the other three.
    This hypothesis was checked by testing our system on portions of each of the three subcorpora that were roughly equal in size to the adverb subcorpus.
    We found that the reduced data caused a slight loss of accuracy on each of the three subcorpora; however, there was still a marked difference between the results for the adverb subcorpus and the other three.
    Further analysis showed that the differences in performance over different subcorpora seem linked to the behavior of different partial taggers when used in combination.
    In the following section we describe this behavior in more detail.
