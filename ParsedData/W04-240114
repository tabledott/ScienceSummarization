 (7), and (8) are the integral constraints on these binary variables.
    There are several advantages of representing the problem in an LP formulation.
    First of all, linear (in)equalities are fairly general and are able to represent many types of constraints (e.g., the decision time constraint in the experiment in Sec.
    4).
    More importantly, an ILP problem at this scale can be solved very quickly using current commercial LP/ILP packages, like (Xpress-MP, 2003) or (CPLEX, 2003).
    We introduce the general strategies of solving an ILP problem here.
    To solve an ILP problem, a natural idea is to relax the integral constraints.
    That is, replacing (6), (7), and (8) with: If LPR returns an integer solution, then it is also the optimal solution to the ILP problem.
    If the solution is non integer, then at least it gives a lower bound to the value of the cost function, which can be used in modifying the problem and getting closer to deriving an optimal integer solution.
