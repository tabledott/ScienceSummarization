accessible node in the stack (the &amp;quot;current active node&amp;quot;).
    Loosely following [Berwick 821, we assume that the action of each rule consists of exactly one of some small set of limited actions which might include the following: (Where &amp;quot;attachment&amp;quot; is as defined above, and &amp;quot;create&amp;quot; means something like coin a new node name, and push it onto the active node stack.)
    Each rule is associated with some position in one of the base templates.
    So, for example, in figure I below, one base template is given, a highly simplified template for a sentence.
    Associated with the NP in the subject position of the sentence are several rules.
    The first rule says that if the first buffer position holds a name which is asserted to be an NP (informally: if there is an NP in the first buffer slot), then (informally) it is dominated by the S. The second says that if there is an auxiliary verb in the first slot followed by an NP, then switch them.
    And so on.
