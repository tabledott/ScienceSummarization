el corpus instead of human translated parallel corpus.
    In addition, they used an unsupervised method of noun group disambiguation, and evaluated on the English all-words task.
  
  
    In this paper, we reported an empirical study to evaluate an approach of automatically acquiring sense-tagged training data from English-Chinese parallel corpora, which were then used for disambiguating the nouns in the SENSEVAL-2 English lexical sample task.
    Our investigation reveals that this method of acquiring sense-tagged data is promising and provides an alternative to manual sense tagging.
