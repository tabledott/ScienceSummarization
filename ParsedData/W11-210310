ft Translator team quickly assembled parallel data from a number of sources, including Mission 4636 and from the archives of Carnegie Mellon&#8217;s DIPLOMAT project (Frederking et al., 1997).

    They deployed a functional translation system to relief workers in the field in less than 5 days &#8211; impressive even when measured against previous rapid MT development efforts like DARPA&#8217;s surprise language exercise (Oard, 2003; Oard and Och, 2003).
    We were inspired by the efforts of Rob Munro and Will Lewis on translating Haitian Creole in the aftermath of the disaster, so we worked with them to create a featured task at WMT11.
    We thank them for generously sharing the data they assembled in their own efforts.
    We invited Rob Munro, Will Lewis, and Stephan Vogel to speak at the workshop on the topic of developing translation technology for
