cal significance is computed using the approximate randomization test (Noreen, 1989), whose application to MT evaluation (Riezler and Maxwell, 2005) was shown to be less sensitive totype-I errors (i.e., incorrectly concluding that im provement is significant) than the perhaps more widely used bootstrap resampling method (Koehn, 2004b).
			Tuning set performance is shown in Figure 5.
