    It is important to note that any sampling method that concentrates on complete, valid and high probability alignments will accomplish the same task.
    When collecting the statistics needed to calculate P(AjE, F) from our initial 02 alignment, we give each s E S a uniform weight.
    This is reasonable, as we have no probability estimates at this point.
    When training from the alignments produced by our model, we normalize P(sjE, F) so that &amp;&#8712;S P(sjE, F) = 1.
    We then count links and features in S according to these normalized probabilities.
  
  
    We adopted the same evaluation methodology as in (Och and Ney, 2000), which compared alignment outputs with manually aligned sentences.
    Och and Ney classify manual alignments into two categories: Sure (S) and Possible (P) (SCP).
    They defined the following metrics to evaluate an alignment A: We trained our alignment program with the same 50K pairs of sentences as (Och and Ney, 2000) and tested it on the same 5
