    Data structures, such as the Patricia tree (Knuth 1973; pp.
    490-493) provide efficient means of identifying all such sequences and, once identified, the data they provide could be added to the WAT much as we now add the results of morphological analysis.
    Needless to say, this would only allow for uninterrupted sequences.
    Any attempt to deal with discontinuous sequences would doubtless also involve great combinatorial problems.
    These avenues for further development are intriguing and would surely lead to interesting results.
    But it is unlikely that they would lead to much better sets of associations among sentences than are to be found in the SATs that our present program produces, and it was mainly these results that we were interested in from the outset.
    The other avenues we have mentioned concern improvements in the WAT which, for us, was always a secondary interest.
