    Subjects did not have a background in NLP, and were native speakers of English.
    They were shown forecast texts from all the generators and from the corpus, and asked to score them on a scale of 0 to 5, for readability, clarity and general appropriateness.
    Experts were additionally shown the numerical weather data that the forecast text was based on.
    At the start, subjects were shown two practice examples.
    The experiments were carried out over the web.
    Subjects completed the experiment unsupervised, at a time and place of their choosing.
    Expert subjects were shown a randomly selected forecast for 18 of the dates.
    The non-experts were shown 21 forecast texts, in a repeated Latin squares (non-repeating column and row entries) experimental design where each combination of date and system is assigned one evaluation.
