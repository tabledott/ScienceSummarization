			to the new position rather than only the word ?calendar?.
			The probability of a completion operation can be calculated as P (com|seg) = Y bw:s BDFT (bw|s) Y w:s Y dep:w CFT (dep).
			where s are the split sentences, bw is a border word in s, w is a word in s, dep is a dependency of w which is out of the scope of s. Fig.
			3 shows the most likely result of the completion operation for our example.
