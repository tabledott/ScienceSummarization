show the results of applying a program that embodies these techniques to an article from Scientific American and its German translation in Spektrurn der Wissenschaft.
    In Section 5 we discuss other approaches to the alignment problem that were subsequently undertaken by other researchers (Gale and Church 1991; Brown, Lai, and Mercer 1991).
    Finally, in Section 6, we consider ways in which our present methods might be extended and improved,
  
  
    The principal data structures used in the algorithm are the following: Word-Sentence Index (WSI).
    One of these is prepared for each of the texts.
    It is a table with an entry for each different word in the text showing the sentences in which that word occurs.
    For the moment, we may take a word as being simply a distinct sequence of letters.
    If a word occurs more than once in a sentence, that sentence occurs on the list once for each occurrence.
    Alignable Sentence Table (AST).
    This is a table of pairs of sentences, one from each text.
