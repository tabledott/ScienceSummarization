r example, newspaper articles from two sources in different languages, within the same window of published dates, can constitute a comparable corpus.
    Rapp (1995), Grefenstette (1998), Fung and Lo (1998), and Kaji (2003) derived bilingual lexicons or word senses from such corpora.
    Munteanu et al., (2004) constructed a comparable corpus of Arabic and English news stories by matching the publishing dates of the articles.
    Finally, a very-non-parallel corpus is one that contains far more disparate, very-non-parallel bilingual documents that could either be on the same topic (in-topic) or not (off-topic).
    The TDT3 Corpus is such a corpus.
    It contains transcriptions of various news stories from radio broadcasting or TV news report from 1998-2000 in English and Chinese.
    In this corpus, there are about 7,500 Chinese and 12,400 English documents, covering more around 60 different topics.
