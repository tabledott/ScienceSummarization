    First, the notion of similarity as defined in the previous section is more restrictive than the traditional definition of similarity [Anderberg 1973; Willet 1988].
    Standard notions of similarity generally involve the creation of a vector or profile of characteristics of a text fragment, and then computing on the basis of frequencies the distance between vectors to determine conceptual distance [Salton and Buckley 1988; Salton 19891.
    Features typically include stemmed words although sometimes multi-word units and collocations have been used [Smeaton 1992], as well as typological characteristics, such as thesaural features.
    The distance between vectors for one text (usually a query) and another (usually a document) then determines closeness or similarity [van Rijsberg
