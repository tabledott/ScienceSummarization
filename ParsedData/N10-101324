red for w cannot influence the senses discovered for w' 7&#65533; w. Sharing statistical strength across similar words could yield better results for rarer words.
  
  
    We presented a resource-light model for vectorspace word meaning that represents words as collections of prototype vectors, naturally accounting for lexical ambiguity.
    The multi-prototype approach uses word sense discovery to partition a word&#8217;s contexts and construct &#8220;sense specific&#8221; prototypes for each cluster.
    Doing so significantly increases the accuracy of lexical-similarity computation as demonstrated by improved correlation with human similarity judgements and generation of better near synonyms according to human evaluators.
    Furthermore, we show that, although performance is sensitive to the number of prototypes, combining prototypes across a large range of clusterings performs nearly as well as the ex-post best clustering.
    Finally, variance in the prototype similarities is found to correlate with in
