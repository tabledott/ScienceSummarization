tem probabilities.
    With the consensus hypothesis, the word error rate went down from 29.5 to 28.5%.
    Thus, the negative effect of recognition errors on the translation quality was further reduced.
  
  
    In this work, we proposed a novel, theoretically well-founded procedure for computing a possibly new consensus translation from the outputs of multiple MT systems.
    In summary, the main conthe BTEC Italian-English task through computing consensus translations from the output of two speech translation systems with different types of source language input. tributions of this work compared to previous approaches are as follows: &#8226; The words of the original translation hypotheses are aligned in order to create a confusion network.
    The alignment procedure explicitly models word reordering.
    &#8226; A test corpus of translations generated by each of the systems is used for the unsupervised statistical alignment training.
    Thus, the decision on how to align two translations of a sentence
