ch can be modeled by augmenting 0 on per-problem basis.
  
  
    In this section, we present our global D2W system, which solves the optimization problem in Eq.
    3.
    We refer to the system as GLOW, for Global Wikification.
    We use GLOW as a test bed for evaluating local and global approaches for D2W.
    GLOW combines a powerful local model &#966; with an novel method for choosing an accurate disambiguation context V, which as we show in our experiments allows it to outperform the previous state of the art.
    We represent the functions &#966; and &#968; as weighted sums of features.
    Specifically, we set: where each feature &#966;i(m, t) captures some aspect of the relatedness between the mention m and the Wikipedia title t. Feature functions &#968;i(t, t&#8242;) are defined analogously.
    We detail the specific feature functions utilized in GLOW in following sections.
    The coefficients wi are learned using a Support Vector Machine over bootstrapped training data from Wikipedia, as describ
