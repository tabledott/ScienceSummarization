    The rest of this section describes the summarizer, specifying the planning operators used for summarization as well as a detailed discussion of the summarization algorithm showing how summaries of different length are generated.
    We provide examples of the summarization markers we collected for the lexicon and show the demands that summarization creates for interpretation.
