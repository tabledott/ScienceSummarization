s, and the dependency of discourse anaphora on discourse structure.&amp;quot; With that background, I will now show how tensed clauses share the two properties I set out in Section 1 (repeated here) and hence are further examples of discourse anaphora: To do this, I need to explain the sense in which tensed clauses specify and the way in which that specification can depend on another element in the current context.
    Recall that I presume that a listener's developing discourse model represents both the entities being discussed, along with their properties and relations, and the events and situations being discussed, along with their relationships with another.
    For the rest of this paper, I want to ignore the former and focus on the latter.
