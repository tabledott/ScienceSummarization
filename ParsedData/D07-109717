verage very close to the dry run results, indicating that models have not been overfitted (although there is considerably variation between languages).
			For the Blended parser, there is a drop of almost one percentage point, which can be explained by the fact that weights could not be tuned on held-out data for the dry run (as explained in section 3).
			Comparing the results for different languages, we see a tendency that languages with rich morphology, usually accompanied by flexible word order, get lower scores.
			Thus, the labeled attachment score isbelow 80% for Arabic, Basque, Czech, Greek, Hungarian, and Turkish.
			By comparison, the more con figurational languages (Catalan, Chinese, English,and Italian) all have scores above 80%.
			Linguis tic properties thus seem to be more important than, for example, training set size, which can be seen by comparing the results for Italian, with one of the smallest training sets, and Czech, with one of the largest.
