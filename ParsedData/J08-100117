bility of existing methods for coherence ranking to new applications, most notably to text-to-text generation applications, such as summarization.
    In the next section, we present a method for coherence assessment that overcomes these limitations: We introduce an entity-based representation of discourse that is automatically computed from raw text; we argue that the proposed representation reveals entity transition patterns characteristic of coherent texts.
    The latter can be easily translated into a large feature space which lends itself naturally to the effective learning of a ranking function, without explicit manual involvement.
  
  
    In this section we describe our entity-based representation of discourse.
    We explain how it is computed and how entity transition patterns are extracted.
    We also discuss how these patterns can be encoded as feature vectors appropriate for performing coherencerelated ranking and classification tasks.
    Each text is represented by an entity grid, a two-dime
