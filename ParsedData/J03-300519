    The output of MINIPAR is a dependency tree that represents the dependency relations between words in a sentence.
    Table 3 shows a subset of the dependencies MINIPAR outputs for the sentence The fat cat ate the door mat.
    In contrast to Gsearch and Cass, MINIPAR produces all possible parses for a given sentence.
    The parses are ranked according to the product of the probabilities of their edges, and the most likely parse is returned.
    Lin (1998) evaluated the parser on the SUSANNE corpus (Sampson 1995), a domain-independent corpus of British English, and achieved a recall of 79% and precision of 89% on the dependency relations. mat N:det:Det the determiner of noun mat N:nn:N door prenominal modifier of noun For our experiments, we concentrated solely on adjective-noun, noun-noun, and verb object relations (denoted as N:mod:A, N:nn:N, and V:obj:N in Table 3).
    From the syntactic analysis provided by the parser, we extracted all occurrences of bi
