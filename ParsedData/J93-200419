 the tagged corpus, any incorrect tags assigned at the first, automatic stage are removed.
  The learning curve for the POS tagging task takes under a month (at 15 hours a week), and annotation speeds after a month exceed 3,000 words per hour.
  Two Modes of AnnotationwAn Experiment To determine how to maximize the speed, inter-annotator consistency, and accuracy of POS tagging, we performed an experiment a the very beginning of the project o com- pare two alternative modes of annotation.
  In the first annotation mode ("tagging"), annotators tagged unannotated text entirely by hand; in the second mode ("correct- ing"), they verified and corrected the output of PARTS, modified as described above.

  Building a Large Annotated Corpus of English This experiment showed that manual tagging took about twice as long as correcting, with about twice the inter-annotator disagreement rate and an error rate that was about 50% higher.
