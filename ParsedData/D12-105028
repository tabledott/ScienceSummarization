f the RAE as features for the classifier, it applies dynamic pooling, a procedure that takes a similarity matrix as input (e.g., created by sentences with differing lengths) and maps it to a matrix of fixed size that represents more faithfully the global similarity structure.3 Overall, we observe that our own models do as well as some of the models that employ WordNet and more sophisticated syntactic features.
    With regard to F1, we are comparable with Das and Smith (2009) and Socher et al. (2011a) without using elaborate features, or any additional manipulations over and above the output of the composition functions 3Without dynamic pooling, their model yields an accuracy of 74.2. which if added could increase performance.
  
  
    In this paper we systematically compared three types of distributional representation and their effect on semantic composition.
    Our comparisons involved a simple distributional semantic space (Mitchell and Lapata, 2010), word embeddings computed with a neural language mode
