 call its address.
    Let A@k denote the node at address k, where A is the non-terminal labeling that node.
    We will need to create one new nonterminal for each node in the training data.
    We will call this non-terminal Ak.
    We will call nonterminals of this form &amp;quot;interior&amp;quot; non-terminals, and the original non-terminals in the parse trees &amp;quot;exterior&amp;quot;.
    Let aj represent the number of subtrees headed by the node Aaj.
    Let a represent the number of subtrees headed by nodes with non-terminal A, that is a = E &#8226; a &#8226; How many subtrees does it have?
    Consider first the possibilities on the left branch.
    There are bk non-trivial subtrees headed by Bak, and there is also the trivial case where the left node is simply B.
    Thus there are bk + 1 different possibilities on the left branch.
    Similarly, for the right branch there are ci + 1 possibilities.
    We can create a subtree by choosing any possible left subtree and any possible right subtree.
