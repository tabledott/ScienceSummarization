l, understandably, because SYNT-TAG is the simpler grammar.
    LDA is an acronym for Lightweight Dependency Analyzer (Srinivas (1997)).
    Given as input a supertagged sequence of words, it outputs a partial dependency parse.
    It takes advantage of the fact that supertagging provides an almost-parse in order to dependency parse the sentence in a simple, deterministic fashion.
    Basic LDA is a two step procedure.
    The first step involves linking each word serving as a modifier with the word that it modifies.
    The second step involves linking each word serving as an argument with its predicate.
    Linking always only occurs so that grammatical requirements as stipulated by the supertags are satisfied.
    The version of LDA that is used in this work differs from Srinivas (1997) in that there are other constraints on the linking process.3 In particular, a link is not established if its existence would create crossing brackets or cycles in the dependency tree for the sentence.
    We perform LDA on
