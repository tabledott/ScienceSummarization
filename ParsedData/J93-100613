ch, either of them could be used as a heuristic in the construction of the initial AST in our algorithm.
    In the current version, the number of candidate sentence pairs that are considered in the first pass near the middle of a text contributes disproportionally to the cost of the computation.
    In fact, as we remarked earlier, the of this step is proposed modification would effectively make it linear.

    Future Work For most practical purposes, the alignment algorithm we have described produces very satisfactory results, even when applied to relatively free translations.
    There are doubtless many places in which the algorithm itself could be improved.
    For example, it is clear that the present method of building the SAT favors associations between long sentences, and this is not surprising, because there is more information in long sentences.
    But we have not investigated the extent of this bias and we do not therefore know it as appropriate.
    The present algorithm rests on being abl
