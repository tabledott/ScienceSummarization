; sit above the baseline.
    The dip is due to the fact that while TroFi can generate some beneficial similarities between words related by context, it can also generate some detrimental ones.
    When we use sum of similarities, it is possible for the transitively discovered indirect similarities between a target nonliteral sentence and all the sentences in a feedback set to add up to more than a single direct similarity between the target sentence and a single feedback set sentence.
    This is not possible with highest similarity because a single sentence would have to show a higher similarity to the target sentence than that produced by sharing an identical word, which is unlikely since transitively discovered similarities generally do not add up to 1.
    So, although highest similarity occasionally produces better results than using sum of similarities, on average we can expect to get better results with the latter.
    In this experiment alone, we get an average f-score of 46.3% for the sum of similar
