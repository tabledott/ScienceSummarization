) = 18 data points were collected for each ROUGE measure and each DUC task.
    To assess the significance of the results, we applied bootstrap resampling technique (Davison and Hinkley, 1997) to estimate 95% confidence intervals for every correlation computation.
    17 ROUGE measures were tested for each run using ROUGE evaluation package v1.2.1: ROUGE-N with N = 1 to 9, ROUGE-L, ROUGE-W with weighting factor a = 1.2, ROUGE-S and ROUGE-SU with maximum skip distance d,1,,o = 1, 4, and 9.
    Due to limitation of space, we only report correlation analysis results based on Pearson&#8217;s correlation coefficient.
    Correlation analyses based on Spearman&#8217;s and Kendall&#8217;s correlation coefficients are tracking Pearson&#8217;s very closely and will be posted later at the ROUGE website5 for reference.
    The critical value6 for Pearson&#8217;s correlation is 0.632 at 95% confidence with 8 degrees of freedom.
    Table 1 shows the Pearson&#8217;s correlation coefficients of the 17 ROUGE measures vs. hu
