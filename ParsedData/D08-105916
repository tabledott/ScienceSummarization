s which contain partial parse trees, and so provides all the information needed by the graph-based parser (i.e. dependency graphs), and hence the combined system.
    In summary, we build the combined parser by using a global linear model, the union of feature templates and the decoder from the transition-based parser.
  
  
    We evaluate the parsers using the English and Chinese Penn Treebank corpora.
    The English data is prepared by following McDonald et al. (2005).
    Bracketed sentences from the Penn Treebank (PTB) 3 are split into training, development and test sets as shown in Table 4, and then translated into dependency structures using the head-finding rules from Yamada and Matsumoto (2003).
    Before parsing, POS tags are assigned to the input sentence using our reimplementation of the POStagger from Collins (2002).
    Like McDonald et al. (2005), we evaluate the parsing accuracy by the precision of lexical heads (the percentage of input words, excluding punctuation, that have been assigned t
