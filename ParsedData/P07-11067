t of Collins and Roark Denote the global feature vector for segmented (2004) who used a beam-search decoder as part of sentence y with 4b(y) E Rd, where d is the total a perceptron parsing model.
    Our work can also be number of features in the model; then Score(y) is seen as part of the recent move towards search-based computed by the dot product of vector 4b(y) and a learning methods which do not rely on dynamic pro- parameter vector &#945; E Rd, where &#945;z is the weight for gramming and are thus able to exploit larger parts of the ith feature: the context for making decisions (Daume III, 2006).
    Score(y) = -b(y) &#183; &#945; We study several factors that influence the performance of the perceptron word segmentor, including the averaged perceptron method, the size of the 841 Inputs: training examples (xi, yi) The perceptron training algorithm is used to determine the weight values &#945;.
    The training algorithm initializes the parameter vector as all zeros, and updates the vector by decoding th
