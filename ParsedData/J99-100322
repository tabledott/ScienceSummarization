e usually too sparse to build an accurate bitext map from.
    When the matching predicate cannot generate enough candidate correspondence points based on cognates, its signal can be strengthened by a seed translation lexicon&#8212; a simple list of word pairs that are believed to be mutual translations.
    Seed translation lexicons can be extracted from machine-readable bilingual dictionaries (MRBDs) in the rare cases where MRBDs are available.
    In other cases, they can be constructed automatically or semiautomatically using any of several published methods (Fung and Church 1994; Fung 1995; Melamed 1996b; Resnik &amp; Melamed 1997).3 A matching predicate based on a seed translation lexicon deems two candidate tokens to be mutual translations if the token pair appears in the lexicon.
    Since the matching predicate need not be perfectly accurate, the seed translation lexicons need not be perfectly accurate either.
    All the matching predicates described above can be fine-tuned with stop lists for one o
