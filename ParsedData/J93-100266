 loves her using Grammar 1, the distinction between reducing the first pronoun and second pronoun to NP&#8212;using rule 5 (NP --&gt; ProNP)&#8212; can be maintained in terms of the different lookahead items paired with the reduce actions relating to this rule (in state 5 of the parse table in Figure 2); in the first case, the lookahead item will be Vi, and in the second $ (the end of sentence marker).
    However, this approach does not make maximal use of the context encoded into a transition in the parse table, and it is possible to devise situations in which the reduction of a pronoun in subject position and elsewhere would be indistinguishable in terms of lookahead alone; for example, if we added appropriate rules for adverbs to Grammar 1, then this reduction would be possible with lookahead Adv in sentences such as he passionately loves her and he loves her passionately.
    A slightly less obvious approach is to further subdivide reduce actions according to the state reached after the reduce action has
