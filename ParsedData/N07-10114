moving to the First-Order Logic Model, the number of possible predictions has increased exponentially.
    In the Pairwise Model, the number of possible y variables is O(|x|2), where x is the set of noun phrases.
    In the First-Order Logic Model, the number of possible y variables is O(21&amp;quot;l): There is a y variable for each possible element of the powerset of x.
    Of course, we do not enumerate this set; rather, we incrementally instantiate y variables as needed during prediction.
    A simple method to generate training examples is to sample positive and negative cluster examples uniformly at random from the training data.
    Positive examples are generated by first sampling a true cluster, then sampling a subset of that cluster.
    Negative examples are generated by sampling two positive examples and merging them into the same cluster.
    At testing time, we perform standard greedy agglomerative clustering, where the score for each merger is proportional to the probability of the newly formed
