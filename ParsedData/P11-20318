chasticity of the optimizer.
    As discussed above, different optimization runs find different local maxima.
    The noise due to this variable can depend on many number of factors, including the number of random restarts used (in MERT), the number of features in a model, the number of references, the language pair, the portion of the search space visible to the optimizer (e.g.
    10best, 100-best, a lattice, a hypergraph), and the size of the tuning set.
    Unfortunately, there is no proxy to estimate this effect as with bootstrap resampling.
    To control for this variable, we must run the optimizer multiple times to estimate the spread it induces on the development set.
    Using the n optimizer samples, with mi as the translation quality measurement of 5METEOR version 1.2 with English ranking parameters and all modules. the development set for the ith optimization run, and m is the average of all mis, we report the standard deviation over the tuning set as sdev: (mi &#8722; m)2 n &#8722; 1 A high sdev
