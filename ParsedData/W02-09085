    The second system component performs nearestneighbour or cluster analysis to determine which terms are similar based on their context vectors.
    Both methods require a function that calculates the similarity between context vectors.
    For experimental analysis we have decomposed this function into measure and weight functions.
    The measure function calculates the similarity between two weighted context vectors and the weight function calculates a weight from the raw frequency information for each context relation.
    The primary experiments in this paper evaluate the performance of various existing and new measure and weight functions, which are described in the next section.
    The simplest algorithm for thesaurus extraction is nearest-neighbour comparison, which involves pairwise vector comparison of the target with every extracted term.
    Given n terms and up to m attributes for each term, the asymptotic time complexity of nearest-neighbour thesaurus extraction i
