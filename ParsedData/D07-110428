e concerned with.
			The first case consists of all patterns prefixed with X . The paths to nodes representing these patterns 982 will all contain the X-edge originating at the rootnode.
			All of these paths form the shadow subtree.
			Path construction in this subtree proceeds dif ferently.
			Because they are lexically identical to theirsuffixes, they are automatically extended if their suffix paths are active, and they inherit location infor mation of their suffixes.
			The second case consists of all patterns suffixedwith X . Whenever we successfully find a new pat tern ?, we automatically extend it with an X edge,provided that ?X is allowed by the model con straints.
			The node pointed to by this edge inheritsits location information from its parent node (repre senting the maximal prefix ?).
			Note that both special cases occur for patterns in the form XuX . 5.5 Memory Requirements.
			As shown in Callison-Burch et al (2005), we must keep an array for the source text F , its suffix array,the target te
