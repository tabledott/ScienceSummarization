 heuristic method had to be employed.
    Probabilities were therefore estimated as the average of individual probabilities conditioned on a single word.
    Another problem is that the model is no longer consistent when unification constraints such as those in HPSG are introduced.
    Our solution is free of these problems, and is applicable to various grammars, not only HPSG and CCG.
    Most of the state-of-the-art studies on parsing with lexicalized grammars have adopted feature forest models (Clark and Curran 2003, 2004b; Kaplan et al. 2004; Riezler and Vasserman 2004).
    Their methods of translating parse results into feature forests are basically the same as our method described in Section 4, and details differ because different grammar theories represent syntactic structures differently.
    They reported higher accuracy in parsing the Penn Treebank than the previous methods introduced herein, and these results attest the effectiveness of feature forest models in practical deep parsing.
