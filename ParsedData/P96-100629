This approach integrates a diverse set of knowledge sources to disambiguate word sense.
    When tested on a common data set, our WSD program gives higher classification accuracy than previous work on WSD.
    When tested on a large, separately collected data set, our program performs better than the default strategy of picking the most frequent sense.
    To our knowledge, this is the first time that a WSD program has been tested on such a large scale, and yielding results better than the most frequent heuristic on highly ambiguous words with the refined senses of WORDNET.
  
  
    We would like to thank: Dr Paul Wu for sharing the Brown Corpus and Wall Street Journal Corpus; Dr Christopher Ting for downloading and installing WORDNET and SEMCOR, and for reformatting the corpora; the 12 undergraduates from the Linguistics Program of the National University of Singapore for preparing the sense-tagged corpus; and Prof K. P. Mohanan for his support of the sense-tagging project.
