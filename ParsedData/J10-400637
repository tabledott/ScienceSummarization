ed with words w1, and vector dimensions are labeled with tuples of type (l, w2); word&#8211;word by link (W1W2xL): vectors are labeled with tuples of type (w1, w2), and vector dimensions are labeled with links l; word&#8211;link by word (W1LxW2): vectors are labeled with tuples of type (w1,l), and vector dimensions are labeled with words w2; link by word&#8211;word (LxW1W2): vectors are labeled with links l and vector dimensions are labeled with tuples of type (w1,w2).
    Words like marine and teacher are represented in the W1xLW2 space by vectors whose dimensions correspond to features such as (use, gun) or (own, book).
    In this space, we can measure the similarity of words to each other, in order to tackle attributional similarity tasks such as synonym detection or concept categorization.
    The W1W2xL vectors represent instead word pairs in a space whose dimensions are links, and it can be used to measure relational similarity among different pairs.
    For example, one could notice that the link vect
