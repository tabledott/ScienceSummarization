 be defined similarly.
			Inspection of Equations (6) and (9) reveals that the only difference between the maximum likelihood and the mean-fieldupdate is that the latter applies the exp(?(?)) func tion to the counts (Figure 5).
			When the truncation K is large, ?B?zl?zr is near 0 for most right-hand sides (zl, zr), so exp(?(?)) hasthe effect of downweighting counts.
			Since this sub traction affects large counts more than small counts,there is a rich-get-richer effect: rules that have al ready have large counts will be preferred.
			Specifically, consider a set of rules with the same left-hand side.
			The weights for all these rules only differ in the numerator (Equation (9)), so applying exp(?(?)) creates a local preference for right-hand sides with larger counts.
			Also note that the rule weights are not normalized; they always sum to at most one and are equal to one exactly when q(?)
			isdegenerate.
			This lack of normalization gives an extra degree of freedom not present in maximum like lihood estim
