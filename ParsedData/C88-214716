n OA constraint.
  Further, the root nodes in c~1 and c~2 have SA constraints that allow for adjunetion only by fll and f~2 respectively: As seen in the Figure 8, corresponding to the FTAG fragment, we can make use of the fact that constraints are dynamically inatantiated and give only one specification of ill.
  When used in the derivation of What do you think Mary thought John saw troot inherits the feature inverted : + which it otherwise does not have, and broot inherits the feature inverted : - .
  Thus, the node which corre- sponds to root of ill, by the dynamic instantiation ofthe feature structure, gets an OA constraint.
  Note that there will not be any OA eoustraint in nodes of the final tree corresponding to What do you think Mary thought John saw.
  Also, the root of the auxiliary tree, corresponding to Mary thought S, does not get OA constraint, when this tree is used in the derivation of the sentence Mary thought John saw Peter.
