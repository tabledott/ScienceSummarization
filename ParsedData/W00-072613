memory-based learning systems to produce different representations of the chunk tags.
    A combination of the five by majority voting performed better than the individual parts.
    Van Halteren (2000) used Weighted Probability Distribution Voting (WPDV) for combining the results of four WPDV chunk taggers and a memory-based chunk tagger.
    Again the combination outperformed the individual systems.
    Kudoh and Matsumoto (2000) created 231 support vector machine classifiers to predict the unique pairs of chunk tags.
    The results of the classifiers were combined by a dynamic programming algorithm.
    The performance of the systems can be found in Table 2.
    A baseline performance was obtained by selecting the chunk tag most frequently associated with a POS tag.
    All systems outperform the baseline.
    The majority of the systems reached an Fo=1 score between 91.50 and 92.50.
    Two approaches performed a lot better: the combination system WPDV used by Van Halteren and the Support Vector Machines
