word spellings and pronunciations.
  
  
    The optimal way to analyze linguistic data into its primitive elements is rarely obvious but often crucial.
    Identifying phones and words in speech has been a major focus of research.
    Automatically finding words in text, the problem addressed here, is largely unsolved for languages such as Chinese and Thai, which are written without spaces (but see Fung Sz Wu, 1994; Sproat et al., 1996).
    Spaces in texts of languages like English offer an easy first approximation to minimal content-bearing units.
    However, this approximation mis-analyzes non-compositional compounds (NCCs) such as &amp;quot;kick the bucket&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;hot dog.&amp;quot; NCCs are compound words whose meanings are a matter of convention and cannot be synthesized from the meanings of their space-delimited components.
    Treating NCCs as multiple words degrades the performance of machine translation (MT), information retrieval, natural language generation, and most other NLP ap
