    10 Conclusion The advantages of unlexicalized grammars are clear enough &#8211; easy to estimate, easy to parse with, and timeand space-efficient.
    However, the dismal performance of basic unannotated unlexicalized grammars has generally rendered those advantages irrelevant.
    Here, we have shown that, surprisingly, the maximum-likelihood estimate of a compact unlexiparse on par with early lexicalized parsers.
    We do not want to argue that lexical selection is not a worthwhile component of a state-ofthe-art parser &#8211; certain attachments, at least, require it &#8211; though perhaps its necessity has been overstated.
    Rather, we have shown ways to improve parsing, some easier than lexicalization, and others of which are orthogonal to it, and could presumably be used to benefit lexicalized parsers as
