minimize the Huber loss with stochastic gradient descent (Zhang, 3For a description of the construction of the polarity dataset, see http://www.cs.cornell.edu/people/ pabo/movie-review-data/.
    2004).
    On the polarity dataset, this model matches the results reported by Pang et al. (2002).
    When we report results with SCL and SCL-MI, we require that pivots occur in more than five documents in each domain.
    We set k, the number of singular vectors of the weight matrix, to 50.
  
  
    Each labeled dataset was split into a training set of 1600 instances and a test set of 400 instances.
    All the experiments use a classifier trained on the training set of one domain and tested on the test set of a possibly different domain.
    The baseline is a linear classifier trained without adaptation, while the gold standard is an in-domain classifier trained on the same domain as it is tested.
    Figure 1 gives accuracies for all pairs of domain adaptation.
    The domains are ordered clockwise from the top
