    Precision is the most likely metric to be improved.
    For a composite algorithm, recall cannot be increased: if neither NP, PAUSE, nor CUE found a boundary, then no combination of them can.
    However, the composite algorithms use narrower criteria for boundaries, which should reduce the number of false positives.
    The precision of the additive algorithms is indeed higher than any of the algorithms alone.
    PAUSE/NP has the best additive algorithm performance as measured by the summed deviation.
    4.2.5 Discussion.
    By using average human performance as a baseline against which to evaluate algorithms, we are asking whether algorithms perform in a manner that reflects an abstraction over a population of humans, rather than whether they perform like a typical human.
    No algorithm or combination of algorithms performs as well as this baseline.
    The referring expression algorithm (NP) performs better than the other unimodal algorithms (PAUSE and CUE), and a combination of PAUSE and N
