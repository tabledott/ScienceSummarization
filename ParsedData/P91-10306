    Of the noun phrase objects identified, 223,666 were ambiguous verb-noun-preposition triples.
    Of course, the table of verbs, nouns and prepositions does not directly tell us what the strength lexical associations are.
    There are three potential sources of noise in the model.
    First, the parser in some cases gives us false analyses.
    Second, when a preposition follows a noun phrase (or verb), it may or may not be structurally related to that noun phrase (or verb).
    (In our terms, it may attach to that noun phrase or it may attach somewhere else).
    And finally, even if we get accurate attachment information, it may be that frequency of cooccurrence is not a good indication of strength of attachment.
    We will proceed to build the model of lexical association strength, aware of these sources of noise.
    We want to use the verb-noun-preposition table to derive a table of bigr
