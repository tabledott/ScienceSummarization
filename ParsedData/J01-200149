ure list, and an information cost which increases as probability decreases, that overcomes that problem.
    Creating a new signature may save some information associated with the stem list in the morphology, but since the length of pointers to a signature a is &#8212; log freq (a), the length of the pointers to the signatures for all of the words in the corpus associated with the old signature (-0, -ed, -s, -ing) or the new signature (-ts, -ted, -ting, -ts) will be longer than the length of the pointers to a signature whose token count is the sum of the token count of the two combined, i.e., The model presented above is too simple in that it underestimates the gain achieved by morphological analysis in case the word that is analyzed is also a stem of a larger word.
    For example, if a corpus contains the words work and working, then morphological analysis will allow us to dispense with the form working; it is modeled by the stem work and the suffixes -0 and -ing.
    If the corpus also includes workings, t
