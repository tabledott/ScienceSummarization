ever, that the similarity information around paragraph 12 is weak.
    This paragraph briefly summarizes the contents of the previous three paragraphs; much of the terminology that occurred in all of them reappears in Judgments of seven readers on the Stargazer text.
    Internal numbers indicate location of gaps between paragraphs; x-axis indicates token-sequence gap number, y-axis indicates judge number, a break in a horizontal line indicates a judge-specified segment break.
    Results of the block similarity algorithm on the Stargazer text with k set to 10 and the loose boundary cutoff limit.
    Both the smoothed and unsmoothed plot are shown.
    Internal numbers indicate paragraph numbers, x-axis indicates token-sequence gap number, y-axis indicates similarity between blocks centered at the corresponding token-sequence gap.
    Vertical lines indicate boundaries chosen by the algorithm; for example, the leftmost vertical line represents a boundary after paragraph 3.
    Note how these align with the bo
