			The subsections that follow present the construction of the graph for our random walk from WordNet and the mathematics of computing the stationary distribution for a given word.
			3.1 Graph Construction.
			WordNet is itself a graph over synsets.
			A synset is best thought of as a concept evoked by one sense of one or more words.
			For instance, different senses of the word ?bank?
			take part in different synsets (e.g. a river bank versus a financial institution), and a single synset can be represented by multiple synonymous words, such as?middle?
			and ?center.?
			WordNet explicitly marks seman tic relationships between synsets, but we are additionally interested in representing relatedness between words.
			Wetherefore extract the following types of nodes fromWord Net: Synset Each WordNet synset has a corresponding node.For example, one node corresponds to the synset re ferred to by ?dog#n#3,?
			the third sense of dog as noun, whose meani
