 tree pairs whose ranking falls below some empirically determined cutoff.
    As we show in &#167;6.3, by using this technique we are able to speed up reranking by a factor of almost 20 without an appreciable loss of performance.
  
  
    All the data used to train the joint parsing model and to evaluate parsing performance were taken from articles 1-325 of the Chinese treebank, which all have English translations with gold-standard parse trees.
    The articles were split into training, development, and test sets according to the standard breakdown for Chinese parsing evaluations.
    Not all sentence pairs could be included for various reasons, including one-to-many Chinese-English sentence alignments, sentences omitted from the English translations, and low-fidelity translations.
    Additional sentence pairs were dropped from the training data because they had unambiguous parses in at least one of the two languages.
    Table 1 shows how many sentences were included in each dataset.
    We had two traini
