of our results include significant improvement via an SVM classifier, improvement from new features and a series of analytic experiments on the contributions of the features.
			Addingfeatures that are generalizations of the more specific features seemed to help.
			These features were named enti ties, head word part of speech and verb clusters.
			We also analyzed the transferability of the features to a new text source.
			We would like to thank Ralph Weischedel and Scott Miller ofBBN Inc. for letting us use their named entity tagger ? Iden tiFinder; Martha Palmer for providing us with the PropBank data, Valerie Krugler for tagging the AQUAINT test set with PropBank arguments, and all the anonymous reviewers for their helpful comments.
