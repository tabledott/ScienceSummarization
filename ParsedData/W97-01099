arest common ancestor in the hierarchy, we calculate the distance as an average of the distance of the two concepts to their nearest common ancestor divided by the depth in the WordNet Hierarchy:
  
  
    where L1, L2 are the lengths of paths between the concepts and the nearest common ancestor, and D1, D2 are the depths of each concept in the hierarchy (the distance to the root).
    The more abstract the concepts are (the higher in hierarchy), the bigger the distance.
    The same concepts have a distance equal to 0; concepts with no common ancestor have a distance equal to 1.
    Because the verb hierarchy is rather shallow and wide, the distance between many verbal concepts is often In order to determine the position of a word in the semantic hierarchy, we have to determine the meaning of the word from the context in which it appears.
    For example, the noun bank can take any of the nine meanings defined in WordNet (financial institution, building, ridge, container, slope, etc.).
