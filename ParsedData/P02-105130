a named entity identifier with the same tag we are interested in.
    This way we can eliminate counting wrong translations such as enthusiasm when translating &#8220; h. m&#175;as&#8221; (Hamas).
  
  
    We have presented a named entity translation algorithm that performs at near human translation accuracy when translating Arabic named entities to English.
    The algorithm uses very limited amount of hard-to-obtain bilingual resources and should be easily adaptable to other languages.
    We would like to apply to other languages such as Chinese and Japanese and to investigate whether the current algorithm would perform as well or whether new algorithms might be needed.
    Currently, our translation algorithm does not use any dictionary of named entities and they are translated on the fly.
    Translating a common name incorrectly has a significant effect on the translation accuracy.
    We would like to experiment with adding a small named entity translation dictionary for common names and see if this m
