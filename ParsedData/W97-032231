 (Wilks et al., 1990)).
    They use co-occurrence data gathered from the machine-readable version of LDOCE to define neighborhoods of related words.
    Conceptually, the neighborhood of a word is a type of equivalence class.
    It is composed of all other words that co-occur with the designated word a significant number of times in the LDOCE sense definitions.
    These neighborhoods are used to increase the number of words in the LDOCE sense definitions, while still maintaining some measure of lexical cohesion.
    The &amp;quot;expanded&amp;quot; sense definitions are then compared to the context of an ambiguous word, and the sensedefinition with the greatest number of word overlaps with the context is selected as correct.
    (Guthrie et al., 1991) propose that neighborhoods be subject dependent.
    They suggest that a word should potentially have different neighborhoods corresponding to the different LDOCE subject code.
    Subjectspecific neighborhoods are composed of words having at least one sense
