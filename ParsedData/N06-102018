 unknown words.
    This is because we also asked the program to do a model search using the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) over all single and pairwise factors.
    The model it chooses predicts that the selftrained parser is likely produce a better parse than the baseline only for sentences of length 20&#8211;40 or sentences containing several CCs.
    It did not include the number of unknown words and the number of INs as factors because they did not receive a weight significantly different from zero, and the AIC model search dropped them as factors from the model.
    In other words, the self-trained parser is more likely to be correct for sentences of length 20&#8211; 40 and as the number of CCs in the sentence increases.
    The self-trained parser does not improve prepositional-phrase attachment or the handling of unknown words.
    This result is mildly perplexing.
    It is fair to say that neither we, nor anyone we talked to, thought conjunction handling would be improved.
    Conjunctions are a
