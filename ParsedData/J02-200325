ubset of the BNC, with 303 cases of an argument in the object position of stir.
    The G2 statistic is used, together with an &#945; value of 0.05.
    Initially, top is set to (soup), and the probabilities corresponding to the children of (dish) are compared: p(stir  |(soup),obj), p(stir  |(lasagne),obj), p(stir | (haggis),obj), and so on for the rest of the children.
    The chi-square test results in a G2 value of 14.5, compared to a critical value of 55.8.
    Since G2 is less than the critical value, the procedure moves up to the next node.
    This process continues until a significant result is obtained, which first occurs at (substance) when comparing the children of (object).
    Thus (substance) is the chosen level of generalization.
    Now we show how the chosen level of generalization varies with &#945; and how it varies with the size of the data set.
    A note of clarification is required before presenting the results.
