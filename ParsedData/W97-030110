 predicates for TAG, CHUNK, BUILD, and CHECK are used to scan the derivations of the trees in the corpus to form the training samples T 'TcHEci,, respectively.
    Each training sample has the form T = (ai b1), (a2, b2), , (as, bs)}, where ai is an action of the corresponding procedure and bi is the list of contextual predicates that were true in the context in which ai was decided.
    The training samples are respectively used to create the models n TAG, PCHUNK PBUILD and PCHECK all of which have the form: malization constant, aj are the model parameters, 0 &lt; aj &lt;00, and fj(a, b) E 10,1} are called features, j = {1... k}.
    Features encode an action a' as well as some contextual predicate cp that a tree-building procedure would find useful for predicting the action a'.
    Any contextual predicate cp derived from table 3 which occurs 5 or more times in a training sample with a particular action a' is used to construct a feature fj: for use in the corresponding model.
    Each feature fj corresponds
