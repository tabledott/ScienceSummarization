presented in Tillmann, Vogel, Ney, and Zubiaga (1997) and Tillmann, Vogel, Ney, Zubiaga, and Sawaf (1997).
    This approach assumes that source and target language have the same word order, and word order differences are dealt with in a preprocessing stage.
    The work by Wu (1996) also uses the original IBM model parameters and obtains an efficient search algorithm by restricting the possible word reorderings using the so-called stochastic bracketing transduction grammar.
    Three different decoders for the IBM-4 translation model are compared in Germann et al. (2001).
    The first is a reimplementation of the stack-based decoder described in Berger et al. (1996).
    The second is a greedy decoder that starts with an approximate solution and then iteratively improves this first rough solution.
    The third converts the decoding problem into an integer program (IP), and a standard software package for solving IP is used.
    Although the last approach is guaranteed to find the optimal solution, it is te
