   For our purpose, the relational representation contains only those relations that involve at least one ambiguous word.
    The relational representation for example (4) is given in (6) (for readability we represent the Hebrew word by its English equivalent, prefixed by 'H' to denote the fact that it is a Hebrew word): The relational representation of a source sentence is reflected also in its translation to a target sentence.
    In some cases the relational representation of the target sentence is completely equivalent to that of the source sentence, and can be achieved just by substituting the source words with target words.
    In other cases, the mapping between source and target relations is more complicated, as is the case for the following German example: (7) Der Tisch gefaellt nair.
    &#8212; I like the table.
    Here, the original subject of the source sentence becomes the object in the target sentence.
    This kind of mapping usually influences the translation process and is therefore encoded
