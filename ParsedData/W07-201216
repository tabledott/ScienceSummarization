eline provides aclustering solution where all the documents are assigned to a single cluster.
			This has the effect of always achieving the highest score in the inverse purity measure, because all classes have their docu ments in a single cluster.
			On the other hand, the purity measure will be equal to the precision of thepredominant class in that single cluster.
			The ONE IN-ONE baseline gives another extreme clusteringsolution, where every document is assigned to a dif ferent cluster.
			In this case purity always gives its maximum value, while inverse purity will decrease with larger classes.
			2.4 Campaign design.
			The schedule for the evaluation campaign was set by the SemEval organisation as follows: (i) release task description and trial data set; (ii) release of training and test; (iii) participants send their answers to the task organizers; (iv) the task organizers evaluate the answers and send the results.
			The task description and the initial trial data set were publicly released before th
