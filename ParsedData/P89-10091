es that goal recursively to produce a plan consisting of oper- ations at a level of detail commensurate with the assumed knowledge of the hearer.
  In order to de- scribe the resulting plan, EPICURE then models its execution, so that the processes which produce referring expressions always have access to a rep- resentation of the ingredients in the state they are in at the time of description.
  This paper describes that part of the system responsible for the generation of subsequent refer- ring expressions, i.e., references to entities which have already been mentioned in the discourse.
  The most notable features of the approach taken here are as follows: (a) the use of a sophisticated un- derlying ontology, to permit the representation f non-singular entities; (b) the use of two levels of se- mantic representation, i  conjunction with a model of the discourse, to produce appropriate anaphoric referring expressions; (c) the use of a notion of dis- crimiaatory power, to determine what properties should be us
