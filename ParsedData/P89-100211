mpletion steps in Earley's algorithm, whether used for parsing or generation, correspond to a post-order traversal (with prediction acting as a pre-order filter).
    The left-to-right traversal order of both of these methods is geared towards the given information in a parsing problem, the string, rather than that of a generation problem, the goal logical form.
    It is exactly this mismatch between structure of the traversal and 2Pereira and Warren (1983) point out that Earley deduction is not restricted to a left-to-right expansion of goals, but this suggestion was not followed up with a specific algorithm addressing the problems discussed here.
    3We use the term &amp;quot;analysis tree&amp;quot; rather than the more familiar &amp;quot;parse tree&amp;quot; to make clear that the source of the tree is not necessarily a parsing process; rather the tree serves only to codify a particular analysis of the structure of the string. structure of the problem premise that accounts for the profligacy of these app
