ee transducers is the large and useful body of literature about these automata; two excellent surveys are (G&#233;cseg and Steinby, 1984) and (Comon et al., 1997).
    For example, R is not closed under composition (Rounds, 1970), and neither are RL or F (the &#8220;frontier-to-root&#8221; cousin of R), but the non-copying FL is closed under composition.
    Many of these composition results are first found in (Engelfriet, 1975).
    R has surprising ability to change the structure of an input tree.
    For example, it may not be initially obvious how an R transducer can transform the English structure S(PRO, VP(V, NP)) into the Arabic equivalent S(V, PRO, NP), as it is difficult to move the subject PRO into position between the verb V and the direct object NP.
    First, R productions have no lookahead capability&#8212;the left-handside of the S production consists only of q S(x0, x1), although we want our English-to-Arabic transformation to apply only when it faces the entire structure q S(PRO, VP(V, NP)).
