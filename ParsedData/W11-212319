t for mid-sentence fragments.
    Storing state therefore becomes a time-space tradeoff; for example, we store state with partial hypotheses in Moses but not with each phrase.
    To optimize left-to-right queries, we extend state to store backoff information: where m is the minimal context from Section 4.1 and b is the backoff penalty.
    Because b is a function, no additional hypothesis splitting happens.
    As noted in Section 1, our code finds the longest matching entry wnf for query p(wn|s(wn&#8722;1 f ) The probability p(wn|wn&#8722;1 f ) is stored with wnf and the backoffs are immediately accessible in the provided state s(wn&#8722;1 When our code walks the data structure to find wnf , it visits wnn, wnn&#8722;1, ... , wnf .
    Each visited entry wni stores backoff b(wni ).
    These are written to the state s(wn1) and returned so that they can be used for the following query.
    Saving state allows our code to walk the data structure exactly once per query.
    Other packages walk their respective
