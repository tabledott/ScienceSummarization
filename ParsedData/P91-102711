, and auxiliary verbs.
    The grammar for detecting SFs needs to distinguish three types of complements: direct objects, infinitives, and clauses.
    The grammars for each of these are presented in Figure 1.
    Any open-class word judged to be a verb (see Section 2) and followed immediately by matches for &lt;DO&gt;, &lt;clause&gt;, &lt;infinitive&gt;, &lt;DO&gt; &lt;clause&gt;, or &lt;D0&gt;&lt;inf&gt; is assigned the corresponding SF.

    The category previously-noted-uninflected-verb is special in that it is not fixed in advance &#8212; open-class nonadverbs are added to it when they occur following an unambiguous modal.'
    This is the only case in which the program makes use of earlier decisions &#8212; literally bootstrapping.
    Note, however, that ambiguity is possible between mass nouns and uninflec
