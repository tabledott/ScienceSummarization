ous inflected forms.
    For example, Table 9 shows the contrast in the distribution of inflected forms between project and board on the one hand and operate and follow on the other.
    Project and board are two words whose frequent occurrence as nouns has caused Lerner to make false positive errors.
    In both cases, the stem and -s forms are much more common than the -ed and -ing forms.
    Compare this to the distribution for the unambiguous verbs operate and follow.
    In these cases the diversity of frequencies is much lower and does not display the characteristic pattern of a word that occurs primarily as a noun&#8212; -ing and -ed forms that are much rarer than the -s and stem forms.
    Similar characteristic patterns exist for words that occur primarily as adjectives.
    Recognizing such ambiguity patterns automatically would allow a separate error rate to be estimated for the highly ambiguous words.
    From the perspective of computational language acquisition, a natural direction in which to e
