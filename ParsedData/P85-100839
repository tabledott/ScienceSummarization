spects of the total process should be in the service of discourse interpretation.
    This includes the semantic translation of sentences into a logical form, and indeed the logical notation itself.
    Discourse interpretation processes, as I see them, are inferential processes that manipulate or perform deductions on logical expressions encoding the information in the text and on other logical expressions encoding the speaker's and hearer's background knowledge.
    These considerations lead to two principal criteria for &#8226; logical notation.
    Criterion I: The notation should be as close to English as possible.
    This makes it easier to specify the rules for translation between English and the formal language, and also makes it easier to encode in logical notation facts we normally think of in English.
    The ideal choice by this criterion is English itself, but it fails monumentally on the second criterion.
    Criterion II: The notation should be syntactically simple.
