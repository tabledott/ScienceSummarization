in rule.
    One key issue is to make linguistically plausible assumptions to determine which conditioning variables in the terms should be deleted.
    Following our discussion in the first part of this section, we may start by making an order-s Markov approximation centered around the head, i.e., we condition each binary variable (e.g., kir) on a context of up to s sister constituents between the current constituent and the head (e.g., (Ri&#8722;s, ... , Ri)).
    In order to incorporate bilexical dependencies between the head and each modifier, we also condition all modifier probabilities on head variables H (and kh).
    These assumptions are overall quite similar to the ones made in Markovized parsing models.
    If we assume that all other conditioning variables in Equation 6 are irrelevant, we write: Note that it is important to condition deletions on both constituent histories (Ri&#8722;s, ... , Ri) and nondeletion histories (ki&#8722;s r , ... , ki&#8722;1 r ); otherwise we would be unable to perform
