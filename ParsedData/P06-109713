observe: improvement for the first, second and third iterations.
    We also performed an additional experiment for French/English aimed at understanding the potential contribution of the word aligned data without the new algorithm4.
    Like Ittycheriah and Roukos (2005), we converted the alignment discriminative training corpus links into a special corpus consisting of parallel sentences where each sentence consists only of a single word involved in the link.
    We found that the information in the links was &#8220;washed out&#8221; by the rest of the data and resulted in no change in the alignment test set&#8217;s F-Measure.
    Callison-Burch et al. (2004) showed in their work on combining alignments of lower and higher quality that the alignments of higher quality should be given a much higher weight than the lower quality alignments.
    Using this insight, we found that adding 10,000 copies of the special corpus to our training data resulted in the highest alignment test set gain, which was a small ga
