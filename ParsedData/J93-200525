st treated lexically or not. the argument is able to change type accordingly&#8212;this explains the behavior of logical metonymy and the syntactic variation seen in complements to verbs and nominals; and cospecification, a semantic tagging of what collocational patterns the lexical item may enter into.
    Metonymy, in this view, can be seen as a case of the &amp;quot;licensed violation&amp;quot; of selectional restrictions.
