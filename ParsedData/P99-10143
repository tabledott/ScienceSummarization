 probability model on the data, and ii) the automatic discovery of class-structure in the data.
    Both of these aspects are respected in our application of lexicon induction.
    The basic ideas of our EM-based clustering approach were presented in Rooth (Ms).
    Our approach constrasts with the merely heuristic and empirical justification of similarity-based approaches to clustering (Dagan et al., to appear) for which so far no clear probabilistic interpretation has been given.
    The probability model we use can be found earlier in Pereira et al. (1993).
    However, in contrast to this approach, our statistical inference method for clustering is formalized clearly as an EM-algorithm.
    Approaches to probabilistic clustering similar to ours were presented recently in Saul and Pereira (1997) and Hofmann and Puzicha (1998).
    There also EM-algorithms for similar probability models have been derived, but applied only to simpler tasks not involving a combination of EMbased clustering models as in our le
