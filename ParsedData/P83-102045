ominating &amp;quot;frogs&amp;quot; and continue.
    If the input proceeds as in (13.1), then the parser will introduce an S node and assert that it dominates the new NP.
    This will make the descriptions of the NPs dominating &amp;quot;worms&amp;quot; and dominating &amp;quot;frogs&amp;quot; incompatible, i.e. this will assure that there really are two NPs in the standard referent. if the input proceeds as in (13.2), a D-theory parser will state that the node referred to by the new name is dominated by the previous VP, resulting in the structure described immediately above.
    To summarize, where a treebuilding parser might be misled into creating a node which might not exist at all, there is no corresponding problem for a D-theory parser.

    SUMMING UP: D-Theory on One Foot This paper has described a new theory of natural language syntax and parsing which argues that the proper output of syntactic analysis is not a tree structure per se, but rather a description of such structures.
