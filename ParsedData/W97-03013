the sentence length.
    Furthermore, the search heuristic returns several scored parses for a sentence, and this paper shows that a scheme to pick the best parse from the 20 highest scoring parses could yield a dramatically higher accuracy of 93% precision and recall.
    Sections 2, 3, and 4 describe the tree-building procedures, the maximum entropy models, and the search heuristic, respectively.
    Section 5 describes experiments with the Penn Treebank and section 6 compares this paper with previously published works.
  
  
    The parser uses four procedures, TAG, CHUNK, BUILD, and CHECK, that incrementally build parse trees with their actions.
    The procedures are applied in three left-to-right passes over the input sentence; the first pass applies TAG, the second pass applies CHUNK, and the third pass applies BUILD and CHECK.
    The passes, the procedures they apply, and the actions of the procedures are summarized in table 1 and described below.
    The actions of the procedures are designed so tha
