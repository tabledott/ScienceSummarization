 example from its neighborhood.
    Put another way, the learner assumes not only that xi is good, but that xi is locally optimal in example space (X), and that alternative, similar examples (from the neighborhood) are inferior.
    Rather than explain all of the data, the model must only explain (using hidden variables) why the observed sentence is better than its neighbors.
    Of course, the validity of this hypothesis will depend on the form of the neighborhood function.
    Consider, as a concrete example, learning natural language syntax.
    In Smith and Eisner (2005), we define a sentence&#8217;s neighborhood to be a set of slightly-altered sentences that use the same lexemes, as suggested at the start of this section.
    While their syntax is degraded, the inferred meaning of any of these altered sentences is typically close to the intended meaning, yet the speaker chose x and not one of the other x' E N(x).
    Why?
    Deletions are likely to violate subcategorization requirements, and transpositi
