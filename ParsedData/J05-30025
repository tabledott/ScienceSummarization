o match a subset of the subtrees in each sentence and are given few constraints on permissible alignments (e.g., arising from constituent ordering, start or end points).
    Our algorithm meets these challenges through bottom-up local multisequence alignment, using words and paraphrases as anchors.
    Combination of fragments is addressed through construction of a fusion lattice encompassing the resulting alignment and linearization of the lattice into a sentence using a language model.
    Our approach to sentence fusion thus features the integration of robust statistical techniques, such as local, multisequence alignment and language modeling, with linguistic representations automatically derived from input documents.
    Sentence fusion is a significant first step toward the generation of abstracts, as opposed to extracts (Borko and Bernier 1975), for multidocument summarization.
    Unlike extraction methods (used by the vast majority of summarization researchers), sentence fusion allows for the true syn
