e word sequence fJ1 and can be introduced as a new hidden variable: 1 The order of omitting tags can be defined in a natural way depending on the part of speech.
    In principle this decision can also be left to the maximum-entropy training, when features for all possible sets of tags are defined, but this would cause the number of parameters to explode.
    As the experiments in this work have been carried out only with up to three levels of abstraction as defined in Section 4.2, the set of tags of the intermediate level is fixed, and thus the priority of the tags needs not be specified.
    The relation between this equivalence class hierarchy and the suggestions in Section 2.4 is clear: Choosing candidates for morpho-syntactic tags not relevant for translation amounts to fixing a level in the hierarchy.
    This is exactly what has been done to define the intermediate level in Section 4.2.
