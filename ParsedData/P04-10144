 of derivations which lead to &#57737;.
    This extends the approach of Clark et al. (2002) who modelled the dependency structures directly, not using any information from the derivations.
    In contrast to the dependency model, the normal-form model simply defines a distribution over normalform derivations.
    The dependency structures considered in this paper are described in detail in Clark et al. (2002) and Clark and Curran (2003).
    Each argument slot in a CCG lexical category represents a dependency relation, and a dependency is defined as a 5-tuple (hf, f, s, ha, l), where hf is the head word of the lexical category, f is the lexical category, s is the argument slot, ha is the head word of the argument, and l indicates whether the dependency is long-range.
    For example, the long-range dependency encoding company as the extracted object of bought (as in the company that IBM bought) is represented as the following 5-tuple: (bought, (S[dcl]\NP,)/NP,, 2, company, *) where * is the category (NP\NP)/
