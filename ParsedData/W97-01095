dropped substantially [C&amp;B95].
    This originated our assumption that if the number of matches on four and three words was raised, the overall accuracy would increase as well.
    Because Collins and Brooks' backing-off model is very profound, we could not find a way of improving its accuracy unless we increased the percentage of full quadruple and triple matches by employing the semantic distance measure instead of word-string matching.
    We feel that the sentence Buy books for children should be matched with Buy magazines for children due to the small conceptual distance between books and magazines.
    What is unknown, however, is the limit distance for two concepts to be matched.
    Many nouns in the WordNet hierarchy share the same root (entity) and there is a danger of overgeneralisation.
    We will try to overcome this problem through the supervised learning algorithm described herein.
    Another problem is that most of the words are semantically ambiguous and unless disambiguated, it is diff
