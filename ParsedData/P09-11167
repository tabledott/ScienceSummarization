l clustering of words, we represent the contexts of a phrase as a feature vector.
    There are many possible definitions for what constitutes the contexts.
    In the literature, contexts have been defined as subject and object relations involving the word (Hindle, 1990), as the documents containing the word (Deerwester et al, 1990), or as search engine snippets for the word as a query (Sahami and Heilman, 2006).
    We define the contexts of a phrase to be small, fixed-sized windows centered on occurrences of the phrase in a large corpus.
    The features are the words (tokens) in the window.
    The context feature vector of a phrase is constructed by first aggregating the frequency counts of the words in the context windows of different instances of the phrase.
    The frequency counts are then converted into point-wise mutual information (PMI) values: where phr is a phrase and f is a feature of phr.
    PMI effectively discounts the prior probability of the features and measures how much beyond random a
