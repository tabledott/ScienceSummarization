  It is interesting to see what kinds of relationships the model is identifying.
    To investigate this we categorized the 880 triples according to the nature of the relationship underlying the attachment.
    In many cases, the decision was difficult.
    Even the argument/adjunct distinction showed many gray cases between clear participants in an action (arguments) and clear temporal modifiers (adjuncts).
    We made rough best guesses to partition the cases into the following categories: argument, adjunct, idiom, small clause, locative ambiguity, systematic ambiguity, light verb.
    With this set of categories, 84 of the 880 cases remained so problematic that we assigned them to category other.
    Table 4 shows the performance of the lexical attachment procedure for these classes of relations.
    Even granting the roughness of the categorization, some clear patterns emerge.
    Our approach is quite successful at attaching arguments correctly; this represents some confirmation that the associations der
