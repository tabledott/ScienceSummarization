models.
    In our view, the approach of using statistical alignment models is more coherent.
    The general principle for coming up with an association score between words results from statistical estimation theory, and the parameters of the models are adjusted such that the likelihood of the models on the training corpus is maximized.
    2.2.1 Hidden Markov Alignment Model.
    The alignment model Pr(fJ1,aJ 1  |eI1) can be structured without loss of generality as follows: dependence for the alignments aj and that the lexicon probability depends only on the word at position aj: Later in the article, we describe a refinement with a dependence on eaj&#8722;1 in the alignment model.
    Putting everything together and assuming a simple length model with the alignment probability p(i  |it, I) and the translation probability p(f  |e).
    To make the alignment parameters independent of absolute word positions, we assume that the alignment probabilities p(i  |i',I) depend only on the jump width (i &#8722; i').
