ample, suppose that there has been a well-received movie about mountaineering.
    During this movie, there is a particularly stirring scene involving an ice-axe and most of the reviewers mention this scene.
    During training, the word &#8216;ice-axe&#8217; would become associated with a positive sentiment, whereas one would suppose that this word does not in general express any kind of sentiment.
    In future work we will perform further tests to determine the nature of dependency in machine learning techniques for sentiment classification.
    One way of evaluating the &#8216;ice-axe&#8217; effect could be to build a &#8216;pseudo-ontology&#8217; of the movie reviews &#8212; a map of the sentiment-bearing relations that would enable the analysis of the dependencies created by the training process.
    Other extensions of this work are to collect more text marked-up with emoticons, and to experiment with techniques to automatically remove noisy examples from the training data.
