slation probabilities from a source word to a target word and vice versa via conventional bilingual word alignment.
    Then both p(fk I e;) and in (3) can be derived: where is the translation model from the source-to-target word alignment model, and p(fk I e;) , which enforces the sum-to-1 constraint over all words in the source sentence, takes the following form, where A2s (fk I e;) is the translation model from the target-to-source word alignment model.
    In our method, A2s (null I e;) for all target words is simply a constant pnull, whose value is optimized on held-out data 1.
    The surface similarity model can be estimated in several ways.
    A very simple model could be based on exact match: the surface similarity model, per,,.
    (elj I , would take the value 1.0 if e&#8217;= e, and 0 otherwise 2 .
    However, a smoothed surface similarity model is used in our method.
    If the target language uses alphabetic orthography, as English does, we treat words as letter sequences and the similarity me
