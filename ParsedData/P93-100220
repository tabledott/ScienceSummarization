ord in each of the two parallel corpora.
    We use dynamic programming to find the probability of the best alignment of these two blocks of sentences.
    If this probability is sufficiently high we take the candidate location to be the end of the deletion.
    Because it is extremely unlikely that there are two very similar sets of forty sentences in a corpus, this deletion identification algorithm is robust.
    In addition, because we key off of rare words in considering ending points, deletion identification requires time linear in the length of the deletion.
  
  
    Using this algorithm, we have aligned three large English/French corpora.
    We have aligned a corpus of 3,000,000 sentences (of both English and French) of the Canadian Hansards, a corpus of 1,000,000 sentences of newer Hansard proceedings, and a corpus of 2,000,000 sentences of proceedings from the European Economic Community.
    In each case, we first bootstrapped the translation model by training on 100 previously aligned sentence pa
