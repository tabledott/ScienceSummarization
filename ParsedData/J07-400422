04), among others.
    The motivation for using these formalisms is that many NLP tasks, such as Machine Translation, Information Extraction, and Question Answering, could benefit from the more sophisticated linguistic analyses they provide.
    The formalism most closely related to CCG from this list is TAG.
    TAG grammars have been automatically extracted from the Penn Treebank, using techniques similar to those used by Hockenmaier (Chen and Vijay-Shanker 2000; Xia, Palmer, and Joshi 2000).
    Also, the supertagging idea which is central to the efficiency of the CCG parser originated with TAG (Bangalore and Joshi 1999).
    Chen et al. (2002) describe the results of reranking the output of an HMM supertagger using an automatically extracted LTAG.
    The accuracy for a single supertag per word is slightly over 80%.
    This figure is increased to over 91% when the tagger is run in n-best mode, but at a considerable cost in ambiguity, with 8 supertags per word.
    Nasr and Rambow (2004) investigate the p
