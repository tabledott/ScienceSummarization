h respect to what S believes A believes S believes.
    This step will only be reasonable if S can do the action, by a precondition-based heuristic.
    To make more explicit the distinction between inferences in BsWA and inferences in BsWABsWA, let us consider two inference chains that demonstrate two interpretations of the utterance &amp;quot;Do you know the secret?&amp;quot;.
    Lines 1-3 of Example 2 show the chain which leads S to believe that A asked a (literal) yes/no question; lines 1-6 of Example 3 show the interpretation as a request to S to inform A of the secret.
    Notice that in both interpretations S may be led to believe that A wants to know the secret.
    In the literal case, S infers A's goal from the literal interpretation, and may tell the secret simply by being helpful (lines 4-9).
    In the indirect case, S recognizes A's intention that S inform A of the secret (lines 1-6).
    Telling the secret is then conforming to A's intentions (lines 7-9).
    There is in fact a third interpret
