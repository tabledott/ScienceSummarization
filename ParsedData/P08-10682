    The idea of combining word clusters with discriminative learning has been previously explored by Miller et al. (2004), in the context of namedentity recognition, and their work directly inspired our research.
    However, our target task of dependency parsing involves more complex structured relationships than named-entity tagging; moreover, it is not at all clear that word clusters should have any relevance to syntactic structure.
    Nevertheless, our experiments demonstrate that word clusters can be quite effective in dependency parsing applications.
    In general, semi-supervised learning can be motivated by two concerns: first, given a fixed amount of supervised data, we might wish to leverage additional unlabeled data to facilitate the utilization of the supervised corpus, increasing the performance of the model in absolute terms.
    Second, given a fixed target performance level, we might wish to use unlabeled data to reduce the amount of annotated data nece
