is not a surprise since the subjects it covers are much more restricted, the genre is of only one kind, and the setting is constant.
    In contrast, the Brown corpus has been designed to be of mixed and rich composition, and NYT is made up of stories and articles related to various subjects and domains.
    Let us note that several factors might also influence the overall entropy of a given corpus; for example the number of writers, the time span covered by the corpus, etc.
    In any case, the success of statistical methods such as the ones described in this report also depends on the sublanguage used in the corpus.
    For a sublanguage-dependent application, the training corpus must be focused, mainly because its vocabulary being restricted, the important words will be more frequent than in a nonrestricted corpus (of equivalent size), and thus the collocations will be easier to retrieve.
    Other applications might require less focused corpora.
    For those applications, the problem is even more touchy,
