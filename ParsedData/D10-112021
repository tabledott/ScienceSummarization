d variational distribution q(z) over dependency structures.
    Hyperparameters and Training Regimes Unless otherwise stated, in experiments with rule-based constraints the expected proportion of dependencies that must satisfy those constraints is set to 0.8.
    This threshold value was chosen based on minimal tuning on a single language and ruleset (English with universal rules) and carried over to each other experimental condition.
    A more detailed discussion of the threshold&#8217;s empirical impact is presented in Section 7.1.
    Variational approximations to the HDP are truncated at 10.
    All hyperparameter values are fixed to 1 except &#945; which is fixed to 10.
    We also conduct a set of No-Split experiments to evaluate the importance of syntactic refinement; in these experiments each coarse symbol corresponds to only one refined symbol.
    This is easily effected during inference by setting the HDP variational approximation truncation level to one.
    For each experiment we run 50 iteratio
