 the 103 ambiguous Hebrew words, for 33 the bound Ba did not pass the threshold, achieving an applicability of 68%.
    The remaining 70 examples were distributed according to Table 2.
    Thus the precision of the statistical model was 91% (64/70),&amp;quot; whereas relying just on Word Frequencies yields 63% (44/70), providing an improvement of 28%.
    The table demonstrates that our algorithm corrects 22 erroneous decisions of the Word Frequencies method, but makes only 2 errors that the Word Frequencies method translates correctly.
    This implies that with high confidence our method greatly improves the Word Frequencies method.
    The number of Hebrew examples is large enough to permit a meaningful analysis of the statistical significance of the results.
    By computing confidence intervals for the distribution of proportions, we claim that with 95% confidence our method succeeds in at least 86% of the applicable examples.
    This means that though the figure of 91% might be due to a lucky selection
