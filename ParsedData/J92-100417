rol strategy is given in Figure 2.
    At any given time, a set of active parse nodes are arranged on a priority queue.
    Each parse node contains a pointer to a corresponding grammar node&#8222; and has access to all the information needed to pursue its partial theory.
    The top node is popped from the queue, and it then creates a number of new nodes (either first children' or right siblings9 depending on its state), and inserts them into the queue according to their probabilities.
    If the node is an [end] node, it returns control to the parent node, giving that node a completed subparse.
    As each new node is considered, unifications of syntactic and semantic constraints are performed, and may lead to failure.
    The process can terminate on the first successful completion of a sentence, or the Nth successful completion if more than one hypothesis is desired.
    A parse in TINA begins with a single parse node linked to the grammar node [sentence], which is entered on the queue with probability 1.
