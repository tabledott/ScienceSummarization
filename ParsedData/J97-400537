226; , n13n).
    Consider the equation gold efi] = P[fil (3) where f# (x) = Epx) is the total number of features of dag x.
    The reason for the factor et is a bit involved.
    Very roughly, we would like to choose weights so that the expectation of f, under the new field is equal to p[f].
    Now qn,(x) is: where we factor Z as Z6Zo, for Zo the normalization constant in q.m.
    Hence, qnew [f] 45j for all the features simultaneously, not just the weight 6, for feature i.
    We might consider approximating qnew Ef,J by ignoring the normalization factor and assuming that all features have the same weight as feature i.
    Since ft 6;6(x) = 6,4(x), we arrive at the expression on the left-hand side of equation (3).
    One might expect the approximation just described to be rather poor, but it is proven in Della Pietra, Della Pietra, and Lafferty (1995) that solving equation (3) for 6, (for each i) and setting the new weight for feature i to SiOi is guaranteed to improve the model.
    This is the real just
