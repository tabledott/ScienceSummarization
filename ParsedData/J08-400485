lly no coder ever identified all the mentions of a discourse entity.
    As a result, even though the values of &#945; and K obtained by using the ID of the antecedent as label were pretty similar, the values obtained when using anaphoric chains as labels were drastically different.
    The value of &#945; increased, because examples where coders linked a markable to different antecedents in the same chain were no longer considered as disagreements.
    However, the value of K was drastically reduced, because hardly any coder identified all the mentions of discourse entities (Figure 3).
    The study also looked at the matter of individual annotator bias, and as mentioned in Section 3.1, we did not find differences between &#945; and a x-style version of &#945; beyond the third decimal point.
    This similarity is what one would expect, given the result about annotator bias from Section 3.1 and given that in this experiment we used 18 annotators.
    These very small differences should be contrasted with the
