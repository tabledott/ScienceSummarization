aligned sentences and that the sentences are segmented into words.
    Obviously, there are additional implicit assumptions in the models that are needed to obtain a good alignment quality.
    For example, in languages with a very rich morphology, such as Finnish, a trivial segmentation produces a high number of words that occur only once, and every learning method suffers from a significant data sparseness problem.
    There are numerous applications for word alignments in natural language processing.
    These applications crucially depend on the quality of the word alignment (Och and Ney 2000; Yarowsky and Wicentowski 2000).
    An obvious application for word alignment methods is the automatic extraction of bilingual lexica and terminology from corpora (Smadja, McKeown, and Hatzivassiloglou 1996; Melamed 2000).
    Statistical alignment models are often the basis of single-word-based statistical machine translation systems (Berger et al. 1994; Wu 1996; Wang and Waibel 1998; Nie&#223;en et al.
