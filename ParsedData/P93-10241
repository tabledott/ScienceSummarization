matically classifying words according to their contexts of use have both scientific and practical interest.
    The scientific questions arise in connection to distributional views of linguistic (particularly lexical) structure and also in relation to the question of lexical acquisition both from psychological and computational learning perspectives.
    From the practical point of view, word classification addresses questions of data sparseness and generalization in statistical language models, particularly models for deciding among alternative analyses proposed by a grammar.
    It is well known that a simple tabulation of frequencies of certain words participating in certain configurations, for example of frequencies of pairs of a transitive main verb and the head noun of its direct object, cannot be reliably used for comparing the likelihoods of different alternative configurations.
    The problem is that for large enough corpora the number of possible joint events is much larger than the number of event
