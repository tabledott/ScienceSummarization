 over complex attachment decisions, for instance, can be inspected.
    The GR scheme includes one feature in DepBank (passive), several splits of relations in DepBank, such as adjunct, adds some of DepBank&#8217;s featural information, such as subord form, as a subtype slot of a relation (ccomp), merges DepBank&#8217;s oblique with iobj, and so forth.
    But it does not explicitly include all the features of DepBank or even of the reduced set of semanticallyrelevant features used in the experiments and evaluation reported in Kaplan et al..
    Most of these features can be computed from the full GR representation of bilexical relations between numbered lemma-affix-tags output by the parser.
    For instance, num features, such as the plurality of justices in the example, can be computed from the full det GR (det justice+s NN2:4 the AT:3) based on the CLAWS tag (NN2 indicating &#8216;plural&#8217;) selected for output.
    The few features that cannot be computed from GRs and CLAWS tags directly, such as stm
