In this paper, we present an algorithm that semiautomatically discovers fine-grained verb semantics by querying the Web using simple lexicosyntactic patterns.
    The verb relations we discover are similarity, strength, antonymy, enablement, and temporal relations.
    Identifying these relations over 29,165 verb pairs results in a broad-coverage resource we call VERBOCEAN.
    Our approach extends previously formulated ones that use surface patterns as indicators of semantic relations between nouns (Hearst 1992; Etzioni 2003; Ravichandran and Hovy 2002).
    We extend these approaches in two ways: (i) our patterns indicate verb conjugation to increase their expressiveness and specificity and (ii) we use a measure similar to mutual information to account for both the frequency of the verbs whose semantic relations are being discovered as well as for the frequency of the pattern.
  
  
    In this section, we describe application domains that can benefit from a resource of verb semantics.
    We then introduce
