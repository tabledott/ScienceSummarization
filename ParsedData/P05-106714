osition are possible.
    Each decomposition is indeed a derivation process on the foreign side of SDIG.
    Then the elementary trees go through a transfer phase and target ETs are combined together into the output.
    The stochastic tree-to-tree transducer we propose models MT as a probabilistic optimization process.
    Let f be the input sentence (foreign language), and e be the output sentence (English).
    We have lation model&#8221; (TM) and the &#8220;language model&#8221; (LM).
    Assuming the decomposition of the foreign tree is given, our approach, which is based on ETs, uses the graphical model shown in Figure 6.
    In the model, the left side is the input dependency tree (foreign language) and the right side is the output dependency tree (English).
    Each circle stands for an ET.
    The solid lines denote the syntactical dependencies while the dashed arrows denote the statistical dependencies.
    Let T( x) be the dependency tree constructed from sentence x .
