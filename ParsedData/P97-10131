hat discourse structures can be built only in conjunction with fully specified clause and sentence structures.
    And Hobbs's theory (1990) assumes that sophisticated knowledge bases and inference mechanisms are needed for determining the relations between discourse units.
    Despite the formal elegance of these approaches, they are very domain dependent and, therefore, unable to handle more than a few restricted examples.
    On the other hand, although the theories described by Grosz and Sidner (1986), Polanyi (1988), and Mann and Thompson (1988) are successfully applied manually, they are too informal to support an automatic approach to discourse analysis.
    In contrast with this previous work, the rhetorical parser that we present builds discourse trees for unrestricted texts.
    We first discuss the key concepts on which our approach relies (section 2) and the corpus analysis (section 3) that provides the empirical data for our rhetorical parsing algorithm.
    We discuss then an algorithm that reco
