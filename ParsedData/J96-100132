mation between X and Y remains the same.
    This is appropriate in the context of communications for which mutual information was originally developed (Shannon 1948), where the ones and zeros encode two different states with no special preference for either of them.
    But in the context of translation, exchanging the &amp;quot;1&amp;quot;s and &amp;quot;0&amp;quot;s is equivalent to considering a word or word group to be present when it was absent and vice versa, thus converting all 1-1 matches to 0-0 matches and all 0-0 matches to 1-1 matches.
    As explained above, such a change should not be considered similarity preserving, since 1-1 matches are much more significant than 0-0 ones.
    As a concrete example, consider a corpus of 100 matched sentences, where each of the word groups associated with X and Y appears five times.
    Furthermore, suppose that the two groups appear twice in a pair of aligned sentences and each word group also appears three times by itself.
    This situation is depicted in t
