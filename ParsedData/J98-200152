st texts in the second experiment, we get again K = 0.73.
    Third, going from a syntactic to a semantic definition of anaphoric definite description resulted in worse agreement both for coreferential and for bridging references: looking at the per-class figures, one can see that we went from a per-class agreement on anaphoric definite descriptions in Experiment 1 of 88% to a per-class agreement on coreferential definites of 86% in Experiment 2; and the per-class agreement for associative definite descriptions of 59% went down rather dramatically to a per-class agreement of 31% on bridging descriptions.
    The good result obtained by reducing the number of classes led us to try to find a way of grouping definite descriptions into classes that would result in an even better agreement.
    An obvious idea was to try with still fewer classes, i.e., just two.
    We first tried the binary division suggested by Fraurud: all coreferential definite descriptions 7 on one side (subsequent-mention), and all other def
