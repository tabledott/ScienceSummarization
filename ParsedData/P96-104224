lassifications.
    By appropriate classification we mean the classification given by a perfectly-trained model, that is, one with accurate parameter values.
    Note that this type of uncertainty regarding the identity of the appropriate classification, is different than uncertainty regarding the correctness of the classification itself.
    For example, sufficient statistics may yield an accurate 0.51 probability estimate for a class c in a given example, making it certain that c is the appropriate classification.
    However, the certainty that c is the correct classification is low, since there is a 0.49 chance that c is the wrong class for the example.
    A single model can be used to estimate only the second type of uncertainty, which does not correlate directly with the utility of additional training.
    Finally, property 3 is addressed by independently examining input examples which are drawn from the input distribution.
    In this way, we implicitly model the distribution of model parameters used
