e translations into whatever languages they were proficient in.
    Shared task participants were excluded from judging their own systems.
    In addition to evaluation each language pair individually, we also combined all system translations into English for the News test set, taking advantage of the fact that our test sets were parallel across all languages.
    This allowed us to gather interesting data about the difficulty of translating from different languages into English.
    Table 3 gives a summary of the number of judgments that we collected for translations of individual sentences.
    We evaluated 14 translation tasks with three different types of judgments for most of them, for a total of 46 different conditions.
    In total we collected over 75,000 judgments.
    Despite the large number of conditions we managed to collect between 1,000&#8211;2,000 judgments for the constituentbased evaluation, and several hundred to several thousand judgments for the sentence ranking tasks.
