  Dynamic Programming for Linear-Time Incremental Parsing
  
    Incremental parsing techniques such as shift-reduce have gained popularity thanks to their efficiency, but there remains a problem: the search is only explores a tiny fraction of the whole space (even with beam search) as opposed to dynamic programming.
    We show that, surprisingly, dynamic programming is in fact possible for many shift-reduce parsers, by merging &#8220;equivalent&#8221; stacks based on feature values.
    Empirically, our algorithm yields up to a five-fold speedup over a state-of-the-art shift-reduce dependency parser with no loss in accuracy.
    Better search also leads to better learning, and our final parser outperforms all previously reported dependency parsers for English and Chinese, yet is much faster.
  
  
    In terms of search strategy, most parsing algorithms in current use for data-driven parsing can be divided into two broad categories: dynamic programming which includes the dominant CKY algorithm, and greedy
