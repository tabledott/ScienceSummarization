y is the lossiness of MSA seen in row 4.
    Figure 3 illustrates a case where the MSA paraphrase yields a significant reduction in information, while PR is more conservative in its replacements.
    While the substitutions obtained by the PR model remain for the present relatively modest, they are not trivial.
    Changing a single content word is a legitimate form of paraphrase, and the ability to paraphrase across an arbitrarily large sentence set and arbitrary domains is a desideratum of paraphrase research.
    We have demonstrated that the SMT-motivated PR method is capable of generating acceptable paraphrases for the overwhelming majority of sentences in a broad domain.
  
  
    Much work obviously remains to be done.
    Our results remain constrained by data sparsity, despite the large initial training sets.
    One major agenda item therefore will be acquisition of larger (and more diverse) data sets.
    In addition to obtaining greater absolute quantities of data in the form of clustered articles
