    To provide a comparison for our learning model, we implement a more traditional self-training procedure in which at each iteration a committee of five SVMs is trained on randomly generated overlapping subsets of the training data and their cumulative confidence is used to select items for augmenting the labelled training data.
    For similar work see (Banko and Brill, 2001; Zhang, 2004).
  
  
    Figure 1 plots accuracy as a function of the training iteration.
    After 150 iterations, all of the weakly supervised learning models are significantly more accurate than the baseline according to a binomial sign test (p &lt; 0.01), though there is clearly still much room for improvement.
    The baseline classifier achieves a BEP of 0.60 while both classifiers using our learning model reach approximately 0.76 BEP with little to tell between them.
