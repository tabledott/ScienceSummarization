    The performance using only our semantically informed features is shown in Table 7.
    Only the Naive Bayes classification results are given, as space is limited and MaxEnt and AdaBoost gave slightly lower accuracies overall.
    The table lists the f-score for each of the target relations, with overall accuracy shown in brackets.
    Given that the experiments are run on natural distribution of the data, which are skewed towards Expansion relations, the f-score is the more important measure to track.
    Our random baseline is the f-score one would achieve by randomly assigning classes in proportion to its true distribution in the test set.
    The best results for all four tasks are considerably higher than random prediction, but still low overall.
    Our features provide 6% to 18% absolute improvements in f-score over the baseline for each of the four tasks.
    The largest gain was in the Contingency versus Other prediction task.
    The least improvement was for distinguishing
