terbi) Algorithm.
    The second uses a grammar with meaningful nonterminal symbols and performs a three-way comparison between the Labelled Recall, Bracketed Recall, and Labelled Tree Algorithms.
    These experiments show that use of an algorithm matched appropriately to the evaluation criterion can lead to as much as a 10% reduction in error rate.
    In both experiments the grammars could not parse some sentences, 0.5% and 9%, respectively.
    The unparsable data were assigned a right branching structure with their rightmost element attached high.
    Since all three algorithms fail on the same sentences, all algorithms were affected equally.
    5.1 Experiment with Grammar Induced by Pereira and Schabes Method The experiment of Pereira and Schabes (1992) was duplicated.
    In that experiment, a grammar was trained from a bracketed form of the TI section of the ATIS corpus' using a modified form of the InsideOutside Algorithm.
    Pereira and Schabes then used the Labelled Tree Algorithm to select the b
