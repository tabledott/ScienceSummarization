			The other estimate comes from a heuristic alignment model that we previously developed (Moore, 2005).2 Space does not permit a full description of this heuristic model here, butin brief, it utilizes a series of greedy searches in spired by Melamed?s competitive linking algorithm (2000), in which constraints limiting alignments tobeing one-to-one and monotonic are applied at different thresholds of the LLR score, with a final cut off of the LLR score below which no alignments are made.
	
	
			While the discriminative models presented above are very simple to describe, finding the optimal alignment according to these models is non-trivial.
			Adding a link for a new pair of words can affect the nonmonotonicity scores, the one-to-many score, and the unlinked word score differently, depending on 2The conditional link probabilities used in the current work are those used in Method 4 of the earlier work.
