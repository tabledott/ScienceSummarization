lding with beam width .
    The data points on a line in the figure were created by varying with other parameters fixed.
    The first method re-ranked the -best parses enumerated from the chart after the PCFG parsing.
    The two lines for the first method in the figure correspond to = 100 and = 300.
    In the second and the third methods, we removed all the dominance relations among chart items that did not contribute to any parses whose PCFG-scores were higher than max, where max is the PCFG-score of the best parse in the chart.
    The parses remaining in the chart were the candidate parses for the second and the third methods.
    The different lines for the second and the third methods correspond to different values of .
    The third method outperforms the other two methods unless the parse time is very limited (i.e., 1 sec is required), as shown in the figure.
    The superiority of the third method over the first method seems to stem from the difference in the number of candidate parses from which t
