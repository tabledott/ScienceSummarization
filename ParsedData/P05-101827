by comparing our original model (Coreference+Syntax+Salience) which accounts separately for patterns of salient and non-salient entities against a model that does not attempt to discriminate between them (Coreference+Syntax).
    Our results on the ordering task indicate that models that take salience information into account consistently outperform models that do not.
    The effect of salience is less pronounced for the summarization task when it is combined with coreference information (Coreference + Salience).
    This is expected, since accurate identification of coreferring entities is prerequisite to deriving accurate salience models.
    However, as explained above, our automatic coreference tool introduces substantial noise in our representation.
    Once this noise is removed (see Syntax+Salience), the salience model has a clear advantage over the other models.
  
  
    In this paper we proposed a novel framework for representing and measuring text coherence.
    Central to this framework is the en
