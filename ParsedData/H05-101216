			and the usual definition of the F-measure, F = 2PR(R+ P ) and define the alignment error as AER = 1 ? F .In this paper, we report our results in terms of F measure over aligned links.
			Note that links to theNULL state (unaligned English words) are not included in the F-measure.
			Systems are compared rel ative to the reduction in AER.
			6.1 Annotator Agreement.
			We measure intra/inter-annotator agreement on thetest set in order to determine the feasibility of hu man annotation of word links.
			These are shown in Table 1.
			In the table, the column for ?Annotator 1 Correction?
			is the first annotator correcting his own word alignments after a span of a year.
			After two weeks, the annotator (Annotator 1?)
			was given the same material with all the links removed and asked to realign and we see that there is more discrepancy in resulting alignments.
			The differences are largely on the head concept where determiners are attachedand the alignment of spontaneous words.
