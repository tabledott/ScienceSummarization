 scheme in the following way: Take the gold-standard CoNLL annotations for the development set (including referring and continuing labels), convert these to basic argument labels of the form ARGX, then convert the resulting labeling to CoNLL-style labeling using our rules to recover the referring and continuing annotations.
    The F-Measure obtained was 99.0.
    Figure 17 shows the performance of the local and joint model on one of the CoNLL test sets&#8212;Test WSJ (Section 23)&#8212;when using gold-standard parse trees.
    Performance on gold-standard parse trees was not measured in the CoNLL 2005 shared task, but we report it here to provide a basis for comparison with the results of other researchers.
    Next we present results using Charniak&#8217;s automatic parses on the development and two test sets.
    We present results for the local and joint models using the maxscoring Charniak parse tree.
    Additionally, we report results for the joint model using the top five Charniak parse trees accordin
