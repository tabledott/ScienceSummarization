 changed from 1 to 0.5.
    Two adaptively trained variants, L-S and L-A, are shown in the last two lines of Table 1.
    The weights in these two systems were produced by filtering the probabilities obtained from the stochastic transducer into three weight classes: 0.5, 0.75, and 1.
    Identity substitutions were assigned a cost of zero.
    For L-S, the cost matrix was separately trained for each language pair, and for L-A, it was trained collectively over all the Romance languages.
    Table 2 shows some of the highest probability consonant-to-consonant edit operations computed by the stochastic transducer (S).
    Most of these topranking derived transformations have been observed to be relatively low distance by either linguistic analysis of historical sound changes or by phonological classification, notably: nasal sonorants (&amp;quot;n&amp;quot; , unvoiced stops (&amp;quot;p&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;f&amp;quot;), and voiced stops (&amp;quot;c&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;g&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;t&amp;quot;, &amp;q
