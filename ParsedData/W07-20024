linked to the clus ter.
			We also think that instead of judging whether the cluster returned by the algorithm is correct, theperson should have independently tagged the occur rence with his own senses, which should have been then compared to the cluster returned by the system.
			This is paramount to compare a corpus which has been hand-tagged with some reference senses (alsoknown as the gold-standard) with the clustering result.
			The gold standard tags are taken to be the def inition of the classes, and standard measures from the clustering literature can be used to evaluate the clusters against the classes.
			A second alternative would be to devise a method to map the clusters returned by the systems to thesenses in a lexicon.
			Pantel and Lin (2002) automatically map the senses to WordNet, and then mea sure the quality of the mapping.
			More recently, themapping has been used to test the system on publicly available benchmarks (Purandare and Peder sen, 2004; Niu et al, 2005).A third alternative is to
