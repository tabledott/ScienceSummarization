presentations, (v) its non-parametric nature, (vi) reasonably good results on unknown words without morphological analysis, and (vii) fast learning and tagging.
    In this paper we show that a large-scale application of the memory-based approach is feasible: we obtain a tagging accuracy that is on a par with that of known statistical approaches, and with attractive and time complexity properties when using tree-based formalism for indexing and searching huge case bases.
    The use of IGTree has as additional advantage that optimal context size for disambiguation is dynamically computed.
  
  
    Part of Speech (POS) tagging is a process in which syntactic categories are assigned to words.
    It can be seen as a mapping from sentences to strings of tags.
    Automatic tagging is useful for a number of applications: as a preprocessing stage to parsing, in information retrieval, in text to speech systems, in corpus linguistics, etc.
    The two factors determining the syntactic category of a word are its lex
