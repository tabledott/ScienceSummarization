his function is a form of maximum a posteriori estimation, rather than maximum likelihood estimation.
    The effect of the prior is to penalise models that have very large positive or negative weights.
    This can be thought of as relaxing the constraints in (5), so that the model fits the data less exactly.
    The parameters o-, are usually collapsed into one parameter which can be set using heldout data.
    The new update rule for GIS with a Gaussian prior is found by solving the following equation for the Ai update values (denoted by S), which can easily be derived from (10) by analogy with the proof in the Appendix: This equation does not have an analytic solution for Si and can be solved using a numerical solver such as Newton-Raphson.
    Note that this new update rule is still significantly simpler than that required for 11s.
