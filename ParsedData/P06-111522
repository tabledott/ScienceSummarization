m undergraduates and from real users of a web-based interface (Tang and Mooney, 2001).
			These were manually translated into their MRs. The average length of an NL sentence in the CLANG corpus is 22.52 words while in the GEOQUERY corpus it is 7.48 words, which indicates that CLANG is the harder corpus.
			The average length of the MRs is 13.42 tokens in the CLANG corpus while it is 6.46 tokens in the GEOQUERY corpus.
			KRISP was evaluated using standard 10-fold cross validation.
			For every test sentence, only thebest MR corresponding to the most probable se mantic derivation is considered for evaluation, and its probability is taken as the system?s confidence in that MR. Since KRISP uses a threshold, ?, toprune low probability derivation trees, it sometimes may fail to return any MR for a test sen tence.
			We computed the number of test sentences for which KRISP produced MRs, and the number of these MRs that were correct.
			For CLANG, an output MR is considered correct if and only if it exactly matches
