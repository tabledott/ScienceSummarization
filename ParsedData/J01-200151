we shall refer to the latter class as secondary counts.
    In order to simplify computation and exposition, we have adopted the convention that the total number of words remains fixed, even when nested structure is posited by the morphology, thus forcing the convention that counts are distributed in a nonintegral fashion over the two or more nested word structures found in complex words.
    We consider the more complex case in the appendix.'
    Goldsmith Unsupervised Learning of the Morphology of a Natural Language We may distinguish between those words, like work or working, whose immediate analysis involves a stem appearing in the stem list (we may call these WsiMPLE) and those whose analysis, like workings, involves recursive structure (we may call these Wcompux).
    As we have noted, every stem entry in a signature begins with a flag indicating which kind of stem it is, and this flag will be of length for simple stems, and of length for complex stems.
    We also keep track separately of the total num
