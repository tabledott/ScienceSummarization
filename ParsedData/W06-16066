ts the string &#8220;COMINGFROM&#8221; as the transducer moves to the state co-indexed by x0; the outputs produced from the new state will be concatenated to the right of the string &#8220;COMINGFROM&#8221;.
    Since there are multiple derivations that could lead to the same outcome, the probability of a tuple (7r, F, A) is obtained by summing over all derivations Oi E O that are consistent with the tuple, c(0) _ (7r, F, A).
    The probability of each derivation BZ is given by the product of the probabilities of all the rules p(rj) in the derivation (see equation 4).
    In order to acquire the rules specific to our model and to induce their probabilities, we parse the English side of our corpus with an in-house implementation (Soricut, 2005) of Collins parsing models (Collins, 2003) and we word-align the parallel corpus with the Giza++2 implementation of the IBM models (Brown et al., 1993).
    We use the automatically derived (English-parse-tree, English-sentence, Foreign-sentence, Word-levelalignment) tu
