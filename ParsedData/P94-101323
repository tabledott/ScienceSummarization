  It is important to give each individual ara word roughly equal representation in the training set, however, lest the list model the idiosyncrasies of the most frequent class members, rather than identify the shared common features representative of the full class.
    In Spanish, decision lists are trained for the general ambiguity classes including -o/-&#243;, -e1-6, -aral-ard, and -aranl-ardn.
    For each ambiguous word belonginging to one of these classes, the accuracy of the word-specific decision list is compared with the class-based list.
    If the class's list performs adequately it is used.
    Words with idiosyncrasies that are not modeled well by the class's list retain their own word-specific decision list.
    Step 7: Using the Decision Lists Once these decision lists have been created, they may be used in real time to determine the accent pattern for ambiguous words in new contexts.
    At run time, each word encountered in a text is looked up in a table.
    If the accent pattern is unambigu
