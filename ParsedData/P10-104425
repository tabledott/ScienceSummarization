r model:5 4Similarity-based and discriminative methods are not applicable to this task as they offer no straightforward way to compare the similarity between selectional preferences of two relations.
    5Note that all probabilities are conditioned on an estimate of the parameters 0, ,Q, 7 from our model, which are omitted for compactness.
    To compute each of these factors we simply marginalize over the hidden topics: where P(z = t|a) can be computed using Bayes rule.
    For example, In order to evaluate LDA-SP&#8217;s ability to filter inferences based on selectional preferences we need a set of inference rules between the relations in our corpus.
    We therefore mapped the DIRT Inference rules (Lin and Pantel, 2001), (which consist of pairs of dependency paths) to TEXTRUNNER relations as follows.
    We first gathered all instances in the generalization corpus, and for each r(a1, a2) created a corresponding simple sentence by concatenating the arguments with the relation string between them.
