s of the model on the same corpus (Kupiec 1992; DeRose 1988).
    The Brill tagger showed some better results: error rate (mean) O*(.
    )=3.327366 with the standard error &#167;63=0.123903.
    Although our primary goal was not to compare the taggers themselves but rather their performance with the guessing components, we attribute the difference in their performance to the fact that Brill's tagger uses the information about the most likely tag for a word whereas the HMM tagger did not have this information and instead used the priors for a set of POS-tags (ambiguity class).
    When we removed from the lexicon all the hapax words and, following the recommendation of Church (1988), all the capitalized words with frequency less than 20, we obtained some 51,522 unknown word-tokens (25,359 wordtypes) out of more than a million word-tokens in the Brown Corpus.
    We tagged the fifteen subcorpora of the Brown Corpus by the four combinations of the taggers and the guessers using the lexicon of 22,260 word-types.
