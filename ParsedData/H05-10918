 1: Shortest Path representation of relations.
			?station?.
			In Figure 2 we show three more examples of the LOCATED (AT) relationship as dependency pathscreated from one or two predicate-argument struc tures.
			The second example is an interesting case,as it illustrates how annotation decisions are accom modated in our approach.
			Using a reasoning similarwith that from the previous paragraph, it is reason able to infer that ?troops?
			are LOCATED in ?vans?, and that ?vans?
			are LOCATED in ?city?.
			However, because ?vans?
			is not an ACE markable, it cannot participate in an annotated relationship.
			Therefore, ?troops?
			is annotated as being LOCATED in ?city?,which makes sense due to the transitivity of the relation LOCATED.
			In our approach, this leads to shortest paths that pass through two or more predicate argument structures.The last relation example is a case where there ex ist multiple shortest paths in the dependency graph between the same two entities ? there are actually two differe
