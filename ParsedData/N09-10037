ting from the use of a large Web-based corpus.
    This work is motivated by previous studies that make use of search engines in order to collect cooccurrence statistics between words.
    Turney (2001) uses the number of hits returned by a Web search engine to calculate the Pointwise Mutual Information (PMI) between terms, as an indicator of synonymy.
    Bollegala et al. (2007) calculate a number of popular relatedness metrics based on page counts, like PMI, the Jaccard coefficient, the Simpson coefficient and the Dice coefficient, which are combined with lexico-syntactic patterns as model features.
    The model parameters are trained using Support Vector Machines (SVM) in order to later rank pairs of words.
    A different approach is the one taken by Sahami and Heilman (2006), who collect snippets from the results of a search engine and represent each snippet as a vector, weighted with the tf&#183;idf score.
    The semantic similarity between two queries is calculated as the inner product between the ce
