rticle, in positions other than at the beginning of sentences.
			If at least 75% of these occurrences are capitalized, then e is a named entity.
			The combined heuristics extract close to half amillion named entities from Wikipedia.
			The second step constructs the actual dictionary D as fol lows:  The set of entries in D consists of all strings that may denote a named entity, i.e. if e2E is a named entity, then its title name e:title,its redirect names e:R, and its disambigua tion names e:D are all added as entries in D.  Each entry string d2D is mapped to d:E, the set of entities that d may denote in Wikipedia.
			Consequently, a named entity e is included in d:E if and only if d = e:title, d 2 e:R, or d2e:D.
	
	
			As illustrated in Section 1, the same proper name may refer to more than one named entity.
			Thenamed entity dictionary from Section 3 and the hy perlinks from Wikipedia articles provide a dataset of disambiguated occurrences of proper names,as described in the following.
			As shown in Sect
