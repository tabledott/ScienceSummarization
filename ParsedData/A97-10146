    Such a word order independent representation has the advantage of all structural information being encoded in a single data structure.
    A uniform representation of local and non-local dependencies makes the structure more transparent'.
  
  
    We distinguish the following levels of representation: 'A context-free constituent backbone can still be recovered from the surface string and argument structure by reattaching 'extracted' structures to a higher node.
    Argument structure, represented in terms of unordered trees.
    Grammatical functions, encoded in edge labels, e.g.
    SB (subject), MO (modifier), HD (head).
    Syntactic categories, expressed by category labels assigned to non-terminal nodes and by part-of-speech tags assigned to terminals.
