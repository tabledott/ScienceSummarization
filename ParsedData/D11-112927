    Second Dataset Description The second dataset6, developed by the authors, follows the format of the (Mitchell and Lapata, 2008) dataset used for the first experiment, with the exception that the target and landmark verbs are transitive, and an object noun is provided in addition to the subject noun, hence forming a small transitive sentence.
    The dataset comprises 200 entries consisting of sentence pairs (hence a total of 400 sentences) constructed by following the procedure outlined in &#167;4 of (Mitchell and Lapata, 2008), using transitive verbs from CELEX7.
    For examples of these sentences, see Table 4.
    The dataset was split into four sections of 100 entries each, with guaranteed 50% exclusive overlap with exactly two other datasets.
    Each section was given to a group of evaluators, with a total of 25, who were asked to form simple transitive sentence pairs from the verbs, subject and object provided in each entry; for instance &#8216;the
