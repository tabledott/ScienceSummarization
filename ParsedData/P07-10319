iven ORG tags, the tool suggests that they be bracketed together first.
    Other suggestions come from previous bracketings of the same words, which helps to keep the annotator consistent.
    Two post processes were carried out to increase annotation consistency and correctness.
    915 difficult NPs were marked by the annotator and were then discussed with two other experts.
    Secondly, certain phrases that occurred numerous times and were non-trivial to bracket, e.g.
    London Interbank Offered Rate, were identified.
    An extra pass was made through the corpus, ensuring that every instance of these phrases was bracketed consistently.
    Annotation initially took over 9 hours per section of the Treebank.
    However, with practice this was reduced to about 3 hours per section.
    Each section contains around 2500 ambiguous NPs, i.e. annotating took approximately 5 seconds per NP.
    Most NPs require no bracketing, or fit into a standard pattern which the annotator soon becomes accustomed to, hence
