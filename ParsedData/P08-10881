    Moreover, parallel text could be scarce for a language pair even if monolingual data is readily available for both languages.
    In this paper, we consider the problem of learning translations from monolingual sources alone.
    This task, though clearly more difficult than the standard parallel text approach, can operate on language pairs and in domains where standard approaches cannot.
    We take as input two monolingual corpora and perhaps some seed translations, and we produce as output a bilingual lexicon, defined as a list of word pairs deemed to be word-level translations.
    Precision and recall are then measured over these bilingual lexicons.
    This setting has been considered before, most notably in Koehn and Knight (2002) and Fung (1995), but the current paper is the first to use a probabilistic model and present results across a variety of language pairs and data conditions.
    In our method, we represent each language as a monolingual lexicon (see figure 2): a list of wor
