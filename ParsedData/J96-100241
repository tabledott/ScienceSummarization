ical probability, these constraints require that the expected joint probability of the English word immediately following in and the French rendering of in be equal to its empirical probability An example of a template 2 constraint is p(y = pendant, e+1 = several) = p(y = pendant, e+i = several) A maximum entropy model that incorporates this constraint will predict the translations of in in a manner consistent with whether or not the following word is several.
    In particular, if in the empirical sample the presence of several led to a greater probability for pendant, this will be reflected in a maximum entropy model incorporating this constraint.
    We have thus taken our first step toward context-sensitive translation modeling.
    Templates 3, 4, and 5 consider, each in a different way, various parts of the context.
    For instance, template 5 constraints allow us to model how an expert translator is biased by the appearance of a word somewhere in the three words following the word being translated.
