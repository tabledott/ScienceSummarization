how results for the bootstrapping algorithm described in Section 3.3, using three different scoring functions.
    The results for the ranking algorithm described in Section 3.4 are shown in the Productivity (Prd) and Popularity&amp;Productivity (Pop&amp;Prd) columns.
    For the states, countries, and singers categories, we randomly selected 5 different initial seeds and then averaged the results.
    For the fish category we ran each algorithm using just the seed &#8220;salmon&#8221;.
    The popularity-based metrics produced good accuracies on the states, countries, and singers categories under all 3 scoring functions.
    For fish, KPP performed better than the others.
    The Out-degree (outD) scoring function, which uses only Productivity information, obtained the best results across all 4 categories.
    OutD achieved 100% accuracy for the first 50 states and fish, 100% accuracy for the top 150 countries, and 97% accuracy for the top 50 singers.
    The three scoring metrics that use both popularity an
