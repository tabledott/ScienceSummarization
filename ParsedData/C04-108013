			Lexicons While placing informed limitations on the tags that can be included in a lexicon can dramatically improve results, it is dependent on some form of supervision ? either from manually tagged data or by a human editor who post-filters an automatically constructed list.
			In the interest of being as unsupervised as possible, we sought to find a way to cope with the noisy aspects of the unfiltered lexicon described in the previous section.
			We suspected that in order to better control the training of lexical probabilities, having a stable model of state transition probabilities would be of help.
			We stabilized this model in two ways.
