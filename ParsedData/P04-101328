 made here between discriminative models and discriminative training criteria, and come to the same conclusions.
    However, their arguments are made in terms of independence assumptions.
    Our results show that these generalizations also apply to methods which do not rely on independence assumptions.
    While both (Johnson, 2001) and (Klein and Manning, 2002) propose models which use the parameters of the generative model but train to optimize a discriminative criteria, neither proposes training algorithms which are computationally tractable enough to be used for broad coverage parsing.
    Our proposed training method succeeds in being both tractable and effective, demonstrating both a significant improvement over the equivalent generative model and state-of-the-art accuracy.
    Collins (2000) and Collins and Duffy (2002) also succeed in finding algorithms for training discriminative models which balance tractability with effectiveness, showing improvements over a generative model.
    Both these metho
