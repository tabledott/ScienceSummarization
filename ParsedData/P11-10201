d progress in the field.
    Without these resources, researchers have resorted to developing their own small, ad hoc datasets (Barzilay and McKeown, 2001; Shinyama et al., 2002; Barzilay and Lee, 2003; Quirk et al., 2004; Dolan et al., 2004), and have often relied on human judgments to evaluate their results (Barzilay and McKeown, 2001; Ibrahim et al., 2003; Bannard and Callison-Burch, 2005).
    Consequently, it is difficult to compare different systems and assess the progress of the field as a whole.
    Despite the similarities between paraphrasing and translation, several major differences have prevented researchers from simply following standards that have been established for machine translation.
    Professional translators produce large volumes of bilingual data according to a more or less consistent specification, indirectly fueling work on machine translation algorithms.
    In contrast, there are no &#8220;professional paraphrasers&#8221;, with the result that there are no readily available large
