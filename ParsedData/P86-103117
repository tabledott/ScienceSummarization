    It is further predicted that morphologically bound pronominal forms (i.e., agreement inflections, elides, and affixes) rather than full independent pronouns are used for Cb-realization if a language has this option.
    For instance, this option exists for the finite clause subject in Italian and Spanish in terms of the agreement inflection, and for the fmite clause subject and object in Warlpiri in terms of clitics.
    The constraint in English is stated below: (16) Centering Constraint [English] Two unstressed pronouns that retain the same Cb in adjacent utterances should share one of the following properties (in descending order of preference): 1) SUBJECT, 2) nonSUBJECT.

    By its reference to the grammatical property SUBJECT, the constraint indicates that adjacent uttera
