cal facts tend to be those involving auxiliaries, modals, and determiners, the agreement and case properties of pronouns, and so on.
    These vary little from speaker to speaker, topic to topic, register to register.
    Unfortunately, this information is not sufficient to parse sentences completely, a fact that is underscored by the current state of the parsing art.
    If sentences cannot be parsed completely and reliably then the syntactic frames used in them cannot be determined reliably.
    How, then, can reliable, easily formalized grammatical information be used to extract syntactic facts about words from a corpus?
    This paper suggests the following approach: one or a fixed number of examples.
    Instead, attempt to determine the distribution of exceptions to the expected correspondence between cues and syntactic frames.
    Use a statistical model to determine whether the cooccurrence of a verb with cues for a frame is too regular to be explained by randomly distributed exceptions.
