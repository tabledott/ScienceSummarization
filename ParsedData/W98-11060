  An Empirical Approach To Conceptual Case Frame Acquisition
  
    TIME 52 process eliminates the need for a human to assign roles to the extraction patterns by hand, as had been necessary when using AutoSlog or AutoSlog-TS by themselves.
    For example, the pattern &amp;quot;machinegunned &lt;direct-obj&gt;&amp;quot; had strong semantic preferences for CIVILIAN, LOCATION, so was expanded to have three conceptual roles with four selectional restrictions.
    The expanded extraction pattern for &amp;quot;machinegunned &lt;direct-obj&gt;&amp;quot; is: &amp;quot;machinegunned &lt;direct-obj&gt;&amp;quot; -+ VEHICLE Only semantic categories that were associated with a pattern are included as selectional restric- For example, the also represents possible terrorism victims, but it was not strongly associated with the pattern.
    Our rationale is that an individual pattern may have a strong preference for only a subset of the categories that can be associated with a role.
    For example, the pattern &amp;quot;&
