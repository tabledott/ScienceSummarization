    Primitive. element of the pair of primitive elements can be restricted to a specific primitive, allowing more expressiveness in the composite features.
    For example, we can restrict one of the primitive features to be a simplex noun phrase and the other to be a verb; then, two noun phrases, one from each text unit, must match according to the rule for matching simplex noun phrases (i.e., sharing the same head), and two verbs must match according to the rule for verbs (i.e., sharthe same semantic class); see Figure This particular combination loosely approximates grammatical relations, e.g., matching subject-verb pairs.
    'Verbs can also be matched by the first (and more reof Section 4.1, namely requiring that their stemmed forms be identical.
    206 Since these restrictions can be combined, many different composite features can be defined, although our empirical results indicate that the most successful tend to include a distance constraint.
    As we put more restrictions on a compos
