  Parallel Implementations of Word Alignment Tool
  
    Training word alignment models on large corpora is a very time-consuming processes.
    This paper describes two parallel implementations of GIZA++ that accelerate this word alignment process.
    One of the implementations runs on computer clusters, the other runs on multi-processor system using multi-threading technology.
    Results show a near-linear speedup according to the number of CPUs used, and alignment quality is preserved.
  
  
    Training state-of-the-art phrase-based statistical machine translation (SMT) systems requires several steps.
    First, word alignment models are trained on the bilingual parallel training corpora.
    The most widely used tool to perform this training step is the well-known GIZA++(Och and Ney, 2003).
    The resulting word alignment is then used to extract phrase pairs and perhaps other information to be used in translation systems, such as block reordering models.
    Among the procedures, more than 2/3 of the
