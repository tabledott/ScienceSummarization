omatic word identification in Chinese lies in the successful resolution of ambiguities and aproper way to handle out-of-vocabulary words.
    The ambiguities in Chinese word segmentation is due to the fact that a hanzi can occur in different word-internal positions (Xue, 2003).
    Given the proper context, generally provided by the sentence in which it occurs, the position of a hanzi can be determined.
    In this paper, we model the Chinese word segmentation as a hanzi tagging problem and use a machine-learning algorithm to determine the appropriate position for a hanzi.
    There are several reasons why we may expect this approach to work.
    First, Chinese words generally have fewer than four characters.
    As a result, the number of positions is small.
    Second, although each hanzi can in principle occur in all possible positions, not all hanzi behave this way.
    A substantial number of hanzi are distributed in a constrained manner.
    For example, , the plural marker, almost always occurs in the
