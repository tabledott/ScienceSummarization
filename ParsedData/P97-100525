r a more extreme result is E b(i: 18.0.5) = 0.41).
    We conclude that there is at best a marginal advantage to using structural cues. an advantage that will not justify the additional computational cost in most cases.
    Our goal in this paper has been to prepare the ground for using genre in a wide variety of areas in natural language processing.
    The main remaining technical challenge is to find an effective strategy for variable selection in order to avoid overfitting during training.
    The fact that the neural networks have a higher performance on average and a much higher performance for some discriminations (though at the price of higher variability of performance) indicates that overfitting and variable interactions are important problems to tackle.
    On the theoretical side, we have developed a taxonomy of genres and facets.
    Genres are considered to be generally reducible to bundles of facets, though sometimes with some irreducible atomic residue.
    This way of looking at the problem a
