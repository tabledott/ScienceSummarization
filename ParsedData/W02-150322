new language can use existing technology to bootstrap a grammar for the new language and can parse equivalent constructions in the existing languages to see how to analyze a construction.
    This allows the grammar writer to focus on more difficult constructions not yet encountered in the existing grammars.
    Consider first the Japanese grammar which was started in the beginning of 2001.
    At the initial stage, the work of grammar development involved implementing the basic constructions already analyzed in the other grammars.
    It was found that the grammar writing techniques and guidelines to maintain parallelism shared in the ParGram project could be efficiently applied to the Japanese grammar.
    During the next stage, LFG rules needed for grammatical issues specific to Japanese have been gradually incorporated, and at the same time, the biannual ParGram meetings have helped significantly to keep the grammars parallel.
    Given this system, in a year and a half, using two grammar writers, the Jap
