s (?,P) and (cp,P) is not significantly greaterthan this at the 1% level), there are substantial differences between the neighbour sets gen erated by different measures.
			For example, for many pairs, neighbour sets do not appear to have even half their members in common.
	
	
			We have seen that there is a large variation inneighbours selected by different similarity mea sures.
			In this section, we analyse how neighboursets vary with respect to one fundamental statis tical property ? word frequency.
			To do this, we measure the bias in neighbour sets towards high frequency nouns and consider how this varies depending on whether the target noun is itself a high frequency noun or low frequency noun.
			4.1 Measuring bias.
			If a measure is biased towards selecting high frequency words as neighbours, then we would ex pect that neighbour sets for this measure wouldbe made up mainly of words from WShigh.
			Fur ther, the more biased the measure is, the more highly ranked these high frequency words will tend
