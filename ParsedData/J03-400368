 rules in the grammar (6,765, or 54.5%) occur only once.
    These rules account for 0.72% of rules by token.
    That is, if one of the 939,382 rule tokens in sections 2&#8211;21 of the treebank were drawn at random, there would be a 0.72% chance of its being the only instance of that rule in the 939,382 tokens.
    On the other hand, if a rule were drawn at random from the 12,409 rules in the grammar induced from those sections, there would be a 54.5% chance of that rule&#8217;s having occurred only once.
    The percentage by token of the one-count rules is an indication of the coverage problem.
    From this estimate, 0.72% of all rules (or 1 in 139 rules) required in test data would never have been seen in training.
    It was also found that 15.0% (1 in 6.67) of all sentences have at least one rule that occurred just once.
    This gives an estimate that roughly 1 in 6.67 sentences in test data will not be covered by a grammar induced from 40,000 sentences in the treebank.
