CF production may be augmented with a set of tests (which perform similar types of operations to those available in a unification grammar).
    At parse time, whenever a sequence of constituents is about to be reduced into a higher-level constituent using a production, the augmentation associated with the production is invoked to check syntactic or semantic constraints such as agreement, pass attribute values between constituents, and construct a representation of the higher-level constituent.
    (This is the standard approach to parsing with attribute grammars).
    The parser is driven by an LR parse table; however, the table is constructed solely from the CF portion of the grammar, and so none of the extra information embodied in the augmentations is taken into account during its construction.
    Thus the predictive power of the parser to select the appropriate rule given a specific parse history is limited to the CF portion of the grammar, which must be defined manually by the grammar writer.
