			Our Model-S uses the single-prototype approach, while Our Model-M uses the multi-prototype approach.AvgSim calculates similarity with each prototype con tributing equally, while AvgSimC weighs the prototypes according to probability of the word belonging to that prototype?s cluster.
			word usages that correspond to the chosen synset, we first construct a set of related words of the chosen synset, including hypernyms, hyponyms, holonyms, meronyms and attributes.
			Using this set of related words, we filter out a sentence if the document in which the sentence appears does not include one of the related words.
			Finally, we randomly select one sentence from those that are left.
			Table 4 shows some examples from the dataset.
			Note that the dataset alo includes pairs of the same word.
			Single-prototype models would give the maxsimilarity score for those pairs, which can be prob lematic depending
