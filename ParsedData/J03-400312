, these assumptions cannot be verified and are arguably quite strong, but these limitations have not prevented generative models from being successfully applied to many NLP and speech tasks.
    (See Collins [2002] for a discussion of other ways of conceptualizing the parsing problem.)
    In the Penn Treebank (Marcus, Santorini, and Marcinkiewicz 1993), which is the source of data for our experiments, the rules are either internal to the tree, where LHS is a nonterminal and RHS is a string of one or more nonterminals, or lexical, where LHS is a part-of-speech tag and RHS is a word.
    (See Figure 1 for an example.)
    A PCFG can be lexicalized3 by associating a word w and a part-of-speech (POS) tag t with each nonterminal X in the tree.
    (See Figure 2 for an example tree.)
    The PCFG model can be applied to these lexicalized rules and trees in exactly the same way as before.
    Whereas before the nonterminals were simple (for example, S or NP), they are now extended to include a word and part-of-spee
