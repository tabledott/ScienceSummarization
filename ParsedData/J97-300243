    The raw phrasal translations suggested by the parse output were then filtered to remove those pairs containing more than 50% singletons, since such pairs are likely to be poor translation examples.
    Examples that occurred more than once in the corpus were also filtered out, since repetitive sequences in our corpus tend to be nongrammatical markup.
    This yielded approximately 2,800 filtered phrasal translations, some examples of which are shown in Figure 12.
    A random sample of the phrasal translation pairs was then drawn, giving a precision estimate of 81.5%.
    Although this already represents a useful level of accuracy, it does not in our opinion reflect the full potential of the formalism.
    Inspection revealed that performance was greatly hampered by our noisy translation lexicon, which was automatically learned; it could be manually post-edited to reduce errors.
    Commercial on-line translation lexicons could also be employed if available.
    Higher precision could be also ach
