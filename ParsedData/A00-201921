    Domain mismatch: Mismatch of the newspaper-domain word-specific corpora and essay-domain test corpus.
    One notable difference is that some TOEFL essay prompts call for the writer's opinion.
    Consequently, TOEFL essays often contain first person references, whereas newspaper articles are written in the third person.
