ave sufficient statistics that are lower-order marginal distributions.
    In the future, we will investigate other goodness-of-fit tests ([18], [1], [22]) that are perhaps more appropriate for sparse data.
    Unlike several previous approaches to word sense disambiguation ([29], [5], [7], [10]), nothing in this approach limits the selection of sense tags to a particular number or type of meaning distinctions.
    In this study, our goal was to address a non-trivial case of ambiguity, but one that would allow some comparison of results with previous work.
    As a result of these considerations, the word interest was chosen as a test case, and the six non-idiomatic noun senses of interest defined in LDOCE were selected as the tag set.
    The only restriction limiting the choice of corpus is the need for large amounts of on-line data.
    Due to availability, the Penn Treebank Wall Street Journal corpus was selected.
    In total, 2,476 usages2 of interest as a noun3 were automatically extracted from the cor
