 and y, respectively.
			Following the definition of mutual information, we derive the temporal mutual information modeling the term-to-term association over time, and the definition is given as follows.
			Definition 2 (Temporal Mutual Information) Given a timestamp t and a pair of terms x and y, the temporal mutual information of x and y in t is defined as: )|()|( )|,(log)|,()|,( tyPtxP tyxPtyxPtyxI = where P(x,y|t) is the probability of co-occurrence of terms x and y in timestamp t, P(x|t) and P(y|t) denote the probability of occurrences of x and y in timestamp t, respectively.
			To measure the change of mutual information in time dimension, we define the change of temporal mutual information as follows.
			Definition 3 (Change of Temporal Mutual Information) Given time interval [t1, t2], the change of temporal mutual information is defined as: 12 12 21 )|,()|,(),,,( tt tyxItyxIttyxC ? ?= where C(x,y,t1,t2) is the change of temporal mutual information of terms x and y in time interval [t1, t2], I(x,y| t1)
