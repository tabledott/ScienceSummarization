ilds on previous work by Reynar (Reynar, 1998; Reynar, 1994).
    The primary distinction of our method is the use of a ranking scheme and the cosine similarity measure (van Rijsbergen, 1979) in formulating the similarity matrix.
    We propose that the similarity values of short text segments is statistically insignificant.
    Thus, one can only rely on their order, or rank, for clustering.
  
  
    Existing work falls into one of two categories, lexical cohesion methods and multi-source methods (Yaari, 1997).
    The former stem from the work of Halliday and Hasan (Halliday and Hasan, 1976).
    They proposed that text segments with similar vocabulary are likely to be part of a coherent topic segment.
    Implementations of this idea use word stem repetition (Youmans, 1991; Reynar, 1994; Ponte and Croft, 1997), context vectors (Hearst, 1994; Yaari, 1997; Kaufmann, 1999; Eichmann et al., 1999), entity repetition (Kan et al., 1998), semantic similarity (Morris and Hirst, 1991; Kozima, 1993), word distance m
