ork if there were no labeled target instances.
    Indeed, all the above methods do not make use of the unlabeled instances in the target domain.
    In contrast, our instance weighting framework allows unlabeled target instances to contribute to the model estimation.
    Blitzer et al. (2006) propose a domain adaptation method that uses the unlabeled target instances to infer a good feature representation, which can be regarded as weighting the features.
    In contrast, we weight the instances.

    Domain adaptation is a very important problem with applications to many NLP tasks.
    In this paper, we formally analyze the domain adaptation problem and propose a general instance weighting framework for domain adaptation.
    The framework is flexible to support many different strategies for a
