ntence condensation that employs linguistically rich LFG grammars in a parsing/generation-based stochastic sentence condensation system.
    Fine-grained dependency structures are output by the parser, then modified by a highly expressive transfer system, and filtered by a constraint-based generator.
    Stochastic selection of generation-filtered reduced structures uses a powerful Maximum-Entropy model.
    As shown in an experimental evaluation, summarization quality of the system output is state-of-the-art, and grammaticality of condensed strings is guaranteed.
    Robustness techniques for parsing and generation guarantee that the system produces non-empty output for unseen input.
    Overall, the summarization quality achieved by our system is similar to the results reported in Knight and Marcu (2000).
    This might seem disappointing considering the more complex machinery employed in our approach.
    It has to be noted that these results are partially due to the somewhat artificial nature of the data
