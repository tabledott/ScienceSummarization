matically.
    Unlabeled recall includes cases that were identified as a frame element but given the wrong role.
    The results show a familiar trade-off between coverage and accuracy.
    Conditioning both the head word and path features on the frame reduces coverage but improves accuracy.
    A linear interpolation, &#955;1P(r I path, f ) + &#955;2P(r I h,f) + &#955;3P(r I pt, position, voice,f) achieved 79.4% performance on the test set, significantly better than any of the individual distributions and approaching the result of 82.1% for the original system, using target-specific statistics and thematic roles.
    This result indicates that predicates in the same frame behave similarly in terms of their argument structure, a finding generally consistent with theories of linking that claim that the syntactic realization of verb arguments can be predicted from their semantics.
    We would expect verbs in the same frame to be semantically similar and to have the same patterns of argument structure.
