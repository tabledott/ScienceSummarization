ed version of Roget's Thesaurus (1977) was used.
    The chains were built by hand.
    Automation was not possible, for lack of a machine-readable copy of the thesaurus.
    Given a copy, implementation would clearly be straightforward.
    It is expected that research with an automated system and a large sample space of text would give valuable information on the fine-tuning of the parameter settings used in the general algorithm.
    Five types of thesaural relations between words were found to be necessary in forming chains, but two (the first two below) are by far the most prevalent, constituting over 90% of the lexical relationships.
    The relationships are the following: has a pointer to category 830.
    Terrified has category 860 that likewise has a pointer to category 830 (see Figure 3.5).
    One must consider how much transitivity to use when computing lexical chains.
    Specifically, if word a is related to word b, word b is related to word c, and word c is related to word d then is word a rel
