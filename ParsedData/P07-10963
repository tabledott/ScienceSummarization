ence learning problem.
    Our system reports an error rate of 2.67% on the standard PTB test set, a relative 3.3% error reduction of the previous best system (Toutanova et al., 2003) by using fewer features.
    By using deterministic search, it obtains an error rate of 2.73%, a 5.9% relative error reduction over the previous best deterministic algorithm (Tsuruoka and Tsujii, 2005).
    The new POS tagger is similar to (Toutanova et al., 2003; Tsuruoka and Tsujii, 2005) in the way that we employ context features.
    We use a bidirectional search strategy (Woods, 1976; Satta and Stock, 1994), and our algorithm is based on Perceptron learning (Collins, 2002).
    A unique contribution of our work is on the integration of individual classification and inference order selection, which are learned simultaneously.
  
  
    We first present an example of POS tagging to show the idea of bidirectional labeling.
    Then we present the inference algorithm and the learning algorithm.
    Suppose that we have an input
