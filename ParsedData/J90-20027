tion and have the redeeming feature that they are easy to make and to use.
    We can see the power of a trigram model by applying it to something that we call bag translation from English into English.
    In bag translation we take a sentence, cut it up into words, place the words in a bag, and then try to recover the sentence given the bag.
    We use the n-gram model to rank different arrangements of the words in the bag.
    Thus, we treat an arrangement S as better than another arrangement S' if Pr(S) is greater than Pr(S').
    We tried this scheme on a random sample of sentences.
    From a collection of 100 sentences, we considered the 38 sentences with fewer than 11 words each.
    We had to restrict the length of the sentences because the number of possible rearrangements grows exponentially with sentence length.
    We used a trigram language model that had been constructed for a speech recognition system.
    We were able to recover 24 (63%) of the sentences exactly.
    Sometimes, the sentence t
