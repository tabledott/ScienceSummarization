to train the reordering component of their MT model.
    Lattice- and hypergraphbased variants of MERT (Macherey et al., 2008; Kumar et al., 2009) are more stable than traditional MERT, but also require significant engineering efforts.
  
  
    We have described a simple technique for tuning an MT system that is on par with the leading techniques, exhibits reliable behavior, scales gracefully to high-dimension feature spaces, and is remarkably easy to implement.
    We have demonstrated, via a litany of experiments, that our claims are valid and that this technique is widely applicable.
    It is our hope that the adoption of PRO tuning leads to fewer headaches during tuning and motivates advanced MT feature engineering research.
