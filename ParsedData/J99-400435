n infinitely many terms.
    In this section, we give relatively efficient formulas for computing the values of items.
    There are three cases that must be handled.
    First is the base case, when x is a rule.
    In this case, inner(x) is trivially {(x)}, the set containing the single derivation tree x.
    Thus, V(x) GDEmner(x) 17(D) = The second and third cases occur when x is an item.
    Recall that each item is associated with a bucket, and that the buckets are ordered.
    Each item x is either associated with a nonlooping bucket, in which case its value depends only on the values of items in earlier buckets; or with a looping bucket, in which case its value depends potentially on the values of other items in the same bucket.
    In the case when the item is associated with a nonlooping bucket, if we compute items in the same order as their buckets, we can assume that the values of items al ... ak contributing to the value of item b are known.
    We give a formula for computing the value of item b
