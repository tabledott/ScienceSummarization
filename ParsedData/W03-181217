djectives and adverbs.
    The nouns are arranged according to hyponymy or ISA relations, e.g. a car is a kind of automobile.
    The verbs are arranged according to troponym or &#8220;manner-of&#8221; relations, where murder is a manner of killing, so kill immediately dominates murder in the hierarchy.
    We used WordNet for evaluation by way of looking at: (a) hyponymy, and (b) semantic distance.
    Hyponymy provides the most immediate way of evaluating decomposability.
    With simple decomposable MWEs, we can expect the constituents (and particularly the head) to be hypernyms (ancestor nodes) or synonyms of the MWE.
    That is, simple decomposable MWEs are generally endocentric, although there are some exceptions to this generalisation such as vice president arguably not being a hyponym of president.
    No hyponymy relation holds with non-decomposable or idiosyncratically decomposable MWEs (i.e., they are exocentric), as even if the semantics of the head noun can be determined through decomposition, b
