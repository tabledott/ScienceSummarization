 the sentence.
    Therefore, this may not be a true negative example, meaning that this can be positive in other sentences.
    In addition, if a segment is not modified by a modifier because of cross dependency constraints but has a similar content word with correct modifiee, this relation also becomes an exception.
    Actually, we cannot ignore these exceptions, since most segments modify a segment on its immediate right hand side.
    By using all candidates of dependency relation as the training examples, we have committed to a number of exceptions which are hard to be trained upon.
    Looking in particular on a powerful heuristics for dependency structure analysis: &#8220;A segment tends to modify a nearer segment if possible,&#8221; it will be most important to train whether the current segment modifies the segment on its immediate right hand side.
    The cascaded chunking model is designed along with this heuristics and can remove the exceptional relations which has less potential to improve perfor
