zation of corpus-based tuples allows distributional information to be represented in a similar way to other types of knowledge.
    In linguistics, cognitive science, and AI, semantic and conceptual knowledge is represented in terms of symbolic structures built around typed relations between elements, such as synsets, concepts, properties, and so forth.
    This is customary in lexical networks like WordNet (Fellbaum 1998), commonsense resources like ConceptNet (Liu and Singh 2004), and cognitive models of semantic memory (Rogers and McClelland 2004).
    The tensor representation of corpus-based distributional data promises to build new bridges between existing approaches to semantic representation that still appear distant in many respects.
    This may indeed contribute to the ongoing efforts to combine distributional and symbolic approaches to meaning (Clark and Pulman 2007).
  
  
    We first introduce the notion of a weighted tuple structure, the format in which DM expects the distributional data extra
