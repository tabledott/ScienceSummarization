ets stand out as strong performers.
    The only significant improvements in accuracy come from the PARTSOF-SPEECH and RELIABILITY-CLASS feature sets for Ripper.
    These improvements are perhaps not surprising given that the Ripper baseline was much lower to begin with.
    Very few feature sets show any improvement for SVM.
    Again, this is not unexpected given that all the features together performed worse than the word+priorpol baseline Increases and decreases for a given metric as compared to the word+priorpol baseline (word baseline for Ripper) are indicated by + or &#8211;, respectively; ++ or &#8211; &#8211; indicates the change is significant at the p &lt; 0.1 level; +++ or &#8211; &#8211; &#8211; indicates significance at the p &lt; 0.05 level; nc indicates no change. for SVM.
    The performance of the feature sets for BoosTexter and TiMBL are perhaps the most revealing.
    In the previous experiments using all the features together, these algorithms produced classifiers with the same high perf
