sed only a rudimentary confidence measure to perform active learning, introducing no additional features beyond those used in training and decoding.
    The confidence score we assign to a sentence is just the un-normalized difference in perceptron scores between the highest scoring theory and the second highest scoring alternative.
    To apply active learning, we simply To compute the confidence scores efficiently, we use a combination of the forward Viterbi and backward Viterbi scores at each word.
    We define the confidence at a word to be the difference between the summed forward and backward scores of the best and second best tags for that word.
    The confidence for the entire sentence is then just the minimum of the scores at each word position.
  
  
    We performed our experiments using the seven MUC-6 name categories: person, organization, location, date, time, percent, and monetary amount.
    For annotated data, we used text from Sections 02-23 of the Wall Street Journal Treebank corpus that
