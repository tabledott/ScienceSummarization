			Likewise, the only possible steps per mitted in either variant from ?wizard#n? and ?wizard#a? are to the Synsets that can be expressed with those nodes: ?ace#n#3,?
			?sorcerer#n#1,?
			and ?charming#a#1.?
			Again, the amount of mass given to these nodes depends on the strength of these edge weights, which is determined by the SemCor usage counts.
			The highest probability nodes in the table are common because both model variants share the same initial links.However, the orders of the remaining nodes in the station ary distributions are different.
			In the MarkovLink variant, the random walk can only proceed to other S
