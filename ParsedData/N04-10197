    We obtain two SCUs from the underlined portions of the sentences above.
    Each SCU has a weight corresponding to the number of summaries it appears in; SCU1 has weight=4 and SCU2 has weight=33: 3The grammatical constituents contributing to an SCU are bracketed and coindexed with the SCU ID.
    The remaining parts of the four sentences above end up as contributors to nine different SCUs of different weight and granularity.
    Though we look at multidocument summaries rather than single document ones, SCU annotation otherwise resembles the annotation of factoids in (Halteren and Teufel, 2003); as they do with factoids, we find increasing numbers of SCUs as the pool of summaries grows.
    For our 100 word summaries, we find about 3440 distinct SCUs across four summaries; with ten summaries this number grows to about 60.
    A more complete comparison of the two approaches follows in section 4.
    An SCU consists of a set of contributors that, in their sentential contexts, express
