bors (solid) and (fluid), the generalization stops there according to MDL.
    In contrast, the nodes under (life_form ...) have relatively small differences in their frequencies, and thus they are generalized to the node (life_form ...).
    The same is true of the nodes under (artifact).
    Since (... amount ...) has a much An example generalization result (for the direct object slot of eat). higher frequency than its neighbors (time) and (space), the generalization does not go up higher.
    All of these results seem to agree with human intuition, indicating that our method results in an appropriate level of generalization.
    Table 7 shows generalization results for the direct object slot of eat and some other arbitrarily selected verbs, where classes are sorted in descending order of their probability values.
    (Classes with probabilities less than 0.05 are discarded due to space limitations.)
    Table 8 shows the computation time required (on a SPARC &amp;quot;Ultra 1&amp;quot; work station) to obt
