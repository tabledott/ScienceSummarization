l of noun phrase at most) and operates on the basis of antecedent-tracking preferences (referred to hereafter as &amp;quot;antecedent indicators&amp;quot;).
    The approach works as follows: it takes as an input the output of a text processed by a part-of-speech tagger, identifies the noun phrases which precede the anaphor within a distance of 2 sentences, checks them for gender and number agreement with the anaphor and then applies the genre-specific antecedent indicators to the remaining candidates (see next section).
    The noun phrase with the highest aggregate score is proposed as antecedent; in the rare event of a tie, priority is given to the candidate with the higher score for immediate reference.
    If immediate reference has not been identified, then priority is given to the candidate with the best collocation pattern score.
    If this does not help, the candidate with the higher score for indicating verbs is preferred.
    If still no choice is possible, the most recent from the remaining candi
