    Prepositional arguments are especially difficult for a person to anticipate when defining case frames by hand.
    It is virtually impossible for a person to correctly and completely anticipate all of the arguments that are necessary for a large set of case frames for a domain.
    Omitting an important argument will result in the failure to recognize role objects in certain syntactic constructions.
    In practice, people often turn to the corpus to look for argument structures that they might have missed.
    For example, the UMass/MUC-4 terrorism case frames wer
