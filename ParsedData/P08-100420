    To compare performance of the extractors when a small set of target relationships is known in advance, we used labeled data for four different relations &#8211; corporate acquisitions, birthplaces, inventors of products and award winners.
    The first two datasets were collected from the Web, and made available by Bunescu and Mooney (2007).
    To augment the size of our corpus, we used the same technique to collect data for two additional relations, and manually labelled positive and negative instances by hand over all collections.
    For each of the four relations in our collection, we trained R1-CRF from labeled training data, and ran each of R1-CRF and O-CRF over the re
