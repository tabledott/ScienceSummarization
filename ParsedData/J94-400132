    For example, an NB with a postposition &amp;quot;NO&amp;quot; can depend on an NB, and a conditional form of a PB (ending with &amp;quot;BA&amp;quot;) can depend on a PB.
    When a bunsetsu can depend on two or more bunsetsus in the range, its head is determined by the following heuristics: bunsetsu accompanying a comma usually depends on a bunsetsu farther away than the nearest one.
    Based on our observation we consider such a bunsetsu to depend on the second nearest head.
    These rules are rather simple, but they are still useful when applied to the reduced form of a sentence, as shown in the discussion of the experiments.
    We illustrate this process for the sentence in Figure 12.
    At first, the CS [HYOUDAI(a title),]-[CHOSHA(an author),]- [SHUDAI-NADO-NO(such as a theme)] is analyzed; because each conjunct consists of only one bunsetsu, the analysis results only in creating Sadao Kurohashi and Makoto Nagao Syntactic Analysis Method a CS node and assigning each bunsetsu to it (Figure 12a
