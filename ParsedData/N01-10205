    As a final note, Table 9 shows the cross-language translation rates for some of the investigated languages.
    When translating from English to one of the Romance languages, using Spanish as the bridge language achieves the highest accuracy; and using Russian as the bridge language achieves the best performance when translating from English to the Slavic languages.
    However, note that using English alone without a bridge language when translating to the Romance languages still achieves reasonable performance, due to the substantial French and Latinate presence in English vocabulary.
