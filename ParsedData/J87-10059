icity of certain readings due to lexical semantic or world knowledge, such as the fact that a child cannot outscope every man in the sentence I've met a child of every man in this room.
    Computational research on quantifier scoping has emphasized generating a single scoping, which can be thought of as heuristically primary, as discussed by, for example, Woods (1977), Pereira (1983), and Grosz et al. (1985).
    We are concerned not with generating the best reading but with generating all readings.
    The reader may object that it is inappropriate in a practical natural language system to generate scopings one by one for testing against semantic and pragmatic criteria.
    Instead, one should appeal to various heuristics to generate only the most likely reading, or at least to generate readings in order of their plausibility.
    These include the following: relational head noun usually outscopes the head noun; and We are sympathetic with this view.
    Nevertheless, there are several reasons that codifyin
