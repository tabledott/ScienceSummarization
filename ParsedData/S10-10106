ction with one other, in many cases based on version 1.2.1 of the TimeML annotation guidelines for English3.
    Not all corpora contained data for all six tasks.
    Table 1 gives the size of the training set and the relation tasks that were included.
    All corpora include event and timex annotation.
    The French corpus contained a subcorpus with temporal relations but these relations were not split into the four tasks C through F. Annotation proceeded in two phases: a dual annotation phase where two annotators annotate each document and an adjudication phase where a judge resolves disagreements between the annotators.
    Most languages used BAT, the Brandeis Annotation Tool (Verhagen, 2010), a generic webbased annotation tool that is centered around the notion of annotation tasks.
    With the task decomposition allowed by BAT, it is possible to structure the complex task of temporal annotation by splitting it up in as many sub tasks as seems useful.
    As 3Seehttp://www.timeml.org. such, BAT was well
