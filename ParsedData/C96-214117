			Therefore a model could be useful that distinguishes between local and big jumps.
			The models have also been tested on the Verb- mobil Translation Corpus as well as on a small Corpus used in the EuTrans project.
			The sen- tences in the EuTrans corpus are in general short phrases with simple grammatical structures.
			However, the training corpus is very small and the produced alignments are generally of poor quality.
			There is no marked difference for the two align- ment models.
