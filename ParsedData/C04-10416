Gbank.2 These figures show that using a fre quency cutoff can significantly reduce the size of the category set with only a small loss in coverage.
			2The numbers differ slightly from those reported in Clark (2002) since a newer version of CCGbank is being used here.
			Clark (2002) compares the size of grammarsextracted from CCGbank with automatically extracted LTAGs.
			The grammars of Chen and Vijay Shanker (2000) contain between 2,000 and 9,000 tree frames, depending on the parameters used inthe extraction process, significantly more elemen tary structures than the number of lexical categories derived from CCGbank.
			We hypothesise this is a key factor in the higher accuracy for supertaggingusing a CCG grammar compared with an automati cally extracted LTAG.
			2.2 The Tagging Model.
			The supertagger uses probabilities p(y|x) where y is a lexical category and x is a context.
			The conditional probabilities have the following log-linear form: p(y|x) = 1 Z(x)e ? i ?i fi(y,x) (1) where fi is a feature, ?
