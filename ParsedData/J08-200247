onsidering both core and modifying arguments.
    Training a model which has such a huge number of classes is infeasible if the model does not factorize due to strong independence assumptions.
    Therefore, in order to be able to incorporate long-range dependencies in our models, we chose to adopt a re-ranking approach (Collins 2000), which selects from likely assignments generated by a model which makes stronger independence assumptions.
    We utilize the top n assignments of our local semantic role labeling model PSRL to generate likely assignments.
    As can be seen from Figure 8(a), for relatively small values of n, our re-ranking approach does not present a serious bottleneck to performance.
    We used a value of n = 10 for training.
    In Figure 8(a) we can see that if we could pick, using an oracle, the best assignment out of the top 10 assignments according to the local model, we would achieve an F-Measure of 97.3 on all arguments.
    Increasing the number of n to 30 results in a very small gain
