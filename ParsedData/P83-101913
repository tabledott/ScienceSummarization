    True Ungrammaticalities.
    A small percentage of spoken utterances are truly ungrammatical.
    That is, they do not result from any regular grammatical process (however rare), nor are they instances of successful self-correction.
    Unexceptionable examples are hard to find, but the following give the flavor. focus of this paper.
    Self-corrected strings all have the characteristic that some extraneous material was apparently inserted, and that expunging some substring results in a well-formed syntactic structure, which is apparently consistent with the meaning that is intended.
    In the degenerate case, self-correction inserts non-lexical material, which the syntactic processor ignores, as in (4).
    The minimal non-lexical material that self-correction might insert is the editing signal itself.
    Other cases (examples 610 below) are only interpretable given the assumption that certain words, which are potentially pa
