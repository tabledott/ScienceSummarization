	A Shortest Path Dependency Kernel For Relation Extraction
		We present a novel approach to relation extraction, based on the observation thatthe information required to assert a rela tionship between two named entities in the same sentence is typically capturedby the shortest path between the two entities in the dependency graph.
		Exper iments on extracting top-level relationsfrom the ACE (Automated Content Ex traction) newspaper corpus show that thenew shortest path dependency kernel outperforms a recent approach based on de pendency tree kernels.
	
	
			One of the key tasks in natural language process ing is that of Information Extraction (IE), which istraditionally divided into three subproblems: coref erence resolution, named entity recognition, and relation extraction.
			Consequently, IE corpora are typically annotated with information corresponding to these subtasks (MUC (Grishman, 1995), ACE(NIST, 2000)), facilitating the development of sys tems that target only one or a subset of the threeproblems
