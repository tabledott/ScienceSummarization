ring them for useful information.
    Such a system would have a large library of extraction patterns for many different types of relations.
    These patterns could be manually generated, such as the ones described here, or learned from text, as described in Ravichandran and Hovy (2002).
    Each pattern would have a machine-learned filter in order to insure high precision output relations.
    These relations would then be stored in repositories that could be quickly and easily searched to answer user queries.
    7 In this way, we envision a system similar to (Lin et al., 2002).
    However, instead of relying on costly structured databases and pain stakingly generated wrappers, repositories are automatically filled with information from many different patterns.
    Access to these repositories does not require wrapper generation, because all information is stored in easily accessible natural language text.
    The key here is the use of learned filters which insure that the information in the repository i
