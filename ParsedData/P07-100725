ress the specific problem of how to perform domain adaptation for WSD.
  
  
    Domain adaptation is important to ensure the general applicability of WSD systems across different domains.
    In this paper, we have shown that active learning is effective in reducing the annotation effort required in porting a WSD system to a new domain.
    Also, we have successfully used an EM-based algorithm to detect a change in predominant sense between the training and new domain.
    With this information on the predominant sense of the new domain and incorporating count-merging, we have shown that we are able to improve the effectiveness of the original adaptation process achieved by the basic active learning approach.
