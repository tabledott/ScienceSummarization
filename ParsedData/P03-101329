    Beil et al. (2002) report an evaluation using an NP chunking task, achieving 92% LR and LP.
    They also report the results of a task-based evaluation (extraction of sucategorization frames).
    There is some research on treebank-based parsing of languages other than English.
    The work by Collins et al. (1999) and Bikel and Chiang (2000) has demonstrated the applicability of the Collins (1997) model for Czech and Chinese.
    The performance reported by these authors is substantially lower than the one reported for English, which might be due to the fact that less training data is available for Czech and Chinese (see Table 1).
    This hypothesis cannot be tested, as the authors do not present learning curves for their models.
    However, the learning curve for Negra (see Figure 1) indicates that the performance of the Collins (1997) model is stable, even for small training sets.
    Collins et al. (1999) and Bikel and Chiang (2000) do not compare their models with an unlexical
