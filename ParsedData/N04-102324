ng and the regression algorithm tie for first place on feature combinations.
    However, the differences are not significant.
    We notice in those separable feature sets the performance on the development data and the test data are tightly consistent.
    Whenever the log-loss on the development set is decreased, and BLEU score on the test set goes up, and vice versa.
    This tells us the merit of these two algorithms; By optimizing on the loss function for the development data, we can improve performance on the test data.
    This property is guaranteed by the theoretical analysis and is borne out in the experimental results.
  
  
    In this paper, we have successfully applied the discriminative reranking to machine translation.
    We applied a new perceptron-like splitting algorithm and ordinal regression algorithm with uneven margin to reranking in MT.
    We provide a theoretical justification for the performance of the splitting algorithms.
    Experimental results provided in this paper show that
