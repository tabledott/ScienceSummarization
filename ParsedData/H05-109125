he dimensions in the corresponding Hilbert space is not obvious.
			For the shortest-path kernels, the semantics is known bydefinition: each path feature corresponds to a dimen sion in the Hilbert space.
			This transparency allows us to easily restrict the types of patterns counted by the kernel to types that we deem relevant for relationextraction.
			The tree kernels are also more time con suming, especially in the sparse setting, where they count sparse subsequences of children common to nodes in the two trees.
			In (Zelenko et al, 2003), the 730 tree kernel is computed in O(mn) time, where m and n are the number of nodes in the two trees.
			This changes to O(mn3) in the sparse setting.Our shortest-path intuition bears some similar ity with the underlying assumption of the relational pathfinding algorithm from (Richards and Mooney,1992) : ?in most relational domains, important con cepts will be represented by a small number of fixedpaths among the constants defining a positive instance ? for example, th
