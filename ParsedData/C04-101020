ith sentence length, the root accuracy drops more drastically (which also very clearly affects the complete match score).
			This may be taken to suggest that some kind of preprocessing in the form of clausing may help to improve overall accuracy.Turning finally to the assessment of labeled de pendency accuracy, we are not aware of any strictlycomparable results for the given data set, but Buch holz (2002) reports a labeled accuracy of 72.6% for the assignment of grammatical relations using a cascade of memory-based processors.
			This can be compared with a labeled attachment score of 84.4% for Model 2 with our B set, which is of about the same size as the set used by Buchholz, although the labels are not the same.
			In another study, Blaheta and Charniak (2000) report an F-measure of 98.9% for the assignment of Penn Treebank grammatical role labels (our G set) to phrases that were correctly parsed by the parser described in Charniak (2000).
			If null labels (corresponding to our DEP labels) areexcluded, t
