is difficult to explicitly define this function, since can contain features with numerical as well as non-numerical values.
    Note that the features, thus space , vary from an NP pattern to another and the classification function will be pattern dependent.
    The novelty of this learning problem is the feature space and the nature ofthe discriminating An essential aspect of our approach below is the word sense disambiguation (WSD) of the content words (nouns, verbs, adjectives and adverbs).
    Using a stateof-the-art open-text WSD system, each word is mapped into its corresponding WordNet 2.0 sense.
    When disambiguating each word, the WSD algorithm takes into account the surrounding words, and this is one important way through which context gets to play a role in the semantic classification of NPs.
    So far, we have identified and experimented with the following NP features: specifies the WordNet synset of the modifier noun.
    In case the modifier is a denominal adjective, we take the synset of the
