 E R(q0, qi) and C is finite.
    This ends the proof of the theorem.
    0 There are transducers that do not have the twins property and that are still determinizable.
    To characterize such transducers, more complex conditions that we will not describe here are required.
    However, in the case of trim unambiguous transducers, the twins property provides a characterization of determinizable transducers.
    Let Ti = (Q1, E, /1, F1, Ei, Ai, Pi) be a trim unambiguous string-to-weight transducer defined on the tropical semiring.
    Then Ti is determirtizable iff it has the twins property.
    Proof According to the previous theorem, if T.1 has the twins property, then it is determinizable.
    Assume now that T does not have the twins property, then there exist at least two states q and q' in Q that are not twins.
    There exists (u, v) E E* such that: ({q, q'} c SW, u), q E 61(q,v),q' E 81(qcv)) and 01(q, v, q) 01(q' ,v, q').
    Consider the weighted subsets 52(i2, UVk), with k E Ai, constructed by the
