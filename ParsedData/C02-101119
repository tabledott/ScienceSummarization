e play positive roles.
			We removed each of the key components of EM-TF-IDF and used the remaining components as a variant of it to perform translation selection.
			The key components are (1) idf value and (2) EM.
			The variants, thus, respectively make use of (1) EM-based frequency vectors (EM-TF), (2) the baseline method MT-TF-IDF.
			Figure 7 and Table 1 show the results.
			We see that EM-TF-IDF outperforms both variants, indicating that all of the components within EM-TF-IDF are needed.
			Comparing the results between MT-NBC-Ensemble and EM-NBC-Ensemble and the results between MT-TF-IDF and EM-TF-IDF, we see that the uses of the EM Algorithm can indeed help to improve translation accuracies.
