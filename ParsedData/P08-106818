ined on the reduced-size datasets, the gains of cluster-based features are more pronounced, but substantial improvements are obtained even when the tagger is accurate.
    It is interesting to consider the amount by which cluster-based features reduce the need for supervised data, given a desired level of accuracy.
    Based on Table 3, we can extrapolate that cluster-based features reduce the need for supervised data by roughly a factor of 2.
    For example, the performance of the dep1c and dep2c models trained on 1k sentences is roughly the same as the performance of the dep1 and dep2 models, respectively, trained on 2k sentences.
    This approximate data-halving effect can be observed throughout the results in Table 3.
    When combining the effects of model order and cluster-based features, the reductions in the amount of supervised data required are even larger.
    For example, in scenario 1 the dep2c model trained on 1k sentences is close in performance to the dep1 model trained on 4k sentences, and
