 strong dependency between the punctuation mark and the modifier generated after it.
    Punctuation is therefore generated with the following phrase through a punc flag that is similar to the coord flag (a binary-valued feature equal to one if a punctuation mark is generated with the following phrase).
    Under this model, NP(Vinken) &#8594; NPB(Vinken) ,(,) ADJP(old) would have probability Pp is a new parameter type for generation of punctuation tag/word pairs.
    The generation of punc=1 along with ADJP(old) in the example implicitly requires generation of a punctuation tag/word pair through the Pp parameter.
    The generation of this tag/word pair is conditioned on the two words in the punctuation dependency (Vinken and old in the example) and the label on their relationship (NP,NPB,ADJP in the example.)
    Sentences in the treebank occur frequently with PRO subjects that may or may not be controlled: As the treebank annotation currently stands, the nonterminal is S whether or not a sentence has an ov
