    We use a set of 30 word pairs from a study carried out by (Miller and Charles, 1991).
    These word pairs are a subset of 65 word pairs used by (Rubenstein and Goodenough, 1965), in a similar study almost 25 years earlier.
    In this study, human subjects assigned relatedness scores to the selected word pairs.
    The word pairs selected for this study ranged from highly related pairs to unrelated pairs.
    We use these human judgments for our evaluation.
    Each of the word pairs have been scored by humans on a scale of 0 to 5, where 5 is the most related.
    The mean of the scores of each pair from all subjects is considered as the &#8220;human relatedness score&#8221; for that pair.
    The pairs are then ranked with respect to their scores.
    The most related pair is the first on the list and the least related pair is at the end of the list.
    We then have each of the measures of relatedness score the word pairs and a another ranking of the word pairs is created corresponding to each o
