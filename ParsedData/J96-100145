n the future, we plan to design more flexible techniques that would work from a loosely aligned corpus (see Section 9).
    To compile collocations, we used XTRACT on the English version of the Hansards.
    Some of the collocations retrieved are shown in Table 5.
    Collocations labeled &amp;quot;fixed,&amp;quot; such as International Human Rights Covenants, are rigid compounds.
    Collocations labeled &amp;quot;flexible&amp;quot; are pairs of words that can be separated by intervening words or occur in reverse order, possibly with different inflected forms.
    Given a source English collocation, Champollion first identifies in the database corpus all the sentences containing the source collocation.
    It then attempts to find all words that can be part of the translation of the collocation, producing all words that are highly correlated with the source collocation as a whole.
    Once this set of words is identified, Champollion iteratively combines these words in groups, so that each group is in turn h
