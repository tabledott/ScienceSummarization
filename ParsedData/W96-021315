trast, the MaxEnt model combines diverse and non-local information sources without making any independence assumptions.
    A POS tagger is one component in the SDT based statistical parsing system described in (Jelinek et al., 1994, Magerman, 1995).
    The total word accuracy on Wall St. Journal data, 96.5%(Magerman, 1995), is similar to that presented in this paper.
    However, the aforementioned SDT techniques require word classes(Brown et al., 1992) to help prevent data fragmentation, and a sophisticated smoothing algorithm to mitigate the effects of any fragmentation that occurs.
    Unlike SDT, the MaxEnt training procedure does not recursively split the data, and hence does not suffer from unreliable counts due to data fragmentation.
    As a result, no word classes are required and a trivial count cutoff suffices as a smoothing procedure in order to achieve roughly the same level of accuracy.
    TBL is a non-statistical approach to POS tagging which also uses a rich feature representation, and perf
