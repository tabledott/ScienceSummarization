propriate removal of valid affixes (&#8220;ally&#8221;&#8212;&#8220;all&#8221;), failure to resolve morphological ambiguities (&#8220;hated&#8221;&#8212;&#8220;hat&#8221;), and pruning of semi-productive affixes (&#8220;dirty&#8221;-A&#8220;dirt&#8221;).
    Yet we illustrated that induced semantics can help overcome some of these errors.
    However, we have since observed that induced semantics can give rise to different kinds of problems.
    For instance, morphological variants may be semantically opaque such that the meaning of one variant cannot be readily determined by the other (&#8220;reusability&#8221;-A&#8220;use&#8221;).
    Additionally, highfrequency function words may be conflated due to having weak semantic information (&#8220;as&#8221;&#8212;&#8220;a&#8221;).
    Coupling semantic and orthographic statistics, as well as introducing induced syntactic information and relational transitivity can help in overcoming these problems.
    Therefore, we begin with an approach similar to our previous a
