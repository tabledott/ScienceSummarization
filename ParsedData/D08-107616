provides a novel upper bound for the number of cost minimizing paths in a directed acyclic graph with arcspecific affine cost functions.
    The bound is not only meaningful for proving the space efficiency of lattice MERT, but it also provides deeper insight into the structure and complexity of the unsmoothed error surface induced by log-linear models.
    Since we are examining a special class of shortest paths problems, we will invert the sign of each local feature function value in order to turn the feature scores into corresponding costs.
    Hence, the objective of finding the best translation hypotheses in a phrase lattice becomes the problem of finding all cost-minimizing paths in a graph with affine cost functions.
