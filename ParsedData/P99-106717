Based on the word co-occurrences in the English corpus, an association matrix was computed whose rows were all word types of the corpus with a frequency of 100 or higher3 and whose columns were all English words occurring as first translations of the German words in the base lexicon!'
    3.
    Using the similarity function, each of the German vectors was compared to all vectors of the English matrix.
    The mapping between vector positions was based on the first translations given in the base lexicon.
    For each of the German source words, the English vocabulary was ranked according to the resulting similarity value.
    3 The limitation to words with frequencies above 99 was introduced for computational reasons to reduce the number of vector comparisons and thus speed up the program.
    (The English corpus contains 657,787 word types after lemmatization, which leads to extremely large matrices.)
    The purpose of this limitation was not to limit the number of translation candidates considered.
