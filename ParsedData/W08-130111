ent words are related; and thus these links are often used by downstream applications (Lin and Pantel, 2001; Snow et al., 2005).
    The usefulness of the representation is exemplified in the sentence A similar technique is almost impossible to apply to other crops, such as cotton, soybeans and rice (WSJ-R) for which SD gives direct links between the entities joined through the preposition such as: SD prep such as(crops, cotton) prep such as(crops, soybeans) prep such as(crops, rice) A similar collapsing treatment takes place for conjuncts (DP5).
    Consider the following sentence: Bell, based in Los Angeles, makes and distributes electronic, computer and building products (WSJR).
    Figures 1 and 2 give the full dependency output from SD and GR, respectively.
    The numbers after the words in the SD representation indicate the word position in the sentence.3 From the SD representation, one can easily see that the sentence talks about electronic products and computer products as well as building products.
