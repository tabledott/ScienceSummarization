ur word seg- menter, using the official scorer and test sets with gold-standard segmentations.
  Version V1 used only the basic features (Section 1.1); Version V2 used the basic features and additional features de- rived from our external dictionary (Section 1.2); Version V3 used the basic features but with ad- ditional training corpora (Section 1.3); and Ver- sion V4 is our official submitted version combin- ing basic features, external dictionary, and addi- tional training corpora.
  Table 2 shows the word segmentation accuracy (F measure) of the differ- ent versions of our word segmenter, when tested on the official test sets of the four corpora.
  The results indicate that the use of external dictionary increases segmentation accuracy.
  Similarly, the use of additional training corpora of different seg- mentation standards also increases segmentation accuracy.
  4 Conclusion Using a maximum entropy approach, our Chi- nese word segmenter achieves state-of-the-art ac- curacy, when evaluated on all four cor
