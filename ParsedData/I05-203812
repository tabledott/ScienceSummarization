 least one disagreement.
			We have made the ?gold standard?
			from the two sets of abstracts by resolving the disagreements, and the accuracy of the annotators against this gold standard were 96.7% for the first annotator and 97.4% for the second annotator.
			Of the disagreement, the most prominent were the cases involving coordination, espe cially the ones with ellipsis.
			For example, one annotator annotated the phrase ?IL-1- and IL-18 mediated function?
			as in Figure 2a, the other annotated as Figure 2b.
			Such problem is addressed in the PTB guideline and both formats are allowed as alter natives.
			As coordination with ellipsis occurs rather frequently in research abstracts, this kind of phenomena has higher effect on decrease of the agreement rate than in Penn Treebank.
			Of the 131 disagreements, 25 were on this type of coordination.
			Another source of disagreement is the at tachment of modifiers such as prepositional phrases and pronominal adjectives.
			However, most are ?benign ambiguity?
