ownstream MT quality.
    In an experiment using a syntactic MT system, we find that rules extracted from joint parses results in an increase of 2.4 BLEU points over rules extracted from independent parses.1 In sum, jointly parsing bitexts improves parses substantially, and does so in a way that that carries all the way through the MT pipeline.
  
  
    In our model, we consider pairs of sentences (s, s'), where we use the convention that unprimed variables are source domain and primed variables are target domain.
    These sentences have parse trees t (respectively t') taken from candidate sets T (T').
    Non-terminal nodes in trees will be denoted by n (n') and we abuse notation by equating trees with their node sets.
    Alignments a are simply at-mostone-to-one matchings between a pair of trees t and t' (see Figure 2a for an example).
    Note that we will also mention word alignments in feature definitions; a and the unqualified term alignment will always refer to node alignments.
