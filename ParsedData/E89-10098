t;sing&gt; to inherit from v:&lt;plur&gt;, that is, from the global initial context.
    To achieve this we change the CAT definition to be: CAT: &lt;sing&gt; == &amp;quot;&lt;plur&gt;&amp;quot;.
    Now we find that we can still derive the same plural theorems, but now in addition we get all these theorems concerning singular: For example, the derivation for the first of these is as follows: Finally, given a set of sentences T, we define the rule-closure of 7, rc1( T) to be the closure of T under finite application of the above inference rules in the conventional fashion.
  
  
    In addition to the conventional inference defined above, DATR has a nonmonotonic notion of inference by default: each definitional sentence about some node/path combination implicitly determines additional sentences about all the extensions to the path at that node for which no more specific definitional sentence exists in the theory.
    Our overall approach follows Moore (1983, 1985), whose treatment of inferences from sets of b
