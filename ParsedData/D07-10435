			In another solution, assigning each data point to a dis tinct cluster guarantees perfect homogeneity ? each cluster trivially contains only members of a singleclass.
			However, in terms of completeness, this so lution scores very poorly, unless indeed each classcontains only a single member.
			We define the dis tance from a perfect clustering is measured as theweighted harmonic mean of measures of homogene ity and completeness.
			Homogeneity: In order to satisfy our homogeneity criteria, a clustering must assign only those datapoints that are members of a single class to a single cluster.
			That is, the class distribution within each cluster should beskewed to a single class, that is, zero entropy.
			We de termine how close a given clustering is to this ideal by examining the conditional entropy of the class distribution given the proposed clustering.
			In the perfectly homogeneous case, this value, H(C|K), is 0.
			However, in an imperfect situation, the size of this value, in bits, is dependent on
