A pair of tapes is accepted if a sequence of transitions can be taken starting at the start-state (conventionally labeled 0) and at the beginning of the tapes and leading to a final state (indicated by double circles) at the end of both tapes.
    In the machine in Figure 1, there is a transition from state 0 to state 0 that translates every phoneme into itself, reflecting the fact that any phoneme can remain unchanged by the optional rule.
    These are shown schematically in the diagram.
    This machine will accept a pair of tapes just in case they stand in a certain relation: they must be identical except for possible replacements of N on the first tape with n on the second.
    In other words, the second tape must be one that could have resulted from applying the optional rule to the string on the first tape.
    But the rule is in fact obligatory, and this means that there must be no occurrences of N on the second tape.
    This condition is imposed by the transducer in Figure 2.
