  Classifying The Semantic Relations In Noun Compounds Via A Domain-Specific Lexical Hierarchy
  
    We are developing corpus-based techniques for identifying semantic relations at an intermediate level of description (more specific than those used in case frames, but more general than those used in traditional knowledge representation systems).
    In this paper we describe a classification algorithm for identifying relationships between two-word noun compounds.
    We find that a very simple approach using a machine learning algorithm and a domain-specific lexical hierarchy successfully generalizes from training instances, performing better on previously unseen words than a baseline consisting of training on the words themselves.
  
  
    We are exploring empirical methods of determining semantic relationships between constituents in natural language.
    Our current project focuses on biomedical text, both because it poses interesting challenges, and because it should be possible to make inferences abou
