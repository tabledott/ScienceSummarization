son Penn-Treebank (C/J) parser using unannotated biomedical data.
    As is well known, biomedical data is hard on parsers because it is so far from more &#8220;standard&#8221; English.
    To our knowledge this is the first application of self-training where the gap between the training and self-training data is so large.
    In section two, we look at previous work.
    In particular we note that there is, in fact, very little data on self-training when the corpora for self-training is so different from the original labeled data.
    Section three describes our main experiment on standard test data (Clegg and Shepherd, 2005).
    Section four looks at some preliminary results we obtained on development data that show in slightly more detail how selftraining improved the parser.
    We conclude in section five.
  
  
    While self-training has worked in several domains, the early results on self-training for parsing were negative (Steedman et al., 2003; Charniak, 1997).
    However more recent results have
