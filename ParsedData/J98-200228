and a number of models, the Bayesian estimator (posterior mode) selects a model /c/I that maximizes the posterior probability: where P(M) denotes the prior probability of the model M and P(S I M) the probability of observing the data S given M. Equivalently, M satisfies This is equivalent to the MDL estimate, if we take &#8212; log P(M) to be the model description length.
    Interpreting &#8212; log P(M) as the model description length translates, in the Bayesian estimation, to assigning larger prior probabilities on simpler models, since it is equivalent to assuming that P(M) = ( )1(M), where l(M) is the description length of M. (Note that if we assign uniform prior probability P(M) to all models M, then (15) becomes equivalent to (13), giving the maximum-likelihood estimate.)
    Recall, that in our definition of parameter description length, we assign a shorter parameter description length to a model with a smaller number of parameters k, which admits the above interpretation.
    As for the model descrip
