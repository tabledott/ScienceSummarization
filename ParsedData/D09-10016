07) automatically extracts relational triples in open domains using a self-trained extractor; SNE applies relational clustering to generate a semantic network from TextRunner triples (Kok and Domingos, 2008).
    While these systems illustrate the promise of unsupervised methods, the semantic content they extract is nonetheless shallow and does not constitute the complete formal meaning that can be obtained by a semantic parser.
    Another issue is that existing approaches to semantic parsing learn to parse syntax and semantics together.1 The drawback is that the complexity in syntactic processing is coupled with semantic parsing and makes the latter even harder.
    For example, when applying their approach to a different domain with somewhat less rigid syntax, Zettlemoyer and Collins (2007) need to introduce new combinators and new forms of candidate lexical entries.
    Ideally, we should leverage the enormous progress made in syntactic parsing and generate semantic parses directly from syntactic analysis
