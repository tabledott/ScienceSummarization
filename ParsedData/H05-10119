equence; the other is to simply count the num ber of backward jumps.
			Rather than choose between them, we use both features.the one-to-many feature It has often been observed that word alignment links tend to be one-to one.
			Indeed, word alignment results can often beimproved by restricting more general models to per mit only one-to-one links.
			For example, Och andNey (2003) found that the intersection of the alignments found training the IBM models in both direc tions always outperformed either direction alone intheir experiments.
			Since the IBM models allow one to-many links only in one direction, this intersection can contain only one-to-one links.
			To model the tendency for links to be one-to-one, we define a one-to-many feature as the number of links connecting two words such that exactly one of them participates in at least one other link.
			We also define a many-to-many feature as the number of links that connect two words that both participate in other links.
			We don?t use this directly i
