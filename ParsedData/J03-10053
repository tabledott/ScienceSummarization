 most likely translation hypotheses during the search process.
    For this purpose, we present a data-driven beam search algorithm similar to the one used in speech recognition search algorithms (Ney et al. 1992).
    The major difference between the search problem in speech recognition and statistical MT is that MT must take into account the different word order for the source and the target language, which does not enter into speech recognition.
    Tillmann, Vogel, Ney, and Zubiaga (1997) proposes a dynamic programming (DP)&#8211;based search algorithm for statistical MT that monotonically translates the input sentence from left to right.
    The word order difference is dealt with using a suitable preprocessing step.
    Although the resulting search procedure is very fast, the preprocessing is language specific and requires a lot of manual work.
    Currently, most search algorithms for statistical MT proposed in the literature are based on the A* concept (Nilsson 1971).
    Here, the word reordering ca
