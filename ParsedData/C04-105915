nces in Chinese, and each sentence has four human translations as references.
			NIST score (NIST 2002) and Bleu score (Papineni et. al. 2002) of mteval version 9 are reported to evaluate the translation quality.
			4.1 Baseline Translation System.
			Our baseline system (Vogel et al, 2003) gives scores of 7.80 NIST and 0.1952 Bleu for Top-1 hypothesis, which is comparable to the best results reported on this task.
			For the baseline system, we built a translation model using 284K parallel sentence pairs, and a trigram language model from a 160 million words general English news text collection.
			This LM is the background model to be adapted.
			With the baseline system, the n-best hypotheses list and the translation lattice are extracted to build the query models.
			Experiments are carried out on the adapted language model using the three bag-of words query models: 1TQ , TNQ and TMQ , and the corresponding structured query models.
