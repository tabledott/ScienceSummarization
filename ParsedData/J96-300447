Foreign names are usually transliterated using hanzi whose sequential pronunciation mimics the source language pronunciation of the name.
    Since foreign names can be of any length, and since their original pronunciation is effectively unlimited, the identification of such names is tricky.
    Fortunately, there are only a few hundred hanzi that are particularly common in transliterations; indeed, the commonest ones, such as e, bal, er3, and IM al are often clear indicators that a sequence of hanzi containing them is foreign: even a name like A* xia4-mi3-er3 'Shamir,' which is a legal Chinese personal name, retains a foreign flavor because of ffl.
    As a first step towards modeling transliterated names, we have collected all hanzi occurring more than once in the roughly 750 foreign names in our dictionary, and we estimate the probability of occurrence of each hanzi in a transliteration (pTN(hanzi,)) using the maximum likelihood estimate.
    As with personal names, we also derive an estimate from text of
