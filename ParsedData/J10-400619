, but they still represent it in the same way as unstructured models.
    The corpus-derived ternary data are mapped directly onto a two-way matrix, either by dropping one element from the tuple (Pad&#180;o and Lapata 2007) or, more commonly, by concatenating two elements.
    The two words can be concatenated, treating the links as basis elements, in order to model relational similarity (Pantel and Pennacchiotti 2006; Turney 2006b).
    Alternatively, pairs formed by the link and one word are concatenated as basis elements to measure attributional similarity among the other words, treated as target elements (Grefenstette 1994; Lin 1998a; Curran and Moens 2002; Almuhareb and Poesio 2004; Rothenh&#168;ausler and Sch&#168;utze 2009).
    In this way, typed DSMs obtain finer-grained features to compute distributional similarity, but, by couching distributional information as two-way matrices, they lose the high expressive power of corpusderived triples.
    We believe that falling short of fully exploiting the p
