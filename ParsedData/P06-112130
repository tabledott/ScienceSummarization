			Furthermore, our decoder doesn?t incorporate any syntax-based language model, and admittedly our ability to penal ize ill-formed parse trees is still limited.Finally, we evaluated our system on the NIST 02 test set with the three different rule sets (see Table 6).
			The performance with our largest rule set represents a 3.63 BLEU point increase (14.8% relative) compared to using only minimal rules, which indicates positive prospects for using even larger rules.
			While our rule inference algorithm scales to higher thresholds, one important area offuture work will be the improvement of our de coder, conjointly with analyses of the impact in terms
