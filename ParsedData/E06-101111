    Otherwise we exit since there are no single edge switches that can improve the score.
    This algorithm allows for the introduction of non-projective edges because we do not restrict any of the edge changes except to maintain the tree property.
    In fact, if any edge change is ever made, the resulting tree is guaranteed to be nonprojective, otherwise there would have been a higher scoring projective tree that would have already been found by the exact projective parsing algorithm.
    It is not difficult to find examples for which this approximation will terminate without returning the highest-scoring non-projective parse.
    It is clear that this approximation will always terminate &#8212; there are only a finite number of dependency trees for any given sentence and each iteration of the loop requires an increase in score to continue.
    However, the loop could potentially take exponential time, so we will bound the number of edge transformations to a fixed value M. It is easy to argue that this wil
