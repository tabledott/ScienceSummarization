 include argument types.
    We now constrain the protagonist to be of a certain type or role.
    A Typed Narrative Chain is a partially ordered set of event slots that share an argument, but now the shared argument is a role defined by being a member of a set of types R. These types can be lexical units (such as observed head words), noun clusters, or other semantic representations.
    We use head words in the examples below, but we also evaluate with argument clustering by mapping head words to member clusters created with the CBC clustering algorithm (Pantel and Lin, 2002).
    We define a typed narrative chain as a tuple (L, P, O) with L and O the set of event slots and partial ordering as before.
    Let P be a set of argument types (head words) representing a single role.
    An example is given here: As mentioned above, narrative chains are learned by parsing the text, resolving coreference, and extracting chains of events that share participants.
    In our new model, argument types are learned simu
