lso labels the collocations it accepts, thus producing a more functional and usable type of knowledge.
    For example, if the first two stages of Xtract produce the collocation &amp;quot;make-decision,&amp;quot; the third stage identifies it as a verb&#8212;object collocation.
    If no such relation can be observed, then the collocation is rejected.
    The produced collocations are not simple word associations but complex syntactic structures.
    Labeling and filtering are two useful tasks for automatic use of collocations as well as for lexicography.
    The whole of stage 3 (both as a filter and as a labeler) is an original contribution of our work.
    Retrieving syntactically labeled collocations is a relatively new concern.
    Moreover, filtering greatly improves the quality of the results.
    This is also a possible use of the emerging new parsing technology.
    Xtract is actually a library of tools implemented using standard C-Unix libraries.
    The toolkit has several utilities useful for anal
