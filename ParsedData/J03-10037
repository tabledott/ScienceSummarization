et of entities and P = { dog, cat, brown, black+white, large, small } is the set of properties.
    A scene is usually represented as a database (or knowledge base) listing the properties of each element in D. Thus: d1: dog (d1) small (d1) brown (d1) d2: dog (d2) large (d2) brown (d2) d3: dog (d3) large (d3) black+white (d3) d4: cat (d4) small (d4) brown (d4) A simple example scene consisting of some domestic animals.
    In what is probably the key reference on the topic, Dale and Reiter (1995) describe and discuss a number of algorithms for the generation of referring expressions.
    One of these is the full brevity algorithm (originally due to Dale 1992).
    This algorithm first tries to generate a distinguishing description for the target object v using one single property.
    If this fails, it considers all possible combinations of two properties to see if any of these suffices for the generation of a distinguishing description, and so on.
    It is readily seen that this algorithm will output the sho
