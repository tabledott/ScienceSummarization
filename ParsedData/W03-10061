nt structures on top of the Penn Treebank (PTB) (Marcus et al., 1993; Marcus et al., 1994).
    The arc labels chosen for the arguments are specific to the predicate, not universal.
    In this paper, we find that the use of deep linguistic representations to predict these semantic labels are more effective than the generally more surface-syntax representations previously employed (Gildea and Palmer (2002)).
    Specifically, we show that the syntactic dependency structure that results load from the extraction of a Tree Adjoining Grammar (TAG) from the PTB, and the features that accompany this structure, form a better basis for determining semantic role labels.
    Crucially, the same structure is also produced when parsing with TAG.
    We suggest that the syntactic representation chosen in the PTB is less well suited for semantic processing than the other, deeper syntactic representations.
    In fact, this deeper representation expresses syntactic notions that have achieved a wide acceptance across linguis
