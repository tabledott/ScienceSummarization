    However, for a new language, a similar investment of effort in time and money is most likely prohibitive, if not impossible.
    Faced with the costs associated with data acquisition, rationalists may argue that it would be more cost effective to construct systems of handcoded rule lists that capture the linguistic characteristics of the task at hand, rather than spending comparable effort annotating data and expecting the same knowledge to be acquired indirectly by a machine learning system.
    The question we are trying to address then is: for a given cost assumption, which approach would be the most effective.
    Although learning curves showing performance relative to amount of training data are common in the machine learning literature, these are inadequate for comparing systems with different sources of training data or supervision.
    This is especially true when a human rule-based approach and empirical learning are evaluated rela
