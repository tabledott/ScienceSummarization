assume, these word graphs have already been produced.
    For all source positions k with jl &lt; k &lt; jr, we combine the word graphs W (jl, k) and W (k + 1, jr) as described above.
    Finally, we merge all start nodes of these graphs as well as all end nodes.
    Now, we have obtained the word graph W(jl, jr) for the source sequence fjr jl .
    As initialization, we use the word graphs of the monotone IBM4 search.
    In this section, we will extend the ITG constraints described in Sec.
    2.1.
    This extension will go beyond basic reordering constraints.
    We already mentioned that the use of consecutive phrases within the ITG approach is straightforward.
    The only thing we have to change is the initialization of the Q-table.
    Now, we will extend this idea to phrases that are non-consecutive in the source language.
    For this purpose, we adopt the view of the ITG constraints as a bilingual grammar as, e.g., in (Wu, 1997).
    For the baseline ITG constraints, the resulting grammar is: A&#82
