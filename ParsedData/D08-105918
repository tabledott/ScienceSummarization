1 and B = 2, we can see that, while the use of search reduces the parsing speed, it improves the quality of the output parses.
    Therefore, beam-search is a reasonable choice for transitionbased parsing.
    The test accuracies are shown in Table 5, where each row represents a parsing model.
    Rows &#8220;MSTParser 1/2&#8221; show the first-order (using feature templates 1 &#8211; 5 from Table 1) (McDonald et al., 2005) and secondorder (using all feature templates from Table 1) (McDonald and Pereira, 2006) MSTParsers, as reported by the corresponding papers.
    Rows &#8220;Graph [M]&#8221; and &#8220;Graph [MA]&#8221; represent our graph-based parser using features from Table 1 and Table 1 + Table 2, respectively; row &#8220;Transition&#8221; represents our transition-based parser; and rows &#8220;Combined [TM]&#8221; and &#8220;Combined [TMA]&#8221; represent our combined parser using features from Table 3 + Table 1 and Table 3 + Table 1 + Table 2, respectively.
