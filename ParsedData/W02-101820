example, Melamed (2001) uses wordlevel alignments in order to learn translations of noncompositional compounds.
    Och and Ney (1999) learn phrase-to-phrase mappings involving word classes, which they call &#8220;templates&#8221;, and exploit them in a statistical machine translation system.
    And Marcu (2001) extracts phrase translations from automatically aligned corpora and uses them in conjunction with a word-for-word statistical translation system.
    However, none of these approaches learn simultaneously the translation of phrases/templates and the translation of words.
    As a consequence, there is a chance that the learning procedure will not discover phrase-level patterns that occur often in the je vais me arreter la .
