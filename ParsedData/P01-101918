trategy for formalization is closest to that adopted in Unification Categorial Grammar (Zeevat et al, 1987), but rather than composing actual logical forms we compose partial descriptions to handle semantic underspecification.
  
  
    We have developed a framework for formally specifying semantics within constraint-based representations which allows semantic operations in a grammar to be tightly specified and which allows a representation of semantic content which is largely independent of the feature structure architecture of the syntactic representation.
    HPSGs can be written which encode much of the algebra described here as constraints on types in the grammar, thus ensuring that the grammar is consistent with the rules on composition.
    There are some aspects which cannot be encoded within currently implemented TFS formalisms because they involve negative conditions: for instance, we could not write TFS constraints that absolutely prevent a grammar writer sneaking in a disallowed coindexation by sp
