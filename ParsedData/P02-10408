treated similarly and multiple human translators with different styles are used, so this effect cancels out in comparisons between systems.
    2.1.2 Ranking systems using only modified n-gram precision To verify that modified n-gram precision distinguishes between very good translations and bad translations, we computed the modified precision numbers on the output of a (good) human translator and a standard (poor) machine translation system using 4 reference translations for each of 127 source sentences.
    The average precision results are shown in Figure 1.
    The strong signal differentiating human (high precision) from machine (low precision) is striking.
    The difference becomes stronger as we go from unigram precision to 4-gram precision.
    It appears that any single n-gram precision score can distinguish between a good translation and a bad translation.
    To be useful, however, the metric must also reliably distinguish between translations that do not differ so greatly in quality.
