 methodology that takes into account the full spectrum of compositionality from phrases to sentences; and the empirical finding that relatively simple compositional models can be used to perform competitively on the paraphrase detection and phrase similarity tasks.
  
  
    The elementary objects that we operate on are vectors associated with words.
    We instantiate these word representations following three distinct semantic space models which we describe in Section 2.1 below.
    Analogously, in Section 2.2 we consider three methods of vector composition, i.e., how a phrase or a sentence can be represented as a vector using the vectors of its constituent words.
    Combining different vector representations and composition methods gives rise to several compositional models whose performance we evaluate in Sections 3 and 4.
    For all of our experiments we employ column vectors from a Cartesian, finitely-dimensional space.
    The dimensionality will depend on the source of the vectors involved.
