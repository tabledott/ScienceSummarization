e.
    Thus, variation in segment size has an effect on Pk, as predicted.
    Note that for false negatives, the Pk value for the (20, 30) range is not much different than for the (15, 35) range.
    This is expected since there are no segments of size less than k (12.5) in these conditions.
    For the (10, 40) range, the Pk value is slightly smaller; and for the (5, 45) range, it is smaller still.
    These results are to be expected, since more segments in these ranges will be of length less than k. For the FP segmentations, on the other hand, the decrease in Pk value is more pronounced, falling from 0.128 to 0.107 as the segment size range changes from (20, 30) to (5, 45).
    This is also consistent with our earlier analysis of the behavior of the metric on false positives as segment size decreases.
    Notice that the difference in Pk values between (15, 35) and (10, 40) is slightly larger than the other two differences.
    This happens because for segment sizes &lt; k, the false positive penalty disap
