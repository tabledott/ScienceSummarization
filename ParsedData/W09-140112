ases are annotated, as in Figure 3(e).
  
  
    For the evaluation, the participants were given the test data with gold annotation only for proteins.
    The evaluation was then carried out by comparing the annotation predicted by each participant to the gold annotation.
    For the comparison, equality of annotations is defined as described in Section 4.1.
    The evaluation results are reported using the standard recall/precision/f-score metrics, under different criteria defined through the equalities.
    Equality of events is defined as follows: Event Equality equality holds between any two events when (1) the event types are the same, (2) the event triggers are the same, and (3) the arguments are fully matched.
    A full matching of arguments between two events means there is a perfect 1-to-1 mapping between the two sets of arguments.
    Equality of individual arguments is defined as follows: Argument Equality equality holds between any two arguments when (1) the role types are the same, and (2-1) bot
