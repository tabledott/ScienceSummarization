t suffers from the lack of realdependency labels in the converted treebank.
			Indi rect support for this assumption can be gained fromprevious experiments with Swedish data, where al most the same accuracy (85% unlabeled attachment score) has been achieved with a treebank whichis much smaller but which contains proper depen dency annotation (Nivre et al, 2004).
			A third important factor is the relatively low rootaccuracy of our parser, which may reflect a weak ness in the one-pass parsing strategy with respect tothe global structure of complex sentences.
			It is note worthy that our parser has lower root accuracy than dependency accuracy, whereas the inverse holds for all the other parsers.
			The problem becomes even more visible when we consider the dependency and root accuracy for sentences of different lengths, as shown in Table 3.
			Here we see that for really short sentences (up to 10 words) root accuracy is indeedhigher than dependency accuracy, but while depen dency accuracy degrades gracefully w
