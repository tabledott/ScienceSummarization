d incorrectly were in (21.4%), to (20.8%) and of (16.6%).
			The top ten prepositions accounted for 93.8% of all preposition errors in our learner corpus.Next, we ranked the common preposition ?con fusions?, the common mistakes made for each preposition.
			The top ten most common confusions are listed in Table 5, where null refers to cases where no preposition is licensed (the writer usedan extraneous preposition).
			The most common of fenses were actually extraneous errors (see Table5): using to and of when no preposition was li censed accounted for 16.8% of all errors.
			It is interesting to note that the most common usage errors by learners overwhelmingly involved the ten most frequently occurring prepositions in native text.
			This suggests that our effort to handle the 34 most frequently occurring prepositions maybe overextended and that a system that is specifically trained and refined on the top ten preposi tions may provide better diagnostic feedback to a learner.
