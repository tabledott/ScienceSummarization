grams that were attested both in the BNC and the NANTC corpus.
    In this way, we obtained NANTC frequency counts for the bigrams that we had randomly selected from the BNC.
    Table 4 shows the NANTC counts for the set of seen bigrams from Table 2.
    Because of the differences in the extraction methodology (chunking versus full parsing) and the text genre (balanced corpus versus news text), we expected that some BNC bigrams would not be attested in the NANTC corpus.
    More precisely, zero frequencies were returned for 23 adjective-noun, 16 verb-noun, and 37 noun-noun bigrams.
    The fact that more zero frequencies were observed for noun-noun bigrams than for the other two types is perhaps not surprising considering the ease with which novel compounds are created (Levi 1978).
    We adjusted the zero counts by setting them to .5.
    This was necessary because all further analyses were carried out on logtransformed frequencies (see Table 4).
    Web counts for bigrams were obtained using a simple heuri
