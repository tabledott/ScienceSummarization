setting are due to Luo et al. (2004) who report a 81.3 Fl (much higher than others).
    However, it is not clear this is a comparable number, due to the apparent use of gold NER features, which provide a strong clue to coreference.
    Regardless, it is unsurprising that their system, which has many rich features, would outperform ours. closest comparable unsupervised system is Cardie and Wagstaff (1999) who use pairwise NP distances to cluster document mentions.
    They report a 53.6 F1 on MUC6 when tuning distance metric weights to maximize F1 on the development set.
    We also performed experiments on ACE 2004 data.
    Due to licensing restrictions, we did not have access to the ACE 2004 formal development and test sets, and so the results presented are on the training sets.
    We report results on the newswire section (NWIRE in table 2b) and the broadcast news section (BNEWS in table 2b).
    These datasets include the prenominal mention type, which is not present in the MUC6 data.
    We treated pre
