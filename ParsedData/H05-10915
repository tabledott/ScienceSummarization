gument (or head-modifier) constructions such as ?troops ? raided?, or ?pump ing ? stations?
			in Figure 1.?
			[Non-local Dependencies] Long-distance dependencies arise due to various linguistic con structions such as coordination, extraction,raising and control.
			In Figure 1, among non local dependencies are ?troops ? warning?, or ?ministers ? preaching?.
			A Context Free Grammar (CFG) parser can be used to extract local dependencies, which for each sentence form a dependency tree.
			Mildly contextsensitive formalisms such as Combinatory Categorial Grammar (CCG) (Steedman, 2000) model word word dependencies more directly and can be used to extract both local and long-distance dependencies, giving rise to a directed acyclic graph, as illustrated in Figure 1.
	
	
			If e1 and e2 are two entities mentioned in the samesentence such that they are observed to be in a relationship R, our hypothesis stipulates that the contribution of the sentence dependency graph to establishing the relationship R(e1, e2) is a
