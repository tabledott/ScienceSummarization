ect CCGbank parser would achieve an F-score of only 77.86% when evaluated against DepBank.
    On inspecting the output, it was clear that a number of general rules could be applied to bring the schemes closer together, which we implemented as a Python postprocessing script.
    We now provide a description of some of the major changes, to give an indication of the kinds of rules we implemented.
    We tried to keep the changes as general as possible and not specific to the test set, although some rules, such as the handling of monetary amounts, are genre-specific.
    We decided to include these rules because they are trivial to implement and significantly affect the score, and we felt that, without these changes, the CCG parser would be unfairly penalized.
    The first set of changes deals with coordination.
    One significant difference between DepBank and CCGbank is the treatment of coordinations as arguments.
