ble to reuse any of the existing largescale linearizers because of significant structural differences between input expected by these linearizers and the format of a fusion lattice.
    We are currently working on adapting Fergus for the sentence fusion task.
    Mistakes related to suboptimal scoring were the most common (33 out of 42); in these cases, a language model selected ill-formed sentences, assigning a worse score to a better sentence.
    The sentence The diplomats were given to leave the country in 10 days illustrates a suboptimal linearization of the fusion lattice.
    The correct linearizations&#8212;The diplomats were given 10 days to leave the country and The diplomats were ordered to leave the country in 10 days&#8212;were present in the fusion lattice, but the language model picked the incorrect verbalization.
    We found that in 27 cases the optimal verbalizations (in the authors&#8217; view) were ranked below the top-10 sentences ranked by the language model.
    We believe that more pow
