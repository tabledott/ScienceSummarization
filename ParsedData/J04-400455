    Curiously, however, Collins&#8217; implementation considers the head label of the NP chart item not to be NPB, but rather the head label of the NPB chart item.
    In other words, to get the head label of an NP chart item, one must &#8220;peek through&#8221; the NPB and get at the NPB&#8217;s head label.
    Presumably, this was done as a consideration for the NPB nodes&#8217; being &#8220;extra&#8221; nodes, in some sense.
    It appears to have little effect on overall parsing accuracy, however.
    Ideally, every parse theory could be kept in the chart, and when the root symbol has been generated for all theories, the top-ranked one would &#8220;win.&#8221; In order to speed things up, Collins employs three different types of pruning.
    The first form of pruning is to use a beam: The chart memoizes the highest-scoring theory in each span, and if a proposed chart item for that span is not within a certain factor of the top-scoring item, it is not added to the chart.
