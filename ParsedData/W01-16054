 the RST framework, the discourse structure of a text can be represented as a tree defined in terms of four aspects: supporting or background unit of information.
    Below, we describe the protocol that we used to build consistent RST annotations.
    The first step in characterizing the discourse structure of a text in our protocol is to determine the elementary discourse units (EDUs), which are the minimal building blocks of a discourse tree.
    Mann and Thompson (1988, p. 244) state that &#8220;RST provides a general way to describe the relations among clauses in a text, whether or not they are grammatically or lexically signalled.&#8221; Yet, applying this intuitive notion to the task of producing a large, consistently annotated corpus is extremely difficult, because the boundary between discourse and syntax can be very blurry.
    The examples below, which range from two distinct sentences to a single clause, all convey essentially the same meaning, packaged in different ways: In Example 1, there is a
