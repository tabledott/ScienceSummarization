se the behavior of the system is identical to the simpler system 5p.
    This is important, because it means that the best-case complexity of the deterministic parser is still O(n) and that the we can expect to observe the best case for all sentences with projective dependency trees.
    The exact number of additional transitions needed to reach a terminal configuration is determined by the number of SWAP transitions.
    Since SWAP moves one node from E to B, there will be one additional SHIFT for every SWAP, which means that the total number of transitions is 2n + 2k, where k is the number of SWAP transitions.
    Given the condition that SWAP can only apply in a configuration c = ([a|i, j], B, A) if 0 &lt; i &lt; j, the number of SWAP transitions is bounded by n(n&#65533;1) 2 , which means that 2n + n(n &#8722; 1) = n + n2 is an upper bound on the number of transitions in a terminating sequence.
    Hence, the worst-case complexity of the deterministic parser is O(n2).
