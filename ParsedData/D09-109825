    Figure 3 illustrates the precision vs. recall tradeoff on our best performing corpus Web100 for 30 random seed sets of size 10 for each of our 50 gold standard sets (i.e., 1500 trials were tested.)
    Each of the trials performed better than the average system performance (the double-lined curve lowest in Figure 3).
    Distinguishing between the various data series is not important, however important to notice is the very large gap between the precision/recall curves of the best and worst performing random seed sets.
    On average, the best performing seed sets had 42% higher precision and 39% higher recall than the worst performing seed set.
    Similar curves were observed for inspected seed sets of size 5, 20, 30, and 40.
    Although outside of the scope of this paper, we are currently investigating ways to automatically detect which seed elements are better than others in order to reduce the impact of seed selection effect.
    Here we aim to confirm, with a large empirical study, the anecdot
