gorithm given in Section 3.2.3 correspond closely to the intentional structure produced from the structural analysis method of Grosz and Sidner (1986).
    This is important, since Grosz and Sidner give no method for computing the intentions or linguistic segments that make up the structure that they propose.
    Hence the concept of lexical cohesion, defined originally by Halliday and Hasan (1976) and expanded in this work, has a definite use in an automated text understanding system.
    Lexical chains are shown to be almost entirely computable with the relations defined in Section 3.2.2.
    The computer implementation of this type of thesaurus access would be a straightforward task involving traditional database techniques.
    The program to implement the algorithm given in Section 3.2.3 would also be straightforward.
    However, automated testing could help fine-tune the parameters, and would help to indicate any unfortunate chain linkages.
    Although straightforward from an engineering point of view
