 when we need to translate news data but only have UN data available for training.
    The solution we propose is to get comparable news data, automatically extract parallel sentences from it, and use these sentences as additional training data; we will show that doing this improves translation performance on a news test set.
    The Arabic-English and Chinese-English resources described in the previous paragraph enable us to simulate our conditions of interest and perform detailed measurements of the impact of our proposed solution.
    We can train baseline systems on UN parallel data (using the data from the first bullet in the previous paragraph), extract additional news data from the large comparable corpora (the fourth bullet), accurately measure translation performance on news data against four reference translations (the third bullet), and compare the impact of the automatically extracted news data with that of similar amounts of human-translated news data (the second bullet).
