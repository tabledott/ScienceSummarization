s H (shows entailment) 2.
			T+H are inconsistent (shows no entailment)Assume that the function DRS denotes the DRS cor responding to T or H, and FOL the function that translates a DRS into first-order logic.
			Then, if the theorem prover manages to find a proof for FOL(DRS(T))?FOL(DRS(H)) (A) we know that we are dealing with a true entailment.In addition, to use a theorem prover to detect incon sistencies in a T/H pair, we give it: ?FOL(DRS(T);DRS(H)) (B) If the theorem prover returns a proof for (B), we know that T and H are inconsistent and T definitelydoesn?t entail H (assuming that T and H are them selves consistent).Examples The theorem prover will find that T im plies H for the following examples: Example: 1005 (TRUE) T: Jessica Litman, a law professor at Michigan?s Wayne State University, has specialized in copyright law and Internet law for more than 20 years.
			H: Jessica Litman is a law professor.
			Example: 1977 (TRUE) T: His family has steadfastly denied the charges.
			H: The charges were den
