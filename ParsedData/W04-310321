y considering (Hyland, 1998) and (Harris et al., 1989).
    Future work concerning automatic annotation includes expanding the substring system with more substrings and perhaps more complicated regular expressions, expanding the feature set of the SVM, trying out other classification methods such as decision trees.
    Finally, we plan on building some of the applications mentioned: a speculation search engine, transcription factor interaction tables with a speculation/definite column, and knowledge discovery test sets.
