strated in Figure 1.
    Even though a sequence (Figure 1 (a)), P(t = B) is only greater than 0.5 for a small range of B around B (Figure 1 (b)), meaning that the choice oft = 1 is not very robust to variation in B.
    In contrast, a sequence with nH = 8 favors t = 1 for a wide range of B around B.
    By integrating over B, Equation 3 takes into account the consequences of possible variation in B.
    Another advantage of integrating over B is that it permits the use of linguistically appropriate priors.
    In many linguistic models, including HMMs, the distributions over variables are multinomial.
    For a multinomial with parameters B = ... , BK), a natural choice of prior is the K-dimensional Dirichlet distribution, which is conjugate to the For simplicity, we initially assume that all K parameters (also known as hyperparameters) of the Dirichlet distribution are equal to Q, i.e. the Diri chlet is symmetric.
    The value of Q determines which parameters B will have high probability: when Q = 1, all pa
