results for the bilingual group.
    The correlation coefficient is 0.96.
    We now take the worst system as a reference point and compare the BLEU scores with the human judgment scores of the remaining systems relative to the worst system.
    We took the BLEU, monolingual group, and bilingual group scores for the 5 systems and linearly normalized them by their corresponding range (the maximum and minimum score across the 5 systems).
    The normalized scores are shown in Figure 7.
    This figure illustrates the high correlation between the BLEU score and the monolingual group.
    Of particular interest is the accuracy of BLEU&#8217;s estimate of the small difference between S2 and S3 and the larger difference between S3 and H1.
    The figure also highlights the relatively large gap between MT systems and human translators.8 In addition, we surmise that the bilingual group was very forgiving in judging H1 relative to H2 because the monolingual group found a rather large difference in the fluency of their
