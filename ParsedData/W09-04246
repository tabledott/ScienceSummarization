equired can be a major hindrance to researchers, especially those investigating the effects of tokenization or word segmentation.
    To alleviate these issues, we extract only a subset of all available rules.
    Specifically, we follow Callison-Burch et al. (2005; Lopez (2007) and use a source language suffix array to extract only those rules which will actually be used in translating a particular set of test sentences.
    This results in a vastly smaller rule set than techniques which extract all rules from the training set.
    The current code requires suffix array rule extraction to be run as a pre-processing step to extract the rules needed to translate a particular test set.
    However, we are currently extending the decoder to directly access the suffix array.
    This will allow the decoder at runtime to efficiently extract exactly those rules needed to translate a particular sentence, without the need for a rule extraction pre-processing step.
    Grammar formalism: Our decoder assumes a probabil
