 the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm was used to estimate the likelihood of the observed role&#8217;s being produced by each of the distributions in the general techniques of Jelinek and Mercer (1980).
    Because a number of the distributions used may have no training data for a given set of variables, the data were divided according to the set of distributions available, and a separate set of interpolation weights was trained for each set of distributions.
    This technique (line 2 of Table 5) did not outperform equal weights even on the data used to determine the weights.
    Although the EM algorithm is guaranteed to increase the likelihood of the training data, that likelihood does not always correspond to our scoring, which is based only on whether the correct outcome is assigned the highest probability.
    Results of the EM interpolation on held-out test data are shown in Table 6.
    Experimentation has shown that the weights used have relatively little impact in our interpolation scheme, no
