pplied LSA to the analysis of MWEs in the task of MWE discovery, by way of rescoring MWEs extracted from a corpus.
    The major point of divergence from this research is that Schone and Jurafsky focused specifically on MWE extraction, whereas we are interested in the downstream task of semantically classifying attested MWEs.
  
  
    In this section, we outline the resources used in evaluation, give an informal introduction to the LSA model, sketch how we extracted the MWEs from corpus data, and describe a number of methods for modelling decomposability within a hierarchical lexicon.
    The particular reference lexicon we use to evaluate our technique is WordNet 1.7 (Miller et al., 1990), due to its public availability, hierarchical structure and wide coverage.
    Indeed, Schone and Jurafsky (2001) provide evidence that suggests that WordNet is as effective an evaluation resource as the web for MWE detection methods, despite its inherent size limitations and static nature.
    Two MWE types that are parti
