in Figure 1 is 0.0336.
    The probability of parse b) or c) must be identical though (0.09), because the same rule is applied twice in each case.
    Similarly, the probability of d) and e) is also identical (0.09) for essentially the same reason.
    However, these rules are natural treatments of noun compounding and prepositional phrase (PP) attachment in English, and the different derivations correlate with different interpretations.
    For example, b) would be an appropriate analysis for toy coffee grinder, while c) would be appropriate for cat food tin, and each of d) and e) yields one of the two possible interpretations of the man in the park with the telescope.
    We want to keep these structural configurations probabilistically distinct in case there are structurally conditioned differences in their frequency of occurrence; as would be predicted, for example, by the theory of parsing strategies (e.g.
    Frazier 1988).
    Fujisaki et al. (1989) propose a rather inelegant solution for the noun comp
