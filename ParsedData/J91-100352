etals (this is a sister relationship).
    The remaining cell matches, distinctive source and distinctive target, account for cells that fail the previous five kinds of cell match.
    For more detail on cell matches, see Fass (1988a).
    A kind of lexical relevance is found dynamically from the sentence context.
    This notion of relevance is used in finding the relevant analogies that distinguish metaphorical from anomalous relations; it is also used when finding CO-AGENT FOR ACTIVITY metonymies.
    Relevance divides the set of cells from the source sense-frame into two subsets.
    One cell is selected as relevant given the context; the remaining cells are termed nonrelevant.
    Collation matches both the source's relevant and nonrelevant cells against the cells from the target sense-frame.
    A relevant analogy is indicated by a sister match of the source's relevant cell (see diamond 3 in Figure 4).
    Five types of metonymic concepts are currently distinguished.
