urse interpretation.
  In the computational literature, there are two foci for research on the interpretation of anaphoric elements such as pronouns.
  The first viewpoint focuses on an inferential process driven by the underlying semantics and relations in the domain (Hobbs 1985a; Hobbs et al.
  1987; Hobbs and Martin 1987).
  A polar focus is to concentrate on the role of syntactic information such as what was previously the topic or subject (Hobbs 1976b; Kameyama 1985; Yoshimoto 1988).
  We will argue for an intermediate position with respect o the interpretation of ZEROS, unexpressed arguments of the verb, in Japanese.
  Our position is that the interpretation f zeros is an inferential process, but that syntactic information provides constraints on this inferential process (Joshi and Kuhn 1979; Joshi and Weinstein 1981).
  We will argue that syntactic ues and semantic interpretation are mutually constraining (Prince 1981b, 1985; Hudson-DZmura 1988).
