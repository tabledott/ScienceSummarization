z1, since v and z are unambiguous.
    Now consider the partial spans beginning at v, and ending (respectively) at each of the four remaining words.
    The partial span network ending at w contains exactly three paths.
    One of these must be a portion of the optimal path for the entire span.
    So we save all three: one path to each tag under w. The probability of each path is the value found in the collocation matrix entry for its tag-pair, namely p(v,wi) for i ranging from one to three.
    Next, consider the three tags under word x.
    One of these tags must lie on the optimal path.
    Assume it is xl.
    Under this assumption, we have a complete span of length 3, for x is unambiguous.
    Only one of the paths to xi can be optimal.
    Therefore we can disambiguate v. .
    . w. .
    . xi under this assumption, namely, as MAX (p(v,wir p(wi,x I)) for all wi.
    Now, of course, the assumption that x1 is on the optimal path is unacceptable.
    However, the key to VOLSUNGA is to notice that by makin
