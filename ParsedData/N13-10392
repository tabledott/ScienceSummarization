    Even web text parsing, which is a comparatively easier genre than social media, lags behind newspaper text (Petrov and McDonald, 2012), as does speech transcript parsing (McClosky et al., 2010).
    To tackle the challenge of novel words and constructions, we create a new Twitter part-of-speech tagger&#8212;building on previous work by Gimpel et al. (2011)&#8212;that includes new large-scale distributional features.
    This leads to state-of-the-art results in POS tagging for both Twitter and Internet Relay Chat (IRC) text.
    We also annotated a new dataset of tweets with POS tags, improved the annotations in the previous dataset from Gimpel et al., and developed annotation guidelines for manual POS tagging of tweets.
    We release all of these resources to the research community:
  
  
    Our tagging model is a first-order maximum entropy Markov model (MEMM), a discriminative sequence model for which training and decoding are extremely efficient (Ratnaparkhi, 1996; McCallum et al., 2000).2 T
