tarred entries are incorrect. core names it is 0.89.
    Thus on average, the correct answer, if it is included in our candidate list, is ranked mostly as the first one.
    We proposed three similarity measures for the frequency correlation method, i.e., the Cosine, Pearson coefficient, and Jensen-Shannon divergence.
    In Table 2, we show their MRRs.
    Given that the only resource the method needs is comparable text documents over a sufficiently long period, these results are quite encouraging.
    For example, with Pearson correlation, when the Chinese transliteration of an English name is included in our candidate list, the correct answer is, on average, ranked at the 3rd place or better.
    The results thus show that the idea of exploiting frequency correlation does work.
    We also see that among the three similarity measures, Pearson correlation performs the best; it performs better than Cosine, which is better than JS-divergence.
    Compared with the phonetic correspondence method, the performan
