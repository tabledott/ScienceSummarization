    The inspection of &#8220;take&#8221; anecdotally confirms that different selectional preferences are learned for different senses.
    This point (which comes down to the usability of selectional preferences for WSD) should be verified in an empirical evaluation, possibly in another pseudodisambiguation task, choosing as confounders seen headwords for other senses of a predicate word.
  
  
    We have introduced the similarity-based model for inducing selectional preferences.
    Computing selectional preference as a weighted sum of similarities to seen headwords, it is a straightforward implementation of the idea of generalization from seen headwords to other, similar words.
    The similarity-based model is particularly simple and easy to compute, and seems not very sensitive to parameters.
    Like the EM-based clustering model, it is not dependent on lexical resources.
    It is, however, more flexible in that it induces similarities from a separate generalization corpus, which allows us to control t
