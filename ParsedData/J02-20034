bility of (the food sense of) chicken appearing as an object of the verb eat can be approximated in some way by a probability based on a class such as FOOD.
    There are two elements involved in the problem of using a class to estimate the probability of a noun sense.
    First, given a suitably chosen class, how can that class be used to estimate the probability of the sense?
    And second, given a particular noun sense, how can a suitable class be determined?
    This article offers novel solutions to both problems, and there is a particular focus on the second question, which can be thought of as how to find a suitable level of generalization in the hierarchy.1 The semantic hierarchy used here is the noun hierarchy of WordNet (Fellbaum 1998), version 1.6.
    Previous work has considered how to estimate probabilities using classes from WordNet in the context of acquiring selectional preferences (Resnik 1998; Ribas 1995; Li and Abe 1998; McCarthy 2000), and this previous work has also addressed the questi
