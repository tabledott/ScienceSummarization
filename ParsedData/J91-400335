    This view suggests that, in such cases, the verb itself is not polysemous.
    Rather, the sense of &amp;quot;create&amp;quot; is part of the meaning of cake by virtue of it being an artifact.
    The verb appears polysemous because certain complements add to the basic meaning by virtue of what they denote.
    We return to this topic below, There are several interesting things about such collocations.
    First, because the complement &amp;quot;selects&amp;quot; the verb that governs it (by virtue of knowledge of what is done to the object), the semantics of the phrase is changed.
    The semantic &amp;quot;connectedness,&amp;quot; as it were, is tighter when cospecification obtains.
    In such cases, the verb is able to successfully drop the dative PP argument, as shown below in (1).
    When the complement does not select the verb governing it, dative-drop is ungrammatical as seen in (2) (although there are predicates selected by these nouns; e.g. keep a secret, read a book, and play a
