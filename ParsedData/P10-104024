or is such that the embeddings have a standard deviation of 0.1.
    There are capacity controls for the word representations: number of Brown clusters, and number of dimensions of the word embeddings.
    Figure 2 shows the effect on the validation F1 as we vary the capacity of the word representations.
    In general, it appears that more Brown clusters are better.
    We would like to induce 10000 Brown clusters, however this would take several months.
    In Turian et al. (2009), we hypothesized on the basis of solely the HLBL NER curve that higher-dimensional word embeddings would give higher accuracy.
    Figure 2 shows that this hypothesis is not true.
    For NER, the C&amp;W curve is almost flat, and we were suprised to find the even 25-dimensional C&amp;W word embeddings work so well.
    For chunking, 50-dimensional embeddings had the highest validation F1 for both C&amp;W and HLBL.
    These curves indicates that the optimal capacity of the word embeddings is task-specific. gazetteers to the basel
