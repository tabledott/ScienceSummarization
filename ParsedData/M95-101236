  Note that what counts as a most immediate contex- tualized fact is itself determined by a separate search procedure .
  The simple-minded strategy we adopted here is to proceed backwards from the current sentence, searching for the most recent sentence containing a n occurrence of ajob-out phrase, and returning the semantic individual it denotes .
  In this example, the job-out- in-contexa predicate succeeds by binding the succ variable to j-o-23, with the rule overall yielding a job-in fact .
  job-in((pers-24, ttl-21, org-22) j-i-26 ) As with job-out, this fact is mapped directly by the template generator to an incoming succession template.
  Note that this process of combining a job-out and successor fact effectively achieves what is ofte n accomplished in data extraction systems by template merging .
  However, since the merging takes place in th e inferential database, with propagation of relevant facts as a side-effect, the process is greatly simplified an d obviates the need for explicit template co
