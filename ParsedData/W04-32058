shallow hierarchy of classes (such as those described in Section 2.2).
    WordNet identifies synonymy, antonymy, troponymy, and cause.
    As summarized in Figure 1, Fellbaum (1998) discusses a finer-grained analysis of entailment, while the WordNet database does not distinguish between, e.g., backward presupposition (forget :: know, where know must have happened before forget) from proper temporal inclusion (walk :: step).
    In formulating our set of relations, we have relied on the finer-grained analysis, explicitly breaking out the temporal precedence between entities.
    In selecting the relations to identify, we aimed at both covering the relations described in WordNet and covering the relations present in our collection of strongly associated verb pairs.
    We relied on the strongly associated verb pairs, described in Section 4.4, for computational efficiency.
    The relations we identify were experimentally found to cover 99 out of 100 randomly selected verb pairs.
    Our algorithm identifies si
