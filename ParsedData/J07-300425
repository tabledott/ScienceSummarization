ent in a purely applicative derivation), for example, (S[ng]\NP1)/NP2, or ((S[b]\NP1)/(S[to]\NP)2)/NP3.
    In lexical functor categories such as that of the auxiliary, (S[dcl]\NP)/(S[b]\NP), the lexical head of all result categories (S[dcl]\NP and S[dcl]) is identical to the lexical head of the entire category (i.e., is).
    But in functor categories that represent modifiers, such as the adverb (S\NP)/(S\NP), the head of the result (the modified verb phrase) comes from the argument (the unmodified verb phrase).
    We use indices on the categories to represent this information: (S\NP)i/(S\NP)i.
    In CCGbank, modifier categories are easily identified by the fact that they are of the form X|X or (X|X) |... (with  |either / or \), where X does not have any of the features described previously, such as [dcl], [b].
    Similarly, determiners (the) take a noun (N, buck) as argument to form a (non-bare) noun phrase whose lexical head comes from the noun: NP[nb]i/Ni.
    Thus, the lexical head of the noun phrase
