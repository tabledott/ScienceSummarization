ands, and one bigram was chosen at random from each band.
    The procedure described by Lapata, Keller, and McDonald (2001) was followed for creating sets of unseen noun-noun and verb-object bigrams: for each noun or verb, we compiled a list of all nouns with which it did not co-occur within a noun-noun or verbobject bigram in the BNC.
    Again, Lauer&#8217;s (1995) heuristic and Abney&#8217;s (1996) partial parser were used to identify bigrams, and proper nouns and low-frequency nouns were excluded.
    For each noun and verb, three bigrams were formed by pairing it with a noun randomly selected from the set of the non-co-occurring nouns for that noun or verb.
    Table 2 lists examples for the seen and unseen noun-noun and verb-object bigrams generated by this procedure.
    The extracted bigrams are in several respects an imperfect source of information about adjective-noun or noun-noun modification and verb-object relations.
