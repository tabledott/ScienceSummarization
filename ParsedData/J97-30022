    We discuss a number of examples of how stochastic inversion transduction grammars bring bilingual constraints to bear upon problematic corpus analysis tasks such as segmentation, bracketing, phrasal alignment, and parsing.
  
  
    We introduce a general formalism for modeling of bilingual sentence pairs, known as an inversion transduction grammar, with potential application in a variety of corpus analysis areas.
    Transduction grammar models, especially of the finite-state family, have long been known.
    However, the imposition of identical ordering constraints upon both streams severely restricts their applicability, and thus transduction grammars have received relatively little attention in language-modeling research.
    The inversion transduction grammar formalism skips directly to a context-free, rather than finite-state, base and permits one extra degree of ordering flexibility, while retaining properties necessary for efficient computation, thereby sidestepping the limitations of traditi
