    The third B, however, follows too far after the second B to continue the chain.

    Boundaries are determined as specified in Section 5.
    This variation of the TextTiling algorithm is explored and evaluated in Hearst (1994b).
    As mentioned in Section 2, Salton and Allan (1993) report work in the automatic detection of hypertext links and theme generation from large documents, focusing primarily on encyclopedia text.
