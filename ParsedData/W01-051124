or case 4) and the dashed lines represent the corresponding lexical accuracies.
    The accuracies are smaller than the previous case of Table 4 because the training set is much smaller, but the point of interest is the difference in the performance of MeSH vs. lexical in this more difficult setting.
    Note that lexical for case 4 reduces to random guessing.
    Testing set performances for different partitions on the test set for the MeSH&#8722;based model Levels of the MeSH Hierarchy (1994) who reports an accuracy of 52% with 13 classes and Lapata (2000) whose algorithm achieves about 80% accuracy for a much simpler binary classification.
    We have shown that a class-based representation performes as well as a lexical-based model despite the reduction of raw information content and despite a somewhat errorful mapping from terms to concepts.
    We have also shown that representing the nouns of the compound by a very general representation (Model 2) achieves a reasonable performance of aout 52% accuracy
