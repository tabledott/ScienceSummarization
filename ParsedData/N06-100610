ssification has also been proposed by Marsi and Krahmer (2005), whose textual system is developed and evaluated on parallel translations into Dutch.
    Their classification phase features an output space of five semantic relations, and performs well at distinguishing entailing sentence pairs.
    Finding aligned content can be done by any search procedure.
    Compared to previous work, we emphasize structural alignment, and seek to ignore issues like polarity and quantity, which can be left to a subsequent entailment decision.
    For example, the scoring function is designed to encourage antonym matches, and ignore the negation of verb predicates.
    The ideas clearly generalize to evaluating several alignments, but we have so far worked with just the one-best alignment.
    Given a good alignment, the determination of entailment reduces to a simple classification decision.
    The classifier is built over features designed to recognize patterns of valid and invalid inference.
