nally similar.
    In the semantic domain, the hypothesis that words which mean similar things behave in similar ways (Levin, 1993), has led researchers (e.g.
    Lin (1998)) to propose that distributional similarity might be used as a predictor of semantic similarity.
    Accordingly, we might automatically build thesauruses which could be used in tasks such as malapropism correction (Budanitsky and Hirst, 2001) and text summarization (Silber and McCoy, 2002).
    However, the loose definition of distributional similarity that two words are distributionally similar if they appear in similar contexts has led to many distributional similarity measures being proposed; for example, the L1 Norm, the Euclidean Distance, the Cosine Metric (Salton and McGill, 1983), Jaccard's Coefficient (Frakes and Baeza-Yates, 1992), the Dice Coefficient (Frakes and Baeza-Yates, 1992), the KullbackLeibler Divergence (Cover and Thomas, 1991), the Jenson-Shannon Divergence (Rao, 1983), the a-skew Divergence (Lee, 1999), the Confusio
