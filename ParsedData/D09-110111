    Discourse-new detection.
    Discourse-new detection is often tackled independently of coreference resolution.
    Pleonastic its have been detected using heuristics (e.g., Kennedy and Boguraev (1996)) and learning-based techniques such as rule learning (e.g., M&#168;uller (2006)), kernels (e.g., Versley et al. (2008)), and distributional methods (e.g., Bergsma et al.
    (2008)).
    Non-anaphoric definite descriptions have been detected using heuristics (e.g., Vieira and Poesio (2000)) and unsupervised methods (e.g., Bean and Riloff (1999)).
    General discourse-new detectors that are applicable to different types of NPs have been built using heuristics (e.g., Byron and Gegg-Harrison (2004)) and modeled generatively (e.g., Elsner and Charniak (2007)) and discriminatively (e.g., Uryupina (2003)).
    There have also been attempts to perform joint inference for discourse-new detection and coreference resolution using integer linear programm
