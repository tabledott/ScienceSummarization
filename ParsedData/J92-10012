plication of the approach in a system that computes sense tags for arbitrary texts, even when it is unable to determine a single syntactic or semantic representation for some sentences.
  
  
    Many problems in applied natural language processing &#8212; including information retrieval, database generation from text, and machine translation &#8212; hinge on relating words to other words that are similar in meaning.
    Current approaches to these applications are often word-based &#8212; that is, they treat words in the input as strings, mapping them directly to other words.
    However, the fact that many words have multiple senses and different words often have similar meanings limits the accuracy of such systems.
    An alternative is to use a knowledge representation, or interlingua, to reflect text content, thereby separating text representation from the individual words.
    These approaches can, in principle, be more accurate than word-based approaches, but have not been sufficiently robust to perfor
