    Sentence Similarity computation: Kauchak and Barzilay (2006) have tried paraphrasing-based sentence similarity computation.
    They paraphrase a sentence s by replacing its words with WordNet synonyms, so that s can be more similar in wording to another sentence s'.
    A similar method has also been proposed in (Zhou et al., 2006), which uses paraphrase phrases like our PT-1 instead of WordNet synonyms.
    These methods can be roughly viewed as special cases of ours, which only focus on the sentence similarity computation application and only use one kind of paraphrase resource.
  
  
    This paper proposes a method for statistical paraphrase generation.
    The contributions are as follows.
    (1) It is the first statistical model specially designed for paraphrase generation, which is based on the analysis of the differences between paraphrase generation and other researches, especially machine translation.
    (2) It generates paraphrases for different applications with
