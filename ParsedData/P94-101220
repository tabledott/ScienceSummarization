    To our knowledge, this is the first large-scale empirical demonstration that a pure length-based method can yield high accuracy sentence alignments between parallel texts in Indo-European and entirely dissimilar non-alphabetic, non-IndoEuropean languages.
    We are encouraged by the results and plan to expand our program in this direction.
    We have also obtained highly promising improvements by hybridizing lexical and lengthbased alignment methods within a common statistical framework.
    Though they are particularly useful for non-alphabetic languages where character length is not as discriminating a feature, we believe improvements will result even when applied to alphabetic languages.
  
  
    I am indebted to Bill Gale for helpful clarifying discussions, Xuanyin Xia and Wing Hong Chan for assistance with conversion of corpus materials, as well as Graeme Hirst and Linda Peto.
