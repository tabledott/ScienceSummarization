   Then the transducer det(klet(TR)r) obtained by reversing T, applying determinization, rereversing the obtained transducer and determinizing it is a minimal subsequential transducer equivalent to T. Proof We denote by: The double reverse and determinization algorithms clearly do not change the function that T realizes.
    So T' is a subsequential transducer equivalent to T. We only need to prove that T' is minimal.
    This is equivalent to showing that T&amp;quot; is minimal, since T' and T&amp;quot; have the same number of states.
    Ti is the result of a determinization, hence it is a trim subsequential transducer.
    We show that T' det(n) is minimal if Ti is a trim subsequential transducer.
    Notice that the theorem does not require that T be subsequential.
    Let Si and 52 be two states of T&amp;quot; equivalent in the sense of automata.
    We prove that Si = Sz, namely that no two distinct states of T&amp;quot; can be merged.
    This will prove that T&amp;quot; is minimal.
    Since pushing o
