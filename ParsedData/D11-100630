S of a delexicalized English parser.
    Of course, our experiments focus strictly on IndoEuropean languages.
    Preliminary experiments for Arabic (ar), Chinese (zh), and Japanese (ja) suggest similar direct transfer methods are applicable.
    For example, on the CoNLL test sets, a DMV model obtains UAS of 28.7/41.8/34.6% for ar/zh/ja respectively, whereas an English direct transfer parser obtains 32.1/53.8/32.2% and a multi-source direct transfer parser obtains 39.9/41.7/43.3%.
    In this setting only Indo-European languages are used as source data.
    Thus, even across language groups direct transfer is a reasonable baseline.
    However, this is not necessary as treebanks are available for a number of language groups, e.g., Indo-European, Altaic, Semitic, and Sino-Tibetan.
    The second fundamental observation is that when available, multiple sources should be used.
    Even through naive multi-source methods (concatenating data), it is possible to build a system that has comparable accuracy to the s
