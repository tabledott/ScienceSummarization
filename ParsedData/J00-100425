hat map heads, w1 and w&#8222; of the right and left dependent phrases of w to their translations as indicated by the alignment function f in the hierarchical alignment.
    The positions of the dependents in the target string are computed by comparing the positions of f (wi) and f (wr) to the position of v = f (w).
    In order to generalize from instances in the training data, some model states arising from different training instances are shared.
    In particular, in the construction described here, for a given pair (w, v) there is only one final state.
    (We have also tried using automatic word-clustering techniques to merge states further, but for the limited domain corpora we have used so far, the results are inconclusive.)
    To specify States and transitions constructed for the &amp;quot;swapping&amp;quot; decomposition shown in Figure 7. the sharing of states we make use of a one-to-one state-naming function a- from sequences of strings to transducer states.
    The same state-naming function is
