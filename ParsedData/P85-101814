 subdag of D picked out by a path p. We will also occasionally use the square brackets as the Hag constructor function, so that If : Di where D is an expression denoting a dag will denote the dag whose f feature has value D. There is a natural lattice structure for dags based on substimption&#8212;an ordering on (lags that roughly corre,pow Is to the compatibility and relative specificity of information 3 The reader is referred to earlier works 115,101 for more detailed discussions of dag structures. contained in the dags.
    Intuitively viewed, a dag D subsumes a dag D' (notated DC D') if D contains a subset of the information in (i.e., is more general than) U.
    Thus variables subsume all other dags, atomic or complex, because as the trivial case, they contain no information at all.
    A complex dag D subsumes a complex dag Ds if and only if D(1) C DT) for all I E dom(D) and Ds(P) = f/(q) for all paths p and q such that D(p) = D(q).
    An atomic dag neither subsumes nor is subsumed by any different ato
