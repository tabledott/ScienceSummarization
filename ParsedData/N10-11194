ces, and when they are included within a contextual classifier framework (Wilson et al., 2005).
    Extracting polarity lexicons from the web has been investigated previously by Kaji and Kitsuregawa (2007), who study the problem exclusively for Japanese.
    In that work a set of positive/negative sentences are first extracted from the web using cues from a syntactic parser as well as the document structure.
    Adjectives phrases are then extracted from these sentences based on different statistics of their occurrence in the positive or negative set.
    Our work, on the other hand, does not rely on syntactic parsers or restrict the set of candidate lexicon entries to specific syntactic classes, i.e., adjective phrases.
    As a result, the lexicon built in our study is on a different scale than that examined in Kaji and Kitsuregawa (2007).
    Though this hypothesis is not tested here, it also makes our techniques more amenable to adaptation for other languages.
