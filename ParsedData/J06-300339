idden.3 Turney and Littman (2005) used AltaVista&#8217;s hit count, which is the number of documents (Web pages) matching a given query, but LRA uses the number of passages (strings) matching a query.
    In our experiments with LRA (Sections 6 and 7), we use a local copy of the Waterloo MultiText System (WMTS) (Clarke, Cormack, and Palmer 1998; Terra and Clarke 2003), running on a 16 CPU Beowulf Cluster, with a corpus of about 5 &#215; 1010 English words.
    The WMTS is a distributed (multiprocessor) search engine, designed primarily for passage retrieval (although document retrieval is possible, as a special case of passage retrieval).
    The text and index require approximately one terabyte of disk space.
    Although AltaVista only gives a rough estimate of the number of matching documents, the WMTS gives exact counts of the number of matching passages.
    Turney et al. (2003) combine 13 independent modules to answer SAT questions.
    The performance of LRA significantly surpasses this combined system
