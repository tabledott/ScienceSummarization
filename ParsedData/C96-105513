of the func- tions: the actual groupings of verbs, based on these two separate criteria.
  The semantic extensions are sets of verb tokens, and likewise, the syntactic extensions are sets of verb tokens.
  To the extent that these functions map between syntax and semantics intensionally, they will pick out the same verbs extensionally.
  So for the verb-based experiment, our technique for establishing the relatedness between the syntactic signa- tures and the semantic lasses, is mediated by the verbs themselves.
  We compare the two orthogonal groupings of the inventory of verbs: the semantic lasses defined by Levin and the sets of verbs that correspond to each of the derived syntactic signatures.
  When these two groupings overlap, we have discovered a mapping from the syntax of the verbs to their semantics, via the verb tokens.
  More specifically, we define the overlap index 3An example of the intensional characterization of the Levin classes are the definitions of Lexical Conceptual Struc- tures which cor
