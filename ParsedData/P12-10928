eserves word order and syntactic information, while the global score uses a weighted average which is similar to bag-of-words features, capturing more of the semantics and topics of the document.
			Note that Collobert and Weston (2008)?s language model corresponds to the network using only local context.
			2.3 Learning.
			Following Collobert and Weston (2008), we sample the gradient of the objective by randomly choosing a word from the dictionary as a corrupt example for each sequence-document pair, (s, d), and take thederivative of the ranking loss with respect to the parameters: weights of the neural network and the em bedding matrix L. These weights are updated via backpropagation.
			The embedding matrix L is theword representations.
			We found that word embed dings move to good positions in the vector spacefaster when using mini-batch L-BFGS (Liu and Nocedal, 1989) with 1000 pairs of good and corrupt examples per batch for training, compared to stochas tic gradient descent.
