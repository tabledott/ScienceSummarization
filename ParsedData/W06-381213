, 2001), co-occurrence graphs as used in the experiment section are reported to possess the small world property, i.e. a high clustering coefficient and short average path length between arbitrary nodes.
    Steyvers and Tenenbaum (2005) show that association networks as well as semantic resources are scale-free SW-graphs: their degree distribution follows a power law.
    A generative model is provided that generates undirected, scalefree SW-graphs in the following way: We start with a small number of fully connected nodes.
    When adding a new node, an existing node v is chosen with a probability according to its degree.
    The new node is connected to M nodes in the neighborhood of v. The generative model is parameterized by the number of nodes n and the network's mean connectivity, which approaches 2M for large n. Let us assume that we deal with natural systems that can be characterized by small world graphs.
    If two or more of those systems interfere, their graphs are joined by merging some nodes, r
