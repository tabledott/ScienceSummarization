e two topmost items of S, and following the item in front of W. The specific features are shown in figure 2.
    The classifier&#8217;s target classes are parser actions that specify both types of decisions mentioned above.
    These classes are: Let: S(n) denote the nth item from the top of the stack S, and W(n) denote the nth item from the front of the queue W. Features: rectly related to the lexicalized constituent trees that are built during parsing, while the features described in items 8 &#8211; 13 are more directly related to the dependency structures that are built simultaneously to the constituent structures.
    Additionally, the head of the new subtree is the same as the head of the left child of the root node; When the algorithm described in section 2.1 is combined with a trained classifier that determines its parsing actions as described in section 2.2, we have a complete classifier-based parser.
    Training the parser is accomplished by training its classifier.
    To that end, we need training
