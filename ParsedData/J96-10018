itional research using statistical approaches to bilingual problems, but it is less related to ours, addressing, for example, word sense disambiguation in the source language by statistically examining context (e.g., collocations) in the source language, thus allowing appropriate word selection in the target language.
    (Brown et al. 1991; Dagan, Itai, and Schwall 1991; Dagan and Itai 1994).
    Our use of bilingual corpora assumes a prealigned corpus.
    Thus, we draw on work done at AT&amp;T Bell Laboratories by Gale and Church (1991a, 1991b, 1993) and at IBM by Brown, Lai, and Mercer (1991) on bilingual sentence alignment.
    Sentence alignment programs take a paired bilingual corpus as input and determine which sentences in the target language translate which sentences in the source language.
    Both the AT&amp;T and the IBM groups use purely statistical techniques based on sentence length to identify sentence pairing in corpora such as the Hansards.
    The AT&amp;T group (Gale and Church 1993) defi
