EU confidence interval com puted using bootstrap resampling (Och, 2003).Row 1 gives the performance when no reordering model is used.
			The next two rows show the in fluence of the MJ-1 reordering model; in row 2, a flat probability of ?1(x, u) = 0.05 is used for all phrase-pairs; in row 3, a reordering probability isestimated for each phrase-pair using Viterbi Train ing (Eqn 13).
			The last two rows show the effect ofthe MJ-2 reordering model; row 4 uses flat proba bilities (?1(x, u) = 0.05, ?2(x, u) = 0.01) for all phrase-pairs; row 5 applies reordering probabilities estimating with Viterbi Training for each phrase-pair (Table 2).On both language-pairs, we observe that reorder ing yields significant improvements.
			The gains from phrase reordering are much higher on A-E relative to C-E; this could be related to the fact that the word order differences between English and Arabic are much higher than the differences between Englishand Chinese.
