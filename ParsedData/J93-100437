etween our work and theirs will not test whether characters or words are more useful.
    As set out in the previous section, there are numerous differences in testing methodology and materials.
    Furthermore, there are apparently many differences between the IBM algorithm and ours other than the units of measurement, which could also account for any difference on performance.
    Appropriate methodology is to compare methods with only one factor varying, as we do here.
    Recall that align is a two-step process.
    First, paragraph boundaries are identified and then sentences are aligned within paragraphs.
    We considered eliminating the first step and found a threefold degradation in performance.
    The English&#8212;French errors were increased from 36 to 84, and the English&#8212;German errors from 19 to 86.
    The overall errors were increased from 55 to 170.
    Thus the two-step approach reduces errors by a factor of three.
    It is possible that performance might be improved further still by
