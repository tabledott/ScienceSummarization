morpheme (88.5%) models over the initial condition.
    The full second-order HMM [2] didn&#8217;t upgrade the accuracy of the partial second-order, but achieved the best results for the uniform distribution morpheme model.
    This is because the context-free approximation does not take into account the tag of the previous word, which is part of model 2.
    We believe that initializing the morpheme model over a small set of annotated corpus will set much stronger initial condition for this model.
    (4) Model type: The main result of this paper is the error reduction of the morpheme model with respect to the word model: about 19.3% (85.75 &#8211; 88.5).
    In addition, we apply the above models for the simpler task of segmentation and PoS tagging, as reported in Table 4.
    The task requires picking the correct morphemes of each word with their correct PoS (excluding all other morphological features).
    The best result for this task is obtained with the morpheme model 2: 92.32%.
