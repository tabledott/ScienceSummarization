ter, and right daughter, respectively.4 In chart parsing, partial parse candidates are stored in a chart, in which phrasal signs are identified and packed into equivalence classes if they are judged to be equivalent and dominate the same word sequences.
    A set of parse trees is then represented as a set of relations among equivalence classes.5 Figure 12 shows a chart for parsing he saw a girl with a telescope, where the modifiee of with is ambiguous (saw or girl).
    Each feature structure expresses an equivalence class, and the arrows represent immediate-dominance relations.
    The phrase, saw a girl with a telescope, has two trees (A in the figure).
    Because the signs of the top-most nodes are equivalent, they are packed into an equivalence class.
    The ambiguity is represented as the two pairs of arrows leaving the node A.
    A set of HPSG parse trees is represented in a chart as a tuple (E, Er, o ), where E is a set of equivalence classes, Er C E is a set of root nodes, and o : E -4 2E&#215;E i
