 doubt because the evaluation metric depends only on the ranking of the probabilities and not on their exact values.
    Changing the interpolation weights rarely changes the probabilities of the roles enough to change their ranking.
    What matters most is whether a combination of variables has been seen in the training data or not.
    Results for the geometric mean are shown in row 3 of Table 5.
    As with linear interpolation, the exact weights were found to have little effect, and the results shown reflect equal weights.
    An area we have not explored is the use of the maximum-entropy techniques of, for example, Pietra, Pietra, and Lafferty (1997), to set weights for the log-linear model, either at the level of combining our probability distributions or at the level of calculating weights for individual values of the features.
    In the &#8220;backoff&#8221; combination method, a lattice was constructed over the distributions in Table 3 from more-specific conditioning events to less-specific, as sho
