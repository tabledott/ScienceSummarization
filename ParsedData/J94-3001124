 the Intro relation includes the identity pair (cd, cd) as well.
    The Coerce relation as defined above also contains the pair (cd, cd) (= (ccd, cEd)), since &#8364;: E is not in [0:0 o 0: M. The grammar as a whole thus allows (cd, cd) as an undesired composition.
    We can eliminate pairs of this type by formulating a slightly different relation for epenthesis rules such as these.
    We must still disallow pairs when O's in the domain of 7- are paired with strings not in the range.
    But we also want to disallow pairs whose lexical strings do not have the appropriate O's to trigger the grammar's epenthesis coercions.
    This can be accomplished by a modified version of the Coerce relation that also excludes realizations of the empty string by something not in T. We replace the Dom (7-) expression in the definition above with the relation Dom (T U {E: E}).
    The twolevel literature is silent about whether or not an epenthesis rule should also reject strings with certain other insertion patterns.
