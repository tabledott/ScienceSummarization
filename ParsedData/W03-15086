 pin-yin symbols by their pronunciations, which are described using an inventory of generalized initials and finals.
    The pronunciation table for this purpose is obtained from an elementary Mandarin textbook (Practical Chinese Reader, 1981).
    The net result is a corpus of 3875 pairs of &#8220;sentences&#8221; of the kind depicted in the second and third lines of Figure 1.
    The vocabulary of the English side of this parallel corpus is 43 phonemes, and the Chinese side is 58 (21 initials and 37 finals).
    Note, however, that only 409 of the 21 37 possible initial-final combinations constitute legal pin-yin symbols.
    A second corpus of 3875 &#8220;sentence&#8221; pairs is derived corresponding to the fourth and fifth lines of Figure 1, this time to train a statistical model to translate pin-yin sequences to Chinese characters.
    The vocabulary of the pin-yin side of this corpus is 282 and that of the character side is about 680.
    These, of course, are much smaller than the inventory of Chinese
