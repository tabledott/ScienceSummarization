    Table 3 shows results for the same experiment, but this time with a seed set of 500 manually labelled sentences.
    We see that naive co-training improves as the cache size increases.
    For a large cache, the performance levels for naive co-training are very similar to those produced by our agreement-based co-training method.
    After 50 rounds of co-training using 50 seed sentences, the agreement rates for naive and agreement-based cotraining were very similar: from an initial value of 73% to 97% agreement.
    Naive co-training is more efficient than agreementbased co-training.
    For the parameter settings used in the previous experiments, agreement-based co-training required the taggers to be re-trained 10 to 100 times more often then naive co-training.
    There are advantages to agreement-based co-training, however.
    First, the agreement-based method dynamically selects the best sample at each stage, which may not be the whole cache.
    In particular, when the agreement rate can
