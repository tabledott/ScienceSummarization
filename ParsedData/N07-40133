, ek are entities and rj is the relation between them.
    For example, TEXTRUNNER might extract the tuple (Edison, invented, light bulbs).
    On our test corpus (a 9 million document subset of our full corpus), it took less than 68 CPU hours to process the 133 million sentences.
    The process is easily parallelized, and took only 4 hours to run on our cluster.
  
  
    While full parsing is too expensive to apply to the Web, we use a parser to generate training examples for extraction.
    Using several heuristic constraints, we automatically label a set of parsed sentences as trustworthy or untrustworthy extractions (positive and negative examples, respectively).
    The classifier is trained on these examples, using features such as the part of speech tags on the words in the relation.
    The classifier is then able to decide whether a sequence of POS-tagged words is a correct extraction with high accuracy.
  
  
    Because TEXTRUNNER has no pre-defined relations, it may extract many different string
