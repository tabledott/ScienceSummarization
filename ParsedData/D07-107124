 performed learning of the lexicon ? at each iteration in a batch method, requiring a pass over the entire training set.
			The new algorithm is fully online, learning both ? and w in an example-by-example fashion.
			This has important consequences for the efficiency of the algorithm.
			Second, the parameter estimation method in ZC05 was based on stochasticgradient descent on a log-likelihood objective func tion.
			The new algorithm makes use of perceptron 683 Inputs: Training examples {(xi, zi) : i = 1 . . .
			n} where each xi is a sentence, each zi is a logical form.
			An initial lexicon ?0.
			Number of training iterations, T . Definitions: GENLEX(x, z) takes as input a sentence x anda logical form z and returns a set of lexical items as de scribed in section 2.4.
			GEN(x; ?) is the set of all parses for x with lexicon ?.
			GEN(x, z; ?) is the set of all parses for x with lexicon ?, which have logical form z. Thefunction f(x, y) represents the features described in sec tion 4.1.
			The function L(y)
