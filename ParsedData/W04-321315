lgorithm, the log ratio threshold is initially set high and gradually reduced until it reaches 0.
    In the case of remaining ties, we assign the role for which is highest.
    Because our evidence count and log ratio restrictions may not be met even when we have a very good candidate for a slot, we reduce the evidence count threshold to the minimum value of 1 when the log ratio threshold reaches 1.3 By this point, we assume competitor candidates have been given sufficient opportunity to amass the relevant counts.
    Algorithm 1 shows the bootstrapping algorithm.
    Algorithm 1 Bootstrapping Algorithm 1: Perform Frame Matching to determine the slots to be labelled, along with their candidate lists of roles.
    2: Let be the set of annotated slots; .
    Let be the set of unannotated slots, initially all slots.
    Let be the set of newly annotated slots; .
    3: Add to each slot whose role assignment is unambiguous&#8212;whose candidate list has one element.
