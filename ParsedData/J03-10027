ed that enforces a one-to-one alignment for nonempty words.
    This means that the alignment mapping aJ1 must be injective for all word positions aj &gt; 0.
    Note that many translation phenomena cannot be handled using restricted alignment representations such as this one.
    Especially, methods such as Melamed&#8217;s are in principle not able to achieve a 100% recall.
    The problem can be reduced through corpus preprocessing steps that perform grouping and splitting of words.
    Some papers report improvements in the alignment quality of statistical methods when linguistic knowledge is used (Ker and Chang 1997; Huang and Choi 2000).
    In these methods, the linguistic knowledge is used mainly to filter out incorrect alignments.
    In this work, we shall avoid making explicit assumptions concerning the language used.
    By avoiding these assumptions, we expect our approach to be applicable to almost every language pair.
    The only assumptions we make are that the parallel text is segmented into
