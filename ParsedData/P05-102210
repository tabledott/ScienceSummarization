CFG parser.
    However, precisely because this first stage uses a grammar that ignores many important contextual features, the best parse it finds will not, in general, be the best parse according to the finer-grained second-stage grammar, so clearly we do not want to perform best-first parsing with this grammar.
    Instead, the output of the first stage is a polynomial-sized packed parse forest which records the left and right string positions for each local tree in the parses generated by this grammar.
    The edges in the packed parse forest are then pruned, to focus attention on the coarsegrained states that are likely to correspond to highprobability fine-grained states.
    The edges are then pruned according to their marginal probability conditioned on the string s being parsed as follows: Here nij,k is a constituent of type i spanning the words from j to k, &#945;(nij,k) is the outside probability of this constituent, and Q(nij,k) is its inside probability.
    From parse forest both &#945; and Q ca
