 models are tractable and easily implemented, the more accurate fertility-based models are intractable and thus require approximation methods which are difficult to implement.
    As a result, many practitioners use the complex GIZA++ software package (Och and Ney, 2003) as a black box, selecting model 4 as a good compromise between alignment quality and efficiency.
    Even though the fertility-based models are more accurate, there are several reasons to consider avenues for improvement based on the simpler and faster sequence-based models.
    First, even with the highly optimized implementations in GIZA++, models 3 and above are still very slow to train.
    Second, we seem to have hit a point of diminishing returns with extensions to the fertility-based models.
    For example, gains from the new model 6 of Och and Ney (2003) are modest.
    When models are too complex to reimplement, the barrier to improvement is raised even higher.
    Finally, the fertility-based models are asymmetric, and symmetrizati
