  Then we took the set of verbs that had one of these containee nouns as a direct object and compared this set to the set of verbs that had the container noun tape as a direct object in the corpus.
    According to our hypothesis, verbs applying to the telic role should appear in the intersection of these two sets (as a result of the alternation), while those applying to the formal role will appear in the set difference {verbs with containers as direct object}&#8212;{verbs with containees as direct object}.
    The difference operation should serve to remove any verbs that co-occur with containee objects.
    Figure 3 shows the results of intersection and set difference for three container nouns tape, disk, and directory.
    The results indicate that the container LCP is able to differentiate nouns with respect to their telic and formal qualia, for the nouns tape and disk but not for directory.
    The poor discrimination in the latter case can be attributed to the fact that a directory is a recursive contai
