 identifies Plot of precision/recall curve for various methods of identifying frame elements.
    Recall is calculated over only frame elements with matching parse constituents.
    Exactly matching boundaries 66% 5,421 Identified constituent entirely within true frame element 8 663 True frame element entirely within identified constituent 7 599 Both partially within the other 0 26 No overlap with any true frame element 13 972 two frame elements, indicated by shading, which together span the true frame element.
    When the automatically identified constituents were fed through the role-labeling system described above, 79.6% of the constituents that had been correctly identified in the first stage were assigned the correct role in the second, roughly equivalent to the performance when roles were assigned to constituents identified by hand.
    A more sophisticated integrated system for identifying and labeling frame elements is described in Section 7.1.
