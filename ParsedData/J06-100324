in the determi- nation of the degree of semantic proximity: Edges are used solely for locating super- ordinates of a pair of concepts; in particular, the number of links does not figure in any of the formulas pertaining to the method; and numerical evidence comes from corpus statistics, which are associated with nodes.
  This rather selective use of the structure of the taxonomy has its drawbacks, one of which is the indistinguishability, in terms of semantic distance, of any two pairs of concepts having the same most-specific subsumer.
  For example, in Figure 1, we find that simR(money, credit) = simR(dime, credit card), be- cause in each case the lso is medium of exchange, whereas, for an edge-based method such as Leacock and Chodorow?s (Section 2.5.3), clearly this is not so, as the number of edges in each case is different.
  2.6.2 Jiang and Conrath?s Combined Approach.
  Reacting to the disadvantages of Resnik?s method, Jiang and Conrath?s (1997) idea was to synthesize edge- and node- based techniques b
