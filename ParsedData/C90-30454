taneously to related nodes in pairs of trees, one for each language.
			For convenience, we will call the two languages ource and target languages, although the formalism is not in- herently directional.
			As an example, consider the task of relating a frag- ment of English with a simple representation of its predicate-argument structure.

			synchronous TAG is a pair consisting of two elemen- tar2,' trees, one from tlie source language (English) and one from the target (logical form \[LF\]).
			Nodes, one from each tree, may be linked; ~ such links are depicted graph- ically as thick lines.
			If we project the pairs onto their first or second components (ignoring the cross links), the projections are TAGs for an English fragment and an LF fragm
