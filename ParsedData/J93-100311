es computed using the normal approximation are less and less accurate.
    Table 1 shows the probability that one or more matches are found in 100 words of text as computed using the binomial and normal distributions for np = 0.001, np = 0.01, np = 0.1, and np = 1 where n = 100.
    Most words are sufficiently rare so that even for samples of text where n is as large as several thousand, np will be at the bottom of this range.
    Short phrases are so numerous that np &lt; 1 for almost all phrases even when n is as large as several million.
    Table 1 shows that for rare events, the normal distribution does not even approximate the binomial distribution.
    In fact, for np = 0.1 and n = 100, using the normal distribution overestimates the significance of one or more occurrences by a factor of 40, while for np = 0.01, using the normal distribution overestimates the significance by about 4 x 1020.
    When n increases beyond 100, the numbers in the table do not change significantly.
    If this overestimation
