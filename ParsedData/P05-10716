    While there have been many publications on computational morphological analysis for Arabic (see (Al-Sughaiyer and Al-Kharashi, 2004) for an excellent overview), to our knowledge only Diab et al. (2004) perform a large-scale corpus-based evaluation of their approach.
    They use the same SVMbased learner we do, Yamcha, for three different tagging tasks: word tokenization (tagging on letters of a word), which we contrast with our work in Section 7; POS tagging, which we discuss in relation to our work in Section 8; and base phrase chunking, which we do not discuss in this paper.
    We take the comparison between our results on POS tagging and those of Diab et al. (2004) to indicate that the use of a morphological analyzer is beneficial for Arabic as well.
    Several other publications deal specifically with segmentation.
    Lee et al. (2003) use a corpus of manually segmented words, which appears to be a subset of the first release of the ATB (110,000 words), and thus comparable to our training co
