em, we can directly apply the many techniques and algorithms for dealing with graph structures.
    (2) The use of cost functions allows us to model different search methods, each restricting the search space in its own way.
    By defining cost functions in different ways, we can mimic and extend various well-known algorithms from the literature (see also Krahmer, van Erk, and Verleg [2001]).
    (3) The generation of relational descriptions is straightforward; the problems that plague some other algorithms for the generation of relational descriptions do not arise.
    Moreover, the approach to relations proposed here is fully general: It applies to all n-ary relations, not just binary ones.
    (4) The use of cost functions paves the way for integrating statistical information directly into the generation process.
    In fact, performing experiments with various ways to estimate stochastic cost functions from corpora is one path for future research that we have identified.
