 natural language processing tasks.
    Although some semantic dictionaries do exist (e.g., WordNet (Miller, 1990)), they are rarely complete, especially for large open classes (e.g., classes of people and objects) and rapidly changing categories (e.g., computer technology).
    (Roark and Charniak, 1998) reported that 3 of every 5 terms generated by their semantic lexicon learner were not present in WordNet.
    Automatic semantic lexicon acquisition could be used to enhance existing resources such as WordNet, or to produce semantic lexicons for specialized categories or domains.
    A variety of methods have been developed for automatic semantic class identification, under the rubrics of lexical acquisition, hyponym acquisition, semantic lexicon induction, semantic class learning, and web-based information extraction.
    Many of these approaches employ surface-level patterns to identify words and their associated semantic classes.
    However, such patterns tend to overgenerate (i.e., deliver incorrect res
