    We present a method for automatic identification of non-compositional expressions using their statistical properties in a text corpus.
    The intuitive idea behind the method is that the metaphorical usage of a non-compositional expression causes it to have a different distributional characteristic than expressions that are similar to its literal meaning.
  
  
    The input to our algorithm is a collocation database and a thesaurus.
    We briefly describe the process of obtaining this input.
    More details about the construction of the collocation database and the thesaurus can be found in (Lin, 1998).
    We parsed a 125-million word newspaper corpus with Minipar,1 a descendent of Principar (Lin, 1993; Lin, 1994), and extracted dependency relationships from the parsed corpus.
    A dependency relationship is a triple: (head type modifier), where head and modifier are words in the input sentence and type is the type of the dependency relation.
    For example, (la) is an example dependency tre
