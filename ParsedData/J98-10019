in a particular domain of discourse; e.g., a microglossary for the domain of mathematics would contain only the relevant definition of triangle, and not the definition of triangle as a musical instrument.
    The need for knowledge representation for WSD was also acknowledged from the outset: Weaver concludes by noting the &amp;quot;tremendous amount of work [needed] in the logical structure of languages&amp;quot; (1995, 23).
