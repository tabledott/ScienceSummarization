ed given a word class.
    For example, the character string &#26446;&#20426;&#29983; is more likely to be a person name than &#37324;&#20426;&#29983; &#8216;Li Junsheng&#8217; because &#26446; is a common family name in China while &#37324; is not.
    So P(S|C) is also referred to as class model afterwards.
    In our system, we use the improved source-channel models, which contains one context model (i.e., a trigram language model in our case) and a set of class models of different types, each of which is for one class of words, as shown in Figure 2.
    Although Eq.
    2 suggests that class model probability and context model probability can be combined through simple multiplication, in practice some weighting is desirable.
    There are two reasons.
    First, some class models are poorly estimated, owing to the sub-optimal assumptions we make for simplicity and the insufficiency of the training corpus.
    Combining the context model probability with poorly estimated class model probabilities according
