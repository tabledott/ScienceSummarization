 times it came up heads.
    At the end of this sampling procedure bin i contains the number of coins that came up heads exactly i times out of N. Such a histogram is shown in Figure 1, where N = 40.
    If N is large enough and enough coins are flipped N times, one would expect the following: A histogram illustrating a binomially shaped distribution in the first eight bins. were 16&#8212;their height drops to zero for two stretches before rising significantly above zero again.
    Specifically, the height of the ith histogram bin should be roughly proportional to P(i,N,p_s), with N the fixed sample size and p_s an estimate of 7r_s.
    The estimation procedure tries out each bin as a possible estimate of Jo.
    Each estimate of Jo leads to an estimate of 7r, and hence to an expected shape for the first Jo histogram bins.
    Each estimate j of Jo is evaluated by comparing the predicted distribution in the first j bins to the observed distribution&#8212;the better the fit, the better the estimate.
