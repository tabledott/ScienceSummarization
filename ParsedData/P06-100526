gender/number.
    It would be interesting to see whether performance could be improved by adding WordNet and web-mined features.
    Path coreference itself could conceivably be determined with a search engine.
    Gender is our most powerful probabilistic feature.
    In fact, inspecting our system&#8217;s decisions, gender often rules out coreference regardless of path coreference.
    This is not surprising, since we based the acquisition of C(p) on gender.
    That is, our bootstrapping assumption was that the majority of times these paths occur, gender indicates coreference or lack thereof.
    Thus when they occur in our test sets, gender should often sufficiently indicate coreference.
    Improving the orthogonality of our features remains a future challenge.
    Nevertheless, note the decrease in performance on each of the datasets when C(p) is excluded (#5).
    This is compelling evidence that path coreference is valuable in its own right, beyond its ability to bootstrap extensive and reliable gend
