 present natural language processing technology with a major challenge: what to do with words the system has never seen before.
    Current technology depends on handcrafted linguistic and domain knowledge.
    For instance, the system that performed most successfully in the evaluation of software to extract data from text at the Second Message Understanding Conference held at the Naval Ocean Systems Center, June 1989, would simply halt processing a sentence when a new word was encountered.
    Using the UPenn set of parts of speech, unknown words can be in any of 22 categories.
    A tri-tag model can be used to estimate the most probable one.
    Random choice among the 22 open classes would be expected to show an error rate for new words of 95%.
    The best previously reported error rate based on probabilistic models was 75% (Kuhn and DeMori 1990).
    In our first tests using the trkag model we showed an error rate of only 51.6%.
    However, this model only took into account the context of the word, and
