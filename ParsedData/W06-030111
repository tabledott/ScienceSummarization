ing frames.
    CBC (Pantel and Lin, 2002) was developed based on the distributional hypothesis (Harris, 1954) that words which occur in the same contexts tend to be similar.
    Using CBC, for example, our clustering module computes lexical similarity between the word vilify in Case 2 and all words in Case 1.
    Then it picks criticize as a similar word, so that we can use for vilify the frame Judgment_communication to which criticize belongs and all frame elements defined under Judgment_ communication.
    To find a potential holder and topic of an opinion word in a sentence, we first label semantic roles in a sentence.
    Modeling: We follow the statistical approaches for semantic role labeling (Gildea and Jurafsky, 2002; Fleischman et. al, 2003) which separate the task into two steps: identify candidates of frame elements (Step 1) and assign semantic roles for those candidates (Step 2).
    Like their intuition, we treated both steps as classification problems.
    We first collected all constituents of
