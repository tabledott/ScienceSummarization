osed in this research, word similarity (&#8220;WS&#8221;) achieves higher precision and recall than context support (&#8220;CS&#8221;), signifying that many of the ill-formed words emanate from morphophonemic variations.
    However, when combined with word similarity features, context support improves over the basic method at a level of statistical significance (based on randomised estimation, p &lt; 0.05: Yeh (2000)), indicating the complementarity of the two methods, especially on Twitter data.
    The best F-score is achieved when combining dictionary lookup, word similarity and context support (&#8220;DL+WS+CS&#8221;), in which ill-formed words are first looked up in the slang dictionary, and only if no match is found do we apply our normalisation method.
    We found several limitations in our proposed approach by analysing the output of our method.
    First, not all ill-formed words offer useful context.
    Some highly noisy tweets contain almost all misspellings and unique symbols, and thus no conte
