 q) to M(i, j).
    The time complexity of the algorithm is 0(n3IGIQmax), where G is the number of ruleFSMs derived from the dependency and LP rules in the grammar and Qmax is the maximum number of states in any of the rule-FSMs.
  
  
    Recall that in a pseudo-projective tree, we make a distinction between a syntactic governor and a linear governor.
    A node can be &amp;quot;lifted&amp;quot; along a lifting path from being a dependent of its syntactic governor to being a dependent of its linear 'This type of parser has been proposed previously.
    See for example (Lombardi, 1996; Eisner, 1996), who also discuss Early-style parsers for projective dependency grammars.
    'We can use pre-computed top-down prediction to limit the number of pairs added. governor, which must be an ancestor of the governor.
    In defining a formal rewriting system for pseudo-projective trees, we will not attempt to model the &amp;quot;lifting&amp;quot; as a transformational step in the derivation.
    Rather, we will directl
