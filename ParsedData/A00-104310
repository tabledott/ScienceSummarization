    Reduced sentence by humans: The V-chip will give parents a device to block out programs they don't want their children to see.
    We implemented an automatic sentence reduction system.
    Input to the reduction system includes extracted sentences, as well as the original document.
    Output of reduction are reduced forms of the extracted sentences, which can either be used to produce summaries directly, or be merged with other sentences.
    The reduction system uses multiple sources of knowledge to make reduction decisions, including syntactic knowledge, context, and statistics computed from a training corpus.
    We evaluated the system against the output of human professionals.
