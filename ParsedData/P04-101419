e node), this involves summing over all conjunctive node daughters which head subderivations leading to the same set of high scoring dependencies.
    In practice large numbers of such conjunctive nodes lead to very long parse times.
    As an alternative to finding the most probable dependency structure, we have developed an algorithm which maximises the expected labelled recall over dependencies.
    Our algorithm is based on Goodman&#8217;s (1996) labelled recall algorithm for the phrase-structure PARSEVAL measures.
    Let L, be the number of correct dependencies in 7r with respect to a gold standard dependency structure G; then the dependency structure, 7rmax, which maximises the expected recall rate is: LP LR UP UR cat where S is the sentence for gold standard dependency structure G and &#57737;i ranges over the dependency structures for S. This expression can be expanded further: The final score for a dependency structure &#57737; is a sum of the scores for each dependency &#57744; in &#57737;; and the
