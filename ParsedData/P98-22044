 
    preferred to RETAIN is preferred to SMOOTHSHIFT is preferred to ROUGH-SHIFT.
    The BFP-algorithm (cf.
    Walker et al. (1994)) consists of three basic steps: To illustrate this algorithm, we consider example (1) (Brennan et al., 1987) which has two different final utterances (1d) and (1 d').
    Utterance (1d) contains one pronoun, utterance (id') two pronouns.
    We look at the interpretation of (1d) and (1 d').
    After step 2, the algorithm has produced two readings for each variant which are rated by the corresponding transitions in step 3.
    In (1d), the pronoun &amp;quot;she&amp;quot; is resolved to &amp;quot;her&amp;quot; (= Brennan) because the CONTINUE transition is ranked higher than SMOOTHSHIFT in the second reading.
    In (id'), the pronoun &amp;quot;she&amp;quot; is resolved to &amp;quot;Friedman&amp;quot; because SMOOTHSHIFT is preferred over ROUGH-SHIFT.
