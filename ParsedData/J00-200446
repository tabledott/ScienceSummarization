 parts of speech.
    A kind of word order correlation bias can be effected by conditioning the auxiliary parameters on the relative positions of linked word tokens in their respective texts.
    Just as easily, we can model link types that coincide with entries in an on-line bilingual dictionary separately from those that do not (cf.
    Brown et al. 1993).
    When the auxiliary parameters are conditioned on different link classes, their optimization is carried out separately for each class: B(links (u, v) Icooc(u, v), A-zF ) (37) scorec (u, viz = class (u, v)) = log B (links (u, v)lcooc(u, v), ) Section 6.1.1 describes the link classes used in the experiments below.
  
  
    This section compares translation model estimation methods A, B, and C to each other and to Brown et al. 's (1993b) Model 1.
    To reiterate, Model 1 is based on co-occurrence information only; Method A is based on the one-to-one assumption; Method B adds the &amp;quot;one sense per collocation&amp;quot; hypothesis to Method A; Metho
