ge and Kruijff (2003), following the type-logical approaches to Categorial Grammar (Moortgat 1997).
    One possible extension to the parser and grammar described in this article is to incorporate the multi-modal approach; Baldridge suggests that, as well as having theoretical motivation, a multi-modal approach can improve the efficiency of CCG parsing.
    CCG was designed to deal with the long-range dependencies inherent in certain constructions, such as coordination and extraction, and arguably provides the most linguistically satisfactory account of these phenomena.
    Long-range dependencies are relatively common in text such as newspaper text, but are typically not recovered by treebank parsers such as Collins (2003) and Charniak (2000).
    This has led to a number of proposals for post-processing the output of the Collins and Charniak parsers, in which trace sites are located and the antecedent of the trace determined (Johnson 2002; Dienes and Dubey 2003; Levy and Manning 2004).
