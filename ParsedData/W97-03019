ual predicates which look at head words, or especially pairs of head words, may not be reliable predictors for the procedure actions due to their sparseness in the training sample.
    Therefore, for each lexically based contextual predicate, there also exist one or more corresponding less specific, or &amp;quot;backed-off&amp;quot;, contextual predicates which look at the same context, but omit one or more words.
    For example, the contexts cons(0, 1*), cons(0*, 1), cons(0*, 1*) are the same as cons(0, 1) but omit references to the head word of the 1st tree, the 0th tree, and both the 0th and 1st tree, respectively.
    The backed-off contextual predicates should allow the model to provide reliable probability estimates when the words in the history are rare.
    Backed-off predicates are not enumerated in table 3, but their existence is indicated with a * and t. The contextual predicates derived from the templates of table 3 are used to create the features necessary for the maximum entropy models.
