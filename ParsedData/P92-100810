selected by the pattern matcher, which has (at least on one measure) a 75% recall rate.
    The repair sites hypothesized by the pattern matcher constitute useful input for further processing based on other sources of information.
  
  
    Here we describe two sets of experiments to measure the effectiveness of a natural language processing system in distinguishing repairs from false positives.
    One approach is based on parsing of whole sentences; the other is based on parsing localized word sequences identified as potential repairs.
    Both of these experiments rely on the pattern matcher to suggest potential repairs.
    The syntactic and semantic components of the Gemini natural language processing system are used for both of these experiments.
    Gemini is an extensive reimplementation of the Core Language Engine (Alshawi et al., 1988).
    It includes modular syntactic and semantic components, integrated into an efficient all-paths bottom-up parser (Moore and Dowding, 1991).
