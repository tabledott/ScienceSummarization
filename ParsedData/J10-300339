    In addition, a strength value is calculated for each positive (negative) contextual feature f using maximum likelihood estimation as follows: strength(f )Number of positive (negative) examples surrounded by f _ Total occurrences off The extracted list of contextual features is thresholded on the basis of this strength value.
    The remaining contextual rules are then applied to the corpora to obtain additional positive and negative paraphrase examples that, in turn, lead to more refined contextual rules, and so on.
    The process is repeated for a fixed number of iterations or until no new paraphrase examples are produced.
    The list of extracted paraphrases at the end of the final iteration represents the final output of the algorithm.
    In total, about 9, 000 phrasal (including lexical) paraphrases are extracted from 11 translations of five works of classic literature.
    Furthermore, the extracted paraphrase pairs are also generalized into about 25 patterns by extracting part-of-speech tag s
