    They differ gold was quoted at S 366.50 an ounce . for seven different tagging formats.
    The I tag has been used for words inside a baseNP, 0 for words outside a baseNP, B and E for baseNP-initial words and E and] for baseNP-final words.
    JOB' The first word inside a baseNP immediately following another baseNP receives a B tag (Ramshaw and Marcus, 1995).
    I0B2 All baseNP-initial words receive a B tag (Ratnaparkhi, 1998).
    IOE1 The final word inside a baseNP immediately preceding another baseNP receives an E tag.
    10E2 All baseNP-final words receive an E tag.
    We wanted to compare these data representation formats with a standard bracket representation.
    We have chosen to divide bracketing experiments in two parts: one for recognizing opening brackets and one for recognizing closing brackets.
    Additionally we have worked with another partial representation which seemed promising: a tagging representation which disregards boundaries between adjacent chunks.
    These boundaries ca
