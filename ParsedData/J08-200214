ling and description of such systems can be found in (Carreras and M`arquez 2004).
    Most systems which use only shallow syntactic information represent the input sentence as a sequence of tokens (words or phrases), which they label with a BIO tagging representation (beginning, inside, and outside argument labels) (Hacioglu 2004).
    Limited joint information is used by such systems, provided as a fixed size context of tags on previous tokens; for example, a length five window is used in the chunk-based system in (Pradhan, Hacioglu et al. 2005).
    A method that models joint information in a different way was proposed by Cohn and Blunsom (2005).
    It uses a tree-structured CRF, where the statistical dependency structure is exactly defined by the edges in the syntactic parse tree.
    The only dependencies captured are between the label of a node and the label of each of its children.
    However, the arguments of a predicate can be arbitrarily far from each other in the syntactic parse tree and therefor
