es systems when they produce: (1) a higher number of clusters (low recall) or (2) a lower number of clusters (low precision), than the GS number of senses.
    Table 5 shows the performance of systems using the second unsupervised evaluation measure.
    In this evaluation, we observe that most of the systems perform better than Random.
    Despite that, none of the systems outperform the MFS baseline.
    It seems that systems generating a smaller number of clusters than the GS number of senses are biased towards the MFS, hence they are not able to perform better.
    On the other hand, systems generating a higher number of clusters are penalised by this measure.
    Systems generating a number of clusters roughly the same as the GS tend to conflate the GS senses lot more than the MFS.
    Table 6 shows the results of this evaluation for a 80-20 test set split, i.e.
    80% for mapping and 20% for evaluation.
    The last columns shows the average number of GS senses identified by each system in the five spl
