inal output of an MT system is only a portion of the utility of an automatic translation metric.
    Optimization of the parameters of an MT system is now done using automatic metrics, primarily BLEU.
    It is likely that some features that make an evaluation metric good for evaluating the final output of a system would make it a poor metric for use in system tuning.
    In particular, a metric may have difficulty distinguishing between outputs of an MT system that been optimized for that same metric.
    BLEU, the metric most frequently used to optimize systems, might therefore perform poorly in evaluation tasks compared to recall oriented metrics such as METEOR and TERp (whose tuning in Table 1 indicates a preference towards recall).
    Future research into the use of TERp and other metrics as optimization metrics is needed to better understand these metrics and the interaction with parameter optimization.
    Finally, we explored the difference between three types of human judgments that are often used t
