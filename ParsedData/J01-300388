ification from linguistically-based numerical indicators are reported.
    Using combinations of seven statistical indicators (some morphological and some reflecting syntactic cooccurrences), it is possible to learn the distinction between events and states for 739 verb tokens with an improvement of 10% over the baseline (error rate reduction of 74%), and to learn the distinction between culminated and non-culminated events for 308 verb tokens with an improvement of 11% (error rate reduction of 29%) (Siegel 1999).
    In work on lexical semantic verb classification, Lapata and Brew (1999) further support the thesis of a predictive correlation between syntax and semantics in a statistical framework, showing that the frequency distributions of subcategorization frames within and across classes can disambiguate the usages of a verb with more than one known lexical semantic class.
    On 306 verbs that are disambiguated by subcategorization frame, they achieve 91.8% accuracy on a task with a 65.7% baseline, for a
