ncludes that of Hobbs et al. (1987) and Wilks (1975), while interesting work on shared information structures in NLP domains is that of Flickinger et al.
    (1985) and Evans and Gazdar (1989, 1990).
    In addition to this static representation, I will introduce another mechanism for structuring lexical knowledge, the projective inheritance, which operates generatively from the qualia structure of a lexical item to create a relational structure for ad hoc categories.
    Both are necessary for projecting the semantic representations of individual lexical items onto a sentence level interpretation.
    The discussion here, however, will be limited to a description of projective inheritance and the notion of &amp;quot;degrees of prototypicality&amp;quot; of predication.
    I will argue that such degrees of salience or coherence relations can be explained in structural terms by examining a network of related lexical items.&amp;quot; I will illustrate the distinction between these mechanisms by considering the
