Schiehlen and Spranger, 2007), averaged perceptron (Carreras, 2007), or MIRA (Shimizu and Nakagawa, 2007), while some systems instead used methods based on maximum conditional likelihood (Nakagawa, 2007; Hall et al, 2007b).
			5.4 Domain Adaptation.
			5.4.1 Feature-Based ApproachesOne way of adapting a learner to a new domain without using any unlabeled data is to only include fea tures that are expected to transfer well (Dredze et al., 2007).
			In structural correspondence learning a transformation from features in the source domain to features of the target domain is learnt (Shimizu and Nakagawa, 2007).
			The original source features along with their transformed versions are then used to train a discriminative parser.
			5.4.2 Ensemble-Based Approaches Dredze et al (2007) trained a diverse set of parsers in order to improve cross-domain performance byincorporating their predictions as features for an other classifier.
			Similarly, two parsers trained with different learners and search directions were us
