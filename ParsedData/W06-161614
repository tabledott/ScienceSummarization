 labels to fall back on.
    Vx also contains a set of binary auxiliary variables: which represent the existence of a dependency between tokens i and j.
    We connect these to the ei,j,l variables by the constraint: Given the above variables our objective function Ox can be represented as (using a suitable k): We first introduce a set of base constraints Bx which we add in advance.
    Only One Head (T1) Every token has exactly one head: for non-root tokens j &gt; 0 in x.
    An exception is made for the artificial root node: Label Uniqueness (A1) To enforce uniqueness of children with labels in U we augment our model with the constraint: for every token i in x and label l in U. Symmetric Coordination (C1) For each conjunction token i which forms a symmetric coordination we add: and Asymmetric Coordination (C2) For each conjunction token i which forms an asymmetric coordination we add: and
  
  
    Now we present the set of constraints IX we add incrementally.
    The constraints are chosen based on the two
