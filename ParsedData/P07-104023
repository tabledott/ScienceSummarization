    An improved confusion network decoding method combining the word posteriors with arbitrary features was presented.
    This allows the addition of language model scores by expanding the lattices or re-scoring -best lists.
    The LM integration should result in more grammatical combination outputs.
    Also, confusion networks generated by using the -best hypothesis from all systems as the skeleton were used with prior probabilities derived from the average TER scores.
    This guarantees that the best path will not be found from a network generated for a system with zero weight.
    Compared to the earlier system combination approaches, this method is fully automatic and requires very little additional information on top of the development set outputs from the individual systems to tune the weights.
    The new method was evaluated on the Arabic to English and Chinese to English NIST MT05 tasks.
    Compared to the baseline from (Rosti et al., 2007), the new method improves the BLEU s
