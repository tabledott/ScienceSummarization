 variance of 100.
    Results for the discriminative parser are shown in the bottom panels of Figure 5.
    The supervised experiments are given to provide context for the accuracies.
    For Bulgarian, we see that without any hints about the annotation guidelines, the transfer system performs better than an unsu% pervised parser, comparable to a supervised parser trained on 10 sentences.
    However, if we specify just the two rules for &#8220;da&#8221; and verb conjugations performance jumps to that of training on 6070 fully labeled sentences.
    If we have just a little more prior knowledge about how closed-class words are handled, performance jumps above 140 fully labeled sentence equivalent.
    We observed another desirable property of the discriminative model.
    While the generative model can get confused and perform poorly when the training data contains very long sentences, the discriminative parser does not appear to have this drawback.
    In fact we observed that as the maximum training sentenc
