m objectives is to identify a core set of features that will be useful for disambiguating a wide class of words using both supervised and unsupervised methodologies.
    We have presented an ensemble approach to word sense disambiguation (Pedersen, 2000) where multiple Naive Bayesian classifiers, each based on co&#8212; occurrence features from varying sized windows of context, is shown to perform well on the widely studied nouns interest and line.
    While the accuracy of this approach was as good as any previously published results, the learned models were complex and difficult to interpret, in effect acting as very accurate black boxes.
    Our experience has been that variations in learning algorithms are far less significant contributors to disambiguation accuracy than are variations in the feature set.
    In other words, an informative feature set will result in accurate disambiguation when used with a wide range of learning algorithms, but there is no learning algorithm that can perform well given an
