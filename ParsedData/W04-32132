e a probability model based on the currently annotated semantic roles, use this probability model to assign roles that are deemed to have sufficient evidence, and add the newly labelled arguments to our annotated set.
    As we iterate, we gradually both grow the size of the annotated set, and relax the evidence thresholds for the probability model, until all arguments have been assigned roles.
    To our knowledge, this is the first unsupervised semantic role labelling system applied to general semantic roles in a domain-general corpus.
    In a similar vein of work, Riloff and colleagues (Riloff and Schmelzenbach, 1998; Jones et al., 1999) used bootstrapping to learn &#8220;case frames&#8221; for verbs, but their approach has been applied in very narrow topic domains with topic-specific roles.
    In other work, Gildea (2002) has explored unsupervised methods to discover role-slot mappings for verbs, but not to apply this knowledge to label text with roles.
    Our approach also differs from earlier work in
