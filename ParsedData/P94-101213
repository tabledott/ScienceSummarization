gle Chinese sentence.
    However, the English sentences in (6, 7) are incorrectly aligned 1for-1 instead of 2-for-1.
    Also, (11, 12) shows an example of a 3-for-1, 1-for-1 sequence that the model has no choice but to align as 2-for-2, 2-for-2.
    Judging relative to a manual alignment of the English and Chinese files, a total of 86.4% of the true L1 L2 pairs were correctly identified by the length-based method.
    However, many of the errors occurred within the introductory session header, whose format is domain-specific (discussed below).
    If the introduction is discarded, then the proportion of correctly aligned pairs rises to 95.2%, a respectable rate especially in view of the drastic inaccuracies in the distributions assumed.
    A detailed breakdown of the results is shown in Table 2.
    For reference, results reported for English/French generally fall between 96% and 98%.
    However, all of these numbers should be interpreted as highly domain dependent, with very small sample size.
