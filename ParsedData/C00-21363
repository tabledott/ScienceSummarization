ext section we outline the strncture of our extraction system, and describe the discov- ery task in the context of this system.
  Sections 2 and 3 describe our algorithm for pattern dis- covery; section 4 describes our experimental re- sults.
  This is tbllowed by comparison with prior work and discussion in section 5.
  1 The Extract ion System In the simplest terms, an extraction system identifies patterns within the text, and then mat)s some constituents of these patterns into data base entries.
  (This very simple descrip- lion ignores the problems of anaphora nd in- tersentential inference, which must be addressed by any general event extraction system.)
  AI- though these l)atterns could in principle be stated in terms of individual words, it is much 940 easier to state them in terms of larger SylltaC- tic constituents, uch as noun phrases and verb groups.
  Consequently, extraction ormally con- sists of an analysis of the l;e.xt in terms of general linguistic structures and dolnain-specifio con- struct
