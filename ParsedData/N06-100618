 reversed: adjuncts can safely be added, but not dropped.
    For example, in ID 59, the hypothesis aligns well with the text, but the addition of in Iraq indicates non-entailment.
    We identify the &#8220;root nodes&#8221; of the problem: the root node of the hypothesis graph and the corresponding aligned node in the text graph.
    Using dependency information, we identify whether adjuncts have been added or dropped.
    We then determine the polarity (negative context, positive context or restrictor of a universal quantifier) of the two root nodes to generate features accordingly.
    Antonymy features.
    Entailment problems might involve antonymy, as in ID 971.
    We check whether an aligned pairs of text/hypothesis words appear to be antonymous by consulting a pre-computed list of about 40,000 antonymous and other contrasting pairs derived from WordNet.
    For each antonymous pair, we generate one of three boolean features, indicating whether (i) the words appear in contexts of matching polarity, (
