  If not, we return the sense which is most frequent overall.
  When we consider more than one collocation type and com- bine evidence, the process is more complicated.
  The algo- rithm used is based on decision lists [Rivest, 1987], and was discussed in [Sproat, Hirschberg, and Yarowsky 1992].
  The goal is to base the decision on the single best piece of evi- dence available.
  Cross-validated probabilities are computed as in Section 4.2, and the different ypes of evidence are sorted by the absolute value of the log of these probabil- ?

  The sense with the greatest listed probability is returned, and this cross-validated probability represents he confidence in the answer.
  This approach is well-suited for the combi
