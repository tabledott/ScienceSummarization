s work with the same parsing and generation algorithms and produce standardized semantic representations derived from a rich, linguistically motivated syntax-semantics interface.
    More importantly, the grammar matrix will help to remove one of the primary remaining obstacles to commercial deployment of grammars of this type and indeed of the commercial use of deep linguistic analysis: the immense cost of developing the resource.
  
  
    Since the grammar matrix draws on prior research and existing grammars, it necessarily reflects contributions from many people.
    Rob Malouf, Jeff Smith, John Beavers, and Kathryn Campbell-Kibler have contributed to the LinGO ERG; Melanie Siegel is the original developer for the Japanese grammar.
    Tim Baldwin, Ann Copestake, Ivan Sag, Tom Wasow, and other members of the LinGO Laboratory at CSLI have had a great deal of influence on the design of the grammatical analyses and corresponding MRS representations.
