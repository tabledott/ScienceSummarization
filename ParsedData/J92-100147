ntersections between it and the names of other active clusters.
    (For purposes of cluster matching, the sense list for each word will include all the special and noncompositional senses activated during the previous stage of preprocessing, as well as any domain-specific senses that are not yet active.)
    For each intersection the preprocessor finds, it adds preferences for the senses that are supported by the cluster match.
    Then, the preprocessor activates any previously inactive senses it found to be supported by a cluster match.
    This triggering of senses on the basis of conceptual context forms the final step of the preprocessing phase.
    Once preprocessing is complete, the parsing phase begins.
    In this phase, TRUMP attempts to build syntactic structures, while calling on the semantic interpreter to build and rate alternative interpretations for each structure proposed.
    These semantic evaluations then guide the parser's evaluation of syntactic structures.
