lgorithm.
    The first difference is that in contrast to the exchange algorithm using a two sided class-based bigram model in its optimization criterion, only two clusters are affected by moving a word.
    Thus the algorithm scales linearly in the number of classes.
    The second difference is that B dominates the term B + N&#8222; for most corpora and scales far less than linearly with the vocabulary size, providing a significant performance advantage over the other optimization criterion, especially when large vocabularies are used (Whittaker and Woodland, 2001).
    For efficiency reasons, an exchange of a word between two clusters is separated into a remove and a move procedure.
    In each iteration the remove procedure only has to be called once for each word, while for a given word move is called once for every cluster to compute the consequences of the tentative exchanges.
    An outline of the move procedure is given below.
    The remove procedure is similar.
