rmal argument below.
  Case h We need to know the co?tents of A[i,j,k.m[, A[m,p,p,I] where m &lt; I, i &lt; m. when we are trying to compute the co?tents or Aii.j,k,l [.
  Since I is the y&amp;riable itererated i?
  the outermost loop (step 6), we can assume (by indnctio?
  hypothesis) that for all m &lt; I and for all p,q,r, the coate?ts of A[p,q,r,mJ are already computed.
  Hence, the contents of A[i,j,k,mJ are known.
  Similarly, for all m &gt; i, and for all p,q, and r &lt;_.
  l, A[m,p,q,rJ would have been computed.
  Thus, A[m,p,p,i I would also have bee?
  Case 2: By s similar ream?lag, the co?tents of A(i,m,m,pJ and A[p,j,k,l I are known since p &lt; I and p &gt; i.
  we are trying to camp?re the contents of some Aii,j,j,lJ, we need to know the nodes in A(i,j~i,pJ and A[p,q,q,l[.
  ,Note j &gt; i or j &lt; I. tlence, we know that the co?tents of A[i,j.i,pj and A(p,q,q,l] would have bee?
  compared already.
  Came 5: The co?tents of A[i,m,p,iJ and A(m,j,k,pJ must be k?own i ?
  order to compote A(i,j,k
