ngle predicate&#8211;argument dependencies.
    The feature sets described below differ for the dependency and normal-form models.
    The dependency model has features defined over the CCG predicate&#8211;argument dependencies, whereas the dependencies for the normal-form model are defined in terms of local rule instantiations in the derivation.
    Another difference is that the rule features for the normal-form model are taken from the gold-standard normal-form derivations, whereas the dependency model contains rule features from non-normal-form derivations.
    There are a number of features defined over derivations which are common to the dependency model and the normal-form model.5 First, there are features which represent each (word, lexical-category) pair in a derivation, and generalizations of these which represent (POS, lexical-category) pairs.
    Second, there are features representing the root category of a derivation, which we also extend with the head word of the root category; this latter feat
