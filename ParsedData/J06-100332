  ), 10 from the intermediate level (between 1 and 3), and 10 from the low level (0 to 1) of semantic similarity?, and then obtained similarity judgments from 38 sub- jects, given the same instructions as above, on those 30 pairs (see Table 2, columns 2 and 3).7 4.2 Method For each of our five implemented measures, we obtained similarity or relatedness scores for the human-rated pairs.
  Where either or both of the words had more than one synset in WordNet, we took the most-related pair of synsets.
  For the measures of Resnik, Jiang and Conrath, and Lin, this replicates and extends a study by each of the original authors of their own measure.
