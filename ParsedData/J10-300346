ally written translations of the same sentence, each by a different translator.
    There are very few corpora that provide such a large number of human translations.
    In recent years, most MT corpora have had no more than four references, which would certainly lead to much sparser word lattices and smaller numbers of paraphrases that can be extracted.
    In fact, given the cost and amount of effort required for humans to translate a relatively large corpus, it is common to encounter corpora with only a single human translation.
    With such a corpus, of course, this technique would be unable to produce any paraphrases.
    One solution might be to augment the relatively few human translations with translations obtained from automatic machine translation systems.
    In fact, the corpus used (Huang, Graff, and Doddington 2002) also contains, besides the 11 human translations, 6 translations of the same sentence by machine translation systems available on the Internet at the time.
    However, no experime
