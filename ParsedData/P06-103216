ntroduced error relates to sporadic substitution of the word their for determiners a/the.
    This is associated with three words, lunch, tea, and haste, and is the principal contributor to the lower percentages in the Correctly Left bin, as compared with Word.
    This overgeneralization error reflects our attempt to engineer the discontinuous mapping the X of them 4 their X, motivated by examples like the following, encountered in the CLEC dataset: In this equal world, lots of people are still concerned on the colors of them ...
    The inability of our translation system to handle such discontinuities in a unitary manner reflects the limited ability of current SMT modeling techniques to capture long-distance effects.
    Similar alternations are rife in bilingual data, e.g., ne...pas in French (Fox, 2002) and separable prefixes in German (Collins et al. 2005).
    As SMT models become more adept at modeling long-distance effects in a principled manner, monolingual proofing will benefit as well.
