roportion of the data.
    Table 10 shows results for the use of automatic clustering on constituents identified by the parser as noun phrases.
    As can be seen in the table, the vocabulary used for clustering includes almost all (97.9%) of the test data, and the decrease in accuracy from direct lexical statistics to clustered statistics is relatively small (from 87.0% to 79.7%).
    When combined with the full system described above, clustered statistics increase performance on NP constituents from 83.4% to 85.0% (statistically significant at p &lt; .05).
    Over the entire test set, this translates into an improvement from 80.4% to 81.2%.
    The automatic clustering described above can be seen as an imperfect method of deriving semantic classes from the vocabulary, and we might expect a hand-developed set of classes to do better.
    We tested this hypothesis using WordNet (Fellbaum 1998), a freely available semantic hierarchy.
    The basic technique, when presented with a head word for which no traini
