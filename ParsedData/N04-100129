for English), which made it difficult to train statistical models with large number of feature types.
    Future ACE evaluations will shed light on whether this lower performance, shown in Table 3, is due to lack of training data or to specific language-specific ambiguity.
    The final observation we want to make is that the systems were not directly optimized for the ACE value, and there is no obvious way to do so.
    As Table 3 shows, the F-measure and ACE value do not correlate well: systems trained to optimize the former might not end up optimizing the latter.
    It is an open research question whether a system can be directly optimized for the ACE value.
  
  
    This paper presents a language-independent framework for the entity detection and tracking task, which is shown to obtain top-tier performance on three radically different languages: Arabic, Chinese and English.
    The task is separated into two sub-tasks: a mention detection part, which is modeled through a named entity-like approach, and
