    A high correlation coefficient was obtained across the board, ranging from .720 to .847 for AltaVista counts and from .720 to .850 for Google counts.
    This indicates that Web counts approximate BNC counts for the three types of bigrams under investigation.
    Note that there is almost no difference between the correlations achieved using Google and AltaVista counts.
    It is important to check that these results are also valid for counts obtained from other corpora.
    We therefore correlated our Web counts with the counts obtained from NANTC, a corpus that is larger than the BNC but is drawn from a single genre, namely, news text (see Section 2.2).
    The results are shown in Table 9.
    We find that Google and AltaVista counts also correlate significantly with NANTC counts.
    The correlation coefficients range from .667 to .788 for AltaVista and from .662 to .787 for Google.
    Again, there is virtually no difference between the correlations for the two search engines.
    We also observe th
