 in a certain position is based on the sum of confidences from each system output having the word in that position.
    This requires aligning the system outputs to form a consensus network and &#8211; during decoding &#8211; simply finding the highest scoring path through this network.
    The alignment of speech recognition outputs is fairly straightforward due to the strict constraint in word order.
    However, machine translation outputs do not have this constraint as the word order may be different between the source and target languages.
    MT systems employ various re-ordering (distortion) models to take this into account.
    Three MT system combination methods are presented in this paper.
    They operate on the sentence, phrase and word level.
    The sentence-level combination is based on selecting the best hypothesis out of the merged N-best lists.
    This method does not generate new hypotheses &#8211; unlike the phrase and word-level methods.
    The phrase-level combination is based on extra
