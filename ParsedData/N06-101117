formance than using either of them alone (see Figure 3).
    We developed a linear discriminative transliteration model, and presented a method to automatically generate features.
    For time sequence matching, we used a scoring metric novel in this domain.
    As supported by our own experiments, this method outperforms other scoring metrics traditionally used (such as cosine (Salton and McGill, 1986)) when corpora are not well temporally aligned.
    In keeping with our objective to provide as little language knowledge as possible, we introduced a simplistic approach to identifying transliteration equivalence classes, which sometimes produced erroneous groupings (e.g. an equivalence class for NE lincoln in Russian included both lincoln and lincolnshire on Figure 6).
    This approach is specific to Russian morphology, and would have to be altered for other languages.
    For example, for Arabic, a small set of prefixes can be used to group most NE variants.
    We expect that language specific knowledge us
