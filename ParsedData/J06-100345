nclude the term log p(lso(c1, c2)), which is zero for the pairs in question.12 For instance, for the pair rooster?voyage (M&amp;C #29, R&amp;G #2), the synsets rooster and voyage have different ?unique beginners?, and hence their lso ?

  IS-A global root, 11 More generally, the inverse image of the second highest value for simLC is a proper subset of that for relHS, for the latter would also include all the antonym and meronym?holonym pairs.
  The two datasets at hand, however, do not contain any instances from these categories.
