refenstette (1994), and Lin (1998a), among others.
    To test if the use of links detracts from performance on attributional similarity tasks, we trained on our concatenated corpus two alternative models&#8212;Win and DV&#8212;whose features only include lexical collocates of the target.
    Win is an unstructured DSM that does not rely on syntactic structure to select the collocates, but just on their linear proximity to the targets (Lund and Burgess 1996; Sch&#168;utze 1997; Bullinaria and Levy 2007, and many others).
    Its matrix is based on co-occurrences of the same 30K words we used for the other models within a window of maximally five content words before or after the target.
    DV is an implementation of the Dependency Vectors approach of Pad&#180;o and Lapata (2007).
    It is a structured DSM, but dependency paths are used to pick collocates, without being part of the attributes.
    The DV model is obtained from the same co-occurrence data as DepDM (thus, relying on the dependency paths we pic
