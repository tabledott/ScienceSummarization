 [1999], with the difference that we collect counts over a four noun window, not a four word window, by dropping all intermediate words.
    Intuitively it is obvious that pairs of words that are similar in one language should have translations that are similar in the other language.
    For instance, Wednesday is similar to Thursday as Mittwoch is similar to Donnerstag.
    Or: dog is similar to cat in English, as Hund is similar to Katze in German.
    The challenge is now to come up with a quantifiable measurement of word similarity.
    One strategy is to define two words as similar if they occur in a similar context.
    Clearly, this is the case for Wednesday and Thursday, as well as for dog and cat.
    Exactly this similarity measurement is used in the work by Diab and Finch [2000].
    Their approach to constructing and comparing context vectors differs significantly from methods discussed in the previous section.
    For each word in the lexicon, the context vector consists of co-occurrence counts i
