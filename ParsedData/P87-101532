e similarity between these constrained systems, it is crucial to abstract away from the details of the structures and operations used by the system.
    The similarities become apparent when they are studied at the level of derivation structures: derivation nee sets of CFG's, HG's, TAG's, and MCTAG's are all local sets.
    Independence of paths at this level reflects context freeness of rewriting and suggests why they can be recognized efficiently.
    As suggested in Section 4.3.2, a derivation with independent paths can be divided into subcomputations with limited sharing of information.
    We outlined the definition of a family of constrained grammatical formalisms, called Linear Context-Free Rewriting Systems.
    This family represents an attempt to generalize the properties shared by CFG's, HG's, TAG's, and MCTAG's.
    Like HG's, TAG's, and MCTAG's, members of LCFRS can manipulate structures more complex than terminal strings and use composition operations that are more complex that concatenation.
