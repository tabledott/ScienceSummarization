produced for all target data, both training and test, so that features for the target parser could refer to them.
    In this task, we know what the gold-standard source language parses are for any given text, since we can produce them from the original Penn Treebank.
    We can thus measure the contribution of adaptation loss alone, and the combined loss of imperfect source-domain parsing with adaptation (Table 1).
    When no target domain trees are available, we simply have the performance of the source domain parser on this out-of-domain data.
    Training a target-domain parser on as few as 10 sentences shows substantial improvements in accuracy.
    In the &#8220;gold&#8221; conditions, where the target parser starts with perfect source trees, accuracy approaches 100%; in the realistic &#8220;parse&#8221; conditions, where the target-domain parser gets noisy source-domain parses, the improvements are quite significant but approach a lower ceiling imposed by the performance of the source parser.2 The ada
