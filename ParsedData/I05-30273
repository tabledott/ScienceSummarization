y of the character in the current, proceeding and subsequent positions.
			Specifically, we used four types of unigram feature functions, designated as C0 (current charac ter), C1 (next character), C-1 (previous character), C-2 (the character two characters back).
			Fur thermore, four types of bi-gram features were used, and are notationally designated here as conjunctions of the previously specified unigram features, C0C1, C-1C0, C-1C1, C-2C-1, and C2C0.
			Given that unknown words are normally more than one character long, when representing the morphological features as feature functions, such feature functions keyed off the morphological information extracted from both the proceeding state and the current state.
			Our morphological features are based upon the intuition re garding unknown word features given in Gao et al.
			(2004).
			Specifically, their idea was to use productive affixes and characters that only oc curred independently to predict boundaries of unknown words.
