 &lt;=~ Q; Q &lt;=~ Q.
  We will discuss in detail how four of these cases, i.e., the ones characterized in Fig- ure 10, are ruled out.
  Of the remaining, 2.1 and 3.4 correspond to the definitions of promotional and demotional divergences illustrated in Figures 9b and 9c, respectively; cases 1.3, 2.2, 2.4, 3.1, and 3.3 are ruled out for the same reasons that cases 1.1 and 1.2 are ruled out (as we will see shortly), namely, that an internal argument Z can never be associated with a logical modifier Q and that a syntactic adjunct (Q) can never be associated with a logical argument Z.
  It cannot be the case that a logical modifier maps to an internal argument position (case 1.1) because a logical modifier is an optional participant of a particular action, i.e., it need not be "governed" by the lexical item that it modifies.
  Internal argument positions are reserved for cases in which a government relation must hold; thus, logical modifiers must necessarily be mapped into syntactic adjunct positions.
