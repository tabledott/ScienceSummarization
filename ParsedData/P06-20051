-box&#8221; with little or minimal adaptation.
    One advantage of this pre-translation normalization is that the diversity in different user groups and domains can be modeled separately without accessing and adapting the language model of the MT system for each SMS application.
    Another advantage is that the normalization module can be easily utilized by other applications, such as SMS to voicemail and SMS-based information query.
    In this paper, we present a phrase-based statistical model for SMS text normalization.
    The normalization is visualized as a translation problem where messages in the SMS language are to be translated to normal English using a similar phrase-based statistical MT method (Koehn et al., 2003).
    We use IBM&#8217;s BLEU score (Papineni et al., 2002) to measure the performance of SMS text normalization.
    BLEU score computes the similarity between two sentences using n-gram statistics, which is widely-used in MT evaluation.
    A set of parallel SMS messages, consisting o
