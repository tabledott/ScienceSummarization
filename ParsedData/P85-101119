ed in detail iu [Abe and UIIman,1073 D, which uses ,, dynamic programming technique to parse CFLs.
  For the sake of making our description of the parsing algorithm simpler, we shall present he algorithm for parsing without considering local constraints.
  We will later show how to handle local constraints.
  We shall s.~ume that any node in the elementary trees in the grammar has atmos?
  Thm assumption c~m be made without any loss of generality, because it can be easily shown that for any TAG G there m an equivalent TAG G I such that amy node in amy elementary tree in G t has atmmt two children.
  A similar assumption is made in CYK algorithm.
  We use the terms ancestor rand descend~at, throughout the paper ms &amp; transitive and reflexive relation, for example, the foot node may be called the ancestor of the foot ands.
  The ~lgoritbm works am follows.
  Let st... % be the input to be posed.
  We use a fom~limeoaioaal rray A; each element of the srrny cont4uiu a subset of the nodes o( derived t rm.
