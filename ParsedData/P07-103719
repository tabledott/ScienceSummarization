line systems with two different-sized training sets: &#8216;Base-SMALL&#8217; (5 million words) and &#8216;Base-LARGE&#8217; (50 million words) as described above.
    Both systems use a trigram language model built using 250 million words from the English GigaWord Corpus.
    Table 1 presents the BLEU scores (Papineni et al., 2002) of both systems on the NIST 2005 MT Evaluation test set.
    We compared the translation quality of the baseline systems with the LTAG and CCG supertags systems (LTAG-SMALL and CCG-SMALL).
    The results are given in Table 2.
    All systems were trained on the same parallel data.
    The LTAG supertag-based system outperforms the baseline by 1.97 BLEU points absolute (or 4.9% relative), while the CCG supertagbased system scores 1.66 BLEU points over the baseline (4.1% relative).
    These significant improvements indicate that the rich information in supertags helps select better translation candidates.
    POS Tags vs. Supertags A supertag is a complex tag that localizes the de
