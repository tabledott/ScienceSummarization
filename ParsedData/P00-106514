ditioning event.
    For example, the distribution P(rlpt, t) was calculated sas follows: Some sample probabilities calculated from the training are shown in Table 3.
  
  
    Results for different methods of combining the probability distributions described in the previous section are shown in Table 4.
    The linear interpolation method simply averages the probabilities given by each of the distributions in Table 2: where Ei Ai = 1.
    The geometric mean, expressed in the log domain, is similar: where Z is a normalizing constant ensuring that Pr P(rlconstituent) = 1.
    The results shown in Table 4 reflect equal values of A for each distribution defined for the relevant conditioning event (but excluding distributions for which the conditioning event was not seen in the training data).

    The variable gf is only defined for noun phrases.
