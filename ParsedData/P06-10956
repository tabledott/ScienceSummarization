time complexity of the human TLINK annotation task is quadratic in the number of events and times in the document.
    Two corpora have been released based on TimeML: the TimeBank (Pustejovsky et al. 2003) (we use version 1.2.a) with 186 documents and 64,077 words of text, and the Opinion Corpus (www.timeml.org), with 73 documents and 38,709 words.
    The TimeBank was developed in the early stages of TimeML development, and was partitioned across five annotators with different levels of expertise.
    The Opinion Corpus was developed very recently, and was partitioned across just two highly trained annotators, and could therefore be expected to be less noisy.
    In our experiments, we merged the two datasets to produce a single corpus, called OTC.
    Table 1 shows the distribution of EVENTs and TIMES, and TLINK RelTypes3 in the OTC.
    The majority class percentages are shown in parentheses.
    It can be seen that BEFORE and SIMULTANEOUS together form a majority of event-ordering (Event-Event) links, whe
