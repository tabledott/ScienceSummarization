is to apply a statistical significance test to each estimated SO.
    There is a large statistical literature on the log-odds ratio, which might lead to improved results on this task.
    This paper has focused on unsupervised classification, but average semantic orientation could be supplemented by other features, in a supervised classification system.
    The other features could be based on the presence or absence of specific words, as is common in most text classification work.
    This could yield higher accuracies, but the intent here was to study this one feature in isolation, to simplify the analysis, before combining it with other features.
    Table 5 shows a high correlation between the average semantic orientation and the star rating of a review.
    I plan to experiment with ordinal classification of reviews in the five star rating system, using the algorithm of Frank and Hall (2001).
    For ordinal classification, the average semantic orientation would be supplemented with other features in a s
