  Exploiting Syntactic and Shallow Semantic Kernels for Question Answer Classification
  
    We study the impact of syntactic and shallow semantic information in automatic classification of questions and answers and answer re-ranking.
    We define (a) new tree structures based on shallow semantics encoded in Predicate Argument Structures (PASs) and (b) new kernel functions to exploit the representational power of such structures with Support Vector Machines.
    Our experiments suggest that syntactic information helps tasks such as question/answer classification and that shallow semantics gives remarkable contribution when a reliable set of PASs can be extracted, e.g. from answers.
  
  
    Question answering (QA) is as a form of information retrieval where one or more answers are returned to a question in natural language in the form of sentences or phrases.
    The typical QA system architecture consists of three phases: question processing, document retrieval and answer extraction (Kwok et al., 2001).
