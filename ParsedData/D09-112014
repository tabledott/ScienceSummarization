nts, and by propagation, also removes the NP headed by Gitano.
    This leaves the NP Wal-Mart as the closest compatible mention.
    Adding these syntactic constraints to our system yields 55.4 F1, a fairly substantial improvement, but many recall errors remain between mentions with differing heads.
    Resolving such cases will require external semantic information, which we will automatically acquire (see Section 3.2).
    Predicate Nominatives: Another syntactic constraint exploited in Poon and Domingos (2008) is the predicate nominative construction, where the object of a copular verb (forms of the verb be) is constrained to corefer with its subject (e.g.
    Microsoft is a company in Redmond).
    While much less frequent than appositive configurations (there are only 17 predicate nominatives in our devel9Arguably, we could also consider right modifying NPs (e.g., [Microsoft [Company]1]1) to be role appositive, but we do not do so here. opment set), predicate nominatives are another highly reliable core
