 &#8220;null&#8221; classifier, which never identifies a word as EDITED.
    Our basic measure of performance is the word misclassification rate (see Section 2.1).
    However, we also report precision and recall scores for EDITED words alone.
    All words are assigned one of the two possible labels, EDITED or not.
    However, in our evaluation we report the accuracy of only words other than punctuation and filled pauses.
    Our logic here is much the same as that in the statistical parsing community which ignores the location of punctuation for purposes of evaluation [3,5, 6] on the grounds that its placement is entirely conventional.
    The same can be said for filled pauses in the switchboard corpus.
    Our results are given in Table 2.
    They show that our classifier makes only approximately 1/3 of the misclassification errors made by the null classifier (0.022 vs. 0.059), and that using the POS tags produced by the bitag tagger does not have much effect on the classifier&#8217;s performance (e.g.,
