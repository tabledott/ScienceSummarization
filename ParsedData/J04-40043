c labeling of semantic roles and predicate-argument extraction (Gildea and Jurafsky 2000; Gildea and Palmer 2002), as well as that of other research efforts.
    Recently, in order to continue our work combining word sense with parsing (Bikel 2000) and the study of language-dependent and -independent parsing features (Bikel and Chiang 2000), we built a multilingual parsing engine that is capable of instantiating a wide variety of generative statistical parsing models (Bikel 2002).1 As an appropriate baseline model, we chose to instantiate the parameters of Collins&#8217; Model 2.
    This task proved more difficult than it initially appeared.
    Starting with Collins&#8217; (1999) thesis, we reproduced all the parameters described but did not achieve nearly the same high performance on the well-established development test set of Section 00 of the Penn Treebank.
    Together with Collins&#8217; thesis, this article contains all the information necessary to replicate Collins&#8217; parsing results.2 Specifica
