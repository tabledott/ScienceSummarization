v) and p(u, v). p(u, v) is the probability that u and v will be linked when they co-occur.
    There is never enough data to robustly estimate each p parameter separately.
    Instead, I shall model all the p's with just two parameters.
    For u and v that are mutual translations, p(u, v) will average to a relatively high probability, which I will call A. for u and v that are not mutual translations, p(u, v) will average to a relatively low probability, which I will call A. .
    A+ and Acorrespond to the two peaks of the distribution , which is illustrated in Figure 2.
    The two parameters can also be interpreted as the rates of true and false positives.
    If the translation in the bitext is consistent and the translation model is accurate, then A+ will be close to one and A- will be close to zero.
    To find the most likely values of the auxiliary parameters A+ and A-, I adopt the standard method of maximum likelihood estimation, and find the values that maximize the probability of the link frequency
