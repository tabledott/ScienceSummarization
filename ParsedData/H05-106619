r rect spanning trees are separated by a score at least as large as the number of incorrect incoming edges.This is because the scores for all the correct arcs can cel out, leaving only the scores for the errors causingthe difference in overall score.
			Since each single er ror results in a score increase of at least 1, the entirescore difference must be at least the number of er rors.
			For sequences, this form of factorization has been called local lattice preference (Crammer et al, 2004).
			Let n be the number of nodes in graph Gx.
			Then the number of constraints is O(n2), since for each node we must maintain n ? 1 constraints.The factored constraints are in general more re strictive than the original constraints, so they mayrule out the optimal solution to the original problem.
			McDonald et al (2005) examines briefly factored MIRA for projective English dependency pars ing, but for that application, k-best MIRA performs as well or better, and is much faster to train.
