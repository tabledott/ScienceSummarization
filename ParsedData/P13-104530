th parsers on two similar sentences and then analyze if the parsers correctly transferred the knowledge.
    The training sentences are He eats spaghetti with a fork. and She eats spaghetti with pork.
    The very similar test sentences are He eats spaghetti with a spoon. and He eats spaghetti with meat.
    Initially, both parsers incorrectly attach the PP to the verb in both test sentences.
    After training, the CVG parses both correctly, while the factored Stanford parser incorrectly attaches both PPs to spaghetti.
    The CVG&#8217;s ability to transfer the correct PP attachments is due to the semantic word vector similarity between the words in the sentences.
    Fig.
    4 shows the outputs of the two parsers. showing that head words dominate the composition.
    The model learns to not give determiners much importance.
    The two diagonals show clearly the two blocks that are multiplied with the left and right children, respectively.
