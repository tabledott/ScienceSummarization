cked parse results.
    As discussed in Section 6.1, Geman and Johnson (2002) proposed an algorithm for maximum entropy estimation for packed representations of LFG parses.
    Recent studies on CCG have proposed probabilistic models of dependency structures or predicate&#8211;argument dependencies, which are essentially the same as the predicate&#8211;argument structures described in the present article.
    Clark, Hockenmaier, and Steedman (2002) attempted the modeling of dependency structures, but the model was inconsistent because of the violation of the independence assumption.
    Hockenmaier (2003) proposed a consistent generative model of predicate&#8211;argument structures.
    The probability of a non-local dependency was conditioned on multiple words to preserve the consistency of the probability model; that is, probability p(Ilwant, dispute) in Section 4.3 was directly estimated.
    The problem was that such probabilities could not be estimated directly from the data due to data sparseness, and a
