 is classified: Each sentence receives one rhetorical category and also the label irrelevant or relevant.
    This strategy can create redundant material (e.g., when the same fact is expressed in a sentence in the introduction, a sentence in the conclusion, and one in the middle of the document).
    But this redundancy also helps mitigate one of the main problems with sentence-based gold standards, namely, the fact that there is no one single best extract for a document.
    In our annotation, all qualifying sentences in the document are identified and classified into the same group, which makes later comparisons with system performance fairer.
    Also, later steps cannot only find redundancy in the intermediate result and remove it, but also use the redundancy as an indication of importance.
    Example of manual annotation: Relevant sentences with rhetorical status.
    Figure 5 gives an example of the manual annotation.
    Relevant sentences of all rhetorical categories are shown.
