 over baseline of up 1.94 BLEU points: XP2, IP2, IP, VP=.PP+.AdvP=, AP2, PP+.AdvP=, and AdvP2.
    Of these, AdvP2 is also a significant improvement over the undifferentiated constituency feature (Chiang-05), with p &lt; .01.
    As we did for Chinese, we tested the best-performing models on a new test set, NIST MT08.
    Consistent patterns reappeared: improvements over the baseline up to 1.69 BLEU (p &lt; .01), with AdvP2 again in the lead (also outperforming the undifferentiated constituency feature, p &lt; .05).
    (p &lt; .05).
    **: Better than baseline (p &lt; .01).
    +: Better than Chiang-05 (p &lt; .05).
    ++: Better than Chiang-05 (p &lt; .01).
    -: Almost significantly better than Chiang-05 (p &lt; .075)
  
  
    The results in Section 4 demonstrate, to our knowledge for the first time, that significant and sometimes substantial gains over baseline can be obtained by incorporating soft syntactic constraints into Hiero&#8217;s translation model.
    Within language, we also see considerabl
