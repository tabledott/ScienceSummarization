tation is based on the PATR strategy for linking syntax and semantics.
			Most grammars written in PATR use the constituent graphs also for encoding semantic information.
			Every constituent has an attribute called trans or semantics.
			The value of this attribute contains minimally the internal semantic fnnction-argument structure of the constituent, but may also encode additional semantic information.
			The separate encoding of the semantics allows for a compositional semantics even in construction in which syntactic and semantic structure divert as in certain raising constructions.
			The following graph for a ficticious prenominal adjective that was introduced earlier contains translation attributes for the functor, the argument and the value.
			The meaning of the adjective is indicated by the atom Red.
