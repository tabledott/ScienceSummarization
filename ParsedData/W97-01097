ust determine how to select a sense of a word based on a context in which it appears.
  
  
    The hierarchy we chose for semantic matching is the semantic network of WordNet 1M190], [MI93].
    WordNet is a network of meanings connected by a variety of relations.
    WordNet presently contains approximately 95.000 different word forms organised into 70.100 word meanings, or sets of synonyms.
    It is divided into four categories (nouns, verbs, adjectives and adverbs), out of which we will be using only verbs and nouns.
    Nouns are organised as 11 topical hierarchies, where each root represents the most general concept for each topic.
    Verbs, which tend to be more polysemous and can change their meanings depending on the kind of the object they take, are formed into 15 groups and have altogether 337 possible roots.
    Verb hierarchies are more shallow than those of nouns, as nouns tend to be more easily organised by the is-a relation, while this is not always possible for verbs.
