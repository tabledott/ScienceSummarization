usted these two datasets such that the proportions of the different senses of each word were the same between BC and WSJ, accuracy improved by 9%.
    In this paper, we explore domain adaptation of WSD systems, by adding training examples from the new domain as additional training data to a WSD system.
    To reduce the effort required to adapt a WSD system to a new domain, we employ an active learning strategy (Lewis and Gale, 1994) to select examples to annotate from the new domain of interest.
    To our knowledge, our work is the first to use active learning for domain adaptation for WSD.
    A similar work is the recent research by Chen et al. (2006), where active learning was used successfully to reduce the annotation effort for WSD of 5 English verbs using coarse-grained evaluation.
    In that work, the authors only used active learning to reduce the annotation effort and did not deal with the porting of a WSD system to a new domain.
    Domain adaptation is necessary when the training and target doma
