ach, as probability distributions do not need to be recomputed as the list is constructed.
    Which approach is best?
    Using only the global proabilities does surprisingly well, and the results cited here are based on this readily replicatable procedure.
    The reason is grounded in the strong tendency of a word to exhibit only one sense or accent pattern per collocation (discussed in Step 6 and (Yarowsky, 1993)).
    Most classifications are based on a x vs. 0 distribution, and while the magnitude of the log-likelihood ratios may decrease in the residual, they rarely change sign.
    There are cases where this does happen and it appears that some interpolation helps, but for this problem the relatively small difference in performance does not seem to justify the greatly increased computational cost.
    Two kinds of optional pruning can also increase the efficiency of the decision lists.
    The first handles the problem of &amp;quot;redundancy by subsumption,&amp;quot; which is clearly visible in the e
