lass that generates the headword of a modifying nonterminal.
    Together, PM and PMw generate a fully lexicalized modifying nonterminal.
    The check marks indicate the inclusion of the headword wh and its part of speech th of the lexicalized head nonterminal H(th,wh) in the conditioning contexts of PM and PMw.
    See Table 4 for definitions of the remaining column headings. sults are shown in Table 8.
    Model Mtw,tw shows our baseline, and Model M&#966;,&#966; shows the effect of removing all dependence on the headword and its part of speech, with the other models illustrating varying degrees of removing elements from the two parameter classes&#8217; conditioning contexts.
    Notably, including the headword wh in or removing it from the PM contexts appears to have a significant effect on overall performance, as shown by moving from Model Mtw,t to Model Mt,t and from Model Mtw,&#966; to Model Mt,&#966;.
    This reinforces the notion that particular headwords have structural preferences, so that making
