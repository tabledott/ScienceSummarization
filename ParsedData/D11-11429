 Finally, Open IE is closely related to semantic role labeling (SRL) (Punyakanok et al., 2008; Toutanova et al., 2008) in that both tasks extract relations and arguments from sentences.
    However, SRL systems traditionally rely on syntactic parsers, which makes them susceptible to parser errors and substantially slower than Open IE systems such as REVERB.
    This difference is particularly important when operating on the Web corpus due to its size and heterogeneity.
    Finally, SRL requires hand-constructed semantic resources like Propbank and Framenet (Martha and Palmer, 2002; Baker et al., 1998) as input.
    In contrast, Open IE systems require no relation-specific training data.
    ReVerb, in particular, relies on its explicit lexical and syntactic constraints, which have no correlate in SRL systems.
    For a more detailed comparison of SRL and Open IE, see (Christensen et al., 2010).
  
  
    In this section we introduce two constraints on relation phrases: a syntactic constraint and a lexical con
