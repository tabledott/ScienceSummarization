for Models 1 and 2 (see Equation (82)), then this sum can be calculated explicitly: Equations (85)&#8212;(89) involve only 0(/m) arithmetic operations, whereas the sum over alignments involves 0(/m) operations. t(f e) translation probabilities n(cb e) fertility probabilities Po, pi fertility probabilities for eo d(jl id,m) distortion probabilities Here cA&#8226; = 0,1,2, &#8226; &#8226; .
    General Formulae. where In Equation (99), the product runs over all] = 1,2, ... , m except those for which a&#8226; 0.
    By summing over all pairs (r, ir) consistent with (f, a) we find The factors of 0,! in Equation (101) arise because there are ft=o cbi! equally probable terms in the sum (100).
    Parameter Reestimation Formulae.
    We can find the parameter values U that maximize the relative objective function R(PO, Po) by applying the considerations of Section B.2.
    The counts c(o.
    ); a, f, e) of Equation (58) are We obtain the parameter reestimation formulae for t(f I e), a(j I i,1, m), and t(q5 I e) by
