    For example, in (2) the metonymy is that the concept for ham sandwich is related to an aspect of another concept, for &amp;quot;the man who ate a ham sandwich.&amp;quot; Regarding how that conceptual information is related: in the case of metaphor, the met* method assigns a central role to finding an analogy, and an analogy between two terms is due to some underlying similarity between them (the ground), e.g., in the analogy that animals drinking potable liquids is like cars using gasoline, the underlying similarity is that both animals and cars ingest liquids.
    In an analogy, the relationship between aspects of two concepts is purely structural.
    In metonymies, however, the relationships are &amp;quot;knowledge-laden&amp;quot; connections, e.g., PART-WHOLE and CONTAINER-CONTENTS.
