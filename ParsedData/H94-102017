otation of non- contiguous tructure, a wide range of phenomena of the kind discussed above can be handled by simple notational devices that use co-indexing to indicate discontinuous tructures.
  Again, an index number added to the label of the original constituent is incorporated into the null element which shows where that constituent should be interpreted within the pred- icate argument structure.
  We use a variety of null elements to show show how non- adjacent constituents are related; we refer to such con- stituents as "pseudoattached.
  There axe four different ypes of pseudo-attach, as shown in Figure 1; the use of each will be explained below: The *IGH* pseudo-attach is used for simple extraposition, solving the most common case of "trapping": (S (NP-SBJ Chris) (VP knew (SBAR *ICH*-I) (NP-TSP yesterday) (SBAR- 1 that (S (NP-SBJ Terry) (VP would (VP catch (NP the ball))))))) Here, the clause that Terry would catch the ball is to be in- terpreted as an argument of knew.
