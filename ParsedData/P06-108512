 parameter determines the total probability of generating any novel word, a probability that decreases as more data is observed, but never disappears.
    Finally, the parameter P0 can be used to encode expectations about the nature of the lexicon, since it defines a probability distribution across different novel words.
    The fact that this distribution is defined separately from the distribution on word frequencies gives the model additional flexibility, since either distribution can be modified independently of the other.
    Since the goal of this paper is to investigate the role of context in word segmentation, we chose the simplest possible model for P0, i.e. a unigram phoneme distribution: where word w consists of the phonemes m1 ... mn, and p# is the probability of the word boundary #.
    For simplicity we used a uniform distribution over phonemes, and experimented with different fixed values of p#.1 A final detail of our model is the distribution on utterance lengths, which is geometric.
