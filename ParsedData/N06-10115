the same NE into an equivalence class, and collect their aggregate mention counts.
    We would then score time sequences of these equivalence classes.
    For instance, we would like to count the aggregate number of occurrences of Herzegovina, Hercegovina on the English side in order to map it accurately to the equivalence class of that NE&#8217;s variants we may see on the Russian side of our corpus (e.g.
    ).
    One of the objectives for this work was to use as little of the knowledge of both languages as possible.
    In order to effectively rely on the quality of time sequence scoring, we used a simple, knowledge poor approach to group NE variants for Russian.
    In the rest of the paper, whenever we refer to a Named Entity, we imply an NE equivalence class.
    Note that although we expect that better use of language specific knowledge would improve the results, it would defeat one of the goals of this work.
  
  
    There has been other work to automatically discover NE with minimal supervision.
