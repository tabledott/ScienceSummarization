difficult to compare the effectiveness of different clustering methods.
    In this paper, we hope to unify the problems of POS disambiguation and syntactic clustering by presenting results for conditions ranging from a full tag dictionary to no dictionary at all.
    We introduce the use of a new information-theoretic criterion, variation of information (Meil&#711;a, 2002), which can be used to compare a gold standard clustering to the clustering induced from a tagger&#8217;s output, regardless of the cluster labels.
    We also evaluate using tag accuracy when possible.
    Our system outperforms an HMM trained with MLE on both metrics in all circumstances tested, often by a wide margin.
    Its accuracy in some cases is close to that of Smith and Eisner&#8217;s (2005) discriminative model.
    Our results show that the Bayesian approach is particularly useful when learning is less constrained, either because less evidence is available (corpus size is small) or because the dictionary contains less informati
