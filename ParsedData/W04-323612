e additional features improved F-measure by an average of about 0.4%, and the post-processing step added on top of the use of all features further improved Fmeasure by 0.3% (i.e., for a cumulative total of 0.7% increase in F-measure).
  
  
    Now that we have successfully built a state-ofthe-art Chinese word segmenter, we are ready to explore issues of processing architecture and feature representation for Chinese POS tagging.
    An English POS tagger based on maximum entropy modeling was built by (Ratnaparkhi, 1996).
    As a first attempt, we investigated whether simply porting the method used by (Ratnaparkhi, 1996) for English POS tagging would work equally well for Chinese.
    Applying it in the context of Chinese POS tagging, Ratnaparkhi&#8217;s method assumes that words are pre-segmented, and it assigns POS tags on a word-by-word basis, making use of word features in the surrounding context.
    This gives rise to a one-at-a-time, word-based POS tagger.
    Note that in a one-at-a-time approach, the
