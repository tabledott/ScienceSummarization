ed by the algorithms described by Covington (2001) and recently explored for classifierbased parsing in Nivre (2007), instead uses open lists for partially processed tokens, which allows arbitrary dependency structures to be processed (in particular, structures with non-projective dependencies).
    We provide a detailed analysis of four different algorithms, two from each family, and give proofs of correctness and complexity for each algorithm.
    In addition, we perform an experimental evaluation of accuracy and efficiency for the four algorithms, combined with state-of-the-art classifiers, using data from 13 different languages.
    Although variants of these algorithms have been partially described in the literature before, this is the first comprehensive analysis and evaluation of the algorithms within a unified framework.
    The remainder of the article is structured as follows.
    Section 2 defines the task of dependency parsing and Section 3 presents a formal framework for the characterization of d
