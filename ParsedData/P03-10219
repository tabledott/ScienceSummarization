nificantly from that obtained with the unsmoothed error count.
    The above stated optimization criterion is not easy to handle:
  
  
    A standard algorithm for the optimization of the unsmoothed error count (Eq.
    5) is Powells algorithm combined with a grid-based line optimization method (Press et al., 2002).
    We start at a random point in the -dimensional parameter space and try to find a better scoring point in the parameter space by making a one-dimensional line minimization along the directions given by optimizing one parameter while keeping all other parameters fixed.
    To avoid finding a poor local optimum, we start from different initial parameter values.
    A major problem with the standard approach is the fact that grid-based line optimization is hard to adjust such that both good performance and efficient search are guaranteed.
    If a fine-grained grid is used then the algorithm is slow.
    If a large grid is used then the optimal solution might be missed.
    In the following, we d
