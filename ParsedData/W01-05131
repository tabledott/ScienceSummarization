    We have interest in inducing headwords for machine-readable dictionaries (MRDs), so our interest is in semantic rather than phonological non-compositionality.
    As an example of semantic non-compositionality, consider &#8220;compact disk&#8221;: one could not deduce that it was a music medium by only considering the semantics of &#8220;compact&#8221; and &#8220;disk.&#8221; MWUs may also be non-substitutable and/or non-modifiable (Manning and Sch&#252;tze, 1999).
    Nonsubstitutability implies that substituting a word of the MWU with its synonym should no longer convey the same original content: &#8220;compact disk&#8221; does not readily imply &#8220;densely-packed disk.&#8221; Nonmodifiability, on the other hand, suggests one cannot modify the MWU&#8217;s structure and still convey the same content: &#8220;compact disk&#8221; does not signify &#8220;disk that is compact.&#8221; MWU dictionary headwords generally satisfy at least one of these constrai
