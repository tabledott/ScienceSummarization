;) Manual subjectivity judgments were added to a total of 354 senses (64 words).
    One annotator, Judge 1 (a co-author), tagged all of them.
    A second annotator (Judge 2, who is not a co-author) tagged a subset for an agreement study, presented next.
    For the agreement study, Judges 1 and 2 independently annotated 32 words (138 senses).
    16 words have both S and O senses and 16 do not (according to Judge 1).
    Among the 16 that do not have both S and O senses, 8 have only S senses and 8 have only O senses.
    All of the subsets are balanced between nouns and verbs.
    Table 1 shows the contingency table for the two annotators&#8217; judgments on this data.
    In addition to S, O, and B, the annotation scheme also permits U(ncertain) tags.
    Overall agreement is 85.5%, with a Kappa (r.) value of 0.74.
    For 12.3% of the senses, at least one annotator&#8217;s tag is U.
    If we consider these cases to be borderline and exclude them from the study, percent agreement increases to 95% and r. r
