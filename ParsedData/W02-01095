sh; we therefore include an explicit set of nonrequirements, which the toolkit is not expected to satisfy.
    Ease of Use.
    The primary purpose of the toolkit is to allow students to concentrate on building natural language processing (NLP) systems.
    The more time students must spend learning to use the toolkit, the less useful it is.
    Consistency.
    The toolkit should use consistent data structures and interfaces.
    Extensibility.
    The toolkit should easily accommodate new components, whether those components replicate or extend the toolkit&#8217;s existing functionality.
    The toolkit should be structured in such a way that it is obvious where new extensions would fit into the toolkit&#8217;s infrastructure.
    Documentation.
    The toolkit, its data structures, and its implementation all need to be carefully and thoroughly documented.
    All nomenclature must be carefully chosen and consistently used.
    Simplicity.
    The toolkit should structure the complexities of building NLP sy
