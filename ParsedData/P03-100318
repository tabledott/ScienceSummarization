    The noisy channel framework we proposed in this paper can approximate the reasoning mechanism employed by LCC and accommodate the exploitation of gloss- and synonymy-based relations found in WordNet.
    In fact, if we had a very large training corpus, we would expect such connections to be learned automatically from the data.
    However, since we have a relatively small training corpus available, we rewrite the WordNet glosses into a dictionary by creating word-pair entries that establish connections between all Wordnet words and the content words in their glosses.
    For example, from the word &#8220;age&#8221; and its gloss &#8220;a historic period&#8221;, we create the dictionary entries &#8220;age - historic&#8221; and &#8220;age &#8211; period&#8221;.
    To exploit synonymy relations, for every WordNet synset Si, we add to our training data all possible combinations of synonym pairs Wi,x-Wi,y.
    Our dictionary creation procedure is a crude version of the axiom extraction algorithm descr
