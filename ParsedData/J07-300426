the buck is buck, not the.
    We also use this coindexation mechanism for lexical categories that project nonlocal dependencies.
    For instance, the category of the auxiliary, (S[dcl]\NP)/(S[ng]\NP), mediates a dependency between the subject (He) and the main verb (passing).
    Like all lexical categories of auxiliaries, modals and subject-raising verbs, the head of the subject NP is coindexed with the head of subject inside the VP argument: (S[dcl]\NPi)/(S[ng]\NPi).
    The set of categories that project such dependencies is not acquired automatically, but is given (as a list of category templates) to the algorithm which creates the actual dependency structures.
    A complete list of the lexical entries in sections 02&#8211;21 of the Treebank which use this coindexation mechanism to project nonlocal dependencies is given in the CCGbank manual (Hockenmaier and Steedman 2005).
    We believe that in practice this mechanism is largely correct, even though it is based on the (fundamentally flawed) assumptio
