 of the possible alignments flag blocks of ambiguous or idiomatic (or just difficult) phrase level alignments.
    These many-to-many alignments cannot be modelled with our many-to-one setup.
    However, a number of possibles flag oneto-one or many-to-one aligments: for this experiment we used these possibles in training to investigate their effect on recall.
    Using these additional alignments our refined precision decreased from 95.7 to 93.5, while recall increased from 89.2 to 92.4.
    This resulted in an overall decrease in AER to 6.99.
    We found no benefit from using many-tomany possible alignments as they added a significant amount of noise to the data.
    Previous work (Taskar et al., 2005) has demonstrated that by including the output of Model 4 as a feature, it is possible to achieve a significant decrease in AER.
    We trained Model 4 in both directions on the two language pairs.
    We added two indicator features (one for each direction) to our CRF which were active if a given word pair w
