mbow, 2005)) and probabilities are assigned to different analyses in accordance with the likelihood of their tags (e.g., &#8220;fmnh is 30% likely to be tagged NN and 70% likely to be tagged REL+VB&#8221;).
    Here we do not submit to this view.
    When a token fmnh is to be interpreted as the lexeme sequence f/REL mnh/VB, the analysis introduces two distinct entities, the relativizer f (&#8220;that&#8221;) and the verb mnh (&#8220;counted&#8221;), and not as the complex entity &#8220;that counted&#8221;.
    When the same token is to be interpreted as a single lexeme fmnh, it may function as a single adjective &#8220;fat&#8221;.
    There is no relation between these two interpretations other then the fact that their surface forms coincide, and we argue that the only reason to prefer one analysis over the other is compositional.
    A possible probabilistic model for assigning probabilities to complex analyses of a surface form may be and indeed recent sequential disambiguation models for Hebrew (Adler and
