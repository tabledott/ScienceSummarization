aw, and furthermore, for each sample he saw, there was a company he was a representative of.
    We can find the same problem of illegitimate readings in the standard account of the &amp;quot;Cooper storage&amp;quot; mechanism for generating quantifier scopings (Cooper 1983).
    Cooper's method generates an expression in intensional logic for the illegitimate readings, but the expression contains an unbound variable and a vacuous quantifier.'
    Finally, the observation follows merely syntactically from the ill-formedness of certain logical form expressions.
    Let us examine why this is so.
    The propositional content of a sentence can be seen as combining specifications that restrict the range of quantified entities, together with assertions about the entities so specified.
    This intuition is often made formal in the use of logical languages that syntactically separate the notion of the range of a quantified expression from its scope by placing the information about the range in a part of the expres
