			For quite a while now I have been using the excellent facilities of PATR for the design and testing of experimental\[ CUGs.
			Such grammars currently run on two PATR implementations: Stuart Shieber's Zetalisp version on the Symbolics 3600 and Lauri Karttunen's Interlisp-D w:rsion on the XEROX 1109.
			The work on CUGs has influenced our efforts to develop a larger PATR grammar, and will do so even more in the future.
			On the theoretical side, this work is part of ongoing research on such topics as word order variation, modification, and German syntax within projects at SRI and CSLI (Stanford University).
			The structure of the paper eflects the diverse nature of the enterprise.
			In the first section, I will introduce the basic notions of CUGs and demonstrate them through examples in PATR notation.
			The second section discusses the motivation for this work and some of its theoretical implications.
			The third section sketches a linguistically motivated CUG framework with a strong lexical syn
