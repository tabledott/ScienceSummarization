language input, as is commonly seen in natural language interface applications.
			For example, consider the sentences shown in figure 1, which were taken from the ATIS travel-planning domain (Dahl et al, 1994).
			Thesesentences exhibit characteristics which present significant challenges to the approach of ZC05.
			For ex 678 ample, the sentences have quite flexible word order, and include telegraphic language where some words are effectively omitted.
			In this paper we describe a learning algorithm that retains the advantages of using a detailed grammar, but is highly effective in dealing with phenomenaseen in spontaneous natural language, as exempli fied by the ATIS domain.
			A key idea is to extendthe approach of ZC05 by allowing additional nonstandard CCG combinators.
			These combinators relax certain parts of the grammar?for example al lowing flexible word order, or insertion of lexical items?with learned costs for the new operations.This approach has the advantage that it can be seam lessly integra
