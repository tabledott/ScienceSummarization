eyond the power of SCFGs.
    For example, the S(VO) structure in English is translated into a VSO word-order in Arabic, an instance of complex reordering not captured by any SCFG (Fig.
    2).
    To alleviate the non-isomorphism problem, (synchronous) grammars with richer expressive power have been proposed whose rules apply to larger fragments of the tree.
    For example, Shieber and Schabes (1990) introduce synchronous tree-adjoining grammar (STAG) and Eisner (2003) uses a synchronous tree-substitution grammar (STSG), which is a restricted version of STAG with no adjunctions.
    STSGs and STAGs generate more tree relations than SCFGs, e.g. the non-isomorphic tree pair in Fig.
    2.
    This extra expressive power lies in the extended domain of locality (EDL) (Joshi and Schabes, 1997), i.e., elementary structures beyond the scope of onelevel context-free productions.
    Besides being linguistically motivated, the need for EDL is also supported by empirical findings in MT that one-level rules are often
