 occurrences in the corpus, so many events are seen rarely or never, making their frequency counts unreliable estimates of their probabilities.
    Hindle (1990) proposed dealing with the sparseness problem by estimating the likelihood of unseen events from that of &amp;quot;similar&amp;quot; events that have been seen.
    For instance, one may estimate the likelihood of a particular direct object for a verb from the likelihoods of that direct object for similar verbs.
    This requires a reasonable definition of verb similarity and a similarity estimation method.
    In Hindle's proposal, words are similar if we have strong statistical evidence that they tend to participate in the same events.
    His notion of similarity seems to agree with our intuitions in many cases, but it is not clear how it can be used directly to construct word classes and corresponding models of association.
    Our research addresses some of the same questions and uses similar raw data, but we investigate how to factor word associ
