    No particular patterns were evident in this respect, perhaps because of the small size of the test data.
    There were nouns such as team (precision= 22) and cancer (8 ) that did better than average, but whether or not they did better than the first-sense heuristic depends of course on the sense in which they are used.
    For example, all 10 occurrences of cancer are in the first sense, so the first sense heuristic is impossible to beat in this case.
    For the test items that are not in their first sense, we beat the first-sense heuristic, but on the other hand, we failed to beat the random baseline.
    (The random baseline is 21.8% and we obtained 21.4% for these items overall.)
    Our performance on these items is low probably because they are lower-frequency senses for which there is less evidence in the untagged training corpus (the BNC).
    We believe that selectional preferences would perform best if they were acquired from similar training data to that for which disambiguation is r
