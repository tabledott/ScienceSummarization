s were selected.
    Here, we use a subset of the original training data; the details regarding this subset are given in Table 14.
    The Hansards corpus presents by far a more difficult task than the Verbmobil corpus in terms of vocabulary size and number of training sentences.
    The training and test sentences are less restrictive than for the Verbmobil task.
    For the translation experiments on the Hansards corpus, no word joining is carried out.
    Two target words can be produced by a single source word, as described in Section 3.9.2.
    4.3.2 Translation Results.
    As can be seen in Table 15 for the translation direction French to English and in Table 16 for the translation direction English to French, the word error rates are rather high compared to those for the Verbmobil task.
    The reason for the higher error rates is that, as noted in the previous section, the Hansards task is by far less restrictive than the Verbmobil task, and the vocabulary size is much larger.
    There is only a sli
