w how to combine the two types of systems into a hybrid that achieves higher precision than a traditional extractor, with comparable recall. tween the two approaches to parsing and argue that state-of-the-art parsing will benefit from employing both approaches in concert.
    In this paper, we examine the tradeoffs between relation-specific (&#8220;lexicalized&#8221;) extraction and relation-independent (&#8220;unlexicalized&#8221;) extraction and reach an analogous conclusion.
    Is it, in fact, possible to learn relation-independent extraction patterns?
    What do they look like?
    We first consider the task of open extraction, in which the goal is to extract relationships from text when their number is large and identity unknown.
    We then consider the targeted extraction task, in which the goal is to locate instances of a known relation.
    How does the precision and recall of Open IE compare with that of relation-specific extraction?
    Is it possible to combine Open IE with a &#8220;lexicalized&
