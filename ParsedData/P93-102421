    The preceding qualitative discussion provides some indication of what aspects of distributional relationships may be discovered by clustering.
    However, we also need to evaluate clustering more rigorously as a basis for models of distributional relationships.
    So, far, we have looked at two kinds of measurements of model quality: (i) relative entropy between held-out data and the asymmetric model, and (ii) performance on the task of deciding which of two verbs is more likely to take a given noun as direct object when the data relating one of the verbs to the noun has been withheld from the training data.
    The evaluation described below was performed on the largest data set we have worked with so far, extracted from 44 million words o
