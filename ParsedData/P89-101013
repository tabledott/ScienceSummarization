    In contrast, when 1(x,y)=-' 0, the pairs less interesting.
    (As a very rough rule of thumb, we have observed that pairs with 1(x,y)&gt; 3 tend to be interesting, and pairs with smaller f(x,y) are generally not.
    One can make this statement precise by calibrating the measure with subjective measures.
    Alternatively, one could make estimates of the variance and then make statements about confidence levels, e.g., with 95% confidence, P(x,y) &gt; P(x) P(y).)
    Some Interesting Associations with &amp;quot;Doctor&amp;quot; In the 1987 AP Corpus (N = 15 million) If 1(x ,y) &lt;&lt;0, we would predict that x and y are in complementary distribution.
    However, we are rarely able to observe 1(x,y)&lt;&lt;0 because our corpora are too small (and our measurement techniques are too crude).
    Suppose, for example, that both x and y appear about 10 times per million words of text.
    Then, P(x) P(y) 10-5 and chance is P(x)P(x) = 10i0.
    Thus, to say that /(x,y) is much less th
