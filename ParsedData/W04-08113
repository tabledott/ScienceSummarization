    For the second set of scores (&amp;quot;Without U&amp;quot;), we simply skipped every instance where the system did not provide a sense.
    Thus precision was not affected by those instances, but recall was lowered.
    Even though any given team may have intended their results to be interpreted one way or the other, we have included both sets of scores for comparative purposes.
    Table 1 shows the system performance under the first interpretation of the results (&amp;quot;With U&amp;quot;).
    The average precision and recall is 52.2%.
    Table 2 shows the system performance under the second interpretation of the results (&amp;quot;Without U&amp;quot;).
    The average precision is 57.4% and 51.9% is the average recall.
    Since comprehensive groupings of the WordNet senses do not yet exist, all results given are the result of fine-grained scoring.
    Although we did not compute a baseline score, we received several baseline figures from our participants.
