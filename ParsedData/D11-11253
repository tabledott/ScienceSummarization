f-the-art are false positives that only show improvement in a narrowly defined setting or with limited data, we validate our claims on both syntax and phrase-based systems, using multiple language pairs and large data sets.
    We describe tuning in abstract and somewhat formal terms in Section 2, describe the MERT algorithm in the context of those terms and illustrate its scalability issues via a synthetic experiment in Section 3, introduce our pairwise ranking optimization method in Section 4, present numerous large-scale MT experiments to validate our claims in Section 5, discuss some related work in Section 6, and conclude in Section 7.
  
  
    In Figure 1, we show an example candidate space, defined as a tuple (A, I, J, f, e, x) where: The example candidate space has two source sentences, three candidate translations for each source sentence, and feature vectors of dimension 2.
    It is an example of a finite candidate space, defined as a candidate space for which I is finite and J maps each index of
