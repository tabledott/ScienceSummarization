tricted corpus (laser patents) and small vocabulary (1000 words).
    Another group of researchers working in Lancaster around the same time, Leech, Garside and Atwell, also found ngram models highly effective; they report 96.7% success in automatically tagging the LOB Corpus, using a bigram model modified with heuristics to cope with more important trigrams.
    The present work developed independently from the LOB project.
    Many people who have not worked in computational linguistics have a strong intuition that lexical ambiguity is usually not much of a problem.
    It is commonly believed that most words have just one part of speech, and that the few exceptions such as &amp;quot;table&amp;quot; are easily disambiguated by context in most cases.
    In contrast, most experts in computational linguists have found lexical ambiguity to be a major issue; it is said that practically any content word can be used as a noun, verb or adjective,I and that local context is not always adequate to disambiguate.
