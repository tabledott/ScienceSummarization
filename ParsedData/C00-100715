ment, as described in Section 3, we employ the supertag-based tree model whose parameters consist of whether a lexeme l d with supertag Sd is zt dependent of Im with supertag sin.
  Fm- thermore we use the supertag in~brmation provided by the XTAG grammar to or- der the dependents.
  This model generates Thcrc was no cost est imate for  the second phase .

  As in the case of machine translation, evalu- ation in generation is a complex issue.
  We use two metrics suggested in the MT literature (A1- shawl et al., 1.998) based on string edit; distance t)etween the outtmt of the generation system and the reference corpus string front the WSJ.
  These metrics, simple accuracy and generation accuracy, allow us to evaluate without human intervention, automatically and objectively.
  4 Simple accuracy is the mnnber of insertion (I), deletion (D) and substitutions (S) errors between the target language strings in the test corpus and the strings
