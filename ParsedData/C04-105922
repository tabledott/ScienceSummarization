			Adding word order information to the queries obviously helps to reduce the noise in the retrieved data by selecting sentences, which are closer to the good translations, The best results using the adapted language models are NIST score 8.12 for using the 2000 most similar sentences, whereas Bleu score goes up to 0.2068 when using 4000 sentences for language model adaptation.
			4.5 Example.
			Table-3 shows translation examples for the 17th Chinese sentence in the test set.
			We applied the baseline system (Base), the bag-of-word query model (Hyp1), and the structured query model (Hyp2) using AFE corpus.
