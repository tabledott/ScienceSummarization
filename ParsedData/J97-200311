tput strings obtained after this application represent the result (T2 0 Ti) (s).
    In fact, instead of waiting for the result of the application of Ti to be completely given, one can gradually apply T2 to the output strings of Ti yet to be completed.
    This is the basic idea of the composition algorithm, which allows the transducer T2 0 Ti to be directly constructed given Ti and T2 We define sequential (resp. p-subsequential) functions to be those functions that can be represented by sequential (resp. p-subsequential) transducers.
    We noted previously that the result of the composition of two transducers is a transducer that can be directly constructed.
    There exists an efficient algorithm for the general case of the composition of transducers (transducers subsequential or not, having &amp;transitions or not, and with outputs in E*, or in E* U fool x R-F U fool) (Mohri, Pereira, and Riley 1996).
    The following theorem gives a more specific result for the case of subsequential and p-subsequential
