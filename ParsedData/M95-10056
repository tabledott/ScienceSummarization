ey Links: &lt;A-B B-C&gt; ?
  Response Links: &lt;A-C&gt; The key generates a single equivalence class S : (A B C}.
  The size of the class i s ISI=3, and the minimum number of links necessary to establish the class i s c(S) = (ISI ?
  The response partitions this class into a partition p(S) of size 2, containing {A C} an d { B }, where the latter element is implicitly defined .
  Working through the arithmetic, we have : R _ ISI ?
  2 This score of 1/2 is the intuitively "correct" one that the syntactic measure fails t o calculate .
  m(S ) c(S) (ISI ?
  (Ip(S)I -1) 47 Finally, we note that extending this measure from a single key equivalence class to a n entire test set T simply requires summing over the key equivalence classes .
  That is , E(ISiI ?
  Ip(Si)I ) SCORING PRECISION The recall scoring procedure operates by merging the subsets of a key equivalence clas s that are defined by equivalence classes in the response .
  It is of course the case that the response classes may not be proper subsets of th
