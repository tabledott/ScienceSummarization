luding the same text as above gives a revised mean accuracy for the correcting task of 3.4%, with the median unchanged.
  We obtained a further measure of the annotators accuracy by comparing their error rates to the rates at which the raw output of Churchs PARTS program--appropri- ately modified to conform to the Penn Treebank tagset--disagreed with the benchmark version.
  The mean disagreement rate between PARTS and the benchmark version was 319 Computational Linguistics Volume 19, Number 2 9.6%, while the corrected version had a mean disagreement rate of 5.4%, as noted above.
  The annotators were thus reducing the error rate by about 4.2%.
  Bracketing 4.1 Basic Methodology The methodology for bracketing the corpus is completely parallel to that for tagging-- hand correction of the output of an errorful automatic process.
  Fidditch, a deterministic parser developed by Donald Hindle first at the University of Pennsylvania nd sub- sequently at AT&amp;T Bell Labs (Hindle 1983, 1989), is used to provide an
