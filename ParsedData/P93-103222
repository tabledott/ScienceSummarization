    There are also some linguistic issues that remain.
    The most troublesome case for any English subcategorization learner is dealing with prepositional complements.
    As well as the issues discussed above, another question is how to represent the subcategorization frames of verbs that take a range of prepositional complements (but not all).
    For example, put can take virtually any locative or directional PP complement, while lean is more choosy (due to facts about the world): 17My system tries to learn many more subcategorization frames, most of which are more difficult to detect accurately than the ones considered in Brent's work, so overall figures are not comparable.
    The recall figures presented in Brent (1992) gave the rate of recall out of those verbs which generated at least one cue of a given subcategorization rather than out of all verbs that have that subcategorization (pp.
    1719), and are thus higher than the true recall rates from the corpus (obs
