rivable during composition.
    This issue is explicitly addressed in Briscoe et al. (1990) as well as Pustejovsky and Briscoe (1991).
  
  
    In this paper I have outlined a framework for lexical semantic research that I believe can be useful for both computational linguists and theoretical linguists alike.
    I argued against the view that word meanings are fixed and inflexible, where lexical ambiguity must be treated by multiple word entries in the lexicon.
    Rather, the lexicon can be seen as a generative system, where word senses are related by logical operations defined by the well-formedness rules of the semantics.
    In this view, much of the lexical ambiguity of verbs and prepositions is eliminated because the semantic load is spread more evenly throughout the lexicon to the other lexical categories.
    I described a language for structuring the semantic information carried by nouns and adjectives, termed Qualia structure, as well as the rules of composition that allow this information to be i
