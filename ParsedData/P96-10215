 the input language is Chinese and the task is to translate into English.
    The underlying generative model, shown in Figure 1, contains a stochastic English sentence generator whose output is &amp;quot;corrupted&amp;quot; by the translation channel to produce Chinese sentences.
    In the IBM system, the language model employs simple n-grams, while the translation model employs several sets of parameters as discussed below.
    Estimation of the parameters has been described elsewhere (Brown et al., 1993).
    Translation is performed in the reverse direction from generation, as usual for recognition under generative models.
    For each Chinese sentence e that is to be translated, the system must attempt to find the English sentence e* such that: In the IBM model, the search for the optimal e* is performed using a best-first heuristic &amp;quot;stack search&amp;quot; similar to A* methods.
    One of the primary obstacles to making the statistical translation approach practical is slow speed of translatio
