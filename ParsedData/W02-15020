  The Grammar Matrix: An Open-Source Starter-Kit For The Rapid Development Of Cross-Linguistically Consistent Broad-Coverage Precision Grammars
  
    The grammar matrix is an open-source starter-kit for the development of broad- By using a type hierarchy to represent cross-linguistic generalizations and providing compatibility with other open-source tools for grammar engineering, evaluation, parsing and generation, it facilitates not only quick start-up but also rapid growth towards the wide coverage necessary for robust natural language processing and the precision parses and semantic representations necessary for natural language understanding.
  
  
    The past decade has seen the development of wide-coverage implemented grammars representing deep linguistic analysis of several languages in several frameworks, including Head-Driven Phrase Structure Grammar (HPSG), LexicalFunctional Grammar (LFG), and Lexicalized Tree Adjoining Grammar (LTAG).
    In HPSG, the most extensive grammars are those of English
