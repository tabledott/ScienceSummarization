mbedded this process in a simple bootstrapping loop, which is presented in Figure 1.
    As input, the user must provide the name of the desired semantic class (Class) and a seed example (Seed), which are used to instantiate the pattern.
    On the first iteration, the pattern is given to Google as a web query, and new class members are extracted from the retrieved text snippets.
    We wanted the system to be as language-independent as possible, so we refrained from using any taggers or parsing tools.
    As a result, instances are extracted using only word boundaries and orthographic information.
    For proper name classes, we extract all capitalized words that immediately follow the pattern.
    For common noun classes, we extract just one word, if it is not capitalized.
    Examples are shown below, with the extracted items underlined: countries such as China and Sri Lanka are ... fishes such as trout and bass can ... One limitation is that our system cannot learn multi-word instances of common noun cate
