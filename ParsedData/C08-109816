e dropping the factor p(word) has no influence on the ranking of the different tag sequences.
			6In earlier experiments, we had used a much larger num ber of word classes.
			Decreasing their number to 4 turned out to be better.
			780 vided by the number of different POS tags is above a threshold of 1.
			More precisely, if T ? is the set of POS tags that occurred with suffix ?, |T | is the size of the set T , f ? is the frequency of suffix ?, and p ?
			(t) is the probability of POS tag t among the words with suffix ?, then the following condition must hold: f a?
			|T a?
			| ? t?T a?
			p a?
			(t) log p a?
			(t) p ?
			(t) &lt; 1 The POS probabilities are recursively smoothedwith the POS probabilities of shorter suffixes us ing Witten-Bell smoothing.
	
	
			Our tagger was first evaluated on data from theGerman Tiger treebank.
			The results were com pared to those obtained with the TnT tagger (Brants, 2000) and the SVMTool (Gim?enez andM`arquez, 2004), which is based on support vec tor machines.
