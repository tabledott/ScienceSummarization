 covers all source-language/target-language distinctions based on lexical-semantic properties.
  Other types of divergences and mismatches are outside of the scope of this paper; these include distinctions based on purely syntactic informa- tion, idiomatic usage, aspectual knowledge, discourse knowledge, domain knowledge, or world knowledge/ Although other translation approaches have attempted to account for divergences, the main innovation of the current approach is that it provides a formalization of these divergences and the techniques by which they are resolved.
  This is advantageous from a computational point of view in that it facilitates the design and implementation of ?
