lustrate the data with a set of confusion matrices, in Tables 14 and 15, which show the pattern of errors according to class label for each set of features.
    In each confusion matrix, the rows indicate the actual class of incorrectly classified verbs, and the columns indicate the assigned class.
    For example, the first row of the first panel of Table 14 shows that one unergative was incorrectly labelled as unaccusative, and two unergatives as object-drop.
    To determine the confusability of any two classes (the 9 The third error in classification of unergatives is the verb floated, which we conjecture is due not to counting errors, but to the linguistic properties of the verb itself.
    The verb is unusual for a manner-of-motion verb in that the action is inherently &amp;quot;uncontrolled&amp;quot;, and thus the subject of the intransitive/object of the transitive is a more passive entity than with the other unergatives (perhaps indicating that the inventory of thematic roles should be refined to dis
