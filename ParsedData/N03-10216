    A production rule that appears in an inference rule stands for the proposition that the production is in the grammar.
    Such specifications are nondeterministic: they do not indicate the order in which a parser should attempt inferences.
    A deterministic parsing strategy can always be chosen later, to suit the application.
    Any reasonable parsing strategy will have the same asymptotic complexity (McAllester, 2002).
    3.1 Naive Synchronous Bilexical Parsers For expository purposes, we begin with Parser R2D2A, which is a naive CKY-style parser for The chart of suitable set of monolingual parsers can also infer the syntactic structure of each component, but cannot infer the correspondence relation between these structures. use both Horn clauses and sequents to save space.
    R2D2A can be compared to Wu (1997)'s procedure for parsing non-lexicalized ITGs, which runs in &#8212;1 22 j1 j1 j2 X7.
