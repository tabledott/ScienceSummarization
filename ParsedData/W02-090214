 not necessarily the translation of the most frequent English word, it should also be very frequent.
    Table 4 illustrates the situation with our corpora.
    It contains the top 10 German and English words, together with the frequency ranks of their best translations.
    For both languages, 4 of the 10 words have translations that also rank in the top 10.
    Clearly, simply aligning the nth frequent German word with the nth frequent English word is not a viable strategy.
    In our case, this is additionally hampered by the different orientation of the news sources.
    The frequent financial terms in the English WSJ corpus (stock, bank, sales, etc.) are rather rare in the German corpus.
    For most words, especially for more comparable corpora, there is a considerable correlation between the frequency of a word and its translation.
    Our frequency measurement is defined as ratio of the word frequencies, normalized by the corpus sizes.
