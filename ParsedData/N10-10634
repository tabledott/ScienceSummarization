    In Section 4, we compare our approach with previous methods on datasets derived from Wikipedia for three language pairs (Spanish-English, German-English, and Bulgarian-English), and show improvements in downstream SMT performance by adding the parallel data we extracted.
    2 Wikipedia as a Comparable Corpus Wikipedia (Wikipedia, 2004) is an online collaborative encyclopedia available in a wide variety of languages.
    While the English Wikipedia is the largest, with over 3 million articles, there are 24 language editions with at least 100,000 articles.
    Articles on the same topic in different languages are also connected via &#8220;interwiki&#8221; links, which are annotated by users.
    This is an extremely valuable resource when extracting parallel sentences, as the document alignment is already provided.
    Table 1 shows how many of these &#8220;interwiki&#8221; links are present between the English Wikipedia and the 16 largest non-English Wikipedias.
