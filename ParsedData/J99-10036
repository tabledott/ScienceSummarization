oken is assigned the position of its median character.
    Each bitext space contains a number of true points of correspondence (TPCs), other than the origin and the terminus.
    TPCs exist both at the coordinates of matching text units and at the coordinates of matching text unit boundaries.
    If a token at position p on the x-axis and a token at position q on the y-axis are translations of each other, then the coordinate (p, q) in the bitext space is a TPC.
    If a sentence on the x-axis ends at character r and the corresponding sentence on the y-axis ends at character s, then the coordinate (r + .5, s + .5) is a TPC.
    The .5 is added because it is the inter-sentence boundaries that correspond, rather than the last characters of the sentences.
    Similarly, TPCs arise from corresponding boundaries between paragraphs, chapters, list items, etc.
    Groups of TPCs with a roughly linear arrangement in the bitext space are called chains.
    Bitext maps are injective (1-to-1) partial functions in bitext
