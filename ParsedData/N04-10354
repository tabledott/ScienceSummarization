f such rules automatically through corpus analysis.
    The search for these rules is driven exactly by the problems raised by Fox (2002) &#8211; cases of crossing and divergence motivate the algorithms to come up with better explanations of the data and better rules.
    Section 2 of this paper describes algorithms for the acquisition of complex rules for a transformation model.
    Section 3 gives empirical results on the explanatory power of the acquired rules versus previous models.
    Section 4 presents examples of learned rules and shows the various types of transformations (lexical and nonlexical, contiguous and noncontiguous, simple and complex) that the algorithms are forced (by the data) to invent.
    Section 5 concludes.
    Due to space constraints, all proofs are omitted.
  
  
    Suppose that we have a French sentence, its translation into English, and a parse tree over the English translation, as shown in Figure 1.
    Generally one defines an alignment as a relation between the words in the
