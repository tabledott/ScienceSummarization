andard) of extracted adjectives using 1, 20, and 100 positive and negative adjective pairs as seeds. recall and precision of extracted adjectives by using randomly selected seed sets of 1, 20, and 100 pairs of positive and negative adjectives from the list of (Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown, 1997).
    Both recall and precision increase as the seed set becomes larger.
    We obtained similar results with the ANEW list of adjectives (Section 7).
    As an additional experiment, we tested the effect of ignoring sentences with negative particles, obtaining a small increase in precision and recall.
    We subsequently used the automatically extracted polarity score for each word to assign an aggregate gold standards A and B for different sets of parts-ofspeech. polarity to opinion sentences.
    Table 5 lists the accuracy of our sentence-level tagging process.
    We experimented with different combinations of part-ofspeech classes for calculating the aggregate polarity scores, and found that the combined evidence
