ntities from the entities that are not related to any events.
    This task does not involve grouping entities associated with the same event into a single template to avoid possible effect of merging failure on extraction performance for entities.
    We accumulated the test set of documents of two scenarios; the Management Succession scenario of (MUC-6, 1995), with a simpler template structure, where corporate managers assumed and/or left their posts, and the Murderer Arrest scenario, where a law enforcement organization arrested a murder suspect.
    The source document set from which the extraction patterns are learned consists of 117,109 Mainichi Newspaper articles from 1995.
    All the sentences are morphologically analyzed by JUMAN (Kurohashi, 1997) and converted into dependency trees by KNP (Kurohashi and Nagao, 1994).
    Regardless of the model of extraction patterns, the pattern acquisition follows the procedure described in Section 3.
    We retrieved 300 documents as a relevant document set.
