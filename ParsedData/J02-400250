ticles follows certain patterns (Swales 1990).
    For example, limitations of the author&#8217;s own method can be expected to be found toward the end of the article, whereas limitations of other researchers&#8217; work are often discussed in the introduction.
    We observed that the size of rhetorical zones depends on location, with smaller rhetorical zones occurring toward the beginning and the end of the article.
    We model this by assigning location values in the following fashion: The article is divided into 20 equal parts, counting sentences.
    Sentences occurring in parts 1, 2, 3, 4, 19, and 20 receive the values A, B, C, D, I, and J, respectively.
    Parts 5 and 6 are pooled, and sentences occurring in them are given the value E; the same procedure is applied to parts 15 and 16 (value G) and 17 and 18 (value H).
    The remaining sentences in the middle (parts 7&#8211;14) all receive the value F (cf.
    Figure 10).
