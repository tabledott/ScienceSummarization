ated iterative, unsupervised methods, the output of the system is a stream of patterns, in which the quality is high initially, but then gradually degrades.
    This degradation is inherent in the trade-off, or tension, in the scoring metrics: between trying to achieve higher recall vs. higher precision.
    Thus, when the learning algorithm is applied against a reference corpus, the result is a ranked list of patterns, and going down the list produces a curve which trades off precision for recall.
    Simply put, the unsupervised algorithm does not know when to stop learning.
    In the absence of a good stopping criterion, the resulting list of patterns must be manually reviewed by a human; otherwise one can set ad-hoc thresholds, e.g., on the number of allowed iterations, as in (Riloff and Jones, 1999), or else to resort to supervised training to determine such thresholds&#8212;which is unsatisfactory when our 'As described in, e.g., (Riloff, 1996; Riloff and Jones, 1999; Yangarber et al., 2000). goal from
