The function subst(x,y,expr) substitutes x for all occurrences of y in expr.
    The unary function predicate(wff) returns the main predicate in a wff.
    The unary function arguments(wff) returns a list of the arguments in a wff.
    Applied to two arguments, wff is a binary function that takes a predicate name and a list of arguments, and returns the wff consisting of the application of the predicate to the arguments.
    Applied to four arguments, wff is a quaternary function that takes a quantifier name, a variable name, a restriction, and a body, and returns the quantified wff consisting of the binding of the variable by the quantifier in the restriction and body.
    The binary predicate opaque(predicate, n) returns true if and only if the predicate is opaque in its nth argument.
    It is naturally assumed that opaque argument positions are filled by wff expressions, not terms.
    Each of the unary predicates wff?, term?, and quantifier? returns true if and only if its argument is a wff, a complex te
