    We paired each source sentence with each of its 5 translations, for a total of 250 pairs of Chinese source and English translations.
    We prepared a web page with these translation pairs randomly ordered to disperse the five translations of each source sentence.
    All judges used this same webpage and saw the sentence pairs in the same order.

    The monolingual group made their judgments based only on the translations&#8217; readability and fluency.
