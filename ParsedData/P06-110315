ch iteration, we used the current transliteration model to find a list of 30 best transliteration equivalence classes for each NE.
    We then computed time sequence similarity score between NE and each class from its list to find the one with the best matching time sequence.
    If its similarity score surpassed a set threshold, it was added to the list of positive examples for the next round of training.
    Positive examples were constructed by pairing an NE with the common stem of its transliteration equivalence class.
    We used the same number of positive and negative examples.
    We used the Mueller English-Russian dictionary to obtain translations in our multi-word NE experiments.
    We only considered the first dictionary definition as a candidate.
    For evaluation, random 727 of the total of 978 NEs were matched to correct transliterations by a language expert (partly due to the fact that some of the English NEs were not mentioned in the Russian side of the corpus).
    Accuracy was computed as
