  For the sake of simplicity: Unsupervised extraction of lexical simplifications from Wikipedia
  
    We report on work in progress on extractlexical simplifications (e.g., focusing on utilizing edit histories in Simple English Wikipedia for this task.
    We consider two main approaches: (1) deriving simplification probabilities via an edit model that accounts for a mixture of different operations, and (2) using metadata to focus on edits that are more likely to be simplification operations.
    We find our methods to outperform a reasonable baseline and yield many high-quality lexical simplifications not included in an independently-created manually prepared list.
