    's system in [Sekine98] and SRA's system in [Bennett+97]).
    Besides, a variant of Eric Brill's transformation-based rules [Brill95] has been applied to the problem [Aberdeen+95].
    Among these approaches, the evaluation performance of HMM is higher than those of others.
    The main reason may be due to its better ability of capturing the locality of phenomena, which indicates names in text.
    Moreover, HMM seems more and more used in NE recognition because of the efficiency of the Viterbi algorithm [Viterbi67] used in decoding the NE-class state sequence.
    However, the performance of a machine-learning system is always poorer than that of a rule-based one by about 2% [Chinchor95b] [Chinchor98b].
    This may be because current machine-learning approaches capture important evidence behind NER problem much less effectively than human experts who handcraft the rules, although machine-learning approaches always provide important statistical information that is not availa
