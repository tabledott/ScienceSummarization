    Table 5 lists the results of the transfer experiments for dependency parsing.
    The baseline results are comparable to those in McDonald et al. (2011) and thus also significantly outperform the results of recent unsupervised approaches (Berg-Kirkpatrick and Klein, 2010; Naseem et al., 2010).
    Importantly, crosslingual cluster features are helpful across the board and give a relative error reduction ranging from 3% for DA to 13% for PT, with an average reduction of 6%, in terms of unlabeled attachment score (UAS).
    This shows the utility of cross-lingual cluster features for syntactic transfer.
    However, X-LINGUAL CLUSTERS provides roughly the same performance as PROJECTED CLUSTERS suggesting that even simple methods of cross-lingual clustering are sufficient for direct transfer dependency parsing.
    We would like to stress that these results are likely to be under-estimating the parsers&#8217; actual ability to predict Stanford-style dependencies in the target lang
