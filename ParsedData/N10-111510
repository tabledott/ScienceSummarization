 series of smaller steps, each pushing w&#65533; away from invalid attachments and toward valid ones.
    This way we integrate the search of confident attachments into the learning process.
  
  
    The function isValid(act(i), gold, arcs) (line 4) is used to decide if the chosen action/location pair is valid.
    It returns True if two conditions apply: (a) (pi, pj) is present in gold, (b) all edges (&#10065;, pj) in gold are also in arcs.
    In words, the function verifies that the proposed edge is indeed present in the gold parse and that the suggested daughter already found all its own daughters.2
  
  
    The feature representation for an action can take into account the original sentence, as well as the entire parse history: Oact(i) above is actually O(act(i), sentence, Arcs, pending).
    We use binary valued features, and each feature is conjoined with the type of action.
    When designing the feature representation, we keep in mind that our features should not only direct the parser toward desir
