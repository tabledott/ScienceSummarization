ing to the new law. noun (14b) The daily sales were ready for the accountant to total with products near profits organized according to the new law. verb The analysis of these sentences makes use of the additivity property of linear systems.
    That is, each case, (14a) and (14b), is treated separately, and then the results are added together.
    Assuming &amp;quot;total&amp;quot; is a noun, there are three prepositional phrases contributing Cat3 bracketings, and assuming it is a verb, there are two prepositional phrases for Cat2 ambiguities.
    Combining the two cases produces Cat3 + Cat2 = 5 + 2 = 7 parses.
    Adding another prepositional phrase yields Cat4 + Cat3 = 14 + 5 = 19 parses.
    (EOSP behaved as predicted in both cases.)
    This behavior is generalized by the following power series: This observation can be incorporated into the table lookup pseudo-parser outlined above.
    Recall that Cat, is interpreted as the ith index in a table containing all binary trees dominating i leaves.
