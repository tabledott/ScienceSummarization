  Structured Models for Fine-to-Coarse Sentiment Analysis
  
    In this paper we investigate a structured model for jointly classifying the sentiment of text at varying levels of granularity.
    Inference in the model is based on standard sequence classification techniques using constrained Viterbi to ensure consistent solutions.
    The primary advantage of such a model is that it allows classification decisions from one level in the text to influence decisions at another.
    Experiments show that this method can significantly reduce classification error relative to models trained in isolation.
  
  
    Extracting sentiment from text is a challenging problem with applications throughout Natural Language Processing and Information Retrieval.
    Previous work on sentiment analysis has covered a wide range of tasks, including polarity classification (Pang et al., 2002; Turney, 2002), opinion extraction (Pang and Lee, 2004), and opinion source assignment (Choi et al., 2005; Choi et al., 2006).
