d we propose some others in the next section.
    We should mention that we have not yet experimented with all-vs.-all (AVA), another standard binary-tomulti-category classifier conversion method, because we wished to focus on the effect of omitting pairwise information.
    In independent work on 3-category rating inference for a different corpus, Koppel and Schler (2005) found that regression outperformed AVA, and Rifkin and Klautau (2004) argue that in principle OVA should do just as well as AVA.
    But we plan to try it out.
  
  
    In this paper, we addressed the rating-inference problem, showing the utility of employing label similarity and (appropriate choice of) item similarity &#8212; either implicitly, through regression, or explicitly and often more effectively, through metric labeling.
    In the future, we would like to apply our methods to other scale-based classification problems, and explore alternative methods.
    Clearly, varying the kernel in SVM regression might yield better results.
