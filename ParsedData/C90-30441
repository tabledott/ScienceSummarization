r example-based translation is becoming the new wave of machine translation.
  The ba.- sic idea.
  of example~based translation is very simple: translate a source sentence by imitat- ing the translation example of a similar sen- tence in the database.
  The idea first appeared in [Nagao 84], and some research has followed it [Sumita 88][Sato 89][Sadler 89a.
  But a great deal of effort is still needed to im- plemenl the idea.
  In our previous work, we show how to select.
  the best target word in case-frame translation based on examples[Sato 89].
  In this paper, we concentrate on two problems: 1. ltow to combine some fragments of trans- lation examph~s in order to translate one sentence?
  2. tlow to select tile best tra.nslation out of inany candidates?
  We show partial solutions for them in MBT2.
  MBT2 is the second prototype system in our Memory-based Translation Project.. MBT2 ca.n do bi-directional m~nslation between an English word-dependency tree and a Japanese word- dependency tree.
  It is imple
