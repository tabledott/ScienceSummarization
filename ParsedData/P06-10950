  Machine Learning Of Temporal Relations
  
    This paper investigates a machine learning approach for temporally ordering and anchoring events in natural language texts.
    To address data sparseness, we used temporal reasoning as an oversampling method to dramatically expand the amount of training data, resulting in predictive accuracy on link labeling as high as 93% using a Maximum Entropy classifier on human annotated data.
    This method compared favorably against a series of increasingly sophisticated baselines involving expansion of rules derived from human intuitions.
  
  
    The growing interest in practical NLP applications such as question-answering and text summarization places increasing demands on the processing of temporal information.
    In multidocument summarization of news articles, it can be useful to know the relative order of events so as to merge and present information from multiple news sources correctly.
    In questionanswering, one would like to be able to ask when an event
