ey are only returned by the morphological analyzer when they are marked overtly in orthography, but they are not disambiguated in case they are not overtly marked.
    The features are indefiniteness (presence of nunation), idafa (possessed), case, and mood.
    First, for each of the 14 morphological features and for each possible value (including &#8216;NA&#8217; if applicable), we define a binary machine learning feature which states whether in any morphological analysis for that word, the feature has that value.
    This gives us 58 machine learning features per word.
    In addition, we define a second set of features which abstracts over the first set: for all features, we state whether any morphological analysis for that word has a value other than &#8216;NA&#8217;.
    This yields a further 11 machine learning features (as 3 morphological features never have the value &#8216;NA&#8217;).
    In addition, we use the untokenized word form and a binary feature stating whether there is an analysis or not.
