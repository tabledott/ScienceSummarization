o significant at 1% based on a one-sided proportional test.
    Thus, SntScore is more reliable than SIM.
    This high precision in SntScore indicates that it is important to take the similarities of article alignments into account when estimating the validity of sentence alignments.
  
  
    Much work has been done on article alignment.
    Collier et al. (1998) compared the use of machine translation (MT) with the use of bilingual dictionary term lookup (DTL) for news article alignment in Japanese and English.
    They revealed that DTL is superior to MT at high-recall levels.
    That is, if we want to obtain many article alignments, then DTL is more appropriate than MT.
    In a preliminary experiment, we also compared MT and DTL for the data in Table 1 and found that DTL was superior to MT.11 These 11We translated the English articles into Japanese with an MT system.
    We then used the translated English articles as queries and searched the database consisting of Japanese articles.
