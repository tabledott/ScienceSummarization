ore than 2 non terminals on the right-hand side are split into binaryrules by applying a transformation algorithm pro posed by Andreas Eisele1.
			It is a greedy algorithm which tries to minimise the number of binarised rules by combining frequently cooccurring symbols first.
			The algorithm consists of the following twosteps which are iterated until all rules are either bi nary or unary.
