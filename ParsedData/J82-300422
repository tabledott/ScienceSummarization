lar, the difference between prepositional phrases and conjunction could be accounted for by modifying the interpretation of the PP category label, so that the trees would be interpreted correctly even though they are not exactly correct.
    8 The table lookup scheme ought to have a way to handle the theoretical possibility that there are an unlimited number of prepositional phrases.
    The table lookup routine will employ a more traditional parsing algorithm (e.g., Earley's algorithm) when the number of phrases in the input sentence is not stored in the table.
    The table lookup approach works for primitive grammars.
    The next two sections show how to decompose composite grammars into series and parallel combinations of primitive grammars.
