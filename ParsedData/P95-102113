at dominates the substituted comto is possible for components above the substituted node to drift arbitrarily far up the d-tree and distribute themselves within domination edges, or above the root, in any way that is compatible with the domination relationships present in the d-tree. a mechanism called constraints control what can appear within d-edges (see below).
    The second composition operation involving dtrees is called sister-adjunction.
    When a d-tree a is at a node ri in a d-tree the comd-tree from the addition to fl of a as a new leftmost or rightmost sub-d-tree below that sister-adjunction involves the addition of exactly one new immediate domination edge and that several sister-adjunctions can occur at the same constraints where d-trees can be sister-adjoined and whether they will be rightor left-sister-adjoined (see below).
