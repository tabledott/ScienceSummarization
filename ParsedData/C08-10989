y the trees for mascu line and feminine) consist of a single terminal node in the two subsets.
			The weight of each subset is proportional to its size.
			2We did not directly compare the two alternatives (two valued vs. multi-valued tests), because the implementational effort required would have been too large.
			which returns a probability of 0.3.
			The third tree for neuter has one non-terminal and two terminalnodes returning a probability of 0.3 and 0.5, re spectively.
			The sum of probabilities is therefore either 0.9 or 1.1, but never exactly 1.
			This problem is solved by renormalizing the probabilities.
			The probability of an attribute (such as ?Nom?)
			is always conditioned on the respective base POS (such as ?N?)
			(unless the predicted attribute is thebase POS) in order to make sure that the probabil ity of an attribute is 0 if it never appeared with the respective base POS.
			All context attributes other than the base POS are always used in combination with the base POS.
			A typical con
