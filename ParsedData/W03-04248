early the additional features have a significant impact on both precision and recall scores across all entities.
    We have found that the word type features are particularly useful, as is the memory feature.
    The performance of the final system drops by 1.97% if these features are removed.
    The performance of the system if the gazetteer features are removed is given in Table 4.
    The sizes of our gazetteers are given in Table 6.
    We have experimented with removing the other contextual predicates but each time performance was reduced, except for the next-next unigram tag feature which was switched off for all final experiments.
    The results for the Dutch test data are given in Table 5.
    These improve upon the scores of the best performing system at CoNLL-2002 (Carreras et al., 2002).
    The final results for the English test data are given in Table 7.
    These are significantly lower than the results for the development data.
    The results for the German development and test sets are giv
