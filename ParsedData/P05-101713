 xi obtained from the distribution over x.
    We should note that the finite-temperature decoding is quite different from annealing type algorithms or &#8216;zero-temperature decoding&#8217;, which correspond to maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation and also often used in natural language processing (Cowie et al., 1992).
    Since the model estimation has been reduced to simple update calculations, the proposed model is similar to conventional spreading activation approaches, which have been applied, for example, to word sense disambiguation (Veronis and Ide, 1990).
    Actually, the proposed model can be regarded as a spreading activation model with a specific update rule, as long as we are dealing with 2-class model (2-Ising model).
    However, there are some advantages in our modelling.
    The largest advantage is its theoretical background.
    We have an objective function and its approximation method.
    We thus have a measure of goodness in model estimation and can use another better approximation
