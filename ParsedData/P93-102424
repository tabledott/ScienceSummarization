or the held-out data involving the 1000 clustered nouns.
  
  
    We also evaluated asymmetric cluster models on a verb decision task closer to possible applications to disambiguation in language analysis.
    The task consists judging which of two verbs v and v' is more likely to take a given noun n as object, when all occurrences of (v, n) in the training set were deliberately deleted.
    Thus this test evaluates how well the models reconstruct missing data in the the weighted average Eneiv., fr,D(11/3) where f, is the relative frequency of n in the test set.
    verb distribution for n from the cluster centroids close to n. The data for this test was built from the training data for the previous one in the following way, based on a suggestion by Dagan et al. (1993).
    104 noun-verb pairs with a fairly frequent verb (between 500 and 5000 occurrences) were randomly picked, and all occurrences of each pair in the training set were deleted.
    The resulting training set was used to build a sequence of clu
