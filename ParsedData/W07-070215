			Analysis of % correct translation and reordering of verbs for Dutch-English translation In Table 2 we can see that the addition of the CCGsupertag sequence model improved both the transla tion of the verbs and their reordering.
			However, theimprovement is much more pronounced for reordering.
			The difference in the reordering results is signif icant at p &lt; 0.05 using the ?2 significance test.
			Thisshows that the syntactic information in the CCG su pertags is used by the model to prefer better word order for the target sentence.In Figure 2 we can see two examples of DutchEnglish translations that have improved with the ap plication of CCG supertag sequence models.
			In the first example the verb ?heeft?
			occurs at the end of the source sentence
