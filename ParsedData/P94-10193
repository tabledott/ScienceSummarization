omain approach, they cannot address the fine-tuned meaning differences among verbs and the correspondence between semantics and syntax.
    Our approach could be adapted to either of these systems and incoporated into them.
    In a transfer-based MT system, pairs of verbs are exhaustively listed in a bilingual dictionary.
    The translation of a source verb is limited by the number of entries in the dictionary.
    For some source verbs with just a few translations, this method is direct and efficient.
    However, some source verbs are very active and have a lot of different translations in the target language.
    As illustrated by the following test of a commercial English to Chinese MT system, TranStar, using sentences from the Brown corpus, current transfer-based approaches have no alternative to listing every translation pair.
    In the Brown corpus, 246 sentences take break as the main verb.
    After removing most idiomatic usages and verb particle constructions, there are 157 sentences left.
