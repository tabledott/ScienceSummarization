nded by adding rules that select between the main distribution P1 and the backoff distribution P2, and also rules that correspond to draws from those distributions.
    We will make use of tied rule probabilities to make the independence assumption in the backoff distribution.
    We still use the original grammar to parse the sentence.
    However, we estimate the parameters in the extended grammar and then translate them back into the original grammar for parsing.
    More formally, suppose B &#8838; N is a set of nonterminals (called the backoff set) with conditioning events N(1) ... N(k&#8722;1) in common (differing in a conditioning event N(k)), and with rule sets of the same cardinality.
    If G is our model&#8217;s PCFG, we can define a new tied PCFG G&#8242; = (N&#8242;, T , S, R&#8242;, O), where N&#8242; = N &#8746; {Nb&#8467;  |N &#8712; B, E &#8712; {1, 2}}, meaning for each nonterminal N in the backoff set we add two nonterminals Nb1, Nb2 representing each distribution P1 and P2.
