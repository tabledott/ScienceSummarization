we learn that translation pairs tend to jointly generate these features, which leads us to believe that time and tiempo might be generated by a common underlying concept vector (see section 2).13 Using context features alone on EN-ES-W, our MCCA model (labeled CONTEXT in table 1) yielded a 80.2 p0.33.
    It is perhaps surprising that context features alone, without orthographic information, can yield a best-F1comparable to EDITDIST.
    We can of course combine context and orthographic features.
    Doing so yielded 89.03 p0.33 (labeled MCCA in table 1); this represents a 46.4% error reduction in p0.33 over the EDITDIST baseline.
    For the remainder of this work, we will use MCCA to refer to our model using both orthographic and context features.
  
  
    In this section we examine how system performance varies when crucial elements are altered.
    There are many sources from which we can derive monolingual corpora, and MCCA performance depends on the degree of similarity between corpora.
    We explored
