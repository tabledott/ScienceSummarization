    One can consider document-level polarity classification to be just a special (more difficult) case of text categorization with sentiment- rather than topic-based categories.
    Hence, standard machinelearning classification techniques, such as support vector machines (SVMs), can be applied to the entire documents themselves, as was done by Pang, Lee, and Vaithyanathan (2002).
    We refer to such classification techniques as default polarity classifiers.
    However, as noted above, we may be able to improve polarity classification by removing objective sentences (such as plot summaries in a movie review).
    We therefore propose, as depicted in Figure 1, to first employ a subjectivity detector that determines whether each sentence is subjective or not: discarding the objective ones creates an extract that should better represent a review&#8217;s subjective content to a default polarity classifier.
