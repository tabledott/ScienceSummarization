ations produced by Champollion in comparison to the total number of valid collocations supplied to it; namely, the percentage of Champ&#176;llion's correct translations if XTRACT'S errors are filtered from the input.
    This quantity is equal to the ratio of the fourth column over the sum of the third and fourth columns.'
    The accuracy figures shown in Table 9 are computed by averaging the scores of the three individual judges.
    However, we noted that the scores of the individual evaluators never varied by more than 2%, thus showing high agreement between the judges.'
    Such results indicate that, in general, there is a single correct answer in each case, verifying the hypothesis of a unique translation per collocation independently of context, which we postulated in Section 4.
    They also indicate that it is generally easy for the evaluators to identify this unique correct answer.
    When there is not a single correct answer, or when it is not easy for the evaluators to identify the correct answe
