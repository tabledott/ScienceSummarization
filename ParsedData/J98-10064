al relations and the role that monosemous &amp;quot;relatives&amp;quot; of polysemous words can play in creating unsupervised training materials.
    TLC is trained with automatically extracted examples, its performance is compared with that obtained from manually tagged training materials.
  
  
    Work on automatic sense identification from the 1950s onward has been well summarized by Hirst (1987) and Dagan and Itai (1994).
    The discussion below is limited to work that is closely related to our research.
    Hearst (1991) represents local context with a shallow syntactic parse in which the context is segmented into prepositional phrases, noun phrases, and verb groups.
    The target noun is coded for the word it modifies, the word that modifies it, and the prepositions that precede and follow it.
    Open-class items within &#177;3 phrase segments of the target are coded in terms of their relation to the target (modifier or head) or their role in a construct that is adjacent to the target.
