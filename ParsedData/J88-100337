Kucera, June 20, 1985).
    Marshall notes the possibility of consulting a complete three-dimensional matrix of collocational probabilities.
    Such a matrix would map ordered triples of tags into the relative probability of occurrence of each such triple.
    Marshall points out that such a table would be too large for its probable usefulness.
    The author has produced a table based upon more than 85% of the Brown Corpus; it occupies about 2 megabytes (uncompressed).
    Also, the mean number of examples per triple is very low, thus decreasing accuracy.
    CLAWS has been applied to the entire LOB Corpus with an accuracy of &amp;quot;between 96% and 97%&amp;quot; (Booth (1985), p. 29).
    Without the idiom list, the algorithm was 94% accurate on a sample of 15,000 words (Marshall (1983)).
    Thus, the pre-processor tagging of 1% of all tokens resulted in a 3% change in accuracy; those particular assignments must therefore have had a substantial effect upon their context, resulting in changes of two othe
