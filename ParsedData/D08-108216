tations for dynamic programming, a naive implementation of the inference algorithm will still require O(n6m) time for 1 EM iteration, where n and m are the length of the NL sentence and the size of the MR structure respectively.
    This is not very practical as in one of the corpora we look at, n and m can be up to 45 and 20 respectively.
    In this section, we develop an efficient dynamic programming algorithm that enables the inference to run in O(n3m) time.
    The idea is as follows.
    Instead of treating each possible hybrid sequence as a separate rule, we efficiently aggregate the already computed probability scores for hybrid sequences that share identical hybrid patterns.
    Such aggregated scores can then be used for subsequent computations.
    By doing this, we can effectively avoid a large amount of redundant computations.
    The algorithm supports both unigram and bigram context assumptions.
    For clarity and ease of presentation, we primarily make the unigram assumption throughout our di
