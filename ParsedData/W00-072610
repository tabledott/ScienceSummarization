 chunk 0 word outside of any chunk This representation type is based on a representation proposed by Ramshaw and Marcus (1995) for noun phrase chunks.
    The three tag groups are sufficient for encoding the chunks in the data since these are non-overlapping.
    Using these chunk tags makes it possible to approach the chunking task as a word classification task.
    We can use chunk tags for representing our example sentence in the following way: The output of a chunk recognizer may contain inconsistencies in the chunk tags in case a word tagged I-X follows a word tagged 0 or I-Y, with X and Y being different.
    These inconsistencies can be resolved by assuming that such I-X tags start a new chunk.
    The performance on this task is measured with three rates.
    First, the percentage of detected phrases that are correct (precision).
    Second, the percentage of phrases in the data that were found by the chunker (recall).
    And third, the Fo=1 rate which is equal to (132+1)*precision*recall / (02*preci
