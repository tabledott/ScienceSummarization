the chart bottom-up, starting with constituents spanning a single word, incrementally increasing the span until the whole sentence is covered.
    Because the constituents are built in order of span size, at any point in the process all the sub-constituents which could be used to create a particular new constituent must be present in the chart.
    Hence dynamic programming can be used to prevent the need for backtracking during the parsing process.
    There is a trade-off between the size and coverage of the grammar and the efficiency of the parser.
    One of our main goals in this work has been to develop a parser which can provide analyses for the vast majority of linguistic constructions in CCGbank, but is also efficient enough for large-scale NLP applications.
    In this section we describe some of the decisions we made when implementing the grammar, with this trade-off in mind.
    First, the lexical category set we use does not contain all the categories in Sections 02&#8211;21 of CCGbank.
