mework to specify the relative contribution of various factors to an agent's overall performance.
    Performance is modeled as a weighted function of a task-based success measure and dialogue-based cost measures, where weights are computed by correlating user satisfaction with performance.
    Also, performance can be calculated for subdialogues as well as whole dialogues.
    Since the goal of this paper is to explain and illustrate the application of the PARADISE framework, for expository purposes, the paper uses simplified domains with hypothetical data throughout.
    Section 2 describes PARADISE's performance model, and Section 3 discusses its generality, before concluding in Section 4.
  
  
    PARADISE uses methods from decision theory (Keeney and Raiffa, 1976; Doyle, 1992) to combine a disparate set of performance measures (i.e., user satisfaction, task success, and dialogue cost, all of which have been previously noted in the literature) into a single performance evaluation function.
