nfer that, in fact, consistent with our intuition, any of the following sets of phrases are also semantically equivalent: {stock market rose, stock market gained, stock prices rose, stock prices gained } and {stock market, stock prices } in the context of rose or gained; {market rose }, {market gained }, {prices rose } and {prices gained } in the context of stock; and so on.
    In this paper, we propose solutions for two problems: the problem ofparaphrase representation and the problem of paraphrase induction.
    We propose a new, finite-statebased representation of paraphrases that enables one to encode compactly large numbers of paraphrases.
    We also propose algorithms that automatically derive such representations from inputs that are now routinely released in conjunction with large scale machine translation evaluations (DARPA, 2002): multiple English translations of many foreign language texts.
    For instance, when given as input the 11 semantically equivalent English translations in Figure 1, our
