out any change in the data.
    In contrast, the performance achieved by a set of rules is effectively final without additional human revision.
    The potential disadvantages of annotationbased system development for applications such as base NP chunking are limited.
    Given the cost models presented in Section 6, one potential negative scenario would be an environment where the machine cost significantly outweighed human labor costs, or where access to active learning and annotation infrastructure was unavailable or costly.
    However, under normal circumstances where machine analysis of text is pursued, and public domain access to our annotation and active learning toolkits is assumed, such a scenario is unlikely.
  
  
    This paper has illustrated that there are potentially compelling practical and performance advantages to pursuing active-learning based annotation rather than rule-writing to develop base noun phrase chunkers.
    The relative balance depends ultimately on one's cost model, but given
