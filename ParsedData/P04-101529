all (LR), and F-measure an external model to present it with candidates, or potentially expensive dynamic programming.
    When the training algorithm is provided the generative model scores as an additional feature, the resulting parser is quite competitive on this task.
    The improvement that was derived from the additional punctuation features demonstrates the flexibility of the approach in incorporating novel features in the model.
    Future research will look in two directions.
    First, we will look to include more useful features that are difficult for a generative model to include.
    This paper was intended to compare search with the generative model and the perceptron model with roughly similar feature sets.
    Much improvement could potentially be had by looking for other features that could improve the models.
    Secondly, combining with the generative model can be done in several ways.
    Some of the constraints on the search technique that were required in the absence of the generative m
