a non-parametric measure and is a special case of the Pearson&#8217;s correlation coefficient when the values of data are converted into ranks before computing the coefficient.
    Spearman&#8217;s correlation coefficient does not assume the correlation between the variables is linear.
    Therefore it is a useful correlation indicator even when good linear correlation, for example, according to Pearson&#8217;s correlation coefficient between two variables could a quick overview of the Spearman&#8217;s coefficient, see: http://davidmlane.com/hyperstat/A62436.html. not be found.
    It also suits the NIST MT evaluation scenario where multiple systems are ranked according to some performance metrics.
    To estimate the significance of these correlation statistics, we applied bootstrap resampling, generating random samples of the 919 different sentence segments.
    The lower and upper values of 95% confidence interval are also shown in the table.
