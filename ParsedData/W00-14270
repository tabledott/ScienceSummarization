  Robust Applied Morphological Generation
  
    natural language generation sysit often advantageous to have a separate component that deals purely with morphological processing.
    We present such a component: a fast and robust morphological generator for English based on finite-state techniques that generates a word form given a specification of the lemma, part-of-speech, and the type of inflection required.
    We describe how this morphological generator is used in a prototype system for automatic simplification of English newspaper text, and discuss practical morphological and orthographic issues we have encountered in generation of unrestricted text within this application.
  
  
    Most approaches to natural language generation (NLG) ignore morphological variation during word choice, postponing the computation of the actual word forms to be output to a final stage, sometimes termed clinearisation'.
    The advantage of this setup is that the syntactic/lexical realisation component does not have to
