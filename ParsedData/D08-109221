evaluation, we used a syntactic system based on Galley et al. (2004) and Galley et al.
    (2006), which extracts tree-to-string transducer rules based on target-side trees.
    We trained the system on 150,000 Chinese-English sentence pairs from the training corpus of Wang et al. (2007), and used a large (close to 5 billion tokens) 4-gram lanwith trees output from either baseline monolingual parsers or our joint parser.
    To facilitate relative comparison, the Moses (Koehn et al., 2007) number listed reflects the default Moses configuration, including its full distortion model, and standard training pipeline. guage model for decoding.
    We tuned and evaluated BLEU (Papineni et al., 2001) on separate held-out sets of sentences of up to length 40 from the same corpus.
    The results are in Table 7, showing that joint parsing yields a BLEU increase of 2.4.9
  
  
    By jointly parsing (and aligning) sentences in a translation pair, it is possible to exploit mutual constraints that improve the quality of s
