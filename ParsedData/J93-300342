    Thus, if indeed our findings generalize, it might be to a class we had not intended to investigate.
    To discover further evidence that our results did indeed apply to the discourse/sentential use disambiguation, we conducted another multispeaker study, this time of the discourse and sentential uses of the single cue phrase well.
    Again, our corpus consisted of recordings of the Harry Gross radio call-in program.
    In addition, we used tokens from several other corpora of recorded, transcribed speech, including the corpus described in Section 5.
    This time we included no more than three tokens from any speaker to minimize the potential effect of speaker idiosyncracy.
