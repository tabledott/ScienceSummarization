titute on the order of 50% of all available vidence types, yet in a wide context window this low frequency evidence is effectively noise, with predic- tive power little better than chance.
  However, in very local collocations, ingle data points carry considerable informa- tion, and when used alone can achieve precision in excess of 92%.
  Their inclusion should improve system recall, with a much-reduced danger of overmodeling the data.
  Bui lding a Full  Disambiguation System Finally, one may ask to what extent can local collocational evidence alone support apractical sense disambiguation algo- rithm.
  As shown in Table 3, our models of single collocation types achieve high precision, but individually their applica- bility is limited.
  However, if we combine these models as described in Section 5, and use an additional function word collocation model when no other evidence is available, we achieve full coverage at a precision of 92%.
  This result is comparable to those previously reported in the literatu
