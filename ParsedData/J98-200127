e the same descriptive content as their antecedent (which we will call anaphoric (same head)) from other cases of anaphoric descriptions in which the association is based on more complex forms of lexical or commonsense knowledge (synonyms, hypernyms, information about events, etc.).
    We grouped these latter definite descriptions with Hawkins's associative descriptions in a class that we called associative.
    This was done in order to see how much need there is for complex lexical inferences in resolving anaphoric definite descriptions, as opposed to simple head matching.
    Secondly, we grouped together all the definite descriptions that introduce a novel discourse entity not associated to some previously established object in the text, i.e., that were discourse-new in Prince's sense.
    This class, that we will call larger situation/unfamiliar, includes both definite descriptions that exploit situational information (Hawkins's larger situation uses) and discourse-new definite descriptions introduced t
