e union of its two arguments (both sets).
    The function cross-product takes a list of sets as its argument and returns the set of lists corresponding to each way of taking an element from each of the sets in order.
    For example, The function terms(form) returns the set of all complex terms in form.
    The function applicable-terms(form) returns the set of all complex terms in form that can be applied to form.
    The deterministic version of the algorithm is identical in structure to the nondeterministic version.
    Each function operates in the same way as its nondeterministic counterpart, except that they uniformly return sets rather than nondeterministically returning single values.
    The algorithm is as follows.
    The function gen (form) returns a set of all valid full scopings of the formula form. function gen (form); return pull(form,true).
    The function pull returns a set of all valid scopings of the formula form.
    If complete? is true, only full scopings are returned; otherwise, part
