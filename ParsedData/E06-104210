se disambiguation, TroFi makes use of an existing similarity-based word-sense disambiguation algorithm developed by (Karov &amp; Edelman, 1998), henceforth KE.
    The KE algorithm is based on the principle of attraction: similarities are calculated between sentences containing the word we wish to disambiguate (the target word) and collections of seed sentences (feedback sets) (see also Section 3.1).
    A target set sentence is considered to be attracted to the feedback set containing the sentence to which it shows the highest similarity.
    Two sentences are similar if they contain similar words and two words are similar if they are contained in similar sentences.
    The resulting transitive similarity allows us to defeat the knowledge acquisition bottleneck &#8211; i.e. the low likelihood of finding all possible usages of a word in a single corpus.
    Note that the KE algorithm concentrates on similarities in the way sentences use the target literal or nonliteral word, not on similarities in the meaning
