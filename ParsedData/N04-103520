s contains two kinds of alignments: S (sure) for unambiguous cases and P (possible) for unclear cases, e.g. idiomatic expressions and missing function words (S C_ P).
    In order to be able to make legitimate comparisons between the two language pairs, we also used GIZA++ to obtain machine-generated word alignments for Hansard: we trained it with the 500 sentences and additional data representing 13.7 million English words (taken from the Hansard and European parliament corpora).
    From a theoretical point of view, we have shown that our model can fully explain the transformation of any parse tree of the source language into a string of the target language.
    The purpose of this section is twofold: to provide quantitative results confirming the full coverage of our model and to analyze some properties of the transformation rules that support these derivations (linguistic analyses of these rules are presented in the next section).
    Figure 9 summarizes the coverage of our model with respect to the Hansa
