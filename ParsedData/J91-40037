understanding of the lexicon and the methods of composition.
    Stepping back from the lexicon for a moment, let me say briefly what I think the position of lexical research should be within the larger semantic picture.
    Ever since the earliest attempts at real text understanding, a major problem has been that of controlling the inferences associated with the interpretation process.
    In other words, how deep or shallow is the understanding of a text?
    What is the unit of well-formedness when doing natural language understanding; the sentence, utterance, paragraph, or discourse?
    There is no easy answer to this question because, except for the sentence, these terms are not even formalizable in a way that most researchers would agree on.
    It is my opinion that the representation of the context of an utterance should be viewed as involving many different generative factors that account for the way that language users create and manipulate the context under constraints, in order to be understood.
