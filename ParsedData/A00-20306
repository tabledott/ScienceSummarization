    Further details are discussed in the section Tree Augmentation.
  
  
    To train our integrated model, we required a large corpus of augmented parse trees.
    Since it was known that the MUC-7 evaluation data would be drawn from a variety of newswire sources, and that the articles would focus on rocket launches, it was important that our training corpus be drawn from similar sources and that it cover similar events.
    Thus, we did not consider simply adding semantic labels to the existing Penn TREEBANK, which is drawn from a single source &#8212; the Wall Street Journal &#8212; and is impoverished in articles about rocket launches.
    Instead, we applied an information retrieval system to select a large number of articles from the desired sources, yielding a corpus rich
