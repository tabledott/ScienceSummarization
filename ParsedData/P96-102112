ase of BTGs which are employed in the model presented below, there is only one undifferentiated nonterminal category (aside from the start symbol).
    Designating this category A, this means all non-lexical productions are of one of these two forms: The degree of word-order flexibility is the critical point.
    BTGs make a favorable trade-off between efficiency and expressiveness: constraints are strong enough to allow algorithms to operate efficiently, but without so much loss of expressiveness as to hinder useful translation.
    We summarize here; details are given elsewhere (Wu, 1995b).
    With regard to efficiency, Figure 2 demonstrates the kind of reduction that BTGs obtain in the space of possible alignments.
    The number of possible alignments, compared against the unrestricted case where any English word may align to any Chinese position, drops off dramatically for strings longer than four words.
