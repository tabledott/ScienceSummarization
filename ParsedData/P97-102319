    A strong point of our method is that decisions on individual words are aggregated to provide decisions on how to group words into a class and whether to label the class as positive or negative.
    Thus, the overall result can be much more accurate than the individual indicators.
    To verify this, we ran a series of simulation experiments.
    Each experiment measures how our algorithm performs for a given level of precision P for identifying links and a given average number of links k for each word.
    The goal is to show that even when P is low, given enough data (i.e., high k), we can achieve high performance for the gr
