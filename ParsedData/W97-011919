the same as in the corpus, then it is judged as correct.
    The results are shown in Figure 9.
    Evaluators on average are able to translate 8 terms out of 19 by themselves, whereas they can translate 18 terms on average with the aid of our output.
    Translation precision increases on the average by 50.9%.
  
  
    We have described a statistical word signature feature, the Word Relation Matrix, that can be used to find matching pairs of content words or terms in a pair of same-domain non-parallel bilingual texts.
    Evaluation shows a precision of about 30%.
    We showed that humans are able to translate more than twice as many Japanese technical terms into English when our system output is used, compared to translating a random set of 19 Japanese terms without aid.
    It is also a significant initial result for lexical translation from truly non-parallel corpora, particularly across language groups.
    For future work, the quality of seed words can be improved by using a training algorithm to sele
