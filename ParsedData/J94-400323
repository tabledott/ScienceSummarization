 to choose for T one of the target tuples T,, we can consider T a discrete random variable with multinomial distribution,' whose possible values are T1,.
    , Tk.
    Let p, be the probability of obtaining Ti, i.e., the probability that Ti is the correct translation for T. We estimate the probabilities pi by the counts n, in the obvious way, using the maximum likelihood estimator (Agresti 1990, pp.
    40-41).
    The estimator P, The precision of the estimator depends, of course, on the size of the counts in the computation.
    We will incorporate this consideration into the decision algorithm by using confidence intervals.'
    We now have to establish the criterion for choosing the preferred target language syntactic tuple.
    The most reasonable assumption is to choose the tuple with the highest estimated probability, that is Ti&#8212;the tuple with the largest observed frequency According to the model, the probability that T1 is the right choice is estimated as This criterion should be subject to the
