 Strube, 2006a), while others overcome this problem with word sense disambiguation (Nicolae and Nicolae, 2006).
    Knowledge has also been mined from Wikipedia for measuring the semantic relatedness of two NPs, NPj and NPk (Ponzetto and Strube (2006a; 2007)), such as: whether NPj/k appears in the first paragraph of the Wiki page that has NPk/j as the title or in the list of categories to which this page belongs, and the degree of overlap between the two pages that have the two NPs as their titles (see Poesio et al. (2007) for other uses of encyclopedic knowledge for coreference resolution).
    Contextual roles (Bean and Riloff, 2004), semantic relations (Ji et al., 2005), semantic roles (Ponzetto and Strube, 2006b; Kong et al., 2009), and animacy (Or&#728;asan and Evans, 2007) have also been exploited to improve coreference resolution.
    Lexico-syntactic patterns have been used to capture the semantic relatedness between two NPs and hence the likelihood that they are coreferent.
    For instance, given th
