dels, such as Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) (Leek, 1997; Freitag and McCallum, 1999), Conditional Markov Models (CMMs) (Borthwick, 1999), and Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) (Lafferty et al., 2001) are a prominent recent approach to information extraction tasks.
    These models all encode the Markov property: decisions about the state at a particular position in the sequence can depend only on a small local window.
    It is this property which allows tractable computation: the Viterbi, Forward Backward, and Clique Calibration algorithms all become intractable without it.
    However, information extraction tasks can benefit from modeling non-local structure.
    As an example, several authors (see Section 8) mention the value of enforcing label consistency in named entity recognition (NER) tasks.
    In the example given in Figure 1, the second occurrence of the token Tanjug is mislabeled by our CRF-based statistical NER system, because by looking only at local evidence it is unclear whether it is a person o
