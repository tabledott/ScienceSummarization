sh paragraph markers line up one-to-one with their French counterparts.
    A random variable z, the log of which is normally distributed with mean it and variance 0.2, has mean value exp(ii + 0.2/2).
    We can also see, therefore, that the total length of the French text in an ef-, eef-, or eff-bead should be about 9.8% greater on average than the total length of the corresponding English text.
    Since most sentences belong to ef-beads, this is close to the value of 9.5% given in Section 2 for the amount by which the length of the average French sentences exceeds that of the average English sentence.
    We can compute from the parameters in Table 3 that the entropy of the bead production process is 1.26 bits per sentence.
    Using the parameters it and 0.2, we can combine the observed distribution of English sentence lengths shown in Figure 4 with the conditional distribution of French sentence lengths given English sentence lengths in Equation (1) to obtain the joint distribution of French and English
