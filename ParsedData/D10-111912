ith a multi-word lexical item xi`S:zi for each training example (xi, zi), consisting of the entire sentence xi and its associated meaning representation zi.
    For example, one initial lexical item might be: Although these initial, sentential lexical items can parse the training data, they will not generalize well to unseen data.
    To learn effectively, we will need to split overly specific entries of this type into pairs of new, smaller, entries that generalize better.
    For example, one possible split of the lexical entry given in (5) would be the pair: New York borders ` S/NP : Ax.next to(ny, x), Vermont ` NP : vt where we broke the original logical expression into two new ones Ax.next to(ny, x) and vt, and paired them with syntactic categories that allow the new lexical entries to be recombined to produce the original analysis.
    The next three subsections define the set of possible splits for any given lexical item.
    The process is driven by solving a higher-order unification problem that defin
