 with other language models in recognition tasks (e.g., Katz 1987; Jelinek 1990, for speech recognition).
    To a limited extent, this view is shared with the statistical machine translation system of Brown et al. (1990), which employs a target language n-gram model (see Section 8 for a comparison with this system).
    In contrast to this view, previous approaches in machine translation typically resolve examples like (1) by stating various constraints in terms of the source language (Nirenburg 1987).
    As explained above, such constraints cannot be acquired automatically and therefore are usually limited in their coverage.
    The experiments we conducted clearly show that statistics on lexical relations are very useful for disambiguation.
    Most notable is the result for the set of examples of Hebrew to English translation, which was picked randomly from foreign news sections in the Israeli press.
    For this set, the statistical model was applicable for 70% of the ambiguous words, and its selection
