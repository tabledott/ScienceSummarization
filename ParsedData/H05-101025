R fig ure for this training scenario (though since we use a subset of the test set, evaluations are not problem-free).
			Finally, our method scales to large numbers of training sentences and trains in minutes rather than hours or days for thehigher-numbered IBM models, a particular ad vantage when not using features derived from those slower models.
