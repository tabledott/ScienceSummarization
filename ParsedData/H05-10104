Model 4 predic tions as features, we achieve an absolute AER of 5.4 on the English-French Hansards alignmenttask, a relative reduction of 22% in AER over intersected Model 4 alignments and, to our knowl edge, the best AER result published on this task.
	
	
			We model the alignment prediction task as a maximum weight bipartite matching problem, where nodes correspond to the words in the two sentences.
			For simplicity, we assume here that each word aligns to one or zero words in the other sentence.
			The edge weight s jkrepre sents the degree to which word j in one sentencecan translate into the word k in the other sen tence.
			Our goal is to find an alignment that maximizes the sum of edge scores.
			We represent a matching using a set of binary variables y jk that are set to 1 if word j is assigned to word k in the other sentence, and 0 otherwise.
			The score of an assignment is the sum of edge scores: s(y) = ? jk s jk y jk . The maximum weight bi-.
