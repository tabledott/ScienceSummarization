ngency there are quite a few more opposite polarity pairs (52%) than for not Contingency (41%).
    The language model features were completely useless for distinguishing contingencies from other relations.
    Expansion As Expansion is the majority class in the natural distribution, recall is less of a problem than precision.
    The features that help achieve the best f-score are all features that were found to be useful in identifying other relations.
    Polarity tags, Inquirer tags and context were the best features for identifying expansions with f-scores around 70%.
    Temporal Implicit temporal relations are relatively rare, making up only about 5% of our test set.
    Most temporal relations are explicitly marked with a connective like &#8220;when&#8221; or &#8220;after&#8221;.
    Yet again, the first and last words of the sentence turned out to be useful indicators for temporal relations (15.93 f-score).
    The importance of the first and last words for this distinction is clear.
