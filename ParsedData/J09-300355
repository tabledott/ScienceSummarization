    Condition 1 allows us to investigate the performance of the different polarity features without the noise of misclassified neutral instances.
    Also, because the set of polar instances being classified is the same for all the algorithms, condition 1 allows us to compare the performance of the polarity features across the different algorithms.
    However, condition 2 is the more natural one.
    It allows us to see how the noise of neutral instances affects the performance of the polarity features.
    The following sections describe three sets of experiments.
    First, we investigate the performance of the polarity features used together for polarity classification under condition 1.
    As before, the word and word+priorpol classifiers provide our baselines.
    In the second set of experiments, we explore the performance of different sets of features for polarity classification, again assuming perfect recognition of the polar instances.
    Finally, we experiment with polarity classification usi
