 The results in Table 7 demonstrate that sentences manually generated by the second human participant (RFA2) not only are the shortest, but are also closest to the reference sentence in terms of selected information.
    The tight connection14 between sentences generated by the RFAs establishes a high upper bound for the fusion task.
    While neither our system nor the baselines were able to reach this level of performance, the fusion algorithm clearly outperforms all the baselines in terms of content selection, at a reasonable level of compression.
    The performance of baseline 1 and baseline 2 demonstrates that neither the shortest sentence nor the basis sentence is an adequate substitution for fusion in terms of content selection.
    The gap in recall between our system and baseline 3 confirms our hypothesis about the importance of paraphrasing information for the fusion process.
    Omission of paraphrases causes an 8% drop in recall due to the inability to match equivalent phrases with different word
