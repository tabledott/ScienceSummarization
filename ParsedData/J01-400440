e number of the spurious links are caused by what he terms &amp;quot;feature ambiguity,&amp;quot; which means that feature values are not computed perfectly.
    As seen in Table 5, our string match feature accounts for most of the spurious links.
    Also, seven of the spurious links are caused by alias and apposition determination.
    As with RESOLVE, &amp;quot;feature ambiguity&amp;quot; is the main source of precision errors.
    For RESOLVE, a large number of the missing links are caused by &amp;quot;incomplete semantic knowledge&amp;quot; (32%) and &amp;quot;unused features&amp;quot; (40.5%).
    For our system, the errors due to the inadequacy of surface features and semantic class determination problems account for about 75% of the missing links.
    &amp;quot;Unused features&amp;quot; means that some of the features, or combinations of features, that are needed to classify pairs of phrases as coreferential are not present in the decision trees (McCarthy 1996).
    Similarly, the inadequacy of our sy
