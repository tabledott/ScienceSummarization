 and worst of these systems.
    Most implemented a series of linguistic constraints similar in spirit to those employed in our system.
    The main advantage of our approach is that all constraints and preferences are represented neatly in the distance metric (and radius r), allowing for simple modification of this measure to incorporate new knowledge sources.
    In addition, we anticipate being able to automatically learn the weights used in the distance metric.
    There is also a growing body of work on the narrower task of pronoun resolution.
    Azzam et al. (1998), for example, describe a focus-based approach that incorporates discourse information when resolving pronouns.
    Lappin and Leass (1994) make use of a series of filters to rule out impossible antecedents, many of which are similar to our ooincompatibilities.
    They also make use of more extensive syntactic information (such as the thematic role each noun phrase plays), and thus require a fuller parse of the input text.
