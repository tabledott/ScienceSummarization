    We simply ranked the elements of Cif according to their text position.
    While it is usually assumed that the functional anaphor (FA) is ranked above its antecedent (FAante) (Grosz, Joshi, and Weinstein 1995, 217), we assume the opposite.
    The second column contains the results of this modification with respect to the naive approach.
    In the third column of Table 18, we give the numbers of transitions generated by the grammatical constraints (Table 1) stated by Grosz, Joshi, and Weinstein (1995, 214, 217).
    The fourth column supplies the results of the same modification as was used for the naive approach, namely, antecedents of functional anaphors are ranked higher than the corresponding anaphoric expressions.
    The fifth column shows the results generated by the functional constraints from Table 11.
