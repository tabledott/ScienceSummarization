.
    Another important direction for performance improvement is to design methods that better approximate Eq.
    6.
    Although at this stage the system performance is not yet better than previous approaches, good translation results are achieved on a standard translation task.
    While being similar to (Tillmann and Zhang, 2005), the current procedure is more automated with comparable performance.
    The latter approach requires a decomposition of the decoding scheme into local decision steps with the inherent difficulty acknowledged in (Tillmann and Zhang, 2005).
    Since such limitation is not present in the current model, improved results may be obtained in the future.
    A perceptronlike algorithm that handles global features in the context of re-ranking is also presented in (Shen et al., 2004).
    The computational requirements for the training algorithm in Table 2 can be significantly reduced.
    While the global training approach presented in this paper is simple, after iterations or so, the
