  :at denoted by e; eonjmmtion and disjunetion are treated as intersection snd union respectively except hat we have to ensure that rely value assigned t&lt;) a wtriable in one of the eonjunets i the same as the valne assigned to the same variable in the other conjnncg.
  Since the grammar is given by a set of equation;;, the denotation is given by tim least solution.
  This is obtaiued by considering the fimctiou corresponding to the set of equations in the standard way, and obtaining its least fixpoint.
  Details of these issues rnay be found in [Vij ayashaaker i 9 In [Vijayashanker 1987], we have shown that any set of equations has a solution.
  Thus, we can Live semantics for recursivc set of eqnatkms which may be used to describe cyclic feature structure.
  For example, we give the solution for equations uch as x: :  f : xAg:a As shown in [V ]ayas ran mr 1987], we can obtain the least lixedopoint by assuming the le~rst vahm for x (which is the cntirc set of partial fnnetions or the in
