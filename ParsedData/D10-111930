 meaning answer(state(borders(tex))).
    For this representation, lexical items such as: can be used to construct the desired output.
    In practice, UBL often learns entries with only a single slash, like those above, varying only in the direction, as required for the language.
    Even the more complex items, such as those for quantifiers, are consistently simpler than those induced from the lambda-calculus meaning representations.
    For example, one of the most complex entries learned in the experiments for English is the smallest ` NP\NP/(NP|NP):AfAx.smallest one(f(x)).
    There are also differences in the aggregate statistics of the learned lexicons.
    For example, the average length of a learned lexical item for the (lambdacalculus, variable-free) meaning representations is: (1.21,1.08) for Turkish, (1.34,1.19) for English, (1.43,1.25) for Spanish and (1.63,1.42) for Japanese.
    For both meaning representations the model learns significantly more multiword lexical items for the somewhat analyti
