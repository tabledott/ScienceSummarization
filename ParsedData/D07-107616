 span.
			We only ex pand the tree span when the tree span belongs to the ?predicate-linked?
			category.
			This is based on our observation that the tree spans belonging to the ?predi cate-linked?
			category vary much syntactically and majority (~70%) of them need information outside SPT while it is quite safe (&gt;90%) to use SPT as the tree span for the remaining categories.
			In our algo rithm, the expansion is done by first moving up until a predicate-headed phrase is found and then moving down along the predicated-headed path to the predi cate terminal node.
			Figure 1(e) shows an example for the ?predicate-linked?
			category where the lines with arrows indicate the expansion path.
