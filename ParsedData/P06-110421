e of the sub-tree, our method is not limited by the constraints (identical layer and ancestors for the matchable nodes, as discussed in Section 2) in Culotta and Sorensen (2004).
    Moreover, the difference between our method and Bunescu and Mooney (2005) is that their kernel is defined on the shortest path between two entities instead of the entire subtrees.
    However, the path does not maintain the tree structure information.
    In addition, their kernel requires the two paths to have the same length.
    Such constraint is too strict.
    (1) Speed Issue: The recursively-defined convolution kernel is much slower compared to feature-based classifiers.
    In this paper, the speed issue is solved in three ways.
    First, the inclusion of the entity kernel makes the composite kernel converge fast.
    Furthermore, we find that the small portion (PT) of a full parse tree can effectively represent a relation instance.
    This significantly improves the speed.
    Finally, the parse tree kernel requires ex
