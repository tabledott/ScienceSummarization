    For example, one may wish to use a capitalization engine developed on newswire text for email or office documents.
    This typically affects negatively the performance of a given model, and more sophisticated models tend to be more brittle.
    In the capitalization case we have studied, the relative performance improvement of the MEMM capitalizer over the 1-gram baseline drops from in-domain &#8212; WSJ &#8212; performance of 45% to 35-40% when used on the slightly mismatched BN data.
    In order to take advantage of the adaptation data in our scenario, a maximum a-posteriori (MAP) adaptation technique for maximum entropy (MaxEnt) models is developed.
    The adaptation procedure proves to be quite effective in further reducing the capitalization error of the WSJ MEMM capitalizer on BN test data.
    It is also quite general and could improve performance of MaxEnt models in any scenario where model adaptation is desirable.
    A further relative improvement of about 2
