l to identify lexical relations between word senses.
    However, within corpora of a single language it is possible to identify automatically only relations at the word level, which are of course not useful for selecting word senses in that language.
    This is where other languages can supply the solution, exploiting the fact that the mapping between words and word senses varies significantly among different languages.
    For instance, the English words 'sign' and 'seal' correspond to a very large extent to two distinct senses of the Hebrew word `la.htom' (from example (1)).
    These senses should be distinguished by most applications of Hebrew understanding programs.
    To make this distinction, it is possible to do the same process that is performed for target word selection, by producing all the English alternatives for the lexical relations involving `lahtom'.
    Then the Hebrew sense which corresponds to the most plausible English lexical relations is preferred.
    This process requires a bilingu
