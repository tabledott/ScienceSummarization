s rule extraction while nearly retaining the speed and alignment accuracy of the HMM model.
    While it remains to be seen whether these improvements impact final translation accuracy, it is reasonable to hope that, all else equal, alignments which better respect syntactic correspondences will be superior for syntactic MT.
