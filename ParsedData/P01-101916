he fact that only these pieces of information are visible means, for instance, that it is impossible to define a verb that controls the object of its complement.7 Although obviously changes to the syntactic valence features would necessitate modification of the hole labels, we think it unlikely that we will need to increase the inventory further.
    In combination with the principles defined in Copestake et al (1999) for qeq conditions, the algebra presented here results in a much more tightly specified approach to semantic composition than that in Pollard and Sag (1994).
  
  
    Compared with A-calculus, the approach to composition adopted in constraint-based grammars and formalized here has considerable advantages in terms of simplicity.
    The standard Montague grammar approach requires that arguments be presented in a fixed order, and that they be strictly typed, which leads to unnecessary multiplication of predicates which then have to be interrelated by meaning postulates (e.g., the two uses of expe
