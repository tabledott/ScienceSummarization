w results for the system achieving the best sensitivity while maintaining at least 90% specificity on the DEV set.
    We evaluated the selected systems on the TEST set.
    Table 1 summarizes the quality of the systems selected according to the Accuracy criterion.
    The best performing system, ISP.IIM.v, performed statistically significantly better than all three baselines.
    The best system according to the 90%Specificity criteria was ISP.JIM, which coincidentally has the highest accuracy for that model as shown in Table 16.
    This result is very promising for researchers that require highly accurate inference rules since they can use ISP.JIM and expect to recall 17% of the correct inferences by only accepting false positives 12% of the time.
    Figures 1a) and 1b) present the full confusion matrices for the most accurate and highly specific systems, with both systems selected on the DEV set.
    The most accurate system was ISP.IIM.v, which is the most permissive of the algorithms.
    This suggests
