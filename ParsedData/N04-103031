			The tables show featurecoverage for constituents that were Arguments and con stituents that were NULL.
			About 99% of the predicates inthe AQUAINT test set were seen in the PropBank train ing set.
			Table 17 shows coverage for the same features onthe AQUAINT test set.
			We believe that the drop in cover age of the more predictive feature combinations explains part of the drop in performance.
	
	
			We have described an algorithm which significantly im proves the state-of-the-art in shallow semantic parsing.
			Like previous work, our parser is based on a supervised machine learning approach.
