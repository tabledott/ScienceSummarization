 of deriving the count and reestimation formulae for Model 4 to the reader.
    He may find the general formulae in Appendix B helpful.
    Once again, the several counts for a translation are expectations of various quantities over the possible alignments with the probability of each alignment computed from an earlier estimate of the parameters.
    As with Model 3, we know of no trick for evaluating these expectations and must rely on sampling some small set, S, of alignments.
    As described above, the simple form that we assume for the distortion probabilities in Model 3 makes it possible for us to find Pc' (a) rapidly for any a.
    The analog of Equation (43) for Model 4 is complicated by the fact that when we move a French word from cept to cept we change the centers of two cepts and may affect the contribution of several words.
    It is nonetheless possible to evaluate the adjusted likelihood incrementally, although it is substantially more time-consuming.
    Faced with this unpleasant situation, w
