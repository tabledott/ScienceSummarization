 agreed on the same label).
    While we postulated that non-native speakers11 might be more sensitive to what was simpler, we note that they disagreed more than the native speakers (n = 0.49) and reported having to consult a dictionary.
    The nativespeaker majority label was used in our evaluations.
    Here are the results; &#8220;-x-y&#8221; means that x and y are the number of instances discarded from the precision calculation for having no majority label or majority label &#8220;?&#8221;, respectively: Both baselines yielded very low precisions &#8212; clearly not all (frequent) edits in SimpleEW were simplifications.
    Furthermore, the edit model yielded higher precision than SIMPL for the top 100 pairs.
    (Note that we only examined one simplification per A for those A where P&#65533;(o2  |A) was well-defined; thus &#8220;# of pairs&#8221; does not directly reflect the full potential recall that either method can achieve.)
    Both, however, produced many high-quality pairs (62% and 71% of the co
