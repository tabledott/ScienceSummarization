ximation to determining this kind of structure, we tagged each word according to whether it appeared in the first quarter, last quarter, or middle half of the document14.
    The results (line (8)) didn&#8217;t differ greatly from using unigrams alone, but more refined notions of position might be more successful.
  
  
    The results produced via machine learning techniques are quite good in comparison to the humangenerated baselines discussed in Section 4.
    In terms of relative performance, Naive Bayes tends to do the worst and SVMs tend to do the best, although the differences aren&#8217;t very large.
    On the other hand, we were not able to achieve accuracies on the sentiment classification problem comparable to those reported for standard topic-based categorization, despite the several different types of features we tried.
    Unigram presence information turned out to be the most effective; in fact, none of the alternative features we employed provided consistently better performance once unigram
