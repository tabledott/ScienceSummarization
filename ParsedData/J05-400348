 another threshold in order to select the ones that are parallel.
    Using the set of extracted sentences, they learn a new dictionary, try to extend their set of matching document pairs (by looking for other documents that contain these sentences), and iterate.
    The evaluation methodologies of these previous approaches are less direct than ours.
    Utiyama et al. (2003) evaluate their sentence pairs manually; they estimate that about 90% of the sentence pairs in their final corpus are parallel.
    Fung and Cheung (2004) also perform a manual evaluation of the extracted sentences and estimate their precision to be 65.7% after bootstrapping.
    In addition, they also estimate the quality of a lexicon automatically learned from those sentences.
    Zhao and Vogel (2002) go one step further and show that the sentences extracted with their method improve the accuracy of automatically computed word alignments, to an F-score of 52.56% over a baseline of 46.46%.
    In a subsequent publication, Vogel (2003) e
