the paraphrase pair (ate at cafe, chowed down at bistro) can also be extracted from the lattice in Figure 5(b).
    In addition, each path between the START and the END nodes in the lattice represents a sentential paraphrase of the original 11 sentences used to create the lattice.
    The direct alignment approach is able to leverage the sheer width (number of parallel alternatives per sentence position; 11 in this case) of the input corpus to do away entirely with any need for measuring distributional similarity.
    In general, it has several advantages.
    It can capture a very large number of paraphrases: Each lattice has on the order of hundreds or thousands of paths depending on the average length of the sentence group that it was generated from.
    In addition, the paraphrases produced are of better quality than other approaches employing parallel corpora for paraphrase induction discussed so far.
    However, the approach does have a couple of drawbacks: the lattices described is built using 11 manu
