(for words such as who, which, that) shows how heads are co-indexed for object-extraction: The derivation for the phrase The company that Marks wants to buy is given in Figure 1 (with the features on S categories removed to save space, and the constant heads reduced to the first letter).
    Typeraising ( ) and functional composition ( ), along with co-indexing of heads, mediate transmission of the head of the NP the company onto the object of buy.
    The corresponding dependencies are given in the following figure, with the convention that arcs point away from arguments.
    The relevant argument slot in the functor category labels the arcs.
    Note that we encode the subject argument of the to category as a dependency relation (Marks is a &#8220;subject&#8221; of to), since our philosophy at this stage is to encode every argument as a dependency, where possible.
    The number of dependency types may be reduced in future work.
  
  
    The DAG-like nature of the dependency structures makes it difficult t
