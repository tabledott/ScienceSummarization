ce was improved by the joint model for five of the six datasets, by up to 1.36%.
    Looking at the parsing improvements on a per-label basis, the largest gains came from improved identication of NML consituents, from an F-score of 45.9% to 57.0% (on all the data combined, for a total of 420 NML constituents).
    This label was added in the new treebank annotation conventions, so as to identify internal left-branching structure inside previously flat NPs.
    To our surprise, performance on NPs only increased by 1%, though over 12,949 constituents, for the largest improvement in absolute terms.
    The second largest gain was on PPs, where we improved by 1.7% over 3,775 constituents.
    We tested the significance of our results (on all the data combined) using Dan Bikel&#8217;s randomized parsing evaluation comparator6 and found that both the precision and recall gains were significant at p &#8804; 0.01.
    Much greater improvements in performance were seen on named entity recognition, where most of the do
