o the query is taken into account, together with syntactic, context, and corpus information.
    Ideally, the sentence reduction module should interact with other modules in a summarization system.
    It should be able to send feedback to the extraction module if it finds that a sentence selected by the extraction module may be inappropriate (for example, having a very low context importance score).
    It should also be able to interact with the modules that run after it, such as the sentence combination module, so that it can revise reduction decisions according to the feedback from these modules.
    Some researchers suggested removing phrases or clauses from sentences for certain applications.
    (Grefenstette, 1998) proposed to remove phrases in sentences to produce a telegraphic text that can be used to provide audio scanning service for the blind.
    (Corston-Oliver and Dolan, 1999) proposed to remove clauses in sentences before indexing documents for Information Retrieval.
