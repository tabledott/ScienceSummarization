    As described in Sproat et al. (1996): FNs are usually transliterated using Chinese character strings whose sequential pronunciation mimics the source language pronunciation of the name.
    Since FNs can be of any length and their original pronunciation is effectively unlimited, the recognition of such names is tricky.
    Fortunately, there are only a few hundred Chinese characters that are particularly common in transliterations.
    Therefore, an FN candidate would be generated given S&#8217;, if it contains only characters stored in a transliterated name character list (which contains 618 Chinese characters).
    The probability P(S&#8217;|FN) is estimated using
