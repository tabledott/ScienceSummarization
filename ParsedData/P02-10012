 relations are closed.
    It is common to define further useful operations (as macros), which modify existing relations not by editing their source code but simply by operating on them &#8220;from outside.&#8221; &#8727;A brief version of this work, with some additional material, first appeared as (Eisner, 2001a).
    A leisurely journal-length version with more details has been prepared and is available.
    The entire paradigm has been generalized to weighted relations, which assign a weight to each (input, output) pair rather than simply including or excluding it.
    If these weights represent probabilities P(input, output) or P(output  |input), the weighted relation is called a joint or conditional (probabilistic) relation and constitutes a statistical model.
    Such models can be efficiently restricted, manipulated or combined using rational operations as before.
    An artificial example will appear in &#167;2.
    The availability of toolkits for this weighted case (Mohri et al., 1998; van Noord and
