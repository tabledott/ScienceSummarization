antially flatter than the rules in the Penn Treebank, for which the Collins model was developed.
    Table 3 compares the average number of daughters in both corpora.
    The flatness of PPs is easy to reduce.
    As detailed in Section 2.2, PPs lack an intermediate NP projection, which can be inserted straightforwardly using the following rule: In the present experiment, we investigated if parsing performance improves if we test and train on a version of Negra on which the transformation in (7) has been applied.
    In a second series of experiments, we investigated a more general way of dealing with the flatness of Negra, based on Collins&#8217;s (1997) model for nonrecursive NPs in the Penn Treebank (which are also flat).
    For non-recursive NPs, Collins (1997) does not use the probability function in (5), but instead substitutes Pr (and, by analogy, Pl) by: Here the head H is substituted by the sister Ri&#8722;1 (and Li&#8722;1).
    In the literature, the version of Pr in (5) is said to capture head-he
