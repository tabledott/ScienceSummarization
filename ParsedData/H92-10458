ey could be disam- biguated by looking at their French translation in the Canadian Hansards (unlike a polysemous word such as interest whose French translation inter~1 is just as am- biguous as the English source).
  In addition, for test- ing methodology, it is helpful that the corpus contain plenty of instances of each sense.
  The second condition, for example, would exclude bank, perhaps the canoni- cal example of a polysemous noun, since there are very few instances of the "river" sense of bank in our corpus of Canadian Hansards.
  We were somewhat surprised to discover that these two conditions are actually fairly stringent, and that there are a remarkably small number of polysemous words which (1) can be disambiguated by looking at the French translation, and (2) appear 150 or more times in two or more senses.
