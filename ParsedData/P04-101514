 under an S. The triple (NP,NN,&#175;S) would specify that the S&#175; symbol can follow an NN under an NP &#8211; i.e., that the symbol NN is allowed to be the final child of a rule with parent NP The initial state of the parser is the input string alone, wn0 .
    In absorbing the first word, we add all chains of the form S&#8224; ... , w0.
    For example, in figure 2 the chain (S&#8224; , S , NP , NN , Trash) is used to construct an analysis for the first word alone.
    Other chains which start with S&#8224; and end with Trash would give competing analyses for the first word of the string.
    Figure 2 shows an example of how the next word in a sentence can be incorporated into a partial analysis for the previous words.
    For any partial analysis there will be a set of potential attachment sites: in the example, the attachment sites are under the NP or the S. There will also be a set of possible chains terminating in the next word &#8211; there are three in the example.
    Each chain could potentially
