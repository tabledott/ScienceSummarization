ich are inherently theory-dependent.
    The initially disappointing results of inducing trees entirely from raw text was not so much due to the difficulty of the bootstrapping problem per se, but to (1) the poverty of the initial models and (2) the difficulty of finding theoryindependent evaluation criteria.
    The time has come to fully reappraise unsupervised parsing models which should be trained on massive amounts of data, and be evaluated in a concrete application.
    There is a final question as to how far the DOP approach to unsupervised parsing can be stretched.
    In principle we can assign all possible syntactic categories, semantic roles, argument structures etc. to a set of given sentences and let the statistics decide which assignments are most useful in parsing new sentences.
    Whether such a massively maximalist approach is feasible can only be answered by empirical investigation in due time.
