her we maintain all variants.
    For example, our naive number detection assigns singular to the mention a group of students and plural to five students.
    When these mentions end up in the same cluster, the resulting number attributes becomes the set {singular, plural}.
    Thus this cluster can later be merged with both singular and plural pronouns.
    Mention selection &#8211; Traditionally, a coreference model attempts to resolve every mention in the text, which increases the likelihood of errors.
    Instead, in each of our models, we exploit the cluster information received from the previous stages by resolving only mentions that are currently first in textual order in their cluster.
    For example, given the following ordered list of mentions, {mi, m2, m3, m4, m5, m6}, where the superscript indicates cluster id, our model will attempt to resolve only m2 and m4.
    These two are the only mentions that have potential antecedents and are currently marked as the first mentions in their clusters.
