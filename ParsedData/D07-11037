			p-value(C(s?, t?)) = ??
			k=C(s?,t?) ph(k) This probability is interpreted as the probability of observing by chance an association that is at least as strong as the given one and hence its significance.
			Agresti (1996) provides an excellent introduction tothis topic and the general ideas of significance test ing in contingency tables.
			Fisher?s exact test of significance is considered agold standard since it repre
