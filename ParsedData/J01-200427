that the relative frequency estimator yields conditional probability distributions of the original rules, given the parent of the left-hand side.
    All of the conditioning information that we will be considering will be of this latter sort: the only novel predictions being made by rule expansions are the node labels of the constituents on the right-hand side.
    Everything else is already specified by the left context.
    We use the relative frequency estimator, and smooth our production probabilities by interpolating the relative frequency estimates with those obtained by &amp;quot;annotating&amp;quot; less contextual information.
    This perspective on conditioning production probabilities makes it easy to see that, in essence, by conditioning these probabilities, we are growing the state space.
    That is, the number of distinct nonterminals grows to include the composite labels; so does the number of distinct productions in the grammar.
    In a top-down parser, each rule expansion is made for a par
