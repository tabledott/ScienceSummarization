ectively.
    The logistic regression models achieve 80.8%, 94.0% and 88.3% for the aspects service, location and rooms.
    We can observe that the topic model, which does not use any explicitly aspect-labeled text, achieves accuracies lower than, but comparable to a supervised model.
  
  
    There is a growing body of work on summarizing sentiment by extracting and aggregating sentiment over ratable aspects and providing corresponding textual evidence.
    Text excerpts are usually extracted through string matching (Hu and Liu, 2004a; Popescu and Etzioni, 2005), sentence clustering (Gamon et al., 2005), or through topic models (Mei et al., 2007; Titov and McDonald, 2008).
    String extraction methods are limited to fine-grained aspects whereas clustering and topic model approaches must resort to ad-hoc means of labeling clusters or topics.
    However, this is the first work we are aware of that uses a pre-defined set of aspects plus an associated signal to learn a mapping from text to an aspect for the
