lar words of orange: (D) peach, grapefruit, yellow, lemon, pink, avocado, tangerine, banana, purple, Santa Ana, strawberry, tomato, red, pineapple, pear, Apricot, apple, green, citrus, mango A common problem of such lists is that they do not discriminate between the senses of polysemous words.
    For example, in (D), the color and fruit senses of orange are mixed up.
    Lin and Pantel (2001) proposed a clustering algorithm, UNICON, which generates similar lists but discriminates between senses of words.
    Later, Pantel and Lin (2002) improved the precision and recall of UNICON clusters with CBC (Clustering by Committee).
    Using sets of representative elements called committees, CBC discovers cluster centroids that unambiguously describe the members of a possible class.
    The algorithm initially discovers committees that are well scattered in the similarity space.
    It then proceeds by assigning elements to their most similar committees.
    After assigning an element to a cluster, CBC removes their
