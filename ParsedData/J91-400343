    Because the verb requires that its first argument be of type transition the complement in 33(c) will not match without some sort of shift.
    It is just this kind of context where the complement (in this case a novel) is coerced to another type.
    The coercion dictates to the complement that it must conform to its type specification and the qualia roles may 20 It should be pointed out that the lexical structure for the verb bake given above in 30 and 31 can more properly be characterized as a process acting on various qualia of the arguments. in fact have values matching the correct type.
    For purposes of illustration, the qualia structure for novel from 41 can be represented as the logical expression in Example 46.
