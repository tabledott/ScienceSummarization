s, 91.5% of the sentences that it selected are subjective, and it found 31.9% of the subjective sentences in the test set).
    This test set consists of 2197 sentences, 59% of which are subjective.
    The high-precision objective classifier takes a different approach.
    Rather than looking for the presence of lexical items, it looks for their absence.
    It classifies a sentence as objective if there are no strongly subjective clues and at most one weakly subjective clue in the current, previous, and next sentence combined.
    Why doesn&#8217;t the objective classifier mirror the subjective classifier, and consult its own list of strongly objective clues?
    There are certainly lexical items that are statistically correlated with the objective class (examples are cardinal numbers (Wiebe et al., 1999), and words such as per, case, market, and total), but the presence of such clues does not readily lead to high precision objective classification.
