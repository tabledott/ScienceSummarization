uously tagged with tag Z in the corpus, and incontext(Z,C) is the number of times a word unambiguously tagged with tag Z occurs in context C in the training corpus.9 Then the score for the transformation Change the tag of a word from x to Y in context Cis: incontext(Y,C)&#8212; freq(Y)I freq(R)* incontext(R,C) A good transformation for removing the part of speech ambiguity of a word is one for which one of the possible tags appears much more frequently as measured by unambiguously tagged words than all others in the context, after adjusting for the differences in relative frequency between the different tags.
    The objective function for this transformation measures this by computing the difference between the number of unambiguous instances of tag Y in context C and the number of unambiguous instances of the most likely tag R in context C, where R E x, R Y, adjusting for relative frequency.
    In each learning iteration, the learner searches for the transformation which maximizes this function.
