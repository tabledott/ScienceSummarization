he log-linear models as well as highly efficient parsing.
    The Maximum Entropy supertagger we use could also be applied to Miyao and Tsujii&#8217;s grammars, although whether similar performance would be obtained depends on the characteristics of the grammar; see subsequent sections for more discussion of this issue in relation to LTAG.
    The second major difference is in our use of a cluster and parallelized estimation algorithm.
    We have found that significantly increasing the size of the parse space available for discriminative estimation, which is possible on the cluster, improves the accuracy of the resulting parser.
    Another advantage of parallelization, as discussed in Section 5.5, is the reduction in estimation time.
    Again, our parallelization techniques could be applied to Miyao and Tsujii&#8217;s framework.
    Malouf and van Noord (2004) present similar work to ours, in the context of an HPSG grammar for Dutch.
    One similarity is that their parsing system uses an HMM tagger before
