    The automata are thus analogous to the rules of a CFG and attempts to use them to model grandparent indices would face difficulties similar to those already described for grammar transformations in CFGs.
    It should be noted that third-order parsers have previously been proposed by McDonald and Pereira (2006), who remarked that their secondorder sibling parser (see Figure 3) could easily be extended to capture m &gt; 1 successive modifiers in O(nm+1) time (ibid., Section 2.2).
    To our knowledge, however, Models 1 and 2 are the first third-order parsing algorithms capable of modeling grandchild parts.
    In our experiments, we find that grandchild interactions make important contributions to parsing performance (see Table 3).
    Carreras (2007) presents a second-order parser that can score both sibling and grandchild parts, with complexities of O(n4) time and O(n3) space.
    An important limitation of the parser&#8217;s factorization is that it only defines grandchild parts for outermost grandchild
