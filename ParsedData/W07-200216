at the purity and entropy measures are not very indicative in this setting.
			For completeness, we also computed the FScore usingthe complete corpus (both train and test).
			The re sults are similar and the ranking is the same.
			We omit them for brevity.
			The results of the supervised evaluation can be seen in Table 4.
			The evaluation is also performed over the test corpus.
			Apart from participants, we also show the most frequent sense (MFS), which tags every test instance with the sense that occurredmost often in the training part.
			Note that the su pervised evaluation combines the information in theclustering solution implicitly with the MFS information via the mapping in the training part.
			Pre vious Senseval evaluation exercises have shown thatthe MFS baseline is very hard to beat by unsuper vised systems.
			In fact, only three of the participant systems are above the MFS baseline, which showsthat the clustering information carries over the map ping successfully for these systems.
