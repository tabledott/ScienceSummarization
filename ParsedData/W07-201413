es an off-the-shelf Machine Learning suite(WEKA), treating the assignment of temporal relations as a simple classification task.
			The features used were the ones provided in theTempEval data annotation together with a few features straightforwardly computed from the docu ment without any deeper NLP analysis.WVALI?s approach for discovering intra sentence temporal relations relies on sentence-levelsyntactic tree generation, bottom-up propaga tion of the temporal relations between syntactic constituents, a temporal reasoning mechanism that relates the two targeted temporal entities to their closest ancestor and then to each other, and on conflict resolution heuristics.
			In establishing the temporal relation between an event and theDocument Creation Time (DCT), the temporal ex pressions directly or indirectly linked to that event are first analyzed and, if no relation is detected, the temporal relation with the DCT is propagatedtop-down in the syntactic tree.
