asculine and feminine pronouns le and la are abbreviated to l' before a word that starts with a vowel, and since in some cases le and la may be unambiguous references while l' is not, the referring expression system must have some knowledge of surface word order and selected content and function words before it can decide whether a pronoun is acceptable; this will not be possible if referring expressions are chosen before syntactic structures are built, as happens in the consensus architecture.
    There is undoubtably some truth to these arguments, but the applications builder also has to consider the engineering reality that the sorts of systems proposed by Appelt, Danlos, and Namer are extremely difficult to build from an engineering perspective.
    The engineering argument for modularization is particularly strong; Marr has put this very well in [Man, 1976, page 485]: Any large computation should be split up and implemented as a collection of small subparts that are as nearly independent of one another a
