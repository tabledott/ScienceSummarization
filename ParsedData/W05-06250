  Generalized Inference With Multiple Semantic Role Labeling Systems
  
    result with joint inference on the development set.
    Overall results on the development and test sets are shown in Table 1.
    Table 2 shows the results of individual systems and the improvement gained by the joint inference on the development set.
    4 Conclusions We present an implementation of SRL system which composed of four stages&#8212;1) pruning, 2) argument identification, 3) argument classification, and 4) inference.
    The inference provides a natural way to take the output of multiple argument classifiers and combines them into a coherent predicate-argument output.
    Significant improvement in overall SRL performance through this inference is illustrated.
