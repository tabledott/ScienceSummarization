e has been a great deal of theoretical and applied work related to collocations that has resulted in different characterizations (e.g., Allerton 1984; Cruse 1986; Menuk 1981).
    Depending on their interests and points of view, researchers have focused on different aspects of collocations.
    One of the most comprehensive definition that has been used can be found in the lexicographic work of Benson and his colleagues (Benson 1990).
    The definition is the following:
  
  
    A collocation is an arbitrary and recurrent word combination (Benson 1990).
    This definition, however, does not cover some aspects and properties of collocations that have consequences for a number of machine applications.
    For example, it has been shown that collocations are difficult to translate across languages&#8212;this fact obviously has a direct application for machine translation.
    Many properties of collocations have been identified in the past; however, the tendency was to focus on a restricted type of collocatio
