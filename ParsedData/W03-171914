e CTB may simply be less consistent than the other corpora in its segmentation; indeed one of the participants (Andi Wu) noted a number of inconsistencies in both the training and the test data (though inconsistencies were also noted for the AS corpus).4 Systems that ran on both closed and open tracks for the same corpus generally did better on the open track, indicating (not surprisingly) that using additional data can help.
    However, the lower-thanbaseline performance of S03 and S11 on ASo may reflect issues with tuning of these additional resources to the particular standard in question.
    Finally note that the top performance of any system on any track was S09 on ASc (F=0.961).
    Since performances close to our ideal topline have occasionally been reported in the literature it is worth bearing the results of this bakeoff in mind when reading such reports.
    Figure 2 plots the recall on out-of-vocabulary words (R ) for all systems and all tracks.
    For this meaas one word in the test data.
