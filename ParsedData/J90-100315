    [T] he question we are asking can be roughly rephrased as follows: how likely is off to occur immediately after set?.
    .
    .
    This is 0.00025 x 0.00055 [P(x) P(y)], which gives us the tiny figure of 0.0000001375 .
    .
    .
    The assumption behind this calculation is that the words are distributed at random in a text [at chance, in our terminology].
    It is obvious to a linguist that this is not so, and a rough measure of how much set and off attract each other is to compare the probability with what actually happens .
    .
    .
    Set off occurs nearly 70 times in the 7.3 million word corpus [P(x, y) = 70/(7.3 x 106) &#187; P(x) P(y)].
    That is enough to show its main patterning and it suggests that in currently-held corpora there will be found sufficient evidence for the description of a substantial collection of phrases .
