    We used the same procedure which is used in (Church, 1988).
    This procedure was developed by Kathiyn Baker (private communication). ratio.
    This probabilistic score is used in a dynamic programming framework in order to find the maximum likelihood alignment of sentences.
    We were led to this approach after noting that the lengths (in characters) of English and German paragraphs are highly correlated (.991), as illustrated in the following figure. length of English paragraphs, while the vertical scale shows the lengths of the corresponding German paragraphs.
    Note that the correlation is quite large (.991).
    Dynamic programming is often used to align two sequences of symbols in a variety of settings, such as genetic code sequences from different species, speech sequences from different speakers, gas chromatograph sequences from different compounds, and geologic sequences from different locations (Sankoff and Kruskal, 1983).
    We could expect these matching techniques to be useful, as long
