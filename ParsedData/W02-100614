 we train a separate classifier for each phrasal word form.
    During testing, if appears in a phrasal word form, the classifier for that phrasal word form is used.
    Otherwise, the classifier for is used.
  
  
    We ran the different learning algorithms using various knowledge sources.
    Table 2 (Table 3) shows each algorithm evaluated and official scores of the top 3 participating systems of SENSEVAL-2 and SENSEVAL-1 the accuracy figures for the different combinations of knowledge sources and learning algorithms for the SENSEVAL-2 (SENSEVAL-1) data set.
    The nine columns correspond to: (i) using only POS of neighboring words (ii) using only single words in the surrounding context with feature selection ( ) (iii) same as (ii) but without feature selection ( ) (iv) using only local collocations with feature selection ( ) (v) same as (iv) but without feature selection ( ) (vi) using only syntactic relations with feature selection on words ( ) (vii) same as (vi) but without feature selection ( ) (viii
