s randomly selected from the Canadian Hansard corpus and manually aligned.
    The alignments are of two types: sure (S) and possible (P).
    S alignments are those which are unambiguous while P alignments are those which are less certain.
    P alignments often appear when a phrase in one language translates as a unit into a phrase in the other language (e.g. idioms, free translations, missing function words) but can also be the result of genuine ambiguity.
    When two annotators disagree, the union of the P alignments produced by each annotator is recorded as the P alignment in the corpus.
    When an S alignment exists, there will always also exist a P alignment such that P S. The English sentences were parsed using a state-of-the-art statistical parser (Charniak, 2000) trained on the University of Pennsylvania Treebank (Marcus et al., 1993). je invoque le R`eglement Since P alignments often align phrasal translations, the number of crossings when P alignments are used will be artificially inflated.
