see that the effect of adding more constraints is quite consistent over the four settings.
  Precision is improved by 1 to 2 per- centage points but recall is decreased a little.
  As a result, the gain in F1 is about 0.5 to 1 point.
  It is not surprising to see this lower recall and higher precision phenomenon after the constraints described in Section 3.4.1 are examined.
  Most constraints punish false non-null output, but do not regulate false null predictions.
  For example, an assignment that has two A1 arguments clearly violates the non-duplication constraint.
  However, if an assignment has no predicted arguments at all, it still satisfies all the constraints.
  5.2 Joint Inference The empirical study in Section 4 indicates that the performance of an SRL system primarily depends on the very first stage?pruning, which is directly derived from the full parse trees.
  This also means that in practice the quality of the syntactic parser is decisive to the quality of the SRL system.
  To improve semantic r
