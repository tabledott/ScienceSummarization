  Disambiguating Nouns Verbs And Adjectives Using Automatically Acquired Selectional Preferences
  
    Selectional preferences have been used by word sense disambiguation (WSD) systems as one source of disambiguating information.
    We evaluate WSD using selectional preferences acquired for English adjective&#8211;noun, subject, and direct object grammatical relationships with respect to a standard test corpus.
    The selectional preferences are specific to verb or adjective classes, rather than individual word forms, so they can be used to disambiguate the co-occurring adjectives and verbs, rather than just the nominal argument heads.
    We also investigate use of the one-senseper-discourse heuristic to propagate a sense tag for a word to other occurrences of the same word within the current document in order to increase coverage.
    Although the preferences perform well in comparison with other unsupervised WSD systems on the same corpus, the results show that for many applications, further knowledge
