, where PSN = {start of word, middle of word, end of word}.2 The position is determined by the location of substring in the source (dictionary) word.
    Positional information is a powerful conditioning feature for rich edit operations.
    For instance, P(e  |a) does not vary greatly between the three positions mentioned above.
    However, P(ent  |ant) is highly dependent upon position.
    People rarely mistype antler as entler, but often mistype reluctant as reluctent.
    Within the noisy channel framework, we can informally think of our error model as follows.
    First, a person picks a word to generate.
    Then she picks a partition of the characters of that word.
    Then she types each partition, possibly erroneously.
    For example, a person might choose to generate the word physical.
    She would then pick a partition from the set of all possible partitions, say: ph y s i c al. Then she would generate each partition, possibly with errors.
    After choosing this particular word and partition,
