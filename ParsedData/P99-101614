rnyms to give better labels to some nodes that are currently labeled simply with the best hypernyms of their subtrees, such as a node labeled &amp;quot;product/analyst&amp;quot; which has two subtrees, one labeled &amp;quot;product&amp;quot; and containing words for things, the other labeled &amp;quot;analyst&amp;quot; and containing names of people.
    We would like to instead label this node something like &amp;quot;entity&amp;quot;.
    It is not yet clear whether corpus data will provide sufficient data for hypernyms at such a high level of the tree, but depending on the intended application for the hierarchy, this level of generality might not be required.
    As noted in the previous section, one major spurious result is a cluster of 51 nouns, mainly people, which is given the hypernym &amp;quot;conductor&amp;quot;.
    The reason for this is that few of the nouns appear with hypernyms, and two of them (Giulini and Ozawa) appear in the same phrase listing conductors, thus giving &amp;quot;conductor&amp
