    As a result, ever since Carletta&#8217;s influential paper, CL researchers have attempted to achieve a value of K (more seldom, of &#945;) above the 0.8 threshold, or, failing that, the 0.67 level allowing for &#8220;tentative conclusions.&#8221; However, the description of the 0.67 boundary in Krippendorff (1980) was actually &#8220;highly tentative and cautious,&#8221; and in later work Krippendorff clearly considers 0.8 the absolute minimum value of &#945; to accept for any serious purpose: &#8220;Even a cutoff point of &#945; = .800 ... is a pretty low standard&#8221; (Krippendorff 2004a, page 242).
    Recent content analysis practice seems to have settled for even more stringent requirements: A recent textbook, Neuendorf (2002, page 3), analyzing several proposals concerning &#8220;acceptable&#8221; reliability, concludes that &#8220;reliability coefficients of .90 or greater would be acceptable to all, .80 or greater would be acceptable in most situations, and below that, there exists great
