    The higher frequency of early updates results in faster iterations of perceptron training.
    Table 2 shows the percentage of early updates and the time per iteration during training.
    While the number of updates is roughly comparable between DP and non-DP, the rate of early updates is much higher with DP, and the time per iteration is consequently shorter.
    Figure 7 shows that training with DP is about 1.2 times faster than non-DP, and achieves +0.2% higher accuracy on the dev set (93.27%).
    Besides training with gold POS tags, we also trained on noisy tags, since they are closer to the test setting (automatic tags on sec 23).
    In that case, we tag the dev and test sets using an automatic POS tagger (at 97.2% accuracy), and tag the training set using four-way jackknifing similar to Collins (2000), which contributes another +0.1% improvement in accuracy on the test set.
