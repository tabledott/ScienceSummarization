 no annotation of training data, nor a large corpus for computing statistical occurrences.
    Finally, we handle a wide array of noun phrase coreference, beyond just pronoun resolution.
  
  
    We have presented a new approach to noun phrase coreference resolution that treats the problem as a clustering task.
    In an evaluation on the MUC6 coreference resolution data set, the approach achieves very promising results, outperforming the only other corpus-based learning approach and producing recall and precision scores that place it firmly between the best and worst coreference systems in the evaluation.
    In contrast to other approaches to coreference resolution, ours is unsupervised and offers several potential advantages over existing methods: no annotated training data is required, the distance metric can be easily extended to account for additional linguistic information as it becomes available to the NLP system, and the clustering approach provides a flexible mechanism for combining a variety of co
