g, etc.
    ), and because very frequent adjectives such as different are at the border between content and function words.
    Following the insight of FS, we treat attributive adjectives as functions over noun meanings; however, noun meanings are vectors, not sets, and the functions are learnt from corpus-based noun-AN vector pairs.
    Original contribution We propose and evaluate a new method to derive distributional representations for ANs, where an adjective is a linear function from a vector (the noun representation) to another vector (the AN representation).
    The linear map for a specific adjective is learnt, using linear regression, from pairs of noun and AN vectors extracted from a corpus.
    Outline Distributional approaches to compositionality are shortly reviewed in Section 2.
    In Section 3, we introduce our proposal.
    The experimental setting is described in Section 4.
    Section 5 provides some empirical justification for using corpusharvested AN vectors as the target of our function
