cal entry is then given by a simple stochastic process known as the Chinese restaurant process (CRP) (Aldous, 1985).
    Imagine a restaurant with an infinite number of tables, each with infinite seating capacity.
    Customers enter the restaurant and seat themselves.
    Let zi be the table chosen by the ith customer.
    Then where z&#8722;i = z1 ... zi&#8722;1, n(z&#8722;i) kis the number of customers already sitting at table k, and K(z&#8722;i) is the total number of occupied tables.
    In our model, the tables correspond to (possibly repeated) lexical entries, having labels generated from the distribution P0.
    The seating arrangement thus specifies a distribution over word tokens, with each customer representing one token.
    This model is an instance of the two-stage modeling framework described by Goldwater et al. (2006), with P0 as the generator and the CRP as the adaptor.
    Our model can be viewed intuitively as a cache model: each word in the corpus is either retrieved from a cache or genera
