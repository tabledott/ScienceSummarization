sed on the tags they have been observed with in the training data.
    We also augment each word with a distributional similarity tag, which we discuss in greater depth in Section 3, and allow tags seen with other words which belong to the same distributional similarity cluster.
    When deciding what tags are allowed for each word, we initially ignore named entity information.
    Once we determine what base tags are allowed for a word, we also allow that tag, augmented with any type of named entity, if the augmented tag is present in the lexicon.
  
  
    We defined features over both the parse rules and the named entities.
    Most of our features are over one or the other aspects of the structure, but not both.
    Both the named entity and parsing features utilize the words of the sentence, as well as orthographic and distributional similarity information.
    For each word we computed a word shape which encoded information about capitalization, length, and inclusion of numbers and other non-alphabetic
