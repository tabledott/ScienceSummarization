g; 96.9% is much greater than the baseline, and indeed, it is considerably above the level of performance that might be expected from state-of-the-art word-sense disambiguation systems.
    Since it is so reliable and so easy to compute, it might be used as a quick-and-dirty measure for testing such systems.
    Unfortunately, we also need a complementary measure that would penalize a system like the baseline system that simply assigned all instances of a polysemous word to the same sense.
    At present, we have yet to identify a quick-and-dirty measure that accomplishes this control, and consequently, we are forced to continue to depend on the relatively expensive panel of judges.
    But, at least, we have been able to establish that it is possible to design a discrimination experiment such that the panel of judges can agree with themselves often enough to be useful.
    In addition, we have established that the discourse constraint on polysemy is extremely strong, much stronger than our ability to tag wor
