    For each word in our opinion word set described in Phase 1, we find a frame to which the word belongs.
    49 frames for verbs and 43 frames for adjectives are collected.
    Table 1 shows examples of selected frames with some of the lexical units those frames cover.
    For example, our system found the frame Desiring from opinionbearing words want, wish, hope, etc.
    Finally, we collected 8256 and 11877 sentences related to selected opinion bearing frames for verbs and adjectives respectively.
    Phase 3: FrameNet expansion Even though Phase 2 searches for a correlated frame for each verb and adjective in our opinionbearing word list, not all of them are defined in FrameNet data.
    Some words such as criticize and harass in our list have associated frames (Case 1), whereas others such as vilify and maltreat do not have those (Case 2).
    For a word in Case 2, we use a clustering algorithms CBC (Clustering By Committee) to predict the closest (most reasonable) frame of undefined word from exist
