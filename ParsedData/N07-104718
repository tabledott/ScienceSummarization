ments, we also compare our method to the constraint satisfaction inference method as described in Section 4.
    The results are reported in word accuracy rate based on the 10-fold cross validation, with the mean and standard deviation values.
    Table 3 shows word accuracy performance across a variety of methods.
    We show results comparing the one-to-one aligner described in Section 2.1 and the one-to-one aligner provided by the PRONALSYL challenge.
    The PRONALSYS one-to-one alignments are taken directly from the PRONALSYL challenge, whose method is based on an EM algorithm.
    For both alignments, we use instancebased learning as the prediction model.
    Overall, our one-to-one alignments outperform the alignments provided by the data sets for all corpora.
    The main difference between the PRONALSYS one-to-one alignment and our one-to-one alignment is that our aligner does not allow a null letter on the grapheme side.
    Consider the word abomination [ a b n m i n e f a n ]: the first six letter
