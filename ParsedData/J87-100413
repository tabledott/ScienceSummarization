orresponds to the root of the tree.
    We call this a tree-structured stack.
    When the top vertex is popped, the tree-structured stack is split into the original number of stacks.
    In general, the system maintains a number of tree-structured stacks in parallel, so stacks are represented as a forest.
    Figure 2.4 shows a snapshot of the tree-structured stack immediately after shifting the word with.
    In contrast to the previous example, the telescope will be parsed only once.
    Although the amount of computation is significantly reduced by the stack combination technique, the number of branches of the tree-structured stack (the number of bottoms of the stack) that must be maintained still grows exponentially as ambiguities are encountered.
    In the next subsection, we describe a further modification in which stacks are represented as a directed acyclic graph, in order to avoid such inefficiency.
    So far, when a stack is split, a copy of the whole stack is made.
    However, we do not necessa
