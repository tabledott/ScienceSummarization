on.
    As a result we can make some inferences with very high confidence, but we cannot make very many of them.
    In stage three we combine the values produced by the various similarity modules in stage two using a pre-specified algorithm.
    The output of this stage is a single table of dissimilarity values (as required by the next stage) having one entry for each adjective pair.
    Currently we have only the two similarity modules described in the previous subsection, so we employ the following simple algorithm: for any pair of adjectives (x,y) do if the adjective-adjective module has no opinion on (x,y) then dissimilarity = 1 - (the similarity reported by the adjective-noun module) else dissimilarity = some constant As can be easily seen, the algorithm has complete confidence in the results of the adjective-adjective module whenever that module has an opinion; when it does not, the algorithm uses the similarity value produced by the adjective-noun module, after a simple linear transformation is applie
