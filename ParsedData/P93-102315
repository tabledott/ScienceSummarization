 to the range 0 to 1 using a simple linear transformation.
    The second similarity module utilizes the knowledge offered by the observed adjectiveadjective pairs.
    We know that the adjectives which appear in any such pair cannot be part of the same group, so the module produces zero similarity for all such pairs.
    The module does not output any similarity value for pairs of adjectives which have not been observed together in the same minimal NP.
    The two modules produce results of a significantly different character.
    The adjective-noun module always outputs a similarity value for any pair of adjectives, but these values tend to be around the middle of the range of possible values; rarely will the pattern of similarity or dissimilarity be strong enough to produce a value which has a large deviation from 0.5.
    This compression of the range of the similarity values can be attributed to the existence of many ties and many adjective-noun pairs with low frequencies, as would be expected by Zipf s
