    In our implementation, cooccurrence pairs were used instead of lexical cooccurrence within syntactic relations (as in the original work), to save the need of parsing the corpus.
    We randomly selected from a software manual a set of 269 examples of ambiguous Hebrew words in translating Hebrew sentences to English.
    The expected success rate of random selection for these examples was 23%.
    The similarity based estimation method was used to estimate the expected frequency of unobserved cooccurrence pairs, in cases where none of the alternative pairs occurred in the corpus (each pair corresponds to an alternative target word).
    Using this method, which we term Augmented TWS, 41 additional cases were disambiguated, relative to the original method.
    We thus achieved an increase of about 15% in the applicability (coverage) of the TWS method, with a small decrease in the overall precision.
    The performance of the Augmented TWS method on these 41 examples was about 15%
