constraints on linear order only indirectly reflect requirements on the tree (because related facts need not appear consecutively).
    Though in fact we will use the idea of planning via a linear sequence later, we would like to experiment using measures of quality that are applied directly to the trees.
    We also have a number of factors that we would like to take account of in the evaluation (see section 3 below).
  
  
    Building a good RS tree is a search problem.
    Stochastic search methods are a form of heuristic search that use the following generic algorithm: Use these to generate one or more new random variations.
    Add these to the set, possibly removing less preferred items in order to keep the size constant.
    Examples of stochastic search approaches are stochastic hillclimbing, simulated annealing and evolutionary algorithms.
    The approaches differ according to factors like the size of the population of possible solutions that is maintained, the operations for generating new possibi
