 degrees of polysemy, using different sense inventories; and (2) Determine the usefulness of sense annotated data collected over the Web (as opposed to other traditional approaches for building semantically annotated corpora).
    The results of 47 systems that participated in this event tentatively suggest that supervised machine learning techniques can significantly improve over the most frequent sense baseline, and also that it is possible to design unsupervised techniques for reliable word sense disambiguation.
    Additionally, this task has highlighted creation of testing and training data by leveraging the knowledge of Web volunteers.
    The training and test data sets used in this exercise are available online from http://www.senseval.org and http://teach-computers.org.
