    Whereas thematic roles tend to be arguments mainly of verbs, frame elements can be arguments of any predicate, and the FrameNet database thus includes nouns and adjectives as well as verbs.
    The examples above also illustrate a few of the phenomena that make it hard to identify frame elements automatically.
    Many of these are caused by the fact that there is not always a direct correspondence between syntax and semantics.
    Whereas the subject of blame is often the JUDGE, the direct object of blame can be an EVALUEE (e.g., the poor in &#8220;blaming the poor&#8221;) or a REASON (e.g., everything in &#8220;blame everything on coyotes&#8221;).
