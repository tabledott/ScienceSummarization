tching mechanisms in the parse tree kernel calculation.
    Finally, it is worth noting that by introducing more individual kernels our method can easily scale to cover more features from a multitude of sources (e.g.
    Wordnet, gazetteers, etc) that can be brought to bear on the task of relation extraction.
    In addition, we can also easily implement the feature weighting scheme by adjusting the eqn.
    (2) and the rule (2) in calculating &#8710;(n1,n2) (see subsection 3.1).
  
  
    Kernel functions have nice properties.
    In this paper, we have designed a composite kernel for relation extraction.
    Benefiting from the nice properties of the kernel methods, the composite kernel could well explore and combine the flat entity features and the structured syntactic features, and therefore outperforms previous bestreported feature-based methods on the ACE corpus.
    To our knowledge, this is the first research to demonstrate that, without the need for extensive feature engineering, an individual tree k
