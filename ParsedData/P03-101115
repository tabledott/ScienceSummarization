    As with the tree-to-string cloning operation, this independence assumption is essential to keep the complexity polynomial in the size of the input sentences.
    For reference, the parameterization of all four models is summarized in Table 1.
  
  
    For our experiments, we used a parallel KoreanEnglish corpus from the military domain (Han et al., 2001).
    Syntactic trees have been annotated by hand for both the Korean and English sentences; in this paper we will be using only the Korean trees, modeling their transformation into the English text.
    The corpus contains 5083 sentences, of which we used 4982 as training data, holding out 101 sentences for evaluation.
    The average Korean sentence length was 13 words.
    Korean is an agglutinative language, and words often contain sequences of meaning-bearing suffixes.
    For the purposes of our model, we represented the syntax trees using a fairly aggressive tokenization, breaking multimorphemic words into separate leaves of the tree.
