ation system requires two ingredients: We fashion our closeness metric after the highly successful word error rate metric used by the speech recognition community, appropriately modified for multiple reference translations and allowing for legitimate differences in word choice and word order.
    The main idea is to use a weighted average of variable length phrase matches against the reference translations.
    This view gives rise to a family of metrics using various weighting schemes.
    We have selected a promising baseline metric from this family.
    In Section 2, we describe the baseline metric in detail.
    In Section 3, we evaluate the performance of BLEU.
    In Section 4, we describe a human evaluation experiment.
    In Section 5, we compare our baseline metric performance with human evaluations.
  
  
    Typically, there are many &#8220;perfect&#8221; translations of a given source sentence.
    These translations may vary in word choice or in word order even when they use the same words.
