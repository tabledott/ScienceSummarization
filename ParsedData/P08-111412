, we define a version of the model, NP2, in which NP= and NP+ are both included as features, with separate weights ANP= and ANP+.
    &#8226; We define a set of &#8220;standard&#8221; linguistic labels containing {CP, IP, NP, VP, PP, ADJP, ADVP, QP, LCP, DNP} and excluding other labels such as PRN (parentheses), FRAG (fragment), etc.8 We define feature XP= as the disjunction of {CP=, IP=, ..., DNP=}; i.e. its value equals 1 for a rule if the span of f exactly covers a constituent having any of the standard labels.
    The 7Formally, AVP+ simply contributes to the sum in expression (1), as with all features in the model, but weight optimization using minimum error rate training should, and does, automatically assign this feature a negative weight.
    8We map SBAR and S labels in Arabic parses to CP and IP, respectively, consistent with the Chinese parses.
    We map Chinese DP labels to NP.
    DNP and LCP appear only in Chinese.
    We ran no ADJP experiment in Chinese, because this label virtually aways spa
