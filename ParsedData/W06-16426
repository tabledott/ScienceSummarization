221; to obtain positive and negative clues for document classification.
    In this paper, we use contextual information which is wider than for the contexts they used, and address the problem of acquiring lexical entries from the noisy clues.
    Inter-sentential contexts as in our approach were used as a clue also for subjectivity analysis (Riloff and Wiebe, 2003; Pang and Lee, 2004), which is two-fold classification into subjective and objective sentences.
    Compared to it, this paper solves a more difficult problem: three-fold classification into positive, negative and non-polar expressions using imperfect coherency in terms of sentiment polarity.
    Learning methods for phrase-level sentiment analysis closely share an objective of our approach.
    Popescu and Etzioni (2005) achieved high-precision opinion phrases extraction by using relaxation labeling.
    Their method iteratively assigns a polarity to a phrase, relying on semantic orientation of co-occurring words in specific relations in a sentenc
