Carthy (1996).
    As explained in McCarthy (1996), the reason for this low recall is that RESOLVE takes only the &amp;quot;relevant entities&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;relevant references&amp;quot; as input, where the relevant entities and relevant references are restricted to &amp;quot;person&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;organization.&amp;quot; In addition, because of limitations of the noun phrase detection module, nested phrases are not extracted and therefore do not take part in coreference.
    Nested phrases can include prenominal modifiers, possessive pronouns, and so forth.
    Therefore, the number of candidate markables to be used for coreference is small.
    On the other hand, the markables extracted by our system include nested noun phrases, MUC-style named entity types (money, percent, date, etc.
    ), and other types not defined by MUC.
    These markables will take part in coreference.
    About 3,600 toplevel markables are extracted from the 30 MUC-6 test documents by our system.
