			goal of this paper is to design a disambiguationmethod that 1) learns the magnitude of these correlations, and 2) uses these correlations in a scor ing function, together with the cosine similarity.
			Our intuition is that, given the query context on the left, such a ranking function has a better chance of ranking the ?composer?
			entity higher than the ?wrestler?
			entity, when compared with the simple cosine similarity baseline.
			We consider using a linear ranking function as follows: e^ = argmax e k w (q; e k ) (3) The feature vector (q; e k ) contains a dedicated feature  cos for cosine similarity, and jV j  jCj features  w;c corresponding
