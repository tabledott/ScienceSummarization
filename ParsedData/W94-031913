-way pipeline is worse at handling some linguistic phenomena than a richlyconnected architecture, but this is not the end of the story for the system-building engineer; he or she has to balance the cost of the pipeline being inefficient and/or inelegant at handling some phenomena against the benefit of the pipeline being a much easier structure to build and debug.
    We have insufficient engineering data at present to make any well-substantiated claims about whether the one-way pipeline has the optimal cost/benefit tradeoff or not (and in any case this will probably_ depend somewhat on the circumstances of each application [Reiter and Mellish, 1993]), but the circumstantial evidence on this question is striking; despite the fact that so many theoretical papers have argued against pipelines and very few (if any) have argued for pipelines, every one of the applicationsoriented systems examined in this survey chose to use the one-way pipeline architecture.
    In other words, an applications systems builder can
