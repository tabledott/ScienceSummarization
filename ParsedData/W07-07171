    This is especially the case for bilingual applications, because parallel training corpora are relatively rare and tend to be drawn from specific domains such as parliamentary proceedings.
    In this paper we address the problem of adapting a statistical machine translation system by adjusting its parameters based on some information about a test domain.
    We assume two basic settings.
    In cross-domain adaptation, a small sample of parallel in-domain text is available, and it is used to optimize for translating future texts drawn from the same domain.
    In dynamic adaptation, no domain information is available ahead of time, and adaptation is based on the current source text under translation.
    Approaches developed for the two settings can be complementary: an in-domain development corpus can be used to make broad adjustments, which can then be fine tuned for individual source texts.
    Our method is based on the classical technique of mixture modeling (Hastie et al., 2001).
