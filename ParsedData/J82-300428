ects, and a vector for the union of all possible VPs, and then compares (intersects) these vectors to check if there are any interpretations that meet the constraint.
    A system such as this, which keeps the parses in factored form, is much more efficient than one that multiplies them out.
    Even if semantics cannot take advantage of the factoring, there is no harm in keeping the representation in factored form, because it is straightforward to expand (23) into a list of trees (though it may be somewhat slow).
    This example is relatively simple because &amp;quot;is&amp;quot; helps the parser determine the value of i and j.
    Now let us return to example (19b) where &amp;quot;is&amp;quot; does not separate the two strings of PPs.
    Again, we determine the power series by multiplying the two subcases: However, this form is not so useful for parsing because the parser cannot easily determine i and j, the number of prepositional phrases in the subject and the number in the predicate.
    It appears the
