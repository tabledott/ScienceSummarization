    The one proposal for measuring agreement on markable identification we are aware of is the &#945;U coefficient, a non-trivial variant of &#945; proposed by Krippendorff (1995).
    A full presentation of the proposal would require too much space, so we will just present the core idea.
    Unitizing is conceived of as consisting of two separate steps: identifying boundaries between units, and selecting the units of interest.
    If a unit identified by one coder overlaps a unit identified by the other coder, the amount of disagreement is the square of the lengths of the non-overlapping segments (see Figure 2); if a unit identified by one coder does not overlap any unit of interest identified by the other coder, the amount of disagreement is the square of the length of the whole unit.
    This distance metric is used in calculating observed and expected disagreement, and &#945;U itself.
    We refer the reader to Krippendorff (1995) for details.
    Krippendorff&#8217;s &#945;U is not applicable to all CL
