didates in S become the input anchor-sets for the template extraction phase, for example, {Aspirinsubj&#8592; , heart attackobj&#8592;} for &#8216;prevent&#8217;.
    The Template Extraction algorithm accepts as its input a list of anchor sets extracted from ASE for each pivot template.
    Then, TE generates a set of syntactic templates which are supposed to maintain an entailment relationship with the initial pivot template.
    TE performs three main steps, described in the following subsections: For each input anchor set, TE acquires from the Web a sample corpus of sentences containing it.
    For example, a sentence from the sample corpus for {aspirin, heart attack} is: &#8220;Aspirin stops heart attack?&#8221;.
    All of the sample sentences are then parsed with MINIPAR (Lin, 1998), which generates from each sentence a syntactic directed acyclic graph (DAG) representing the dependency structure of the sentence.
    Each vertex in this graph is labeled with a word and some morphological information; eac
