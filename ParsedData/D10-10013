tees of convergence for our algorithms by showing that they are instantiations of Lagrangian relaxation, a general method for solving linear programs of a particular form.
    Finally, we describe experiments that demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.
    First, we consider the integration of the generative model for phrase-structure parsing of Collins (2003), with the second-order discriminative dependency parser of Koo et al. (2008).
    This is an interesting problem in its own right: the goal is to inject the high performance of discriminative dependency models into phrase-structure parsing.
    The method uses off-theshelf decoders for the two models.
    We find three main results: 1) in spite of solving an LP relaxation, empirically the method finds an exact solution on over 99% of the examples; 2) the method converges quickly, typically requiring fewer than 10 iterations of decoding; 3) the method gives gains over a baseline method that forces the phrase-structure parser to produce the same d
