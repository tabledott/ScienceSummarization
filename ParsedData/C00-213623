  The prior work most closely related to our own is that of (R.ilotf, 1996), who also seeks to lmild pattenls automatically without the need to annotate a corpus with the information to be extracted.
  Itowever, her work ditfers trom 01217 own in several i lnportant respects.
  First, her patterns identit~y phrases that fill individual slots in the template, without specifying how these slots may be combined at a later stage into complete templates.
  In contrast, our pro- cedure discovers complete, multi-slot event pat- 945 terns.
  Second, her procedure relies on a cort)us in which |;tie documents have been classified for relevance by hand (it was applied to the MUC-3 task, tbr which over 1500 classified documents are available), whereas ExDIsco requires no manual relevance judgements.
  While classify- ing documents tbr relevance is much easier than annotating docunlents with the info
