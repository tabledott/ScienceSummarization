    Ambiguity remains one of the main challenges in the processing of natural language text.
    Efforts to resolve it have traditionally focussed on the development of full-coverage parsers, extensive lexicons, and vast repositories of world knowledge.
    For some natural-language applications, the tremendous effort involved in developing these tools is still required, but in other applications, such as information extraction, there has been a recent trend towards favoring minimal parsing and shallow knowledge (Cowie and Lehnert 1996).
    In its minimal use of resources, Nominator follows this trend: it relies on no syntactic information and on a small semantic lexicon &#8212; an authority list which could easily be modified to include information about new domains.
    Other advantages of using limited resources are robustness and execution speed, which are important in processing large amounts of text.
    In another sense, however, development of
