e for f is D(Igold) &#8212; D(311q0/).
    We compute the score for each candidate feature and add to the field that feature with the highest score.
    To illustrate, consider the two atomic features a and B.
    Given the null field as old field, the best weight for a is 0 = 7/5, and the best weight for B is 0 = 1.
    This yields q and D(1.711f) as in Figure 15.
    The better feature is a, and a would be added to the field Comparing features. qa is the best (minimum-divergence) distribution that can be generated by adding the feature &amp;quot;a&amp;quot; to the field, and qB is the best distribution generable by adding the feature &amp;quot;B&amp;quot;. if these were the only two choices.
    Intuitively, a is better than B because a permits us to distinguish the set {xi, x3} from the set {x2, x4}; the empirical probability of the former is 1/3+1/4 = 7/12 whereas the empirical probability of the latter is 5/12.
    Distinguishing these sets permits us to model the empirical distribution better (since the
