enerate the first word, we must make a transition from one name-class to another, as well as calculate the likelihood of that word.
    Our intuition was that a word preceding the start of a name-class (such as &amp;quot;Mr.&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;President&amp;quot; or other titles preceding the PERSON name-class) and the word following a name-class would be strong indicators of the subsequent and preceding name-classes, respectively.
    2 Non-english languages tend to use the comma and period in the reverse way in which English does, i.e., the comma is a decimal point and the period separates groups of three digits in large numbers.
    However, the re-ordering of the precedence of the two relevant word-features had little effect when decoding Spanish, so they were left as is.
    3 Although Spanish has many lower-case words in organization names.
    See &#167;4.1 on p. 6 for more details.
    Accordingly, the probabilitiy for generating the first word of a name-class is factored into two parts: Pr(NC I NC_
