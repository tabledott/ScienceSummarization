the more information there is about it, but the less information there may be about a corresponding preference.
    The paradox arises because the failure of a very specific preference introduces significant uncertainty as to why the preference failed.
    Failing to meet a very general preference is always strong information because, in practice, the purpose of such preferences is to eliminate the grossly inappropriate &#8212; such as trying to use a relation with a physical object when it should only be applied to events.
    The specificity function in this case returns a value whose magnitude is the same as the specificity of the complement of the concept (i.e., the positive specificity less the maximum specificity, 10.)
    The result is a negative number whose absolute value is greater than it would be by default.
    For example, if a preference is for the concept c-obj ect, which has a positive specificity of 1, and this concept fails to match the input, then the preference value for the cue will be &
