			4.4 Experiments with Noisy NL Sentences.
			Any real world application in which semantic parsers would be used to interpret natural language of a user is likely to face noise in the input.
			If the user is interacting through spontaneous speech and the input to the semantic parser is coming form the output of a speech recognition system then there are many ways in which noise could creep in the NL sentences: interjections (like um?s and ah?s), environment noise (like door slams, phone rings etc.), out-of-domain words, grammatically ill-formed utterances etc.
