 densely interrelated discussions linked together, one after another.
    This topology maps nicely onto that of viewing documents as a sequence of densely interrelated subtopical discussions, one following another.
    This assumption, as will be seen, is not always valid, but is nevertheless quite useful.
    This theoretical stance bears a close resemblance to Chafe's notion of The Flow Model of discourse (Chafe 1979), in description of which he writes (pp 179-180): Our data.., suggest that as a speaker moves from focus to focus (or from thought to thought) there are certain points at which there may be a more or less radical change in space, time, character configuration, event structure, or, even, world.
    ... At points where all of these change in a maximal way, an episode boundary is strongly present.
