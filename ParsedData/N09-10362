for structural inference, i.e., inferring the features relevant to a particular problem as well as their weights.
    (Here &#8220;nonparametric&#8221; means that the models do not have a fixed set of parameters; our nonparametric models do have parameters, but the particular parameters in a model are learned along with their values).
    Dirichlet Processes and their associated predictive distributions, Chinese Restaurant Processes, are one kind of nonparametric Bayesian model that has received considerable attention recently, in part because they can be composed in hierarchical fashion to form Hierarchical Dirichlet Processes (HDP) (Teh et al., 2006).
    Lexical acquisition is an ideal test-bed for exploring methods for inferring structure, where the features learned are the words of the language.
    (Even the most hard-core nativists agree that the words of a language must be learned).
    We use the unsupervised word segmentation problem as a test case for evaluating structural inference in this paper.
