			The paper?s global optimization approach and use of multiple sources of constraints on a word?s semantic orientation is similar to ours, but the mechanism differs and they currently omit the use of syntactic information.
			Subjective phrases are used by (Turney, 2002; Pang and Vaithyanathan, 2002; Kushal et al, 2003; Kim and Hovy, 2004) and others in order to classify reviews or sentences as positive or negative.
			So far, OPINE?s focus has been on extracting and analyzing opinion phrases corresponding to specific features in specific sentences, rather than on determining sentence or review polarity.
	
	
			OPINE is an unsupervised information extraction systemwhich extracts fine-grained features, and associated opinions, from reviews.
			OPINE?s use of the Web as a corpus helps identify product features with improved preci sion compared with previous work.
			OPINE uses a novel relaxation-labeling technique to determine the semantic orientation of potential opinion words in the context ofthe ext
