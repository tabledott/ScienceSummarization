    The overall system evaluation includes both intrinsic and extrinsic evaluation.
    In the intrinsic evaluation, we asked human subjects to compare the quality of extraction-based summaries and their revised versions produced by our sentence reduction and combination modules.
    We selected 20 documents; three different automatic summarizers were used to generate a summary for each document, producing 60 summaries in total.
    These summaries are all extraction-based.
    We then ran our sentence reduction and sentence combination system to revise the summaries, producing a revised version for each summary.
    We presented human subjects with the full documents, the extraction-based summaries, and their revised versions, and asked them to compare the extraction-based summaries and their revised versions.
    The human subjects were asked to score the conciseness of the summaries (extractionbased or revised) based on a scale from 0 to 10 the higher the score, the more concise a summary is
