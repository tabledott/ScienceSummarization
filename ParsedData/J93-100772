rence between these two groups lies in the types of words involved.
    Lexical collocations roughly consist of syntagmatic affinities among open class words such as verbs, nouns, adjectives, and adverbs.
    In contrast, grammatical collocations generally involve at least one closed class word among particles, prepositions, and auxiliary verbs.
    Examples of grammatical collocations are: put-up, as in &amp;quot;I can't put up with this anymore,&amp;quot; and fill-out, as in &amp;quot;You have to fill out your 1040 form.&amp;quot;19 Consider the sentences below: 6.

    * &amp;quot;... a new initiative in the aftershocks of the PLO's evacuation from Beirut.&amp;quot; These examples clearly show that the choices of the prepositions are arbitrary.
