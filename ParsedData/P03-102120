 that for some evaluation criteria there is a correlation with human subjective evaluation of fluency and adequacy (Papineni et al., 2001; Doddington, 2002).
    However, the different evaluation criteria yield quite different results on our Chinese&#8211;English translation task and therefore we expect that not all of them correlate equally well to human translation quality.
    The following important questions should be answered in the future: How many parameters can be reliably estimated using unsmoothed minimum error rate criteria using a given development corpus size?
    We expect that directly optimizing error rate for many more parameters would lead to serious overfitting problems.
    Is it possible to optimize more parameters using the smoothed error rate criterion?
    Which error rate should be optimized during training?
    This relates to the important question of which automatic evaluation measure is optimally correlated to human assessment of translation quality.
    Note, that this approach
