 is Compositional The mapping [] : h&#931;, opi &#8722;&#8594; hhI, I, Gi, fi is a homomorphism (so [op(a1, a2)] = f([a1], [a2])).
    This follows from the definitions of [], op and f.
  
  
    We now start considering the elaborations necessary for real grammars.
    As we suggested earlier, it is necessary to have multiple labelled holes.
    There will be a fixed inventory of labels for any grammar framework, although there may be some differences between variants.3 In HPSG, complements are represented using a list, but in general there will be a fixed upper limit for the number of complements so we can label holes COMP1, COMP2, etc.
    The full inventory of labels for the ERG is: SUBJ, SPR, SPEC, COMP1, COMP2, COMP3 and MOD (see Pollard and Sag, 1994).
    To illustrate the way the formalization goes with multiple slots, consider opsubj: Definition 6 The definition of opsubj where Tr stands for transitive closure.
    There will be similar operations opcomp1, opcomp2 etc for each labelled hole.
    The
