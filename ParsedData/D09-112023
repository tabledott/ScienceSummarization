erence resolution.
    Indeed, we suspect that further improving the syntactic and semantic modules in our system may produce greater error reductions than any other route forward.
    Of course, a system which is rich in all axes will find some advantage over any simplified approach.
    Nonetheless, our coreference system, despite being relatively simple and having no tunable parameters or complexity beyond the non-reference complexity of its component modules, manages to outperform state-of-the-art unsupervised coreference resolution and be broadly comparable to state-of-the-art supervised systems.
