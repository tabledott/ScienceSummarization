codes many possibilities.
    The final stage contains all back-transliterations suggested by the models, and we finally extract the best one.
    We start with the masutaazutoonamento problem from Section 1.
    Our OCR observes: -q :/ j.
    This string has two recognition errors: (ku) for (ta), and .1- (chi) for t (na).
    We turn the string into a chained 12-state/11-arc WFSA and compose it with the P(klo) model.
    This yields a fatter 12-state/15-arc WFSA, which accepts the correct spelling at a lower probability.
    Next comes the P(jlk) model, which produces a 28-state/31-arc WFSA whose highest-scoring sequence is: masutaazutoochiment o Next comes P(e1j), yielding a 62-state/241-arc WFSA whose best sequence is: Next to last comes P(wle), which results in a 2982state/4601-arc WFSA whose best sequence (out of myriads) is: masters tone am ent awe This English string is closest phonetically to the Japanese, but we are willing to trade phonetic proximity for more sensical English; we rescore this WFSA b
