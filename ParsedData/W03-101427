sed during the second bootstrapping cycle contained exactly the same objective sentences as the first cycle, half of the same subjective sentences as the first cycle, and 9,500 brand new subjective sentences.
    On this second cycle of bootstrapping, the extraction pattern learner generated many new patterns that were not discovered during the first cycle.
    4,248 new patterns were found that have 01&gt;2 and 02&gt;.60.
    If we consider only the strongest (most subjective) extraction patterns, 308 new patterns were found that had 01&gt;10 and 02&gt;1.0.
    This is a substantial set of new extraction patterns that seem to be very highly correlated with subjectivity.
    An open question was whether the new patterns provide additional coverage.
    To assess this, we did a simple test: we added the 4,248 new patterns to the original set of patterns learned during the first bootstrapping cycle.
    Then we repeated the same analysis that we depict in Figure 4.
    In general, the recall numbers increased b
