Set At step (5) in the search we expand the space 7 ~ of putative features based on the feature last selected from 72 for addition to M.  Given an n-gram feature f~ (i.e., of type "word", "class" or"mixed") that was last added to M,  we create 2m.4 new n + 1-gram features which ask questions about class bits in addition to the questions asked in fi.
  E.g., let fi(h, d) constrain d = 0 and constrain h with the questions v == imposed    , P ==   on    Then, given fi(h,d), the 2m new features generated for just the Head Noun are the following: V ==   imposed   ,  P == ~on   , B i t  1 fo r  Noun == 0 V ==   imposed   ,  P ==  on   , B i t  1 fo r  Noun == 1 V ==   imposed   ,  P == B i t  m fo r  Noun == 0 on V ==   imposed   ,  P ==  on   , B i t  m fo r  Noun == 1 We construct he remaining 6m features imilarly from the remaining 3head words.
