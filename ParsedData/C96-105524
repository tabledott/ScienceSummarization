t intersection with the syntactic odes for attempt occurs with the verb try (TI T3 T4 N).
  How- ever, Levins class 31.1 is not the correct class for at- tempt since this sense of try has a "negative amuse" meaning (e.g., Johns behavior tried my patience.
  In fact, the (:odes T1 l3 14 are not part of the canonical class-code mapping associated with class 31.1.
  Thus, at- tempt falls under case 2(b) of the algorithm, and a new class is hypothesized.
  This is a case where word-sense disambiguation has allowed us to classify a new word and to enhance Levins verb classification by adding a new class to the word try as well.
  In our experiment;s, our algorithm found severM additional non-Levin verbs that fell into this newly hypothesized (;lass, including aspire, attempt, dare, decide, desire, elect, need, and swear.
  We have automatically classified 10,000 "unknown" verbs, i.e., those not occurring in the Levin classifica- tion, using this technique.
  These verbs are taken from i e , translations provided i
