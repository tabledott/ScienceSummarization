To demonstrate the wide variation in topics, we calculated the proportion of tokens in each language assigned to each topic.
    Figure 8 represents the estimated probabilities of topics given a specific language.
    Competitive cross-country skiing (left) accounts for a significant proportion of the text in Finnish, but barely exists in Welsh and the languages in the Southeastern region.
    Meanwhile, interest in actors and actresses (center) is consistent across all languages.
    Finally, historical topics, such as the Byzantine and Ottoman empires (right) are strong in all languages, but show geographical variation: interest centers around the empires.
  
  
    We introduced a polylingual topic model (PLTM) that discovers topics aligned across multiple languages.
    We analyzed the characteristics of PLTM in comparison to monolingual LDA, and demonstrated that it is possible to discover aligned topics.
    We also demonstrated that relatively small numbers of topically comparable document tuples are s
