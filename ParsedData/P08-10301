n which an event may be expressed, distinguishing events of different types, and finding the arguments of an event are all challenging tasks.
    Fortunately, many of these events will be reported multiple times, in different forms, both within the same document and within topicallyrelated documents (i.e. a collection of documents sharing participants in potential events).
    We can take advantage of these alternate descriptions to improve event extraction in the original document, by favoring consistency of interpretation across sentences and documents.
    Several recent studies involving specific event types have stressed the benefits of going beyond traditional singledocument extraction; in particular, Yangarber (2006) has emphasized this potential in his work on medical information extraction.
    In this paper we demonstrate that appreciable improvements are possible over the variety of event types in the ACE (Automatic Content Extraction) evaluation through the use of cross-sentence and cross-document
