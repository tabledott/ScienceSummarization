onetic-Based vs. Spelling Based on Names in the Dictionary As we have described in Section 4, the phoneticbased model uses a pronunciation dictionary to convert an English phoneme sequence to an English word sequence.
    Consequently, only words with known pronunciations (from the dictionary) can be generated using this model.
    Therefore, the spellingbased model generally has a higher transliteration accuracy.
    But, does the spelling-based model generate more accurate transliterations for words with known pronunciations?
    We expected the answer to this question to be no.
    But much to our surprise, the spelling-based model produced more accurate transliterations on all categories, as shown in Table 8.
    When top-20 transliterations were considered, the spelling-based model was slightly less accurate.
    As expected, the transliterations for names in the pronunciation dictionary are much more accurate than those that are not in it.
    This is because the word unigram model P(w) was trained on n
