rted upon yet.Thus the graph used in most of this paper repre sents only nouns.
			Each node represents a noun and two nodes have a link between them if they co-occur separated by the conjunctions and or or, and each link is weighted according to the number of times the co-occurrence is observed.Various cutoff functions were used to deter mine how many times a relationship must be observed to be counted as a link in the graph.
			A well-behaved option was to take the top nneighbours of each word, where n could be determined by the user.
			In this way the link weighting scheme was reduced to a link-ranking scheme.
			One consequence of this decision was that links to more common words were preferred over links to rarer words.
			This decision may have effectively boosted precision at the expense of recall, because the preferred links are to fairlycommon and (probably) more stable words.
