m 500 paraphrasing pairs from the lexical paraphrases produced by our algorithm.
    These pairs were used as test data and also to evaluate whether humans agree on paraphrasing judgments.
    The judges were given a page of guidelines, defining paraphrase as &#8220;approximate conceptual equivalence&#8221;.
    The main dilemma in designing the evaluation is whether to include the context: should the human judge see only a paraphrase pair or should a pair of sentences containing these paraphrases also be given?
    In a similar MT task &#8212; evaluation of word-to-word translation &#8212; context is usually included (Melamed, 2001).
    Although paraphrasing is considered to be context dependent, there is no agreement on the extent.
    To evaluate the influence of context on paraphrasing judgments, we performed two experiments &#8212; with and without context.
    First, the human judge is given a paraphrase pair without context, and after the judge entered his answer, he is given the same pair with its su
