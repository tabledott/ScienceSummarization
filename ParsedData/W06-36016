 partial English&#8221; sentence &#8220;qiangshou VP o&#8221; as shown in Fig.
    3 (c).
    Our recursion goes on to translate the VP sub-tree.
    Here we use the rule r3 for the passive construction: which captures the fact that the agent (NP-C, &#8220;the police&#8221;) and the verb (VBN, &#8220;killed&#8221;) are always inverted between English and Chinese in a passive voice.
    Finally, we apply rules r&#65533; and r5 which perform phrasal translations for the two remaining subtrees in (d), respectively, and get the completed Chinese string in (e).
  
  
    It is helpful to compare this approach with recent efforts in statistical MT.
    Phrase-based models (Koehn et al., 2003; Och and Ney, 2004) are good at learning local translations that are pairs of (consecutive) sub-strings, but often insufficient in modeling the reorderings of phrases themselves, especially between language pairs with very different word-order.
    This is because the generative capacity of these models lies within the realm of
