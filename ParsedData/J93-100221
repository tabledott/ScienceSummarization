types that together define a CFG.
    This allows probabilities concerning dominance, associated with ID rules, to be factored out from those concerning precedence, associated with LP rules.
    In this experiment, a supervised training regime was employed.
    A grammar containing 100 terminals and 16 nonterminals and initial probabilities based on the frequency of ID and LP relations was extracted from a manually parsed corpus of about one million words of text.
    The resulting probabilistic ID/LP grammar was used to parse 42 sentences of 30 words or less drawn from the same corpus.
    In addition, lexical syntactic probabilities were integrated with the probability of the ID/LP relations to rank parses.
    Eighteen of the parses were identical to the original manual analyses, while a further 19 were 'similar,' yielding a success rate of 88%.
    What is noticeable about this experiment is that the results are no better than Fujisaki et al. 's unsupervised training experiment discussed above, despite th
