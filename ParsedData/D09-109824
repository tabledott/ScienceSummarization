nsists of roughly 60 times fewer tokens than Web020, performs nearly as well as Web020 (see Figure 2).
    We omitted statistics from Wikipedia &#8220;List of&#8221; pages in order to not bias our evaluation to the test set described in Section 5.1.
    Inspection of the precision vs. rank graph (omitted for lack of space) revealed that from rank 1 thru 550, Wikipedia had the same precision as Web020.
    From rank 550 to 1000, however, Wikipedia&#8217;s precision dropped off significantly compared with Web020, accounting for the fact that the Web corpus contains a higher recall of gold standard instances.
    The R-precision reported in Table 3 shows that this precision drop-off results in a significantly lower R-precision for Wikipedia compared with Web020.
    Intuitively, some seeds are better than others.
    We study the impact of seed selection effect by inspecting the system performance for several randomly selected seed sets of fixed size and we find that seed set composition greatly affects performa
