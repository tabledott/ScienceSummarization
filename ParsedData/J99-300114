es remain unsolved (such as the relation between Akkus, 'rechargeable battery cell', and 316LT in examples (lb) and (la), respectively.'
    The linking conceptual relation between these two discourse elements has to be inferred in order to make it explicit at the level of text knowledge representation structures (for an early statement of this idea in terms of &amp;quot;bridging&amp;quot; inferences, see Clark [1975]).
    Note an interesting asymmetric relationship between these three types of anaphora.
    Pronominal anaphora are constrained by morphosyntactic and grammatical agreement criteria between the pronoun and the antecedent,' and no conceptual constraints apply.
    Nominal anaphora are only constrained by number compatibility between the anaphoric expression and the antecedent, while at the conceptual level the anaphoric expression is related to its antecedent in terms of a conceptual generalization relation.
    Finally, no grammatical constraints apply to inferables, while conceptual constraint
