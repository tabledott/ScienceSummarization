d each member of GEN(x) has a rich internal structure.
    This contrasts with &#8220;typical&#8221;classification problems in which GEN(x) is a fixed, small set, for example, f-1,+11 in binary classification problems.
    In probabilistic approaches, a model is defined which assigns a probability P(x, y) to each (x, y) pair.2 The most likely parse for each sentence x is then arg maxyEGEN(x) P(x, y).
    This leaves the question of how to define P(x,y).
    In history-based approaches, a one-to-one mapping is defined between each pair (x, y) and a decision sequence (d1... dn).
    The sequence (d1... dn) can be thought of as the sequence of moves that build (x, y) in some canonical order.
    Given this mapping, the probability of a tree can be written as Here, (d1... di-1) is the history for the ith decision.
    F is a function which groups histories into equivalence classes, thereby making independence assumptions in the model.
    Probabilistic context-free grammars (PCFGs) are one example of a history-ba
