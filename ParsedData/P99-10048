; Hatzivassiloglou, 1996), is a nonparametric measure of the association between random variables (Gibbons, 1993).
    In our context, it looks for correlation between the behavior of q and r on pairs of verbs.
    Three versions exist; we use the simplest, Ta, here: sign [(q(vi) &#8212; q(v2))(r(vi) &#8212; r(v2)) 2(11;1) where sign(x) is 1 for positive arguments, &#8212;1 for negative arguments, and 0 at 0.
    The intuition behind Kendall's T is as follows.
    Assume all verbs have distinct conditional probabilities.
    If sorting the verbs by the likelihoods assigned by q yields exactly the same ordering as that which results from ranking them according to r, then T (q, r) = 1; if it yields exactly the opposite ordering, then T(q,r) = &#8212;1.
    We treat a value of &#8212;1 as indicating extreme dissimilarity.3 It is worth noting at this point that there are several well-known measures from the NLP literature that we have omitted from our experiments.
    Arguably the most widely used is the mutual i
