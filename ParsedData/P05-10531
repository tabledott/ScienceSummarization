    With the dramatic increase in the amount of textual information available in digital archives and the WWW, there has been growing interest in techniques for automatically extracting information from text.
    Information Extraction (IE) systems are expected to identify relevant information (usually of pre-defined types) from text documents in a certain domain and put them in a structured format.
    According to the scope of the NIST Automatic Content Extraction (ACE) program, current research in IE has three main objectives: Entity Detection and Tracking (EDT), Relation Detection and Characterization (RDC), and Event Detection and Characterization (EDC).
    The EDT task entails the detection of entity mentions and chaining them together by identifying their coreference.
    In ACE vocabulary, entities are objects, mentions are references to them, and relations are semantic relationshi
