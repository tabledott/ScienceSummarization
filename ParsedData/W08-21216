i.e., the percentage of tokens with correct HEAD, and label accuracy, i.e., the percentage of tokens with correct DEPREL.
    The semantic propositions are evaluated by converting them to semantic dependencies, i.e., we create a semantic dependency from every predicate to all its individual arguments.
    These dependencies are labeled with the labels of the corresponding arguments.
    Additionally, we create a semantic dependency from each predicate to a virtual ROOT node.
    The latter dependencies are labeled with the predicate senses.
    This approach guarantees that the semantic dependency structure conceptually forms a single-rooted, connected (but not necessarily acyclic) graph.
    More importantly, this scoring strategy implies that if a system assigns the incorrect predicate sense, it still receives some points for the arguments correctly assigned.
    For example, for the correct proposition: verb.01: ARG0, ARG1, ARGM-TMP the system that generates the following output for the same argument token
