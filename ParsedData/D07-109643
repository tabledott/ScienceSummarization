s (2007) extends the first-order model to incorporate a sum over scores for pairs of adjacent arcs in the tree, yielding a second-order model.
			In contrast to previous work where this was constrained to sibling relations of the dependent (McDonald and Pereira, 2006), here head-grandchild relations can be taken into account.
			In all of the above cases the scoring function isdecomposed into functions that score local proper ties (arcs, pairs of adjacent arcs) of the graph.
			By contrast, the model of Nakagawa (2007) considersglobal properties of the graph that can take multi ple arcs into account, such as multiple siblings and children of a node.
			5.3.2 Inference Searching for the highest scoring graph (usually atree) in a model depends on the factorization cho sen and whether we are looking for projective ornon-projective trees.
			Maximum spanning tree algorithms can be used for finding the highest scor ing non-projective tree in a first-order model (Hall et al, 2007b; Nguyen et al, 2007; Canisius and
