alized expectation criteria (Druck et al., 2009) is the closest to our reported work in terms of technique.
    To compare the two, we run HDP-DEP using the 20 rules given by Druck et al. (2009).
    Our model achieves an accuracy of 64.9% (line 7) compared to 61.3% (line 6) reported in their work.
    Note that we do not rely on rule-specific expectation information as they do, instead requiring only a single expectation constraint parameter.4 Model Stability It is commonly acknowledged in the literature that unsupervised grammar induction methods exhibit sensitivity to initialization.
    As in the previous section, we find that the presence of linguistic rules greatly reduces this sensitivity: for HDP-DEP, the standard deviation over five randomly initialized runs with the English-specific rules is 1.5%, compared to 4.5% for the parser developed by Headden III et al. (2009) and 8.0% for DMV (Klein and Manning, 2004).
