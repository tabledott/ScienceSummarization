sfy C in a constant time, regardless of the sentence length n.
  
  
    The formula Fl of the constraint Cl is the conjunction of the following four subformulas (an informal description is attached to each constraint): &amp;quot;No two words can modify the same word with the same label.&amp;quot; Analyzing a sentence with G1 means assigning a label-modifiee pair to the only role &amp;quot;governor&amp;quot; of each word so that the assignment satisfies (G1-1) to (G1-4) simultaneously.
    For example, sentence (1) is analyzed as shown in Figure 2 provided that the words &amp;quot;a,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;dog,&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;runs&amp;quot; are given parts-ofspeech D, N, and V, respectively (the subscript attached to the words indicates the position of the word in the sentence).
    Thus, sentence (1) is generated by the grammar GI.
    On the other hand, sentences (2) and (3) are not generated since there are no proper assignments for such sentences.
