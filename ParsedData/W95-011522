seline lexicon are appropriate.
    The Cognate Filter allows the fourth item, a cognate, to percolate up to second place, and makes room for &amp;quot;two-party&amp;quot; in sixth place.
  
  
    Figures 5 and 6 show mean BiBLE scores for precision of the best translations in lexicons induced with various cascades of the four filters discussed.
    Assuming that BiBLE scores are normally Cognate Filter by itself achieves the best precision for the best-of-N translations, when N &gt; 2.
    The POS Filtei only degrades precision for large training corpora. distributed, 95% confidence intervals were estimated for each score, using ten mutually exclusive training sets of each size.
    All the confidence intervals were narrower than one percentage point at 500 pairs of training sentences, and narrower than half of one percentage point at 2000 pairs.
    Therefore, BiBLE score differences displayed in Figures 5 and 6 are quite reliable.
    The upper bound on performance for this task is plotted at 0.57 (see en
