oponents of this approach have felt some freedom on making this choice in an ad hoc fashion.
    Janssen (1992, 81-82) observes that the French word linguistique displays three peaks, predicting the analysis lthguist-ique, employing a trigram model.
    The reason for the strong, but spurious, peak after lin is that lin occurs with high frequency word finally, just as gui appears with high frequency word initially.
    One could respond to this observation in several ways: word-final frequency should not contribute to word-internal, morpheme-final status; or perhaps frequencies of this sort should not be added.
    Indeed, it is not clear at all why these numbers should be added; they do not, for example, represent probabilities that can be added.
    Janssen notes that the other two trigrams that enter into the picture (ing and ngu) had a zero frequency of morpheme break in the desired spot, and proposes that the presence of any zeros in the sum forces the sum to be 0, raising again the question of what kind
