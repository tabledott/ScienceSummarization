r NPs in the structures considered here.
    Indeed, even though the PCFG estimated from the trees obtained by applying the &amp;quot;parent annotation&amp;quot; transformation to sections 2-21 of the WSJ corpus contains 22,773 productions (i.e., 7,811 more than the PCFG estimated from the untransformed corpus), only 965 of them, or just over 4%, are subsumed by two or more other productions.
    We can gain some theoretical insight into the effect that different tree representations have on PCFG language models by considering several artifical corpora whose estimated PCFGs are simple enough to study analytically.
    PP attachment was chosen for investigation here because the alternative structures are simple and clear, but presumably the same points could be made for any construction that has several alternative tree representations.
    Correctly resolving PP attachment ambiguities requires information, such as lexical information (Hindle and Rooth 1993), that is simply not available to the PCFG models con
