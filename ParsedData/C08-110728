		We presented two approaches for unsupervised ac quisition of unary entailment rules from regular (non-comparable) corpora.
			In the first approach, rules are directly learned based on distributionalsimilarity measures.
			The second approach de rives unary rules from a given rule-base of binary rules.
			Under the first approach we proposed a novel directional measure for scoring entailment rules, termed Balanced-Inclusion.
			We tested the different approaches utilizing a standard IE test-set and compared them to binary rule learning.
			Our results suggest the advantage of learning unary rules: (a) unary rule-bases perform 855 better than binary rules; (b) it is better to directly learn unary rules than to derive them from binary rule-bases.
			In addition, the Balanced-Inclusion measure outperformed all other tested methods.
			In future work, we plan to explore additional unary template structures and similarity scores, and to improve rule application utilizing context matching methods such as (Szpekto
