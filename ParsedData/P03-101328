 currently no probabilistic, treebanktrained parsers available for German (to our knowledge).
    A number of chunking models have been proposed, however.
    Skut and Brants (1998) used Negra to train a maximum entropy-based chunker, and report LR and LP of 84.4% for NP and PP chunking.
    Using cascaded Markov models, Brants (2000) reports an improved performance on the same task (LR 84.4%, LP 88.3%).
    Becker and Frank (2002) train an unlexicalized PCFG on Negra to perform a different chunking task, viz., the identification of topological fields (sentence-based chunks).
    They report an LR and LP of 93%.
    The head-lexicalized model of Carroll and Rooth (1998) has been applied to German by Beil et al. (1999, 2002).
    However, this approach differs in the number of ways from the results reported here: (a) a hand-written grammar (instead of a treebank grammar) is used; (b) training is carried out on unannotated data; (c) the grammar and the training set cover only subordinate and relative clauses, n
