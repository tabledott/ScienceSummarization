o methods for including a conventional bilingual dictionary in training and described heuristic symmetrization algorithms that combine alignments in both translation directions possible between two languages, producing an alignment with a higher precision, a higher recall, or an improved alignment error rate.
    We have suggested measuring the quality of an alignment model using the quality of the Viterbi alignment compared to that achieved in a manually produced reference alignment.
    This quality measure has the advantage of automatic evaluation.
    To produce the reference alignment, we have used a refined annotation scheme that reduces the problems and ambiguities associated with the manual construction of a word alignment.
    We have performed various experiments to assess the effect of different alignment models, training schemes, and knowledge sources.
    The key results of these experiments are as follows: Further improvements in alignments are expected to be produced through the adoption of cog
