 a nonzero ith coordinate where i is the coordinate which is non-zero for the most vectors.
    In other words, the algorithm is efficient only when the density of the coordinates is low.
    On our datasets, we observed near linear running time in the corpus size.
    Bayardo et al. (2007) described a strategy that potentially reduces the cost even further by omitting the coordinates with the highest number of non-zero value.
    However, their algorithm gives a significant advantage only when we are interested in finding solely the similarity between highly similar terms.
    In our experiments, we compute the exact similarity between all pairs of terms.
    The pseudo-code in Figure 1 assumes that A can fit into memory, which for large A may be impossible.
    Also, as each element of B is processed independently, running parallel processes for nonintersecting subsets of B makes the processing faster.
    In this section, we outline our MapReduce implementation of Figure 1 deployed using Hadoop1, the open-
