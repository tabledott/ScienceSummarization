    We produced good results with a relatively small corpus of 8.2 million words4, out of which only 34,359 total / 3,073 distinct adjective-noun pairs involving 1,509 distinct nouns were relevant to our test set of 21 adjectives (Figure 2).
    The accuracy of the results can be improved if a larger, homogeneous corpus is used to provide the raw data.
    Also, we can increase the size of the adjective-noun and adjectiveadjective data that we are using if we introduce more syntactic patterns in stage one to extract more co
