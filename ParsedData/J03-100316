l be further discussed in Section 5.
    Now the content determination problem for referring expressions can be formulated as a graph construction problem.
    To decide which information to include in a referring expression for an object v E V, we construct a connected directed labeled graph over the set of labels L and an arbitrary set of vertices, but including v. A graph is connected iff there is a path (a list of vertices in which each vertex has an edge from itself to the next vertex) between each pair of vertices.
    Informally, we say that a vertex (&#8220;the intended referent&#8221;) from a graph H refers to a given entity in the scene graph G iff the graph H can be &#8220;placed over&#8221; the scene graph G in such a way that the vertex being referred to is &#8220;placed over&#8221; the vertex of the given entity in G and each edge from H with label l can be &#8220;placed over&#8221; an edge from G with the same label.
    Furthermore, a vertex-graph pair is distinguishing iff it refers to exactl
