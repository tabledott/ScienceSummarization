e choice of the production X &#8212;&gt; Apt is not part of the outer probability associated with a state kX A.A.
    In fact, the definition makes no reference to the first part A of the RHS: all states sharing the same k, X, and it will have identical outer probabilities.
    Intuitively, f3 (kX &#8212;&gt; A.,u) is the probability that an Earley parser operating as a string generator yields the prefix xo...k-1 and the suffix while passing through state kX A././ at position i (which is independent of A).
    As was the case for forward probabilities, ,C3 is actually an expectation of the number of such states in the path, as unit production cycles can result in multiple occurrences for a single state.
    Again, we gloss over this technicality in our terminology.
    The name is motivated by the fact that ,3 reduces to the &amp;quot;outer probability&amp;quot; of X, as defined in Baker (1979), if the dot is in final position.
