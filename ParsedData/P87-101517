 view of recognition, independent paths in the derivation structures suggests that a top-down parser (for example) can work on each branch independently, which may lead to efficient parsing using an algorithm based on the Divide and Conquer technique.
  
  
    From the discussion so far it is clear that a number of formalisms involve some type of context-free rewriting (they have derivation trees that are local sets).
    Our goal is to define a class of formal systems, and show that any member of this class will possess certain attractive properties.
    In the remainder of the paper, we outline how a class of Linear Context-Free Rewriting Systems (LCFRS's) may be defined and sketch how semilinearity and polynomial recognition of these systems follows.
    In defining LCFRS's, we hope to generalize the definition of CFG's to formalisms manipulating any structure, e.g. strings, trees, or graphs.
    To be a member of LCFRS a formalism must satisfy two restrictions.
    First, any grammar must involve a finit
