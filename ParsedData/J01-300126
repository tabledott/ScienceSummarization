sing the first homograph.
    However, we felt that it would be useful to carry out some further analysis of the data.
    To do this, it is useful to divide the polyhomographic words into four classes, all based on the assumption that a part-of-speech tagger has been run over the text and that homographs which do not correspond to the grammatical category assigned have been removed.
    Full disambiguation (by part of speech): If only a single homograph with the correct part of speech remains, that word has been fully disambiguated by the tagger.
    Stevenson and Wilks Interaction of Knowledge Sources in WSD Partial disambiguation (by part of speech): If there is more than one possible homograph with the correct part of speech but some have been removed from consideration, that word has been partially disambiguated by part of speech.
    No disambiguation (by part of speech): If all the homographs of a word have the same part of speech, which is then assigned by the tagger, then none can be removed and no d
