t introduced in the previous section according to the measurements given in Section 2.2 are shown in Table 3.
    Figure 11 shows a graph of %non-0 E for each sentence length for the boundary models and the trigram and prefix estimates.
    This graph shows that the contextual information gained from using oL in the prefix estimate is almost completely included in just the previous tag, as illustrated by the left boundary trigram estimate.
    Adding right contextual information in the boundary trigram estimate gives us the best performance on this measure of any of our figures of merit.
    We can consider the left boundary trigram estimate to be an approximation of the prefix estimate, where the effect of the left context is approximated by the effect of the single tag to the left.
    Similarly, the boundary trigram estimate is an approximation to an estimate involving the full context, i.e., an estimate involving the outside probability a.
    However, the parser cannot compute the outside probability of
