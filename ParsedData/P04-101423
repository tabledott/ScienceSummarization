dencies to be very beneficial &#8212; in contrast to recent results from the lexicalised PCFG parsing literature (Gildea, 2001) &#8212; but did not gain from the use of distance measures.
    One of the advantages of a log-linear model is that it is easy to include additional information, such as distance, as features.
    The FINAL result in Table 2 is obtained by using a larger derivation space for training, created using more categories per word from the supertagger, 2.9, and hence using charts containing more derivations.
    (15 machines were used to estimate this model.)
    More investigation is needed to find the optimal chart size for estimation, but the results show a gain in accuracy.
    Table 3 gives the results of the best performing normal-form model on the test set.
    The results of Clark et al. (2002) and Hockenmaier (2003a) are shown for comparison.
    The dependency set used by Hockenmaier contains some minor differences to the set used here, but &#8220;evaluating&#8221; our test set aga
