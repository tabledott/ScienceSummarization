, we see statistically significant gains in precision and statistically significant, but much smaller, drops in recall, producing systems with better F-measure scores.
    In addition, precision on common nouns rises substantially, as expected.
    Unfortunately, the hand-selected features precipitate a large drop in precision for pronoun resolution for the MUC-7/C4.5 data set.
    Additional analysis is required to determine the reason for this.
    Moreover, the Hand-selected Features produce the highest scores posted to date for both the MUC6 and MUC-7 data sets: F-measure increases w.r.t. the Baseline system from 64.3 to 70.4 for MUC6/RIPPER, and from 61.2 to 63.4 for MUC-7/C4.5.
    In one variation (MUC-7/RIPPER), however, the Hand-selected Features slightly underperforms the Learning Framework modifications (F-measure of 63.1 vs. 63.2) although changes in recall and precision are not statistically significant.
    Overall, our results indicate that pronoun and especially common noun resolution remain i
