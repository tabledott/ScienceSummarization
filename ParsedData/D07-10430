	V-Measure: A Conditional Entropy-Based External Cluster Evaluation Measure
		We present V-measure, an external entropybased cluster evaluation measure.
		V measure provides an elegant solution tomany problems that affect previously defined cluster evaluation measures includ ing 1) dependence on clustering algorithm or data set, 2) the ?problem of matching?, where the clustering of only a portion of datapoints are evaluated and 3) accurate evaluation and combination of two desirable aspects of clustering, homogeneity and completeness.
		We compare V-measure to a num ber of popular cluster evaluation measuresand demonstrate that it satisfies several desirable properties of clustering solutions, us ing simulated clustering results.
		Finally, we use V-measure to evaluate two clustering tasks: document clustering and pitch accent type clustering.
	
	
			Clustering techniques have been used successfully for many natural language processing tasks, such as document clustering (Willett, 1988; Zamir and Etzioni, 199
