wever, providing a ANIM + feature to known animates, such as people&#8217;s names and pronouns, allows the grammar to encode information that is relevant for interpretation.
    Consider the relative pronoun who in (15).
    (15) a. the girl[ANIM +] who[ANIM +] left b. the box[ANIM +] who[ANIM +] left The relative pronoun has a ANIM + feature that is assigned to the noun it modifies by the relative clause rules.
    As such, a noun modified by a relative clause headed by who is interpreted as animate.
    In the case of canonical inanimates, as in (15b), this will result in a pragmatically odd interpretation, which is encoded in the f-structure.
    Teasing apart these different phenomena crosslinguistically poses a challenge that the ParGram members are continually engaged in.
    As such, we have developed several methods to help maintain parallelism.
    The parallelism among the grammars is maintained in a number of ways.
    Most of the work is done during two week-long project meetings held each year.
