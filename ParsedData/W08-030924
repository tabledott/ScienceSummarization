calculate correlation coefficients.
    We did not gather any absolute scores and thus cannot compare translations across different sentences.
    Given the seemingly unreliable fluency and adequacy assignments that people make even for translations of the same sentences, it may be dubious to assume that their scoring will be reliable across sentences.
    The data points that we have available consist of a set of 6,400 human judgments each ranking the output of 5 systems.
    It&#8217;s straightforward to construct a ranking of each of those 5 systems using the scores automatic evaluation metrics on translations into French, German and Spanish assigned to their translations of that sentence by the automatic evaluation metrics.
    When the automatic scores have been retrieved, we have 6,400 pairs of ranked lists containing 5 items.
    How best to treat these is an open discussion, and certainly warrants further thought.
    It does not seem like a good idea to calculate p for each pair of ranked list, becau
