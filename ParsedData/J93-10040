  A Program For Aligning Sentences In Bilingual Corpora
  
    Researchers in both machine translation (e.g., Brown et al. 1990) and bilingual lexicography (e.g., Klavans and Tzoukermann 1990) have recently become interested in studying bilingual corpora, bodies of text such as the Canadian Hansards (parliamentary proceedings), which are available in multiple languages (such as French and English).
    One useful step is to align the sentences, that is, to identify correspondences between sentences in one language and sentences in the other language.
    This paper will describe a method and a program (align) for aligning sentences based on a simple statistical model of character lengths.
    The program uses the fact that longer sentences in one language tend to be translated into longer sentences in the other language, and that shorter sentences tend to be translated into shorter sentences.
    A probabilistic score is assigned to each proposed correspondence of sentences, based on the scaled difference of
