eplace GRs of the form (cmod say arg) with (ta quote arg say), where say can be any of say, said, or says.
    This rule applies to only a small subset of the ta cases but has high enough precision to be worthy of inclusion.
    A common source of error is the distinction between iobj and ncmod, which is not surprising given the difficulty that human annotators have in distinguishing arguments and adjuncts.
    There are many cases where an argument in DepBank is an adjunct in CCGbank, and vice versa.
    The only change we have made is to turn all ncmod GRs with 10 CCGbank does not contain GRs in this form, although we will continue to talk as though it does; these are the GRs after the CCGbank dependencies have been put through the dependency to GRs mapping.
    Clark and Curran Wide-Coverage Efficient Statistical Parsing of as the modifier into iobj GRs (unless the ncmod is a partitive predeterminer).
    This was found to have high precision and applies to a significant number of cases.
    There are some
