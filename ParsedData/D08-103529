ess of cue phrases as a feature depends on whether the writer or speaker uses them consistently.
    At the same time, the addition of cue phrases prevents the use of exact inference techniques, which may explain the decline in results for the meetings dataset.
    To investigate the quality of the cue phrases that our model extracts, we list its top ten cue phrases for each dataset in Table 2.
    Cue phrases are ranked by their chi-squared value, which is computed based on the number of occurrences for each word at the beginning of a hypothesized segment, as compared to the expectation.
    For cue phrases listed in bold, the chi-squared value is statistically significant at the level of p &lt; .01, indicating that the frequency with which the cue phrase appears at the beginning of segments is unlikely to be a chance phenomenon.
    As shown in the left column of the table, our model has identified several strong cue phrases from the meeting dataset which appear to be linguistically plausible.
