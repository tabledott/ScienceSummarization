ell, and Warwick 1989; Gale and Church 1991; Fung 1995; Kumano and Hirakawa The remaining word pairs become the entries in the translation lexicon.
    The various proposals differ mainly in their choice of similarity function.
    Almost all the similarity functions in the literature are based on a model of co-occurrence with some linguistically motivated filtering (see Fung [1995] for a notable exception).
    Given a reasonable similarity function, the greedy algorithm works remarkably well, considering how simple it is.
    However, the association scores in Step 2 are typically computed independently of each other.
    The problem with this independence assumption is illustrated in Figure 1.
    The two word sequences represent corresponding regions of an English/French bitext.
    If nods and hoche co-occur much more often than expected by chance, then any reasonable similarity metric will deem them likely to be mutual translations.
    Nods and hoche are indeed mutual translations, so their tendency to
