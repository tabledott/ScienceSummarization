ance of performance differences.
    Unfortunately, reported results sometimes leave out details needed for accurate comparisons.
    We report F scores for comparison with previous work, but we also give statistical significance estimates using McNemar&#8217;s test for those methods that we evaluated directly.
    Testing the significance of F scores is tricky because the wrong chunks generated by two chunkers are not directly comparable.
    Yeh (2000) examined randomized tests for estimating the significance of F scores, and in particular the bootstrap over the test set (Efron and Tibshirani, 1993; Sang, 2002).
    However, bootstrap variances in preliminary experiments were too high to allow any conclusions, so we used instead a McNemar paired test on labeling disagreements (Gillick and Cox, 1989).
  
  
    All the experiments were performed with our Java implementation of CRFs,designed to handle millions of features, on 1.7 GHz Pentium IV processors with Linux and IBM Java 1.3.0.
