ech that human listeners can detect the occurrence of a repair in the absence of segmental information (Lickley, 1991).
    In the sections that follow, we describe in detail our corpus of spontaneous speech data and present an analysis of the repair phenomena observed.
    In addition, we describe ways in which pattern matching, syntactic and semantic a.nalysis, and acoustic analysis can be helpful in detecting and correcting these repairs.
    We use pattern matching to determine an initial set of possible repairs; we then apply information from syntactic, semantic, and acoustic analyses to distinguish actual repairs from false positives.
  
  
    The data we are analyzing were collected as part of DARPA's Spoken Language Systems project.
    The corpus contains digitized waveforms and transcriptions of a large number of sessions in which subjects made air travel plans using a computer.
    In the majority of sessions, data were collected in a Wizard of Oz setting, in which subjects were led to believe the
