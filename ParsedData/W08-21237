  3.1 SRL Pipeline The SRL pipeline consists of classifiers for predi- cate identification, predicate disambiguation, sup- port identification (for noun predicates), argument identification, and argument classification.
  We trained one set of classifiers for verb predicates and another for noun predicates.
  For the pred- icate disambiguation classifiers, we trained one subclassifier for each lemma.
  All classifiers in the pipeline were L2-regularized linear logistic regres- sion classifiers, implemented using the efficient LIBLINEAR package (Lin et al., 2008).
  For multi- class problems, we used the one-vs-all binarization 184 method, which makes it easy to prevent outputs not allowed by the PropBank or NomBank frame.
  Since our classifiers were logistic, their output values could be meaningfully interpreted as prob- abilities.
  This allowed us to combine the scores from subclassifiers into a score for the complete predicate?argument structure.
