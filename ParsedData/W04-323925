performance than binary-valued learners.
    In our experiments, n-gram features showed comparable performance to dependency features.
    We would like to apply our method to other applications where instances are represented in a tree and their subtrees play an important role in classifications (e.g., parse re-ranking (Collins and Duffy, 2002) and information extraction).
