 Class-based n-gram models have also been shown to benefit from their reduced number of parameters when scaling to higher-order n-grams (Goodman and Gao, 2000), and even despite the increasing size and decreasing sparsity of language model training corpora (Brants et al., 2007), class-based n-gram models might lead to improvements when increasing the n-gram order.
    When training class-based n-gram models on large corpora and large vocabularies, one of the problems arising is the scalability of the typical clustering algorithms used for obtaining the word classification.
    Most often, variants of the exchange algorithm (Kneser and Ney, 1993; Martinet al., 1998) or the agglomerative clustering algorithm presented in (Brown et al., 1990) are used, both of which have prohibitive runtimes when clustering large vocabularies on the basis of large training corpora with a sufficiently high number of classes.
    In this paper we introduce a modification of the exchange algorithm with improved efficiency and then
