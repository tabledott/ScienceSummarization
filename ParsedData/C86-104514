eter likes bananas and Paul likes oranges.
			(22c) Peter likes and buys bananas.
			The conjunction and may combine two simple argument categories (22a), two functors with one unfilled argument position (22b), or two functors with more than one unfilled argument position (22c).
			If the conjuncts have unfilled argument positions, the conjoined phrase needs to inherit them through functional composition.
			The simplified lexical graph for and is given under (23).
			In order to avoid a thicket of crossing edges, I have expressed some of the relevant bindings by indices.
			191 (23) c ~ ..
			r ( The most appealing feature of this way of utilizing functional composition is that no additional combinators are required.
			No restriction on such a rule need to be formulated.
			It is only the lexical entries for functors that either demand, permit, or forbid functional composition.
			Extensions to the formalism that I have experimented with that cannot be discussed in the frame of this paper are the use of mul
