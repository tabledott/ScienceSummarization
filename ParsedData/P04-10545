 composite kernels to reduce kernel sparsity.
    Brin (1998) and Agichtein and Gravano (2000) apply pattern matching and wrapper techniques for relation extraction, but these approaches do not scale well to fastly evolving corpora.
    Miller et al. (2000) propose an integrated statistical parsing technique that augments parse trees with semantic labels denoting entity and relation types.
    Whereas Miller et al. (2000) use a generative model to produce parse information as well as relation information, we hypothesize that a technique discriminatively trained to classify relations will achieve better performance.
    Also, Roth and Yih (2002) learn a Bayesian network to tag entities and their relations simultaneously.
    We experiment with a more challenging set of relation types and a larger corpus.
  
  
    In traditional machine learning, we are provided a set of training instances S = {x1 ... xN}, where each instance xi is represented by some ddimensional feature vector.
    Much time is spent on the
