bed speech, in which we examined text-based and prosodic features to find which best predicted the discourse/sentential distinction.
    Based on these analyses, we present an intonational model for cue phrase disambiguation in speech, based on prosodic phrasing and pitch accent.
    We associate this Model with features identifiable from text analysis, principally orthography and part of speech, that can be automatically extracted from large corpora.
    On a practical level, this association permits the application of our findings to the identification and appropriate generation of cue phrases in synthetic speech.
    On a more theoretical level, our findings provide support for theories of discourse that rely upon the feasibility of cue phrase disambiguation to support the identification of discourse structure.
    Our results provide empirical evidence suggesting how hearers and readers may distinguish between discourse and sentential uses of cue phrases.
    More generally, our findings can be seen as a
