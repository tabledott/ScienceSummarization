set of manually assigned keywords were then removed from the documents.
    For all experiments the same training, validation, and test sets were used.
  
  
    This section begins with a discussion on the different ways the data were represented: in Section 4.1 the term selection approaches are described, and in Section 4.2 the features are discussed.
    Thereafter, a brief description of the machine learning approach is given.
    Finally in Section 4.4, the training and the evaluation of the classifiers are discussed.
    In this section, the three different term selection approaches, in other words, the three definitions of what constitutes a term in a document, are described.
    n-grams In a first set of runs, the terms were defined in a manner similar to Turney (2000) and Frank et al. (1999).
    (Their studies were introduced in Section 2.)
    All unigrams, bigrams, and trigrams were extracted.
    Thereafter a stoplist was used (from Fox (1992)), where all terms beginning or ending with a stopword
