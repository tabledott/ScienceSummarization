			as correct or incorrect.
			The results from this taskare presented in Table 10.
			These first results sug gest that the model is fairly robust: the accuracy rate on the correct data, for example, is not much lower than that on the L1 data.
			In an application designed to assist learners, it is important to aim to reduce the rate of false alarms - cases where the original is correct, but the model flags an error - toa minimum, so it is positive that this result is com paratively high.
			Accuracy on error identification is at first glance even more encouraging.
			However, ifwe look at the suggestions the model makes to re place the erroneous preposition, we find that theseare correct only 51.5% of the time, greatly reduc ing its usefulness.
			6.2.1 Further discussion A first analysis of the classifier?s decisions and itserrors points to various factors which could be im pairing its performance.
			Spelling mistakes in theinput are one of the most immediate ones.
