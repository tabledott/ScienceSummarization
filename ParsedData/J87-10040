  An Efficient Augmented-Context-Free Parsing Algorithm
  
    An efficient parsing algorithm for augmented context-free grammars is introduced, and its application to on-line natural language interfaces discussed.
    The algorithm is a generalized LR parsing algorithm, which precomputes an LR shift-reduce parsing table (possibly with multiple entries) from a given augmented context-free grammar.
    Unlike the standard LR parsing algorithm, it can handle arbitrary context-free grammars, including ambiguous grammars, while most of the LR efficiency is preserved by introducing the concept of a &amp;quot;graph-structured stack&amp;quot;.
    The graph-structured stack allows an LR shift-reduce parser to maintain multiple parses without parsing any part of the input twice in the same way.
    We can also view our parsing algorithm as an extended chart parsing algorithm efficiently guided by LR parsing tables.
    The algorithm is fast, due to the LR table precomputation.
