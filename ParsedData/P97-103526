en the repair strategy that Agent B uses and the repair strategy that Agent A uses for repairing depart-city, it should use Agent B's strategy RB, since the performance(RB) is predicted to be greater than the performance(RA ).
    Note that the ability to calculate performance over subdialogues allows us to conduct experiments that simultaneously test multiple dialogue strategies.
    For example, suppose Agents A and B had different strategies for presenting the value of depart-time (in addition to different confirmation strategies).
    Without the ability to calculate performance over subdialogues, it would be impossible to test the effect of the different presentation strategies independently of the different confirmation strategies.
    We have presented the PARADISE framework, and have used it to evaluate two hypothetical dialogue agents in a simplified train timetable task domain.
    We used PARADISE to derive a performance function for this task, by estimating the relative contribution of a set of po
