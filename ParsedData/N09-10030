  A Study on Similarity and Relatedness Using Distributional and WordNet-based Approaches
  
    This paper presents and compares WordNetbased and distributional similarity approaches.
    The strengths and weaknesses of each approach regarding similarity and relatedness tasks are discussed, and a combination is presented.
    Each of our methods independently provide the best results in their class on the RG and WordSim353 datasets, and a supervised combination of them yields the best published results on all datasets.
    Finally, we pioneer cross-lingual similarity, showing that our methods are easily adapted for a cross-lingual task with minor losses.
  
  
    Measuring semantic similarity and relatedness between terms is an important problem in lexical semantics.
    It has applications in many natural language processing tasks, such as Textual Entailment, Word Sense Disambiguation or Information Extraction, and other related areas like Information Retrieval.
    The techniques used to solve this probl
