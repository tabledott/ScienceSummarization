, 20052) for this task employ a large amount of diverse linguistic features, such as lexical, syntactic and semantic features.
    These methods are very effective for relation extraction and show the bestreported performance on the ACE corpus.
    However, the problems are that these diverse features have to be manually calibrated and the hierarchical structured information in a parse tree is not well preserved in their parse tree-related features, which only represent simple flat path information connecting two entities in the parse tree through a path of non-terminals and a list of base phrase chunks.
    Prior kernel-based methods for this task focus on using individual tree kernels to exploit tree structure-related features.
    Zelenko et al. (2003) developed a kernel over parse trees for relation extraction.
    The kernel matches nodes from roots to leaf nodes recursively layer by layer in a topdown manner.
    Culotta and Sorensen (2004) generalized it to estimate similarity between dependency trees.
