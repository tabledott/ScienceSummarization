 unlisted&#65533; personal name; LOC iff wi is unlisted location name; ORG iff wi is unlisted organization name; TIME iff wi is unlisted time expression; NUM iff wi is unlisted numeric expression; STR iffwi is unlisted symbol string; BEG iff beginning of a sentence END iff ending of a sentence OTHER otherwise.
    &#65533; &amp;quot;unlisted&amp;quot; is referred as being outside the lexicon According to the word class definition, if wi is listed in lexicon, then ci is wi, and p(wiIci) is equal to 1.0.Otherwise, p(wiIci) is probability that class ci initially activates wi , and it could be estimated in its child HMM for unknown words recognition.
    As demonstrated in Figure 3, we provide the process of class-based word segmentation on &amp;quot;Et MT,, 1893' 01&amp;quot; (Mao Ze-Dong was born in the year of 1893).
    The significance of our method is: it covers the possible ambiguity.
    Moreover, unknown words, which are recognized in the following steps, can be added into the segmentation graph and proc
