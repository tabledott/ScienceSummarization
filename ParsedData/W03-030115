    There are many people who contributed greatly to making this word alignment evaluation task possible.
    We are grateful to all the participants in the shared task, for their hard work and involvement in this evaluation exercise.
    Without them, all these comparative analyses of word alignment techniques would not be possible.
    We are very thankful to Franz Och from ISI and Hermann Ney from RWTH Aachen for kindly making their English-French word aligned data available to the workshop participants; the Hansards made available by Ulrich Germann from ISI constituted invaluable data for the English-French shared task.
    We would also like to thank the student volunteers from the Department of English, Babes-Bolyai University, Cluj-Napoca, Romania who helped creating the Romanian-English word aligned data.
    We are also grateful to all the Program Committee members of the current workshop, for their comments and suggestions, which helped us improve the definition of this shared task
