 simple application of Bayes rule: During development, however, we found that rather than making these assumptions, using Gibbs Sampling to estimate the posterior distribution over types performs slightly better.
    In order to make predictions, for each entity we use an informative Dirichlet prior based on Otrain e and perform 100 iterations of Gibbs Sampling holding the hidden topic variables in the training data fixed (Yao et al., 2009).
    Fewer iterations are needed than in training since the typeword distributions, &#946; have already been inferred.
    To evaluate T-CLASS&#8217;s ability to classify entity mentions in context, we annotated the 2,400 tweets with 10 types which are both popular on Twitter, and have good coverage in Freebase: PERSON, GEO-LOCATION, COMPANY, PRODUCT, FACILITY, TV-SHOW, MOVIE, SPORTSTEAM, BAND, and OTHER.
    Note that these type annotations are only used for evaluation purposes, and not used during training T-CLASS, which relies only on distant supervision.
