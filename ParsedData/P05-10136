27; wj for the reflexive and transitive closure of the (unlabeled) arc relation.
    The dependency graph in Figure 1 satisfies all the defining conditions above, but it fails to satisfy the condition ofprojectivity (Kahane et al., 1998): The arc connecting the head jedna (one) to the dependent Z (out-of) spans the token je (is), which is not dominated by jedna.
    As observed by Kahane et al. (1998), any (nonprojective) dependency graph can be transformed into a projective one by a lifting operation, which replaces each non-projective arc wj wk by a projective arc wi &#8212;* wk such that wi &#8212;*&#8727; wj holds in the original graph.
    Here we use a slightly different notion of lift, applying to individual arcs and moving their head upwards one step at a time: Intuitively, lifting an arc makes the word wk dependent on the head wi of its original head wj (which is unique in a well-formed dependency graph), unless wj is a root in which case the operation is undefined (but then wj &#8212;* wk is necessa
