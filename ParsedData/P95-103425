neration model allows us to indirectly apply lexical constraints for the selection of open-class words, even though these constraints are not explicitly represented in the generator's lexicon.
    For example, the selection of a word from a pair of frequently co-occurring adjacent words will automatically create a strong bias for the selection of the other member of the pair, if the latter is compatible with the semantic concept being lexicalized.
    This type of collocational knowledge, along with additional collocational information based on long- and variable-distance dependencies, has been successfully used in the past to increase the fluency of generated text (Smadja and McKeown, 1991).
    But, although such collocational information can be extracted automatically, it has to be manually reformulated into the generator's representational framework before it can be used as an additional constraint during pure knowledge-based generation.
    In contrast, the two-level model provides for the automatic coll
