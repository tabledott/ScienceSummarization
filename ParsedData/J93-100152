e possible to properly balance a corpus.
    And moreover, if we insist on throwing out idiosyncratic data, we may find it very difficult to collect any data at all, since all corpora have their quirks.
    In some sense, the question comes down to a tradeoff between quality and quantity.
    American industrial laboratories (e.g., IBM, AT&amp;T) tend to favor quantity, whereas the BNC, NERC, and many dictionary publishers, especially in Europe, tend to favor quality.
    The paper by Biber (1993) argues for quality, suggesting that we ought to use the same kinds of sampling methods that statisticians use when studying the economy or predicting the results of an election.
    Poor sampling methods, inappropriate assumptions, and other statistical errors can produce misleading results: &amp;quot;There are lies, damn lies, and statistics.&amp;quot; Unfortunately, sampling methods can be expensive; it is not clear whether we can justify the expense for the kinds of applications that we have in mind.
