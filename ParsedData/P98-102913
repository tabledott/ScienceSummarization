g correct in this particular context.
    For instance, we may learn that the Trigram tagger is most accurate at tagging the word up or that the Unigrarn tagger does best at tagging the word (Daelemans(1996)). race when the word that follows is and.
    The results are given in Figure 7.
    We see that while simple voting achieves an error reduction of 6.9%, using contexts to choose a tag gives an error reduction of 9.8% and using contexts to choose a tagger gives an error reduction of 10.4%.
  
  
    In this paper, we showed that the error distributions for three popular state of the art part of speech taggers are highly complementary.
    Next, we described experiments that demonstrated that we can exploit this complementarity to build a tagger that attains significantly higher accuracy than any of the individual taggers.
    In the future, we plan to expand our repertoire of base taggers, to determine whether performance continues to improve as we add additional systems.
    We also plan to explore diffe
