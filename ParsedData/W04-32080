  Mining Very-Non-Parallel Corpora: Parallel Sentence And Lexicon Extraction Via Bootstrapping And EM
  
    We present a method capable of extracting parallel sentences from far more disparate &#8220;very-non-parallel corpora&#8221; than previous &#8220;comparable corpora&#8221; methods, by exploiting bootstrapping on top of IBM Model 4 EM.
    Step 1 of our method, like previous methods, uses similarity measures to find matching documents in a corpus first, and then extracts parallel sentences as well as new word translations from these documents.
    But unlike previous methods, we extend this with an iterative bootstrapping framework based on the principle of which claims documents found to contain one pair of parallel sentences must contain others even if the documents are judged to be of low similarity.
    We re-match documents based on extracted sentence pairs, and refine the mining process iteratively until convergence.
    This novel principle allows us to add parallel sentences from documents, to
