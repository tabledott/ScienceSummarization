t plausible analysis.
    In Section 2, we briefly review extant work on probabilistic approaches to corpus analysis and parsing and argue the need for a more refined probabilistic model to distinguish distinct derivations.
    Section 3 discusses work on LR parsing of natural language and presents our technique for automatic construction of LR parsers for unification-based grammars.
    Section 4 presents the method and results for constructing a LALR(1) parse table for the ANLT grammar and discusses these in the light of both computational complexity and other empirical results concerning parse table size and construction time.
    Section 5 motivates our interactive and incremental approach to semi-automatic production of a disambiguated training corpus and describes the variant of the LR parser used for this task.
    Section 6 describes our implementation of a breadth-first LR parser and compares its performance empirically to a highly optimized chart parser for the same grammar, suggesting that (optimiz
