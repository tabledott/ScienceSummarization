    In order to detect these two types of problems, ALEK uses a 30-million word general corpus of English from the San Jose Mercury News (hereafter referred to as the general corpus) and, for each target word, a set of 10,000 example sentences from North American newspaper text' (hereafter referred to as the word-specific corpus).
    The corpora are extracted from the ACL-DCI corpora.
    In selecting the sentences for the word ALEK infers negative evidence from the contextual cues that do not co-occur with the target word &#8212; either in the word specific corpus or in the general English one.
    It uses two kinds of contextual cues in a &#177;2 word window around the target word: function words (closed-class items) and part-of-speech tags (Brill, 1994).
    The Brill tagger output is post-processed to &amp;quot;enrich&amp;quot; some closed class categories of its tag set, such as subject versus object pronoun and definite versus indefinite determiner.
    The enriched tags were adapted from Francis and K
