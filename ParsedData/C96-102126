this fl'agment introduces three dis- course referents bearing different grammatical func- tions, none of which appear in subordinate contexts.
			Since the sentence in which the anaphor occurs does not contain any candidates (the discourse referent in- troduced by dimensions ix eliminated from considera- tion by both the morphok)gical nct disjoint reference filters), only those from the previous entence are con- sidered (each is compatible with the morphological requirements of the anaphor).
			These are ranked ac- cording to salience weight, where the crucial factor is grammatical function value.
			The result of the ranking is that Internet access device--the candidate which satis- fies the highest-weighted salience facto1, SUBl-S--is the optimal candidate, and so correctly identified as the an tecedent
	
	
			Quantitative evaluation shows the anaphora resolution algorithm described here to run at a rate of 75'70 accu- racy.
			The data set on which the evaluatkm was based consisted of 27 texts, taken from
