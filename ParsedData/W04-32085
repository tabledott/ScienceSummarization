ed as a parallel sentence resource for statistical machine translation systems.
    There are 313,659 sentence pairs in Chinese and English.
    Alignment of parallel sentences from this type of database has been the focus of research throughout the last decade and can be accomplished by many off-the-shelf, publicly available alignment tools.
    A noisy parallel corpus, sometimes also called a &#8220;comparable&#8221; corpus, contains non-aligned sentences that are nevertheless mostly bilingual translations of the same document.
    (Fung and McKeown 1997, Kikui 1999, Zhao and Vogel 2002) extracted bilingual word senses, lexicon and parallel sentence pairs from such corpora.
    A corpus such as Hong Kong News contains documents that are in fact rough translations of each other, focused on the same thematic topics, with some insertions and deletions of paragraphs.
    Another type of comparable corpus is one that contains non-sentence-aligned, non-translated bilingual documents that are topic-aligned.
