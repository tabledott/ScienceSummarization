 as its backbone.
    Using this algorithm it is trivial to calculate both Zx and each edge expectation.
    Crucially, the nested property of projective structures allows edge expectations to be computed in O(n3) from the inside-outside values.
    It is straight-forward to extend the algorithms of Eisner (1996) and Paskin (2001) to the labeled case adding only a factor of O(|L|n2).
    Table 1 gives an overview of the computational complexity for the three problems considered here for both the projective and non-projective case.
    We see that the non-projective case compares favorably for all three problems.
  
  
    To motivate the algorithms from Section 3, we present some important situations where each calculation is required.
    Many learning paradigms can be defined as inference-based learning.
    These include the perceptron (Collins, 2002) and its large-margin variants (Crammer and Singer, 2003; McDonald et al., 2005a).
    In these settings, a models parameters are iteratively updated based on
