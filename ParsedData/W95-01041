form either component method.
    However, it is found that further improvements can be obtained taking into account not just the single strongest piece of evidence, but available evidence.
    A new hybrid method, based on Bayesian classifiers, is presented for doing this, and its performance improvements are demonstrated.
  
  
    Two classes of methods have been shown useful for resolving lexical ambiguity.
    The first tests for the presence of particular context words within a certain distance of the ambiguous target word.
    The second tests for collocations &#8212; patterns of words and part-of-speech tags around the target word.
    The context-word and collocation methods have complementary coverage: the former captures the lexical &amp;quot;atmosphere&amp;quot; (discourse topic, tense, etc.
    ), while the latter captures local syntax.
    Yarowsky [1994] has exploited this complementarity by combining the two methods using decision lists.
    The idea is to pool the evidence provided by the com
