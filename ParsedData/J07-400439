n.
    Hockenmaier also argues that, compared to Hockenmaier and Steedman (2002b), the predicate&#8211;argument model is better suited to languages with freer word order than English.
    The model was also designed to test whether the inclusion of predicate&#8211;argument dependencies improves parsing accuracy.
    In fact, the results given in Hockenmaier (2003b) are lower than previous results.
    However, Hockenmaier (2003b) reports that the increased complexity of the model reduces the effectiveness of the dynamic programming used in the parser, and hence a more aggressive beam search is required to produce reasonable parse times.
    Thus the reduced accuracy could be due to implementation difficulties rather than the model itself.
    The use of conditional log-linear models in this article is designed to overcome some of the weaknesses identified in the approach of Clark, Hockenmaier, and Steedman (2002), and to offer a more flexible framework for including features than the generative models of Hock
