such as adverbial phrases or adverbial SBARs, can also modify a verb several times, and all of these different types of adjuncts can be seen together in the same rule.
    The result is a combinatorial explosion in the number of rules.
    To give a flavor of this, here is a random sample of rules of the format VP &#8594; VB modifier* that occurred only once in sections 2&#8211;21 of the Penn Treebank: It is not only verb phrases that cause this kind of combinatorial explosion: Other phrases, in particular nonrecursive noun phrases, also contribute a huge number of rules.
    The next section considers the distributional properties of the rules in more detail.
    Note that there is good motivation for the Penn Treebank&#8217;s decision to represent rules in this way, rather than with rules expressing Chomsky adjunction (i.e., a schema in which complements and adjuncts are separated, through rule types (VP &#8594; VB {complement}*) and (VP &#8594; VP {adjunct})).
    First, it allows the argument/adjunct dist
