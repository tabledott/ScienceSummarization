line knowledge-free model.
    However, these biases will not produce the best possible translation models by themselves.
    Anyone attempting to build an optimal translation model should infuse it with all available knowledge sources, including syntactic, dictionary and cognate information.
    My goal here is only to demonstrate the value of some previously unused kinds of information that are always available for translation modeling, and to show how these information sources can be integrated with others.
  
  
    Parallel texts (bitexts) have properties that distinguish them from other kinds of parallel data.
    First, most words translate to only one other word.
    Second, bitext correspondence is typically only partial&#8212;many words in each text have no clear equivalent in the other text.
    This article presents methods for biasing statistical translation models to reflect these properties.
    Evaluation with respect to independent human judgments has confirmed that translation models biased
