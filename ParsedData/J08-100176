comings of previous approaches.
    By recasting readability assessment as a classification task, they are able to combine several knowledge sources ranging from traditional reading level measures, to statistical language models, and syntactic analysis.
    Evaluation results show that their system outperforms two commonly used reading level measures (the Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level index and Lexile).
    In the following we build on their approach and examine whether the entity-grid representation introduced in this article contributes to the readability assessment task.
    The incorporation of coherence-based information in the measurement of text readability is, to our knowledge, novel.
    We follow Schwarm and Ostendorf (2005) in treating readability assessment as a classification task.
    The unit of classification is a single article and the learner&#8217;s task is to predict whether it is easy or difficult to read.
    A variety of machine learning techniques are amenable to this problem.
