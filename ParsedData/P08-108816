 the following levels of relationships between corpora, roughly in order of closest to most distant: Our results for all conditions are presented in table 2(a).
    The predominant trend is that system performance degraded when the corpora diverged in content, presumably due to context features becoming less informative.
    However, it is notable that even in the most extreme case of disjoint corpora from different time periods and topics (e.g.
    EN-ES-G), we are still able to recover lexicons of reasonable accuracy.
    All of our experiments so far have exploited a small seed lexicon which has been derived from the evaluation lexicon (see section 4.3).
    In order to explore system robustness to heuristically chosen seed lexicons, we automatically extracted a seed lexicon similarly to Koehn and Knight (2002): we ran EDITDIST on EN-ES-D and took the top 100 most confident translation pairs.
    Using this automatically derived seed lexicon, we ran our system on EN-ESD as before, evaluating on the top 2,0
