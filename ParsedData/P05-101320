ntire training data set, and an adapted version of Charniak&#8217;s parser (Charniak, 2000) performs at 84% (Jan Haji&#711;c, pers. comm.).
    However, the accuracy is considerably higher than previously reported results for robust non-projective parsing of Czech, with a best performance of 73% UAS (Holan, 2004).
    Compared to related work on the recovery of long-distance dependencies in constituency-based parsing, our approach is similar to that of Dienes and Dubey (2003) in that the processing of non-local dependencies is partly integrated in the parsing process, via an extension of the set of syntactic categories, whereas most other approaches rely on postprocessing only.
    However, while Dienes and Dubey recognize empty categories in a pre-processing step and only let the parser find their antecedents, we use the parser both to detect dislocated dependents and to predict either the type or the location of their syntactic head (or both) and use post-processing only to transform the graph in accordance
