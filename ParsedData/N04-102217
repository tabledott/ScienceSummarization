decoding.
    This shows the value of finding decoding procedure matched to the performance criterion of interest.
    We also notice some affinity among the loss functions.
    The MBR decoding under the Bitree Loss function performs better under the WER relative to the MAP decoder, but perform poorly under the BLEU metric.
    The MBR decoder under WER and PER perform better than the MAP decoder under all error metrics.
    The MBR decoder under BLEU loss function obtains a similar (or worse) performance relative to MAP decoder on all metrics other than BLEU.
  
  
    We have described the formulation of Minimum BayesRisk decoders for machine translation.
    This is a general framework that allows us to build special purpose decoders from general purpose models.
    The procedure aims at direct minimization of the expected risk of translation errors under a given loss function.
    In this paper we have focused on two situations where this framework could be applied.
    Given an MT evaluation metric of i
