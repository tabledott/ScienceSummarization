 the Robocup domain.
    Figure 5 shows the predictions of the three models on an example.
    Model 1 is only able to form isolated (but not completely inaccurate) associations.
    By modeling segmentation, Model 2 accounts for the intermediate words, but errors are still made due to the lack of Markov structure.
    Model 3 remedies this.
    However, unexpected structures are sometimes learned.
    For example, the temperature.time=6-21 field indicates daytime, which happens to be perfectly correlated with the word high, although high intuitively should be associated with the temperature.max field.
    In these cases of high correlation (Table 2 provides another example), it is very difficult to recover the proper alignment without additional supervision.
    In order to scale up our models to the NFL domain, we first pruned for each sentence the records which have either no numerical values (e.g., 23, 23-10, 2/4) nor name-like words (e.g., those that appear only capitalized in the text) in common.
