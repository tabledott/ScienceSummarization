knowledge axioms, logic representation of semantically equivalent linguistic patterns, and others.
    Logic proofs are accurate but costly, both in terms of high failure rate due to insufficient input axioms, as well as long processing time.
    Our solution is to integrate the prover into the QA system and rely on reasoning methods only to augment other previously implemented answer extraction techniques.
  
  
    The QA system includes traditional modules such as question processing, document retrieval, answer extraction, built in ontologies, as well as many tools such as syntactic parser, name entity recognizer, word sense disambiguation (Moldovan and Noviscki 2002), logic representation of text (Moldovan and Rus 2001) and others.
    The Logic Prover is integrated in this rich NLP environment and augments the QA system operation.
    As shown in Figure 1, the inputs to COGEX consist of logic representations of questions, potential answer paragraphs, world knowledge and lexical information.
