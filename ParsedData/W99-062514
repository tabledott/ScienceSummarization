ite feature, the fewer times it occurs in the corpus; however, some of the more restrictive features are most effective in determining similarity.
    Hence, there is a balance between the discriminatory power of these features and applicability to number of cases. features are normalized features are (i.e., for text unit length and for frequency of occurrence).
    This type of normalization also uses equation (2) but averages the normalization values of each primitive in the composite feature.
    4.3 Learning a Classifier For each pair of text units, we compute a vector of primitive and composite feature values.
    To determine whether the units match overall, we employ a machine learning algorithm, RIP- PER [Cohen 1996], a widely used and effective rule induction system.
    RIPPER is trained over a corpus of manually marked pairs of units; we discuss the specifics of our corpus and of the annotation process in the next session.
    We experwith varying RIPPER's ratio, measures the cost of a false positi
