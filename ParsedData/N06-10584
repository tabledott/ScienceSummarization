stributional properties in a large body of text.
    Finally, paraphrases that pass the filtering stage are used to rewrite the reference sentence.
    We apply our paraphrasing method in the context of machine translation evaluation.
    Using this strategy, we generate a new sentence for every pair of human and machine translated sentences.
    This synthetic reference then replaces the original human reference in automatic evaluation.
    The key findings of our work are as follows: (1) Automatically generated paraphrases improve the accuracy of the automatic evaluation methods.
    Our experiments show that evaluation based on paraphrased references gives a better approximation of human judgments than evaluation that uses original references.
    (2) The quality of automatic paraphrases determines their contribution to automatic evaluation.
    By analyzing several paraphrasing resources, we found that the accuracy and coverage of a paraphrasing method correlate with its utility for automatic MT evaluatio
