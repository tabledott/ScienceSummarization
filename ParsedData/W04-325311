    The approach described in this paper allows such secondary information to be incorporated, where available.
    In the second of the two datasets used in the present experiments, texts were annotated by hand using the Open Ontology Forge annotation tool (Collier et al., 2003).
    In each record review, references (including co-reference) to the record being reviewed were tagged as THIS WORK and references to the artist under review were tagged as THIS ARTIST.
    With these entities tagged, a number of classes of features may be extracted, representing various relationships between topic entities and value phrases similar to those described in section 3.1.
    The classes looked at in this work are as follows: Turney Value The average value of all value phrases&#8217; SO values for the text.
