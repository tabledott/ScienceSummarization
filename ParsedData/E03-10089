 Some code for (re)training this parser was added to make the co-training experiments possible.
    We refer to this parser as Collins-CFG.
    In order to perform the co-training experiments reported in this paper, LTAG derivation events Collins-CFG LTAG Bi-lexical dependencies are between Bi-lexical dependencies are between lexicalized nonterminals elementary trees Can produce novel elementary Can produce novel hi-lexical trees for the LTAG parser dependencies for Collins-CFG When using small amounts of seed data, When using small amounts of seed data, abstains less often than LTAG abstains more often than Collins-CFG were extracted from the head-lexicalized parse tree output produced by the Collins-CFG parser.
    These events were used to retrain the statistical model used in the LTAG parser.
    The output of the LTAG parser was also modified in order to provide input for the re-training phase in the Collins-CFG parser.
    These steps ensured that the output of the Collins-CFG parser could be used as ne
