in the case of a tree, some longer description may be necessary.
    Henceforth, we will call the intended referent the target of the GRE algorithm.
    The question that we set out to answer is whether existing GRE algorithms produce adequate descriptions whenever such descriptions exist: in short, whether these algorithms are, as we shall say, complete.
    The paper brings a degree of formal precision to this issue and reveals a number of reasons why current GRE algorithms are incomplete; we sketch remedies and discuss their consequences in terms of linguistic coverage and computational tractability.
    We take the Incremental Algorithm (Dale and Reiter 1995) to represent the state of the art in this area, and we minimize the deviations from this algorithm.
    As a result, this paper might be read as an investigation into how widely the ideas underlying the Incremental Algorithm can be used, and the extent to which they may be generalized.
    The main generalization that we will investigate involves com
