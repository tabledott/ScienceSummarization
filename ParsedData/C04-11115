ar in meaning.
			Curran and Moens (2002) experimented with corpus size and complexity of proximity features in building automatic thesauri.
			CBC (Clustering by Commit tee) proposed by Pantel and Lin (2002) achieves high recall and precision in generating similarity lists of words discriminated by their meaning and senses.
			However, such clustering algorithms fail to name their classes.
			Caraballo (1999) was the first to use clustering for labeling is-a relations using conjunction and apposition features to build noun clusters.
			Re cently, Pantel and Ravichandran (2004) extended this approach by making use of all syntactic de pendency features for each noun.
	
	
			Much of the research discussed above takes a similar approach of searching text for simple sur face or lexico-syntactic patterns in a bottom-up approach.
			Our co-occurrence model (Pantel and Ravichandran 2004) makes use of semantic classes like those generated by CBC.
			Hyponyms are gen erated in a top-down approach by naming each group
