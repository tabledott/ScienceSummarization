k. The most computationally expensive step in the chain recognition process is the insertion of candidate points into the sorted point sequence.
    The following subsections describe two of the more interesting enhancements in the current SIMR implementation.
    4.6.1 Overlapping Chains.
    SIMR's fixed chain size imposes a rather arbitrary fragmentation on the TBM trace.
    Each chain starts at the top-right corner of the previously found chain, but these chain boundaries are independent of discontinuities or angle variations in the TBM trace.
    Therefore, SIMR is likely to miss TPCs wherever the TBM is not linear.
    One way to make SIMR more robust is to start the search rectangle just above the lowest point of the previously found chain, instead of just above the highest point.
    If the chain size is fixed at k, then each linear stretch of s TPCs will result in s &#8212; k + 1 overlapping chains.
    Unfortunately, this solution introduces another problem: Two overlapping chains can be inconsiste
