 Given two sequences X and Y, the longest common subsequence (LCS) of X and Y is a common subsequence with maximum length (Cormen et al 1989).
			To apply LCS in machine translation evaluation, we view a translation as a sequence of words.
			The intuition is that the longer the LCS of two translations is, the more similar the two translations are.
			We propose using LCS-based F-measure to estimate the similarity between two translations X of length m and Y of length n, assuming X is a reference translation and Y is a candidate translation, as follows: Rlcs m YXLCS ),( = (1) Plcs n YXLCS ),( = (2) Flcs lcslcs lcslcs PR PR 2 2 )1( ? ?
			+ + = (3) Where LCS(X,Y) is the length of a longest common subsequence of X and Y, and ? = Plcs/Rlcs when ?Flcs/?Rlcs_=_?Flcs/?Plcs.
			We call the LCS based F-measure, i.e. Equation 3, ROUGE-L.
			Notice that ROUGE-L is 1 when X = Y since LCS(X,Y) = m or n; while ROUGE-L is zero when LCS(X,Y) = 0, i.e. there is nothing in common between X and Y. One advantage of using LCS is
