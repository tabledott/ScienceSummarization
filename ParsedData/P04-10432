s called target words.
    In FrameNet, the argument names are local to a particular frame.
    Several machine learning approaches for argument identification and classification have been developed (Gildea and Jurasfky, 2002; Gildea and Palmer, 2002; Surdeanu et al., 2003; Hacioglu et al., 2003).
    Their common characteristic is the adoption of feature spaces that model predicate-argument structures in a flat representation.
    On the contrary, convolution kernels aim to capture structural information in term of sub-structures, providing a viable alternative to flat features.
    In this paper, we select portions of syntactic trees, which include predicate/argument salient sub-structures, to define convolution kernels for the task of predicate argument classification.
    In particular, our kernels aim to (a) represent the relation between predicate and one of its arguments and (b) to capture the overall argument structure of the target predicate.
    Additionally, we define novel kernels as combinations
