ta set.
    The source domain contains 4000 spam and ham emails from publicly available sources, and the target domains are three individual users&#8217; inboxes, each containing 2500 emails.
    For each task, we consider two experiment settings.
    In the first setting, we assume there are a small number of labeled target instances available.
    For POS tagging, we used an additional 300 Oncology sentences as labeled target instances.
    For NE typing, we used 500 labeled target instances and 2000 unlabeled target instances for each target domain.
    For spam filtering, we used 200 labeled target instances and 1800 unlabeled target instances.
    In the second setting, we assume there is no labeled target instance.
    We thus used all available target instances for testing in all three tasks.
    We used logistic regression as our model of p(ylx; 0) because it is a robust learning algorithm and widely used.
    We now describe three sets of experiments, corresponding to three heuristic ways of setting
