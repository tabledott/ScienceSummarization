by the item i7.
    The word belongs to the subcategory V:NP which takes an NP as the complement.
    Therefore, the item i7 is sent to node V:NP. i6 from Ito form in.
    8.
    When IP receives in, it is combined with i4 from NP to form i12.
    Since in contains an npmovement whose np-atts attribute is unifiable with i4, i4 is identified as the antecedent of npmovement.
    The np-movement attributes in i12 are cleared.
    The sources of i12 are i4 from NP and in from Ibar.
    Therefore, the top-level of parse tree consists of an NP and Ibar node dominated by IP node.
    The complete parse tree (Figure 2.b) is obtained by recursively tracing the origins of i4 and in from NP and Ibar respectively.
    The trace after &amp;quot;eaten&amp;quot; is indicated by the np-movement attributes of i7, even though the tree does not include a node representing the trace.
  
  
    GB principles are stated in terms of linguistic concepts such as barrier, government and movement, which are relationships between nodes
