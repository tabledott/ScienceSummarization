			In this alignment with the frontier no tion, there are only distance 1 transitions, whereas the traditional shapes would incur a penalty of 2 for alignment of ?pointed?
			and a penalty of 3 for the word ?to?.The state visit penalty, ns(i) is the distance be tween the English words aligned to this state times the number of state visits1.
