ain of molecular biology: transcription factors in human blood cells.
    The purpose of the GE task is two-fold: to measure the progress of the community since the last event, and to evaluate generalization of the technology to full papers.
    For the second purpose, the provided data is composed of two collections: the abstract collection, identical to the BioNLP-ST 2009 data, and the new full paper collection.
    Progress on the task is measured through the unchanged task definition and the abstract collection, while generalization to full papers is measured on the full paper collection.
    In this way, the GE task is intended to connect the entire event to the previous one.
    The EPI task (Ohta et al., 2011) focuses on IE for protein and DNA modifications, with particular emphasis on events of epigenetics interest.
    While the basic task setup and entity definitions follow those of the GE task, EPI extends on the extraction targets by defining 14 new event types relevant to task topics, including m
