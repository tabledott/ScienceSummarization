el, determining which derivations lead to a given set of dependencies.
    However, there are situations where the lexical items need to be considered independently of sentence position, for example when defining feature functions in terms of dependencies.
    Such cases should be clear from the context.
    We define CCG predicate&#8211;argument relations in terms of the argument slots in CCG lexical categories.
    Thus the transitive verb category, (S\NP)/NP, has two predicate&#8211; argument relations associated with it, one corresponding to the object NP argument and one corresponding to the subject NP argument.
    In order to distinguish different argument slots, the arguments are numbered from left to right.
    Thus, the subject relation for a transitive verb is represented as ((S\NP1)/NP2,1).
    The predicate&#8211;argument dependencies are represented as 5-tuples: (hf,f, s, ha, l), where hf is the lexical item of the lexical category expressing the dependency relation, f is the lexical category, s
