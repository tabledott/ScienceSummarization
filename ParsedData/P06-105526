, indefinite (a), demonstrative (this), quantificational (some), negative polarity (no, any), and various upper- and lower-case distinctions inside these types.
    Here, it is interesting to note that these distinctions emerge in a predictable order (see Figure 2 for DT splits), beginning with the distinction between demonstratives and non-demonstratives, with the other distinctions emerging subsequently; this echoes the result of Klein and Manning (2003), where the authors chose to distinguish the demonstrative constrast, but not the additional ones learned here.
    Another very important distinction, as shown in Klein and Manning (2003), is the various subdivisions in the preposition class (IN).
    Learned first is the split between subordinating conjunctions like that and proper prepositions.
    Then, subdivisions of each emerge: wh-subordinators like if, noun-modifying prepositions like of, predominantly verb-modifying ones like from, and so on.
    Many other interesting patterns emerge, including ma
