 the following collocations: To some extent, all of these collocations conflict with walk.
    Collocation (1) is the most blatant case; if it matches the target context, this logically implies that the context word walk will match.
    If collocation (2) matches, this guarantees that one of the possible tags of walk will be present nearby the target word, thereby elevating the probability that walk will match within +k words.
    If collocation (3) matches, this guarantees that there are two positions nearby the target word that are incompatible with walk, thereby reducing the probability that walk will match.
    If we were to treat all of these cases as conflicts, we would end up losing a great deal of (potentially useful) evidence.
    Instead, we adopt the more relaxed policy of only flagging the most egregious conflicts - here, the one between collocation (1) and walk.
    In general, we will say that a collocation and a context word conflict if the collocation contains an explicit test for the context
