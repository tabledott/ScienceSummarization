assign to each link ? the choices made in this area so far are often of an ad hoc nature.
			The graph used in the experiments described has 99,454 nodes (nouns) and 587,475 links.
			There were roughly 400,000 different types tagged as nouns in the corpus, so the graph model represents about one quarter of these nouns, including most of the more common ones.
	
	
			Extracting Categories of Similar Words In this section we describe a new algorithm for adding the ?most similar node?
			to an existingcollection of nodes in a way which incremen tally builds a stable cluster.
			We rely entirelyupon the graph to deduce the relative importance of relationships.
			In particular, our algo rithm is designed to reduce so-called ?infections?(Roark and Charniak, 1998, ?3) where the inclu sion of an out-of-category word which happens to co-occur with one of the category words can significantly distort the final list.
			Here is the process we use to select and add the ?most similar node?
			to a set of nodes: Definition
