    First, IBM models are restricted in a way such that each target word fj is assigned to exactly one source word eaj.
    A more general way is to model alignment as an arbitrary relation between source and target language positions.
    Second, IBM models are typically language-independent and may fail to tackle problems occurred due to specific languages.
    In this paper, we use Model 3 as our base feature function, which is given by 1: We distinguish between two translation directions to use Model 3 as feature functions: treating English as source language and French as target language or vice versa.
    The first linguistic information we adopt other than the source language sentence e and the target language sentence f is part-of-speech tags.
    The use of POS information for improving statistical alignment quality of the HMM-based model is described 1If there is a target word which is assigned to more than one source words, h(a, e, f) = 0. in (Toutanova et al., 2002).
    They introduce additional
