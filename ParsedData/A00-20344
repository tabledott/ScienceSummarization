    Dorr and Jones (1996) extend the classification by using grammatical information in LDOCE alongside semantic information in WordNet.
    What is missing is a way of classifying verbs when the relevant information is not available in a manmade resource.
    Using corpora by-passes reliance on the availability and adequacy of mRDs.
    Additionally, the frequency information in corpora is helpful for estimating alternation productivity (Lapata, 1999).
    Estimations of productivity have been suggested for controlling the application of alternations (Briscoe and Copestake, 1996).
    We propose a method to acquire knowledge of alternation participation directly from corpora, with frequency information available as a by-product.
  
  
    We use both syntactic and semantic information for identifying participants in RsAs.
    Firstly, syntactic processing is used to find candidates taking the alternating SCFS.
    Secondly, selectional preference models are acquired for the argument heads associated with a
