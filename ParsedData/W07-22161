 gives an example dependency graph for the sentence Mr. Tomash will remain as a director emeritus, which has been extracted from the Penn Treebank (Marcus et al., 1993).
    Each edge in this graph represents a single syntactic dependency directed from a word to its modifier.
    In this representation all edges are labeled with the specific syntactic function of the dependency, e.g., SBJ for subject and NMOD for modifier of a noun.
    To simplify computation and some important definitions, an artificial token is inserted into the sentence as the left most word and will always represent the root of the dependency graph.
    We assume all dependency graphs are directed trees originating out of a single node, which is a common constraint (Nivre, 2005).
    The dependency graph in Figure 1 is an example of a nested or projective graph.
    Under the assumption that the root of the graph is the left most word of the sentence, a projective graph is one where the edges can be drawn in the plane above the sentence
