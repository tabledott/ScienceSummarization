 operation is dependent only on the word itself and that no context is consulted.2 The model&#8217;s t-table specifies the probability for all cases.
    Suppose we obtained the translations shown in the fourth tree of Figure 1.
    The probability of the translate operation here is .
    The total probability of the reorder, insert and translate operations in this example is 3.498e-9 1.828e-11.
    Note that there 2When a TM is used in machine translation, the TM&#8217;s role is to provide a list of possible translations, and a language model addresses the context.
    See (Berger et al., 1996). are many other combinations of such operations that yield the same Japanese sentence.
    Therefore, the probability of the Japanese sentence given the English parse tree is the sum of all these probabilities.
    We actually obtained the probability tables (Table 1) from a corpus of about two thousand pairs of English parse trees and Japanese sentences, completely automatically.
