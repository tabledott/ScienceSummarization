ognition that involves two-level, finite-state, phonology or graphology.
    The approach to nonconcatenative morphology to be outlined in this paper will provide a more unified treatment of morphophonemics and morphotactics than has been usual I shall attempt to show how a two-level account might be given of nonconcatenative morphological phenomena, particularly those exhibited in the Semitic languages.
    The approach I intend to take is inspired, not only by finite-state morphology, broadly construed, but equally by autosegmental phonology as proposed by Goldsmith (1979) and the autosegmental morphology of McCarthy (1979) All the data that I have used in this work is taken from McCarthy (1979) and my debt to him will be clear throughout. forms that can be constructed on the basis of each of the stems shown.
    However, there is every reason to suppose that, though longer and greatly more complex in detail, that enterprise would not require essentially different mechanisms from the ones I shall describe.
