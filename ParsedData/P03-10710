  Discourse Segmentation Of Multi-Party Conversation
  
    We present a domain-independent topic segmentation algorithm for multi-party speech.
    Our feature-based algorithm comknowledge about a text-based algorithm as a feature and linguistic and acoustic cues about topic shifts extracted from speech.
    This segmentation algorithm uses automatically induced decision rules to combine the different features.
    The embedded text-based algorithm builds on lexical cohesion and has performance comparable to state-of-the-art algorithms based on lexical information.
    A significant error reduction is obtained by combining the two knowledge sources.
  
  
    Topic segmentation aims to automatically divide text documents, audio recordings, or video segments, into topically related units.
    While extensive research has targeted the problem of topic segmentation of written texts and spoken monologues, few have studied the problem of segmenting conversations with many participants (e.g., meetings).
