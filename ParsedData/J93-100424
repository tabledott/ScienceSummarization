 a standardized (mean zero, variance one) normal distribution, has magnitude at least as large as 161.
    That is, The program computes 6 directly from the lengths of the two portions of text, /1 and /2, and the two parameters, c and s2.
    That is, 6 = (12 - lic)/ Vlis2.
    Then, Prob(I6I) is computed by integrating a standard normal distribution (with mean zero and variance one).
    Many statistics textbooks include a table for computing this.
    The code in the appendix uses the pnorm function, which is based on an approximation described by Abramowitz and Stegun (1964; p. 932, equation 26.2.17).
    The prior probability of a match, Prob(match), is fit with the values in Table 5, which were determined from the hand-marked UBS data.
    We have found that a sentence in one language normally matches exactly one sentence in the other language (1-1).
    Three additional possibilities are also considered: 1-0 (including 0-1), 2-1 (including 1-2), and 2-2.
    Table 5 shows all four possibilities.
