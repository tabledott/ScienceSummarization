    One may ask: how can we make full use of the nice properties of kernel methods and define an effective kernel for relation extraction?
    In this paper, we study how relation extraction can benefit from the elegant properties of kernel methods: 1) implicitly exploring (structured) features in a high dimensional space; and 2) the nice mathematical properties, for example, the sum, product, normalization and polynomial expansion of existing kernels is a valid kernel (Sch&#246;lkopf and Smola, 2001).
    We also demonstrate how our composite kernel effectively captures the diverse knowledge for relation extraction.
  
  
    In this section, we define the composite kernel and study the effective representation of a relation instance.
    Our composite kernel consists of an entity kernel and a convolution parse tree kernel.
    To our knowledge, convolution kernels have not been explored for relation extraction.
