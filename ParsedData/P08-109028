it is unclear if these are better than an unconstrained distribution of events, they do offer insight into the quality of narratives.
    An important area not discussed in this paper is the possibility of using narrative chains for semantic role learning.
    A narrative chain can be viewed as defining the semantic roles of an event, constraining it against roles of the other events in the chain.
    An argument&#8217;s class can then be defined as the set of narrative arguments in which it appears.
    We believe our model provides an important first step toward learning the rich causal, temporal and inferential structure of scripts and frames.
