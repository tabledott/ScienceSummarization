tract all mentions that can refer to Wikipedia titles, and to construct a set of disambiguation candidates for each mention.
    Following previous work, we use Wikipedia hyperlinks to perform these steps.
    GLOW utilizes an anchortitle index, computed by crawling Wikipedia, that maps each distinct hyperlink anchor text to its target Wikipedia titles.
    For example, the anchor text &#8220;Chicago&#8221; is used in Wikipedia to refer both to the city in Illinois and to the movie.
    Anchor texts in the index that appear in document d are used to supplement the mention set M in Step 1 of the GLOW algorithm in Figure 2.
    Because checking all substrings Table 1: Ranker features.
    I[ti_tj] is an indicator variable which is 1 iff ti links to t1 or vise-versa.
    I[ti&#8212;tj] is 1 iff the titles point to each other. in the input text against the index is computationally inefficient, we instead prune the search space by applying a publicly available shallow parser and named entity recognition system.3 W
