 variable length n-gram matches.
    By taking a log sum of the ngram matches, the Ngram(1,4)n favors match of longer n-grams.
    For example, if &amp;quot;United States of America&amp;quot; occurs in a reference summary, while one peer summary, A, uses &amp;quot;United States&amp;quot; and another summary, B, uses the full phrase &amp;quot;United States of America&amp;quot;, summary B gets more contribution to its overall score simply due to the longer version of the name.
    However, intuitively one should prefer a short version of the name in summarization.
    Therefore, we need to change the weighting scheme to not penalize or even reward shorter equivalents.
    We conduct experiments to understand the effect of individual n-gram co-occurrence scores in approximating human assessments.
    Tables 2 and 3 show the results of these runs without and with stopwords respectively.
