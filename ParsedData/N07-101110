phrase compatibility as fc(yj, xj) = exp(Ek &#955;kfk(yj, xj)).
    Again, factor ft enforces the transitivity constraints by ft(&#183;) = &#8722;oc if transitivity is not satisfied, 1 otherwise.
    Here, transitivity is a bit more complicated, since it also requires that if yj = 1, then for any subset xk C_ xj, yk = 1.
    A factor graph for the First-Order Model is presented in Figure 3 for three noun phrases.
    The methods described in Sections 2, 3 and 4 can be viewed as estimating the parameters of each factor fc independently.
    This approach can therefore be viewed as a type of piecewise approximation of exact parameter estimation in these models (Sutton and McCallum, 2005).
    Here, each fc is a &#8220;piece&#8221; of the model trained independently.
    These pieces are combined at prediction time using clustering algorithms to enforce transitivity.
    Sutton and McCallum (2005) show that such a piecewise approximation can be theoretically justified as minimizing an upper bound of the exact lo
