as the number of ways to pick b objects out of a set of a objects.
    American Journal of Computational Linguistics, Volume 8, Number 3-4, July-December 1982 141 Kenneth Church and Ramesh Path Coping with Syntactic Ambiguity sequences of 2n parentheses, such that there are the same number of opens and closes.
    The second term subtracts cases violating condition (b).
    This explanation is elaborated in Knuth 1975, p. 531.
    It is very useful to know that the ambiguity coefficients are Catalan numbers because this observation enables us to replace equation (9) with (11), where Cat i denotes the ith Catalan number.
    (All summations range from 0 to 00 unless noted otherwise.)
    The ith Catalan number is the number of binary trees that can be constructed over i phrases.
    This theoretical model correctly predicts our practical experience with EQSP.
    EQSP found exactly the Catalan number of parse trees for each sentence in the following sequence.
    14 It was the number of products of products of
