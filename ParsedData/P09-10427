where q is a strength parameter.
    This gives the parser freedom to have some uncertainty about which edges to include, or alternatively to choose to exclude some of the transferred edges.
    A more serious problem for transferring parse information across languages are structural differences and grammar annotation choices between the two languages.
    For example dealing with auxiliary verbs and reflexive constructions.
    Hwa et al. (2005) also note these problems and solve them by introducing dozens of rules to transform the transferred parse trees.
    We discuss these differences in detail in the experimental section and use our framework introduce a very small number of rules to cover the most common structural differences.
  
  
    We explored two parsing models: a generative model used by several authors for unsupervised induction and a discriminative model used for fully supervised training.
    The discriminative parser is based on the edge-factored model and features of the MSTParser (McDonal
