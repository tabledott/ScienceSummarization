 1976); others using complicated networks and hierarchies often referred to as metaphor maps (e.g.
    (Fass, 1997; Martin, 1990; Martin, 1992) &#8211; must be largely hand-coded and generally work well on an enumerable set of metaphors or in limited domains.
    Dictionarybased systems use existing machine-readable dictionaries and path lengths between words as one of their primary sources for metaphor processing information (e.g.
    (Dolan, 1995)).
    Corpus-based systems primarily extract or learn the necessary metaphor-processing information from large corpora, thus avoiding the need for manual annotation or metaphor-map construction.
    Examples of such systems can be found in (Murata et. al., 2000; Nissim &amp; Markert, 2003; Mason, 2004).
    The work on supervised metonymy resolution by Nissim &amp; Markert and the work on conceptual metaphors by Mason come closest to what we are trying to do with TroFi.
    Nissim &amp; Markert (2003) approach metonymy resolution with machine learning methods, &#8
