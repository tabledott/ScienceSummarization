se patterns suggested by Justeson and Katz (1995); these terms are then the basis for a headline-like characterisation of a document.
    The final example given in this paper is Daille et al. (1994) who apply statistical filters on the extracted noun phrases.
    In that study it is concluded that term frequency is the best filter candidate of the scores investigated.
    When POS patterns are used to extract potential terms, the problem lies in how to restrict the number of terms, and only keep the ones that are relevant.
    In the case of professional indexing, the terms are normally limited to a domain-specific thesaurus, but not to those present only in the document to which they are assigned.
    For example, Steinberger (2001) presents work where as a first step, all lemmas after stop word removal in a document are ranked according to the log-likelihood ratio, thus a list of content descriptors is obtained.
    These terms are then used to assign thesaurus terms, that have been automatically assigned
