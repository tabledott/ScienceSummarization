rch without search errors.
    The search algorithm should not impose any principal limitations.
    We also expect that the search algorithm be able to scale up to very long sentences with an acceptable computing time.
    To meet these aims, it is necessary to have a mechanism that restricts the search effort.
    We accomplish such a restriction by searching in a breadth-first manner with pruning: beam search.
    In pruning, we constrain the set of considered translation candidates (the &#8220;beam&#8221;) only to the promising ones.
    We compare in beam search those hypotheses that cover different parts of the input sentence.
    This makes the comparison of the probabilities problematic.
    Therefore, we integrate an admissible estimation of the remaining probabilities to arrive at a complete translation (Section 5.6) (Garcia-Varea, Casacuberta, and Ney 1998; Garcia-Varea et al. 2001), as does the original IBM stack search decoder (Berger et al.
    1994).
    All these simplifications ultimately mak
