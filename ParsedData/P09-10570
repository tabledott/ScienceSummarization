  Minimized Models for Unsupervised Part-of-Speech Tagging
  
    We describe a novel method for the task of unsupervised POS tagging with a dictionary, one that uses integer programming to explicitly search for the smallest model that explains the data, and then uses EM to set parameter values.
    We evaluate our method on a standard test corpus using different standard tagsets (a 45-tagset as well as a smaller 17-tagset), and show that our approach performs better than existing state-of-the-art systems in both settings.
  
  
    In recent years, we have seen increased interest in using unsupervised methods for attacking different NLP tasks like part-of-speech (POS) tagging.
    The classic Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm has been shown to perform poorly on POS tagging, when compared to other techniques, such as Bayesian methods.
    In this paper, we develop new methods for unsupervised part-of-speech tagging.
    We adopt the problem formulation of Merialdo (1994), in which we are given a raw wo
