en on the convex hull of the DET curves, the equal error rate ranges from 12-25% for the different grade levels.
    We investigated the contribution of individual features to the overall performance of the SVM classifier and found that no features stood out as most important, and performance was degraded when any particular features were removed.
    We also compared error rates for the best performing SVM classifier with two traditional reading level measures, Flesch-Kincaid and Lexile.
    The Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level index is a commonly used measure of reading level based on the average number of syllables per word and average sentence length.
    The Flesch-Kincaid score for a document is intended to directly correspond with its grade level.
    We chose the Lexile measure as an example of a reading level classifier based on word lists.3 Lexile scores do not correlate directly to numeric grade levels, however a mapping of ranges of Lexile scores to their corresponding grade levels is available on the L
