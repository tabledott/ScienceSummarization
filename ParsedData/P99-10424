' abilities to answer ad hoc, domainindependent questions; this ability supports fact retrieval, as opposed to document retrieval, which could augment future search engines &#8212; see Kupiec (1993) for an example of such work.
    There has been previous work on story understanding that focuses on inferential processing, common sense reasoning, and world knowledge required for in-depth understanding of stories.
    These efforts concern themselves with specific aspects of knowledge representation, inference techniques, or question types &#8212; see Lehnert (1983) or Schubert (to appear).
    In contrast, our research is concerned with building systems that can answer ad hoc questions about arbitrary documents from varied domains.
    We report here on our initial pilot study to determine the feasibility of this task.
    We purchased a small (hard copy) corpus of development and test materials (about 60 stories in each) consisting of remedial reading materials for grades 3-6; these materials are simulated ne
