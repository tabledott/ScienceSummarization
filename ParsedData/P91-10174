on on Hebrew, because Hebrew does not distinguish between them.
    The solution suggested in this paper is to identify the lexical relationships in corpora of the target language, instead of the source language.
    Consulting English corpora of 150 million words, yields the following statistics on single word frequencies: 'sign' appeared 28674 times, 'seal' 2771 times, 'finish' appeared 15595 times, 'close' 38291 times, 'treaty' 7331 times and 'contract' 30757 times.
    Using a naive approach of choosing the most frequent word yields (3) *That issue prevented the two countries from closing a peace contract.
    This may be improved upon if we use lexical relations.
    We consider word combinations and count how often they appeared in the same syntactic relation as in the ambiguous sentence.
    For the above example, among the successfully parsed sentences of the corpus, the noun compound 'peace treaty' appeared 49 times, whereas the compound 'peace contract' did not appear at all; 'to sign a treaty' appe
