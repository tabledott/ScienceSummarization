give convincing evidence of the power of statistical methods to extract linguistically interesting correlations from large corpora.
    We also show automatically derived word-by-word alignments for several sentences.
    In Section 6, we discuss some shortcomings of our models and propose modifications to address some of them.
    In the final section, we discuss the significance of our work and the possibility of extending it to other pairs of languages.
    Finally, we include two appendices: one to summarize notation and one to collect the formulae for the various models that we describe and to fill an occasional gap in our development.
