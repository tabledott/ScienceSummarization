g procedure matches 61% of the English words with some French word, and about 95% of these pairs match the English word with the appropriate French word.
  After word correspondences have been identified, it is possible to estimate a probabilistic transfer dictionary.
  The entry for "the" found in prawn et al.)
  includes the estimates of ~rob(le I the)=.61 and Prob(1a I the)=.18.
  show how this probabilistic transfer dictionary can be combined with a trigram grammar in order to produce a machine translation system.
  Since this paper is primarily concerned with the identification of word correspondences.
  we will not go into these other very interesting issues here.
  Applications Beyond MT As mentioned above, MT is not the only motivation for sentence alignment and word correspondence.
  Computational linguists (e.g.. Klavans and Tzoukermann, 1990) have recently become interested in bilingual concordances.
  Table 1, for example, shows a bilingual concordance contrasting the uses of bank that are transla
