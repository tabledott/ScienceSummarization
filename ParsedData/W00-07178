nd at least half the time had that CLAWS tag.
    I then tested the accuracy of my assignment algorithm by marking it as correct if it assigned the word to a 'plausible' cluster &#8212; for AJO, either of the clusters &amp;quot;NEW&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;IMPORTANT&amp;quot;, and for NN1, one of the clusters &amp;quot;TIME&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;PEOPLE&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;WORLD&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;GROUP&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;FACT&amp;quot;.
    I did this for n in {1, 2, 3, 5, 10, 20}.
    I proceeded similarly for the Brown clustering algorithm, selecting two clusters for NN1 and four for AJO.
    This can only be approximate, since the choice of acceptable clusters is rather arbitrary, and the BNC tags are not perfectly accurate, but the results are quite clear; for words that occur 5 times or less the CDC algorithm is clearly more accurate.
    Evaluation is in general difficult with unsupervised learning algorithms.
    Previous authors have relied on both informal evaluations of the plausibility of the c
