erted to semantic dependency graphs in XML for mat, and then these graphs were compared.
			There are three points that make this task harder and more interesting than earlier SRL tasks: (1) while previous tasks focused on role assignment, the current task also comprises the identification of the appropriate FrameNet frame, similar to WSD, (2)the task comprises not only the labeling of individual predicates and their arguments, but also the integration of all labels into an overall semantic depen dency graph, a partial semantic representation of the overall sentence meaning based on frames and roles, and (3) the test data includes occurrences of frames that are not seen in the training data.
			For these cases, participant systems have to identify theclosest known frame.
			This is a very realistic scenario, encouraging the development of robust systems showing graceful degradation in the face of un known events.
