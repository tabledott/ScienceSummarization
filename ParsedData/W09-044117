corporate statistical significance, we calculated the 95% confidence interval for each correlation coefficient and found the highest and lowest rank from which the correlation coefficient was statistically indistinguishable, resulting in lower and upper bounds of the rank for each metric in each condition.
    The average lower bound, actual, and upper bound ranks (where a rank of 1 indicates the highest correlation) of the top metrics, as well as BLEU and TER, are shown in Table 4, sorted by the average upper bound Pearson correlation.
    Full descriptions of the other metrics3, the evaluation results, and the test set composition are available from NIST (Przybocki et al., 2008).
    This analysis shows that TERp was consistently one of the top metrics across test conditions and had the highest average rank both in terms of Pearson and Spearman correlations.
    While this analysis is not comprehensive, it does give a general idea of the performance of all metrics by synthesizing the results into a single t
