sentence with head-word and argument (or complement) information using heuristics that are common to most contemporary statistical parsers and easily available for both English and Chinese.
    Note that we do not use the word alignment information for the decomposition into TAG elementary trees.
    Once we have a TAG elementary tree per word, we can create several models that score word alignments by exploiting the alignments between TAG elementary trees between source and target.
    Let tfi and tei be the TAG elementary trees associated with the aligned words fi and ei respectively.
    We experimented with two models over alignments: unigram model over alignments: ni P(fi, tfi, ei, tei) and conditional model: Hi P(ei, tei  |fi, tfi) &#215; P(fi+1, tfi+1  |fi,tfi) We trained both of these models using the SRI Language Modeling Toolkit using 60K aligned parse trees.
    We extracted 1300 TAG elementary trees each for Chinese and for English.
    The unigram model gets a %BLEU score of 31.7 and the conditio
