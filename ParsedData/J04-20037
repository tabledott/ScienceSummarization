1997) propose a statistical language model for inflected languages.
    They decompose word forms into stems and affixes.
    Maltese and Mancini (1992) report that a linear interpolation of word n-grams, part of speech n-grams, and lemma n-grams yields lower perplexity than pure word-based models.
    Larson et al. (2000) apply a data-driven algorithm for decomposing compound words in compounding languages as well as for recombining phrases to enhance the pronunciation lexicon and the language model for large-vocabulary speech recognition systems.
    As regards machine translation, the treatment of morphology is part of the analysis and generation step in virtually every symbolic machine translation system.
    For this purpose, the lexicon should contain base forms of words and the grammatical category, subcategorization features, and semantic information in order to enable the size of the lexicon to be reduced and in order to account for unknown word forms, that is, word forms not present explicitly in th
