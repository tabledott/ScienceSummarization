rform as well as relational similarity.
  
  
    This section is a brief survey of the many problems that involve semantic relations and could potentially make use of an algorithm for measuring relational similarity.
    The problem of recognizing word analogies is, given a stem word pair and a finite list of choice word pairs, selecting the choice that is most analogous to the stem.
    This problem was first attempted by a system called Argus (Reitman 1965), using a small hand-built semantic network.
    Argus could only solve the limited set of analogy questions that its programmer had anticipated.
    Argus was based on a spreading activation model and did not explicitly attempt to measure relational similarity.
    Turney et al. (2003) combined 13 independent modules to answer SAT questions.
    The final output of the system was based on a weighted combination of the outputs of each individual module.
    The best of the 13 modules was the VSM, which is described in detail in Turney and Littman (2005).
