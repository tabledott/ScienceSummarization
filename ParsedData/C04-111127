ee an interesting need to de velop fast, robust, and scalable methods to mine semantic information from the Web.
			This paper compares and contrasts two methods for extracting is-a relations from corpora.
			We presented a novel pattern-based algorithm, scalable to the terascale, which outperforms its more informed syntactical co-occurrence counterpart on very small and very large data.
			Albeit possible to successfully apply linguisti cally-light but data-rich approaches to some NLP applications, merely reporting these results often fails to yield insights into the underlying theories of language at play.
			Our biggest challenge as we venture to the terascale is to use our new found wealth not only to build better systems, but to im prove our understanding of language.
