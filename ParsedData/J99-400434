et; that is, it is a maximum that is defined in the infinite case.
    We can now define max for the case of infinite sums.
    Let Vit where E &#8226; D represents the concatenation of the two derivation forests. best semiring, which is used for constructing n-best lists.
    Intuitively, the value of a string using this semiring will be the n most likely derivations of that string (unless there are fewer than n total derivations.)
    In practice, this is actually how a Viterbi-n-best semiring would typically be implemented.
    From a theoretical viewpoint, however, this implementation is inadequate, since we must also define infinite sums and be sure that the distributive property holds.
    Elsewhere (Goodman 1998), we give a mathematically precise definition of the semiring that handles these cases.
  
  
    Recall that the value of an item x is just V(x) = @DEinner(x)11(D), the sum of the values of all derivation trees headed by x.
    This definition may require summing over exponentially many or eve
