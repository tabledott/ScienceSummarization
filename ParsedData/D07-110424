 to both the maximal prefix and maximal suffix of any phrase that we might consider.
			5.4.3 Prefix Trees and Suffix Links Our search optimizations are easily captured in a prefix tree data structure augmented with suffix links.Formally, a prefix tree is an unminimized determin istic finite-state automaton that recognizes all of thepatterns in some set.

			Its prefix is represented by node (2), and node (2)?s suffix is represented by node (3).
			Therefore, node (1)?s suffix is represented by the node pointed to by the d-edge from
