	Mining WordNet For A Fuzzy Sentiment: Sentiment Tag Extraction From WordNet Glosses
		Many of the tasks required for semantic tagging of phrases and texts rely on a list of words annotated with some semanticfeatures.
		We present a method for ex tracting sentiment-bearing adjectives fromWordNet using the Sentiment Tag Extrac tion Program (STEP).
		We did 58 STEP runs on unique non-intersecting seed lists drawn from manually annotated list ofpositive and negative adjectives and evaluated the results against other manually annotated lists.
		The 58 runs were then col lapsed into a single set of 7, 813 unique words.
		For each word we computed a Net Overlap Score by subtracting the totalnumber of runs assigning this word a neg ative sentiment from the total of the runs that consider it positive.
		We demonstrate that Net Overlap Score can be used as ameasure of the words degree of member ship in the fuzzy category of sentiment:the core adjectives, which had the high est Net Overlap scores, were identifiedmost
