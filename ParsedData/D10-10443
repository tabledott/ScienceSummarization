, including the output from an SVM classifier that uses the intersection between IN and OUT as positive examples.
    Our second contribution is to apply instance weighting at the level of phrase pairs.
    Sentence pairs are the natural instances for SMT, but sentences often contain a mix of domain-specific and general language.
    For instance, the sentence Similar improvements in haemoglobin levels were reported in the scientific literature for other epoetins would likely be considered domain-specific despite the presence of general phrases like were reported in.
    Phrase-level granularity distinguishes our work from previous work by Matsoukas et al (2009), who weight sentences according to sub-corpus and genre membership.
    Finally, we make some improvements to baseline approaches.
    We train linear mixture models for conditional phrase pair probabilities over IN and OUT so as to maximize the likelihood of an empirical joint phrase-pair distribution extracted from a development set.
    This is a s
