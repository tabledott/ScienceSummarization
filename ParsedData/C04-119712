PP, or NP.
			Sub-categorization describes the phrase structure around the predicate.
			We separate the clause where the predicate is in into three parts?the predicate chunk, segments before and after the predicate, and use the sequence of phrase types of these three segments.
			Baseline features identified not in the main verb chunk as AM-NEG and modal verb in the main verb chunk as AM-MOD.
			Clause coverage describes how much of the local clause (from the predicate) is covered by the target argument.?
			Chunk pattern length feature counts the num ber of patterns in the argument.?
			Conjunctions join every pair of the above fea tures as new features.
			Boundary words &amp; POS tag include twowords/tags before and after the target argu ment.
			Bigrams are pairs of words/tags in the window from two words before the target to the first word of the target, and also from the last word to two words after the argument.
			1We use simple rules to first decide if a candidate phrase type is VP, NP, or PP.
