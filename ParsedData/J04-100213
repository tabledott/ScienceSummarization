ribution over word classes, but what is observed in the corpus is a distribution over word forms.
    Resnik&#8217;s algorithm works around this problem by approximating a word class distribution from the word form distribution.
    For each word form observed filling a case slot, credit is divided evenly among all of that word form&#8217;s possible senses (and their ancestors in WordNet).
    Although Resnik&#8217;s algorithm makes no explicit attempt at sense disambiguation, greater activation tends to accumulate in those nodes that best characterize a predicate&#8217;s selectional preferences.
    CorMet uses Resnik&#8217;s algorithm to learn domain-specific selection preferences.
    It often finds different selectional preferences for predicates whose preferences should, intuitively, be the same.
    In the MILITARY domain, the object of assault selects strongly for fortification but not social group, whereas the selectional preferences for the object of attack are the opposite.
