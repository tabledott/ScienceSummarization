both areas even though experimental results are only given for the restricted domain of retrieval from FAQ pages.
  
  
    Large-scale collection of question-answer pairs has been hampered in previous work by the small sizes of publicly available FAQ collections or by restricted access to retrieval results via public APIs of search engines.
    Jijkoun and de Rijke (2005) nevertheless managed to extract around 300,000 FAQ pages and 2.8 million question-answer pairs by repeatedly querying search engines with &#8220;intitle:faq&#8221; and &#8220;inurl:faq&#8221;.
    Soricut and Brill (2006) could deploy a proprietary URL collection of 1 billion URLs to extract 2.3 million FAQ pages containing the uncased string &#8220;faq&#8221; in the url string.
    The extraction of question-answer pairs amounted to a database of 1 million pairs in their experiment.
    However, inspection of the publicly available WebFAQ collection provided by Jijkoun and de Rijke2 showed a great amount of noise in the retrieved FAQ pages
