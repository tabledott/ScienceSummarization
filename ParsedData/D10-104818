fiers only feature, while Pass 5 removes the word inclusion constraint.
    All in all, these two passes yield an improvement of 1.7 pairwise F1 points, due to recall improvements.
    Table 2 shows that the word inclusion feature is more precise than compatible modifiers only, but the latter has better recall.
    This pass relaxes the cluster head match heuristic by allowing the mention head to match any word in the cluster of the candidate antecedent.
    For example, this heuristic matches the mention Sanders to a cluster containing the mentions {Sauls, the judge, Circuit Judge N. Sanders Sauls}.
    To maintain high precision, this pass requires that both mention and antecedent be labeled as named entities and the types coincide.
    Furthermore, this pass implements a conjunction of the above features with word inclusion and not i-within-i.
    This pass yields less than 1 point improvement in most metrics.
    With one exception (Pass 2), all the previous coreference models focus on nominal coreference
