ication, we again perform a series of ablation experiments.
    As before, we start with the word+priorpol baseline classifier, add different sets of polarity features, train new classifiers, and compare the results of the new classifiers to the baseline.
    Increases and decreases for a given metric as compared to the word+priorpol baseline are indicated by + or &#8211;, respectively; ++ or &#8211; &#8211; indicates the change is significant at the p &lt; 0.1 level; +++ or &#8211; &#8211; &#8211; indicates significance at the p &lt; 0.05 level.
    Table 16 lists the sets of features tested in each experiment, and Table 17 shows the results of the experiments.
    Results are reported as they were previously in Section 8.1.2, with increases and decreases compared to the baseline for a given metric indicated by + or &#8211;, respectively.
    Looking at Table 17, we see that all three sets of polarity features help to increase performance as measured by accuracy and positive and negative F-measures.
