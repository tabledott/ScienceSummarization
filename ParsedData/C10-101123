e features and to calculate the weightarrays can be well implemented as parallel algo rithm.
			We could also successful parallelize theprojective parsing and the non-projective approximation algorithm.
			Algorithm 4 shows the paral lel feature extraction in pseudo code.
			The mainmethod prepares a list of tasks which can be per formed in parallel and afterwards it creates thethreads that perform the tasks.
			Each thread re moves from the task list an element, carries out the task and stores the result.
			This procedure is repeated until the list is empty.
			The main method waits until all threads are completed and returns the result.
