 the 50% baseline, with some classifiers being as accurate as that that distinguishes between CAUSE-EXPLANATION-EVIDENCE and ELABORATION relations, which has an accuracy of 93%.
    We have also built a six-way classifier to distinguish between all six relation types.
    This classifier has a performance of 49.7%, with a baseline of 16.67%, which is achieved by labeling all relations as CONTRASTS.
    We also examined the learning curves of various classifiers and noticed that, for some of them, the addition of training examples does not appear to have a significant impact on their performance.
    For example, the classifier that distinguishes between CONTRAST and CAUSE-EXPLANATION-EVIDENCE relations has an accuracy of 87.1% when trained on 2,000,000 examples and an accuracy of 87.3% when trained on 4,771,534 examples.
    We hypothesized that the flattening of the learning curve is explained by the noise in our training data and the vast amount of word pairs that are not likely to be good predictors of dis
