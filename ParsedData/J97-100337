    Large paragraph-sized intervals for measuring introduction of new words seem unlikely to be useful since every paragraph of a given length should have approximately the same number of new words, although those at the beginning of a subtopic segment will probably have slightly more.
    Instead, I use interval lengths of size 40, closer to Youmans' suggestion of 35.
    Second, the granularity at which Youmans takes measurements is too fine, since he plots the score at every word.
    Sampling this frequently yields a very spiky plot from which it is quite difficult to draw conclusions at a paragraph-sized granularity.
    I 6 This might be explained in part by Stark (1988) who shows that readers disagree measurably about where to place paragraph boundaries when presented with texts with those boundaries removed. plot the score at every sentence gap, thus eliminating the wide variation that is seen when measuring after each word.
    Results for this approach are reported in Section 6.
