erate the source language sen tence (noisy-channel model).
			Similar stories can also be found in paraphrasing (Quirk et al, 2004; Wu, 2005) and textual entailment (Harabagiu and Hickl, 2006; Wu, 2005).
			Our story makes use of a weighted formalism known as quasi-synchronous grammar (hereafter, QG), originally developed by D. Smith and Eisner(2006) for machine translation.
			Unlike most synchronous formalisms, QG does not posit a strict iso morphism between the two trees, and it providesan elegant description for the set of local configura tions.
			In Section 2 we situate our contribution in thecontext of earlier work, and we give a brief discus sion of quasi-synchronous grammars in Section 3.
			Our version of QG, called the Jeopardy model, and our parameter estimation method are described inSection 4.
			Experimental results comparing our ap proach to two state-of-the-art baselines are presented in Section 5.
			We discuss portability to cross-lingual QA and other applied semantic processing tasks in Se
