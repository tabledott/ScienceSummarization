given sentence/tree pair containing a conjunction and/or a punctuation mark, there is an infinite number of similar sentence/tree pairs with arbitrary amounts of &#8220;conjunctive&#8221; material between the same two nodes.
    Because all of these trees have the same, nonzero probability, the sum ETP(T), where T is a possible tree generated by the model, diverges, meaning the model is inconsistent (Booth and Thompson 1973).
    Another consequence of not generating posthead conjunctions and punctuation as first-class words is that they The Collins model assigns equal probability to these three trees. do not count when calculating the head-adjacency component of Collins&#8217; distance metric.
    When emulating Collins&#8217; model, instead of reproducing the Ppun, and PCC parameter classes directly in our parsing engine, we chose to use a different mechanism that does not yield an inconsistent model but still estimates the large joint event that was the motivation behind these parameters in the first place
