es a network of frames and, again following Quillian, marker passing to find minimum-length paths of association between frames for senses of words in context in order to choose among them.
    He introduces &amp;quot;polaroid words,&amp;quot; a mechanism which progressively eliminates inappropriate senses based on syntactic evidence provided by the parser, together with semantic relations found in the frame network.
    Eventually only one sense remains; however, Hirst reports that in cases where some word (including words other than the target) in the sentence is used metaphorically, metonymically, or in an unknown sense, the polaroids often end by eliminating all possible senses, and fail.
    Wilks' preference semantics ([1968, 1969, 1973, 1975a, 1975b, 1975c, 1975d]; see the survey by Wilks and Fass [1990]), which uses Masterman's primitives, is essentially a case-based approach to natural language understanding and one of the first specifically designed to deal with the problem of sense disambiguation.
