test cor pus with gold standard tags.
			The mapping is automatically produced by the organizers, and the resulting results evaluated according to theusual precision and recall measures for super vised word sense disambiguation systems.
			We call this evaluation supervised.
			We will see each of them in turn.
			2.1 Unsupervised evaluation.
			In this setting the results of the systems are treated as clusters of examples and gold standard senses are classes.
			In order to compare the clusters with the classes, hand annotated corpora is needed.
			The testset is first tagged with the induced senses.
			A per fect clustering solution will be the one where each cluster has exactly the same examples as one of the classes, and vice versa.Following standard cluster evaluation practice (Zhao and Karypis, 2005), we consider the FS core measure for measuring the performance of the systems.
			The FScore is used in a similar fashion to Information Retrieval exercises, with precisionand recall defined as the percenta
