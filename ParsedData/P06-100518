ueries for each new word, while ours are all pre-stored in a table for fast access.
    We are pleased to be able to share our gender and number data with the NLP community.2 In Section 6, we show the benefit of this data as a probabilistic feature in our pronoun resolution system.
    Probabilistic data is useful because it allows us to rapidly prototype resolution systems without incurring the overhead of large-scale lexical databases such as WordNet (Miller et al., 1990).
    Researchers since Dagan and Itai (1990) have variously argued for and against the utility of collocation statistics between nouns and parents for improving the performance of pronoun resolution.

    If the verb phrase was shatter it, we would expect it to refer to some kind of brittle entity.
    Like path coreference, semantic compatibility can be considered a form of world knowledge needed for more
