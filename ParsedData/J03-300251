s u, then the current implementation will do at most p &#215; u string matches of length no more than l.17 (Currently we use C strcmp for string matching.)
    In practice, this is extremely fast: We can generate handles for nearly 5,000 URLs per second on a six-year-old Sun Ultra 1 workstation.
    Figure 6 illustrates handle generation on two real URLs.
    As one would hope, these two URLs produce the same handle, and as a result, they wind up in the same bucket in step 3.18 In step 4, the URLs in each bucket are used to generate candidate pairs by taking the cross product and keeping those URL pairs for which the URL bookkeeping data indicate pages that are in the correct languages.
    For example, given the bucket containing the two URLs in Figure 6, this step would generate a single pair consisting of be more efficient to create buckets by doing a parallel sort of the entire URL set using the handle as the key, and then creating buckets based on identical handles&#8217; being on adjacent lines. the URL
