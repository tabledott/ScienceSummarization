ty &lt; n of morpho-syntactic tags considered relevant (see Section 2.4 for a description of the detection of relevant tags): In terms of the hierarchy introduced in Section 4.1, this means that information at three different levels in the hierarchy is combined.
    The subsets T of relevant tags mentioned previously fix the intermediate level.2 This choice of the types of features as well as the choice of the subsets T is reasonable but somewhat arbitrary.
    Alternatively one can think of defining a much more general set of features and applying some method of feature selection, as has been done, for example, by Foster (2000), who compared different methods for feature selection within the task of translation modeling for statistical machine translation.
    Note that the log-linear model introduced here uses one parameter per feature.
    For the Verbmobil task, for example, there are approximately 162, 000 parameters: 47,800 for the first-order features, 55,700 for the second-order features, and 58,500 f
