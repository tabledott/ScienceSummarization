e.
    However, that constraint does not apply to prepositional phrases, so 'prep_phrase' has arguments.
    The non-terminal 'sentence' (and consequently 'verb_phrase') has a single argument, because in a relative clause the trace must occur in the sentence immediately to the right of the relative pronoun.
    It is obvious that in a more extensive grammar, many non-terminals would need extraposition arguments, and the increased complication would make the grammar larger and less readable.
    Colmerauer's MG formalism allows an alternative way to express left extraposition.
    It involves the use of rules whose left-hand side is a non-terminal followed by a string of &amp;quot;dummy&amp;quot; terminal symbols which do not occur in the input vocabulary.
    An example of such a rule is: rel_marker, [t] --&gt; rel pronoun.
    Its meaning is that 'rel pronoun' can be analysed as a 'rel marker' provided that the terminal 't' is added to the front of the input remaining after the rule application.
