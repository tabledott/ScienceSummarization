list of all features, sorted by decreasing strength.
    It classifies an ambiguous target word by matching each feature in the list in turn against the target context.
    Instead of stopping at the first matching feature, however, it traverses the entire list, combining evidence from all matching features, and resolving conflicts where necessary.
    This method is essentially the same as the one for collocations (see Figure 2), except that it uses context words as well as collocations for the features.
    The only new wrinkle is in checking for conflicts between features (in step (2) at run time), as there are now two kinds of features to consider.
    If both features are context words, we say the features never conflict (as in the method of context words).
    If both features are collocations, we say they conflict if they overlap (as in the method of collocations).
    The new case is if one feature is a context word, and the other is a collocation.
    Consider, for example, the context word walk, and
