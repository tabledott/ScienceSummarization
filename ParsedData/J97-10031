i-paragraph subtopic segmentation should be useful for many text analysis tasks, including information retrieval and summarization.
  
  
    Most work in discourse processing, both theoretical and computational, has focused on analysis of interclausal or intersentential phenomena.
    This level of analysis is important for many discourse-processing tasks, such as anaphor resolution and dialogue generation.
    However, important and interesting discourse phenomena also occur at the level of the paragraph.
    This article describes a paragraph-level model of discourse structure based on the notion of subtopic shift, and an algorithm for subdividing expository texts into multi-paragraph &amp;quot;passages&amp;quot; or subtopic segments.
    In this work, the structure of an expository text is characterized as a sequence of subtopical discussions that occur in the context of one or more main topic discussions.
    Consider a 21-paragraph science news article, called Stargazers, whose main topic is the existen
