ted into CCG learning algorithms such as the algorithm described in ZC05.A second contribution of the work is a new, online algorithm for CCG learning.
			The approach in volves perceptron training of a model with hidden variables.
			In this sense it is related to the algorithmof Liang et al (2006).
			However it has the addi tional twist of also performing grammar induction(lexical learning) in an online manner.
			In our experiments, we show that the new algorithm is consid erably more efficient than the ZC05 algorithm; this is important when training on large training sets, for example the ATIS data used in this paper.
			Results for the approach on ATIS data show 86%F-measure accuracy in recovering fully correct semantic analyses, and 95.9% F-measure by a partial match criterion described by He and Young (2006).
			The latter figure contrasts with a figure of 90.3% for the approach reported by He and Young (2006).1Results on the Geo880 domain also show an im provement in accuracy, with 88.9% F-measure fo
