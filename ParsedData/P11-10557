includes repeated factors for making sentence level predictions as well as globals factors for aggregating these choices.
    For each entity pair e = (e1, e2), define x to be a vector concatenating the individual sentences xi E S(e1,e2), Y to be vector of binary Yr random variables, one for each r E R, and Z to be the vector of Zi variables, one for each sentence xi.
    Our conditional extraction model is defined as follows: where the parameter vector &#952; is used, below, to define the factor cfiextract.
    The factors Voin are deterministic OR operators which are included to ensure that the ground fact r(e) is predicted at the aggregate level for the assignment Yr = yr only if at least one of the senwhere the features &#966;j are sensitive to the relation name assigned to extraction variable zi, if any, and cues from the sentence xi.
    We will make use of the Mintz et al. (2009) sentence-level features in the expeiments, as described in Section 7.
    This model was designed to provide a joint approac
