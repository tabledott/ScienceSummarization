es like thesauri (Mohammad et al., 2009)) is that it allows the lexicons to include non-standard entries, most notably spelling mistakes and variations, slang, and multiword expressions.
    The primary goal of our study is to understand the characteristics and practical usefulness of such a lexicon.
    Towards this end, we provide both a qualitative and quantitative analysis for a web-derived English lexicon relative to two previously published lexicons &#8211; the lexicon used in Wilson et al. (2005) and the lexicon used in Blair-Goldensohn et al.
    (2008).
    Our experiments show that a web-derived lexicon is not only significantly larger, but has improved accuracy on a sentence polarity classification task, which is an important problem in many sentiment analysis applications, including sentiment aggregation and summarization (Hu and Liu, 2004; Carenini et al., 2006; Lerman et al., 2009).
    These results hold true both when the lexicons are used in conjunction with string matching to classify senten
