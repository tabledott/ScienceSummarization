d classes: adjectives, adverbs, and cardinals, are checked for lexical similarity with their counter-parts and included in the corresponding word class set if a match is found.
    The similarity between the input text segments Ti and Tj is then determined using a scoring function that combines the word-to-word similarities and the word specificity: This score, which has a value between 0 and 1, is a measure of the directional similarity, in this case computed with respect to Ti.
    The scores from both directions can be combined into a bidirectional similarity using a simple average function: sim(Ti, Tj) = sim(Ti, Tj)Ti + sim(Ti, Tj)Tj (8) 2 Text Segment 1: The jurors were taken into the courtroom in groups of 40 and asked to fill out a questionnaire.
  
  
    We illustrate the application of the text similarity measure with an example.
    Given two text segments, as shown in Figure 1, we want to determine a score that reflects their semantic similarity.
    For illustration purposes, we restrict our atte
