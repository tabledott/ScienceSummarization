he AltaVista corpus and VSM-WMTS is VSM with the WMTS corpus.
    The results for VSM-AV are taken from Turney and Littman (2005).
    All three pairwise differences in the three F measures are statistically significant at the 95% level, according to the Paired t-Test (Feelders and Verkooijen 1995).
    The accuracy of LRA is significantly higher than the accuracies of VSM-AV and VSM-WMTS, according to the Fisher Exact Test (Agresti 1990), but the difference between the two VSM accuracies is not significant.
    Table 21 compares the performance of LRA and VSM on the 5 class problem.
    The accuracy and F measure of LRA are significantly higher than the accuracies and
  
  
    The experimental results in Sections 6 and 7 demonstrate that LRA performs significantly better than the VSM, but it is also clear that there is room for improvement.
    The accuracy might not yet be adequate for practical applications, although past work has shown that it is possible to adjust the trade-off of precision versus recal
