    There is a rich tradition of supervised and unsupervised learning in the domain of morphology.
    Rumelhart and McClelland (1986), Egedi and Sproat (1988), Ling (1994) and Mooney and Calif (1995) have each investigated the supervised learning of the English past tense from paired training data, the first two using phonologicallybased connectionist models and the latter two performing comparative studies with ID3 decision trees and first-order decision lists respectively.
    Brent (1993, 1999), de Marcken (1995), Kazakov (1997) and Goldsmith (2000) have each focused on the problem of unsupervised learning of morphological systems as essentially a segmentation task, yielding a morphologically plausible and statistically motivated partition of stems and affixes.
    Brent and de Marcken both have used a minimum description length framework, with the primary goal of inducing lexemes from boundaryless speech-like streams.
