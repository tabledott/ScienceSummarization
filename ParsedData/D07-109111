 on lemmas or stems yields improved alignment quality.
			Each mapping step forms a component of the overall model.
			From a training point of view thismeans that we need to learn translation and gener ation tables from the word-aligned parallel corpus and define scoring methods that help us to choose between ambiguous mappings.
			Phrase-based translation models are acquired from a word-aligned parallel corpus by extracting allphrase-pairs that are consistent with the word align ment.
			Given the set of extracted phrase pairs with counts, various scoring functions are estimated, such as conditional phrase translation probabilities based on relative frequency estimation or lexical translation probabilities based on the words in the phrases.
			In our approach, the models for the translationsteps are acquired in the same manner from a word aligned parallel corpus.
			For the specified factors in the input and output, phrase mappings are extracted.The set of phrase mappings (now over factored rep resentations
