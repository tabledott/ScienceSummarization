mation ISER of more than 16% as compared to the baseline.
    Training on 5,000 sentences plus conventional dictionary: Restructuring alone can improve the translation quality from 37.3% to 33.6%.
    The benefit from the hierarchical lexicon is larger in this setup, and the resulting in SSER is 31.8%.
    This is a relative improvement of almost 15%.
    The relative improvement in terms of ISER is almost 22%.
    Note that by applying the methods proposed here, the corpus for training can be reduced to less than 10% of the original size while increasing the SSER only from 30.2% to 31.8% compared to the baseline when using the full corpus.
    Training only on conventional dictionary: In this setup the impact of the hierarchical lexicon is clearly larger than the effect of the restructuring methods, because here the data sparseness problem is much more important than the word order problem.
    The overall relative reduction in terms of SSER is 13.7% and in terms of ISER 19.1%.
    An error rate of about 52%
