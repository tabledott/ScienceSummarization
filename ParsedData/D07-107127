on and Mooney, 2002; Tang and Mooney, 2000; Kate et al, 2005), andideas from string kernels and support vector ma chines (Kate and Mooney, 2006; Nguyen et al, 2006).
			In our experiments we compare to He and Young (2006) on the ATIS domain and Zettlemoyerand Collins (2005) on the Geo880 domain, because these systems currently achieve the best per formance on these problems.
			The approach of Zettlemoyer and Collins (2005) was presented in section 2.4.
			He and Young (2005) describe an algorithm that learns a probabilisticpush-down automaton that models hierarchical de pendencies but can still be trained on a data set that does not have full treebank-style annotations.
			Thisapproach has been integrated with a speech recog nizer and shown to be robust to recognition errors (He and Young, 2006).There is also related work in the CCG litera ture.
			Clark and Curran (2003) present a method forlearning the parameters of a log-linear CCG pars ing model from fully annotated normal?form parse trees.
