    Other pairs are derivationally reasonable: (&amp;quot;b&amp;quot; , &amp;quot;v&amp;quot;), (&amp;quot;x&amp;quot; , &amp;quot;s&amp;quot;) and (&amp;quot;s&amp;quot; , &amp;quot;c&amp;quot;); while some may be noise: (&amp;quot;g&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;n&amp;quot;) and (&amp;quot;g&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;v&amp;quot;).
    Not shown are vowel-to-vowel substitutions which in general were the most highly ranked; also not shown are tight correspondences between accented and unaccented vowel variants which were also learned by the stochastic transducer.
    As can be observed from Table 1, pure Levenshtein distance (L) works surprisingly well.
    Dynamic adaptation via the stochastic transducers (S) also gives a notable boost on French-Portuguese (increasing cognate accuracy from 66% to 79%) but offer little improvement for Spanish-Portuguese (perhaps because pure Levenshtein needs no diffusion for relatively close languages while more complex mappings benefit from training).
    Similarly, a s
