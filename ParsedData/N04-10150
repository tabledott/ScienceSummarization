	Catching The Drift: Probabilistic Content Models With Applications To Generation And Summarization
		We consider the problem of modeling the content structure of texts within a specific do main, in terms of the topics the texts address and the order in which these topics appear.
		We first present an effective knowledge-leanmethod for learning content models from unannotated documents, utilizing a novel adaptation of algorithms for Hidden Markov Models.
		We then apply our method to two complementary tasks: information ordering and ex tractive summarization.
		Our experiments showthat incorporating content models in these ap plications yields substantial improvement over previously-proposed methods.
	
	
			The development and application of computational models of text structure is a central concern in natural language processing.
			Document-level analysis of text struc ture is an important instance of such work.
			Previous research has sought to characterize texts in terms of domain-independent rhetorica
