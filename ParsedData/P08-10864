cted word are replaced by their class.
    Once a partition of the words in the vocabulary is obtained, two-sided class-based models can be built just like word-based n-gram models using existing infrastructure.
    In addition, the size of the model is usually greatly reduced.
    Two-sided class-based models received most attention in the literature.
    However, several different types of mixed word and class models have been proposed for the purpose of improving the performance of the model (Goodman, 2000), reducing its size (Goodman and Gao, 2000) as well as lowering the complexity of related clustering algorithms (Whittaker and Woodland, 2001).
    In (Emami and Jelinek, 2005) a clustering algorithm is introduced which outputs a separate clustering for each word position in a trigram model.
    In the experimental evaluation, the authors observe the largest improvements using a specific clustering for the last word of each trigram but no clustering at all for the first two word positions.
