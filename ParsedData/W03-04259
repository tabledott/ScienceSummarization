er estimation type obtains a lower performance than the latter.
    In a last experiment using only features extracted from the training data, we use the RRM method to compute the function f in Equation (1), allowing the system to select a good performing combination of features.
    At training time, the system was fed the output of each classifier on the cross-classified data, the part-of-speech and chunk boundary tags.
    At test time, the system was fed the classifications of each system trained on the entire training data, and the corresponding POS and chunk boundary tags.
    The result obtained rivals the one obtained by model 2, both displaying a 17% reduction in F-measure error4, indicating that maybe all sources of information have been explored and incorporated.
    The RRM method is showing its combining power when additional information sources are used.
    Specifically, the system was fed additional feature streams from a list of gazetteers and the output of two other named entity systems trai
