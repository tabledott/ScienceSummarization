ple from Hobbs (1978): Hobbs identifies the coherence relation as elaboration.
    But it could just as easily be explanation.
    This distinction depends on context, knowledge, and beliefs.
    For example, if you questioned John's ability to open Bill's safe, you would probably identify the relation as explanation.
    Otherwise you could identify it as elaboration.
    Here is another example: The coherence relation here could be elaboration (on the buying), or explanation (of when, how, or why), or cause (he bought the raincoat because it was raining out).
    The point is that the identity of coherence relations is &amp;quot;interpretative,&amp;quot; whereas the identity of cohesion relations is not.
    At a general level, even if the precise coherence relation is not known, the relation &amp;quot;is about the same thing&amp;quot; exists if coherence exists.
    In the example from Hobbs above, safe and combination are lexically related, which in a general sense means they &amp;quot;are about the same
