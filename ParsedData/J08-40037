    Classifier-based dependency parsing was pioneered by Kudo and Matsumoto (2002) for unlabeled dependency parsing of Japanese with head-final dependencies only.
    The algorithm was generalized to allow both head-final and head-initial dependencies by Yamada and Matsumoto (2003), who reported very good parsing accuracy for English, using dependency structures extracted from the Penn Treebank for training and testing.
    The approach was extended to labeled dependency parsing by Nivre, Hall, and Nilsson (2004) (for Swedish) and Nivre and Scholz (2004) (for English), using a different parsing algorithm first presented in Nivre (2003).
    At a recent evaluation of data-driven systems for dependency parsing with data from 13 different languages (Buchholz and Marsi 2006), the deterministic classifier-based parser of Nivre et al. (2006) reached top performance together with the system of McDonald, Lerman, and Pereira (2006), which is based on a global discriminative model with online learning.
