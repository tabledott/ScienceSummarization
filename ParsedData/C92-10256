wo-level repre- sentation of happier and better are: AcrF.s DE COLING-92, NANTES, 23-28 Ao0r 1992 1 4 2 Our formal understanding of finite-state morpho logy  is based on the demonstrations that both rewriting rules and two-level rules denote regular relations on strings (Kaplan [9]).
  The correspondence b tween regular elations and finite-state transducers and the closure properties of regular relations provide the computat iona l  and mathematical tools that our approach depends on.
  One of the earliest results of finite-state morphology is the observation PROC.
  OF COLING-92, NANTES, AUG. 23-28, 1992 that regular relations are closed under composition (Johnson [8], Kaplan&amp;Kay [7], Kaplan [9]).
  Consequently, a single transducer can be constructed whose behavior is exactly the same as a set of transducers arranged in an ordered feeding cascade: lexical string lexical string T composite intermediate string transducer surface string surface string Figure 2 This observation was originally made about tra
