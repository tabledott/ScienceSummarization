 in a final state qf.
    .
    The result of applying the transition is to add the following to the set of configurations: [ni , n3, w, v, q', c + ci + c', g] where t' is the target dependency tree formed by adding t1 as the rightmost dependent of t. [n,n',w,v,q,ci, ti] [n,n' , w, v, q,c2,t2] and c2 &gt; cl, the second configuration is removed from the set of configurations.
    If, after all applicable transitions have been taken, there are configurations spanning the entire input lattice, then the one with the lowest cost is the optimal derivation.
    When there are no such configurations, we take a pragmatic approach in the translation application and simply concatenate the lowest costing of the minimal length sequences of partial derivations that span the entire lattice.
    A Viterbi-like search of the graph formed by configurations is used to find the optimal sequence of derivations.
    One of the advantages of middle-out transduction is that robustness is improved through such use of partial derivat
