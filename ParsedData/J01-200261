nly best when a single part is used (as in the earlier experiments).
    After that it is overtaken and quickly left behind, as it is increasingly unable to use the additional training data to its advantage.
    The three systems using only base tagger outputs have comparable accuracy growth curves, although the initial growth is much higher for WPDV.
    The curves for WPDV and Maccent appear to be leveling out towards the right end of the graph.
    For MBL, this is much less clear.
    However, it would seem that the accuracy level at 1M words is a good approximation of the eventual ceiling.
    The advantage of the use of context information becomes clear at 500K words.
    Here the tags-only systems start to level out, but WPDV(Tags+Context) keeps showing a constant growth.
    Even at 1M words, there is no indication that the accuracy is approaching a ceiling.
    The model seems to be getting increasingly accurate in correcting very specific contexts of mistagging.
    Another way in which the amount o
