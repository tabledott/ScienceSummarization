 mechanism to build a representation of the semantics of a discourse in a stepwise fashion, from left to right, on the basis of the semantic representations of the individual clauses which constitute the discourse.
    The intermediate states of the parser model the intermediate states of the social situation which generates the discourse.
    The paper attempts to demonstrate that a discourse may indeed be viewed as constructed by means of sequencing and recursive nesting of discourse constituents.
    It gives rather detailed examples of discourse structures at various levels, and shows how these structures are described in the framework proposed here.
    I DISCOURSE STRUCTURES AT DIFFERENT LEVELS If a discourse understanding system is to be able to assemble the meaning of a complex discourse fragment (such as a story or an elaborate description) out of the meanings of the utterances constituting the fragment, it needs a correct structural analysis of it.
    Such an analysis is also necessary to assign a
