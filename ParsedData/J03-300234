ple of two texts with links is illustrated in Figure 4.
    Next, we desire to compute the probability of the most probable link sequence that could have accounted for the two texts.6 The probability of a link sequence is simply the product of the probabilities p of the links it contains.
    As noted by Melamed (2000), the problem of finding the best set of links is the maximum-weighted bipartite matching (MWBM) problem: Given a weighted bipartite graph G = (V1 U V2, E) with edge weights ci,j(i E V1,j E V2), find a matching M C_ E such that each vertex has at most one edge in M and Ee&#8712;M ci,j is maximized.
    The fastest known MWBM algorithm runs in O(ve+v2 log v) time (Ahuja, Magnati, and Orlin 1993).
    Applied to this problem, that is O(max(|X|, |Y|)3), where X and Y are the text lengths in words.
    To use MWBM to find the most probable link sequence, let the L1 words be V1 and the L2 words be V2.
    If two words x, y have p(x, y) &gt; 0, an edge exists between them with weight logp(x,y).
