ntext-sensitive lemmatizer for German available (Lezius, Rapp, &amp; Wettler, 1998), this was not the case for English, so for reasons of symmetry we decided not to use the context feature.
    I In cases in which an ambiguous word can be both a content and a function word (e.g., can), preference was given to those interpretations that appeared to occur more frequently.
    For counting word co-occurrences, in most other studies a fixed window size is chosen and it is determined how often each pair of words occurs within a text window of this size.
    However, this approach does not take word order within a window into account.
    Since it has been empirically observed that word order of content words is often similar between languages (even between unrelated languages such as English and Chinese), and since this may be a useful statistical clue, we decided to modify the common approach in the way proposed by Rapp (1996, p. 162).
    Instead of computing a single co-occurrence vector for a word A, we comput
