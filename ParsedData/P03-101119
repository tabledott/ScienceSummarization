t error &#8211; an open question is whether the optimization with respect to alignment error will correspond to optimization for translation accuracy.
    Within the strict EM framework, we found roughly equivalent performance between the IBM models and the two tree-based models when making use of the cloning operation.
    For both the tree-tostring and tree-to-tree models, the cloning operation improved results, indicating that adding the flexibility to handle structural divergence is important when using syntax-based models.
    The improvement was particularly significant for the tree-to-tree model, because using syntactic trees on both sides of the translation pair, while desirable as an additional source of information, severely constrains possible alignments unless the cloning operation is allowed.
    The tree-to-tree model has better theoretical complexity than the tree-to-string model, being quadratic rather than quartic in sentence length, and we found this to be a significant advantage in practice
