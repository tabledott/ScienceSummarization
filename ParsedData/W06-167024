 biomedical domain also show performance loss with respect to smaller tagsets; e.g., Kazama et al. (2002) report an Fscore of 56.2% on a tagset of 25 Genia classes, compared to the 75.9% achieved on the simplest binary case.
    The sequence fragments from SEMv contribute about 1% F-score improvement.
    Table 5 focuses on subsets of the evaluation.
    The upper part summarizes the results on Semcor for the classes comparable to standard NER&#8217;s: &#8220;person&#8221;, &#8220;group&#8221;, &#8220;location&#8221; and &#8220;time&#8221;.
    However, these categories here are composed of common nouns as well as proper names/named entities.
    On this four tags the tagger achieves an average 82.46% F-score, not too far from NER results.
    The lower portion of Table 5 summarizes the results on the five most frequent noun and verb supersense labels on the Senseval-3 data, providing more specific evidence for the supersense tagger&#8217;s disambiguation accuracy.
    The tagger outperforms the first sense b
