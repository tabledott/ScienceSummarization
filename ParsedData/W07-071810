and rank them.
    In addition to having judges rank the translations of whole sentences, we also conducted a pilot study of a new type of evaluation methodology, which we call constituent-based evaluation.
    In our constituent-based evaluation we parsed the source language sentence, selected constituents from the tree, and had people judge the translations of those syntactic phrases.
    In order to draw judges&#8217; attention to these regions, we highlighted the selected source phrases and the corresponding phrases in the translations.
    The corresponding phrases in the translations were located via automatic word alignments.
    Figure 2 illustrates the constituent based evaluation when applied to a German source sentence.
    The German source sentence is parsed, and various phrases are selected for evaluation.
    Word alignments are created between the source sentence and the reference translation (shown), and the source sentence and each of the system translations (not shown).
    We parsed the te
