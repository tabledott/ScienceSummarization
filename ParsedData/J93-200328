ll the expected number of times that e connects to f in the translation (fle) the count off given e for (fle) and denote it by c(f le; f, e).
    By definition, where Pr(aje, f) = Pr(f, ale)/ Pr(fle).
    If we replace A, by A, Pr(fle), then Equation (11) can be written very compactly as In practice, our training data consists of a set of translations, (f (i)ie (1) ), (f (2)le (2) ) (f(s)ie(s)), so this equation becomes Here, A, serves only as a reminder that the translation probabilities must be normalized.
    Usually, it is not feasible to evaluate the expectation in Equation (12) exactly.
    Even when we exclude multi-word cepts, there are still (1 + 1)m alignments possible for (fie).
    Model 1, however, is special because by recasting Equation (6), we arrive at an expression that can be evaluated efficiently.
    The right-hand side of Equation (6) is a sum of terms each of which is a monomial in the translation probabilities.
    Each monomial contains in translation probabilities, one for each of th
