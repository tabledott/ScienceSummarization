   All methods were deemed to have converged when less than .0001 of the translational probability distribution changed from one iteration to the next.
    The links assigned by each of methods A, B, and C in the last iteration were normalized into joint probability distributions using Equation 19.
    I shall refer to these joint distributions as Model A, Model B, and Model C, respectively.
    Each of the joint probability distributions was further normalized into two conditional probability distributions, one in each direction.
    Since Model 1 is inherently directional, its conditional probability distributions were estimated separately in each direction, instead of being derived from a joint distribution.
    The four models' predictions were compared to the gold standard annotations.
    Each model guessed one translation (either stochastically or deterministically, depending on the task) for each word on one side of the gold standard bitext.
    Therefore, precision = recall here, and I shall refer to
