    Figure 1 shows that the correlation improves with the size of the corpus, as expected.
    For the results using the WordSim353 corpus, we show the results of the bag-of-words approach with context size 10.
    Results improve from 0.5 Spearman correlation up to 0.65 when increasing the corpus size three orders of magnitude, although the effect decays at the end, which indicates that we might not get further gains going beyond the current size of the corpus.
    With respect to results for the RG dataset, we used a context-window approach with context radius 4.
    Here, results improve even more with data size, probably due to the sparse data problem collecting 8-word context windows if the corpus is not large enough.
    Correlation improves linearly right to the end, where results stabilize around 0.89.
    Although the vocabulary of WordNet is very extensive, applications are bound to need the similarity between words which are not included in WordNet.
    This is exemplified in the WordSim353 d
