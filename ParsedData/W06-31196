the CFG grammar into Chomsky Normal Form and applying a CKY algorithm to produce the most likely parse for a given source sentence, we avoided the explosion of the rule set caused by the introduction of new non-terminals in the conversion process and implemented a variant of the CKY+ algorithm as described in (J.Earley, 1970).
    Each cell of the parsing process in (J.Earley, 1970) contains a set of hypergraph nodes (Huang and Chiang, 2005).
    A hypergraph node is an equivalence class of complete hypotheses (derivations) with identical production results (left-hand sides of the corresponding applied rules).
    Complete hypotheses point directly to nodes in their backwards star, and the cost of the complete hypothesis is calculated with respect to each back pointer node&#8217;s best cost.
    This structure affords efficient parsing with minimal pruning (we use a single parameter to restrict the number of hierarchical rules applied), but sacrifices effective management of unique language model states contr
