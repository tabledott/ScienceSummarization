olation is detected at V:IP node (Figure 3.b).
    The word &amp;quot;hope&amp;quot; takes a CP complement.
    It does not govern the subject of CP because there is a barrier between them.
    The subject of an infinitive CP can only be governed by complement &amp;quot;for&amp;quot; (Figure 3.c and 3.d).
    4-criterion: Every chain must receive and orionly one 0-role, where a chain consists of an NP and the traces (if any) coindexed with it (van ...liemsdijk and Williams, 1986, p.245).
    We first consider chains consisting of one element.
    The 0-criterion is implemented as the following constraints: value 0-role* examples +subj -theta yes &amp;quot;take&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;sleep&amp;quot; -subj-theta no &amp;quot;seem&amp;quot;, passive verbs *assigning 0-role to subject This attribute percolates with the item from V to IP.
    The IP node then check the value of theta and subj-theta to make sure that the verb assigns a 0-role to the subject if it requires one, and vice versa.
