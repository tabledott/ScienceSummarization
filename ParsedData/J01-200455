 and tested the SLM on a modified, more &amp;quot;speech-like&amp;quot; version of the Penn Treebank.
    Their modifications included: (i) removing orthographic cues to structure (e.g., punctuation); (ii) replacing all numbers with the single token N; and (iii) closing the vocabulary at 10,000, replacing all other words with the UNK token.
    They used Sections 00-20 (929,564 words) as the development set, Sections 21-22 (73,760 words) as the check set (for interpolation coefficient estimation), and tested on Sections 23-24 (82,430 words).
    We obtained the training and testing corpora from them (which we will denote C&amp;J corpus), and also created intermediate corpora, upon which only the first two modifications were carried out (which we will denote no punct).
    Differences in performance will give an indication of the impact on parser performance of the different modifications to the corpora.
    All trials in this section used Sections 00-20 for counts, held out 21-22, and tested on 23-24.
