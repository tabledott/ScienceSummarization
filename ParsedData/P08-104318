uency estimates for once-occurring segments.
    3An English sentence with ambiguous PoS assignment can be trivially represented as a lattice similar to our own, where every pair of consecutive nodes correspond to a word, and every possible PoS assignment for this word is a connecting arc.
    Handling Unknown tokens When handling unknown tokens in a language such as Hebrew various important aspects have to be borne in mind.
    Firstly, Hebrew unknown tokens are doubly unknown: each unknown token may correspond to several segmentation possibilities, and each segment in such sequences may be able to admit multiple PoS tags.
    Secondly, some segments in a proposed segment sequence may in fact be seen lexical events, i.e., for some p tag Prf(p &#8212;* (s, p)) &gt; 0, while other segments have never been observed as a lexical event before.
    The latter arcs correspond to OOV words in English.
    Finally, the assignments of PoS tags to OOV segments is subject to language specific constraints relative to the
