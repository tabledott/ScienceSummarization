 agreement expected on the basis of a single distribution which reflects the combined judgments of all coders, meaning that expected agreement is calculated using &#710;P(k), the overall proportion of items assigned to category k, which is the total number of such assignments by all coders nk divided by the overall number of assignments.
    The latter, in turn, is the number of items i multiplied by the number of coders c. As in the two-coder case, the probability that two arbitrary coders assign an item to a particular category k E K is assumed to be the joint probability of each coder making this assignment independently, that is (&#710;P(k))2.
    The expected agreement is the sum of this joint probability over all the categories k E K. Multi-&#960; is the coefficient that Siegel and Castellan (1988) call K. 2.5.2 Multi-&#954;.
    It is fairly straightforward to adapt Fleiss&#8217;s proposal to generalize Cohen&#8217;s &#954; proper to more than two coders, calculating expected agreement based on individ
