d &#948;(k).
    Since in practical applications values of m between 3 and 10 suffice, this can offer a substantial savings in storage requirements over variable metric methods, while still giving favorable convergence properties.1
  
  
    The performance of optimization algorithms is highly dependent on the specific properties of the problem to be solved.
    Worst-case analysis typically 'Space constraints preclude a more detailed discussion of these methods here.
    For algorithmic details and theoretical analysis of first and second order methods, see, e.g., Nocedal (1997) or Nocedal and Wright (1999). does not reflect the actual behavior on actual problems.
    Therefore, in order to evaluate the performance of the optimization techniques sketched in previous section when applied to the problem of parameter estimation, we need to compare the performance of actual implementations on realistic data sets (Dolan and Mor&#180;e, 2002).
    Minka (2001) offers a comparison of iterative scaling with other al
