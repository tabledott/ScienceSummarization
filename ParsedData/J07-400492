y cutoff for features, the &#963; parameter in the Gaussian prior term, the R values used in the supertagger, and so on.
    All of these were set experimentally using Section 00 as development data.
  
  
    The gold standard for the normal-form model consists of the normal-form derivations in CCGbank.
    For the dependency model, the gold-standard dependency structures are produced by running our CCG parser over the normal-form derivations.
    It is essential that the packed charts for each sentence contain the gold standard; for the normalform model this means that our parser must be able to produce the gold-standard derivation from the gold-standard lexical category sequence; and for the dependency model this means that at least one derivation in the chart must produce the goldstandard dependency structure.
    Not all rule instantiations in CCGbank can be produced by our parser, because some are not instances of combinatory rules, and others are very rare punctuation and type-changing rules which we h
