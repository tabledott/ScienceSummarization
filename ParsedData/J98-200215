better fit to the data.
    Table 2 shows the number of free parameters and the KL distance from the empirical distribution of the data (namely, the word-based distribution estimated by MLE) shown in Figure 2 for each of the five tree cut models.3 In the table, one can see that there is a trade-off between the simplicity of a model and the goodness of fit to the data.
    In the MDL framework, the model description length is an indicator of model complexity, while the data description length indicates goodness of fit to the data.
    The MDL principle stipulates that the model that minimizes the sum total of the description lengths should be the best model (both for data compression and statistical estimation).
    In the remainder of this section, we will describe how we apply MDL to our current problem.
    We will then discuss the rationale behind using MDL in our present context.
    We first show how the description length for a model is calculated.
    We use S to denote a sample (or set of data), which
