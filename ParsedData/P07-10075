in as predicted by the EM-based algorithm, we improve the effectiveness of the adaptation process.
    Our empirical results show that for the set of nouns which have different predominant senses between the training and target domains, we are able to reduce the annotation effort by 71%.
    2 Experimental Setting In this section, we discuss the motivations for choosing the particular corpus and the set of nouns to conduct our domain adaptation experiments.
    2.1 Choice of Corpus The DSO corpus (Ng and Lee, 1996) contains 192,800 annotated examples for 121 nouns and 70 verbs, drawn from BC and WSJ.
    While the BC is built as a balanced corpus, containing texts in various categories such as religion, politics, humanities, fiction, etc, the WSJ corpus consists primarily of business and financial news.
    Exploiting the difference in coverage between these two corpora, Escudero et al. (2000) separated the DSO corpus into 50 2.2 Choice of Nouns The WordNet Domains resource (Magnini and Cavaglia, 2000) assign
