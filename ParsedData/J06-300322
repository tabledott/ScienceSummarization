orical language with LRA and SME for handling novel metaphors.
    Lakoff and Johnson (1980) give many examples of sentences in support of their claim that metaphorical language is ubiquitous.
    The metaphors in their sample sentences can be expressed using SAT-style verbal analogies of the form A:B::C:D. The first column in Table 5 is a list of sentences from Lakoff and Johnson (1980) and the second column shows how the metaphor that is implicit in each sentence may be made explicit as a verbal analogy.
    The task of classifying semantic relations is to identify the relation between a pair of words.
    Often the pairs are restricted to noun-modifier pairs, but there are many interesting relations, such as antonymy, that do not occur in noun-modifier pairs.
    However, noun-modifier pairs are interesting due to their high frequency in English.
    For instance, WordNet 2.0 contains more than 26,000 noun-modifier pairs, although many common noun-modifiers are not in WordNet, especially technical terms.
