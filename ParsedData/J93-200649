 Thus the event becomes less specific but more likely to have been observed.
    We back off on the detail until we can estimate the probability from the training set.
    The Katz algorithm gives a way to estimate the back-off penalty as the probability that we would not have observed the more detailed triple even though it was possible.
    4.3.4 The Experiment.
    By examining the table of triples X P 0 that were learned, it was clear that meaningful information was induced from the examples.
    For instance, (&lt;attack&gt; against &lt;building&gt;) and (&lt;attack&gt; against &lt;residence&gt;) were learned, which correspond to two cases of importance in the MUC domain.
    As a consequence, useful semantic information was learned by the training algorithm.
    However, we ran a far more meaningful evaluation of what was learned by measuring how effective the learned information would be at predicting 166 prepositional phrase attachments that were not made by our partial parser.
    For example, in the
