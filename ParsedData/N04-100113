labeled as pronominal mentions &#8211; but, to do this, they need to be separated from the stem mnE.
    Pragmatically, we found segmenting Arabic text to be a necessary and beneficial process due mainly to two facts: Given these observations, we decided to &#8220;condition&#8221; the output of the system on the segmented data: the text is first segmented into tokens, and the classification is then performed on tokens.
    The segmentation model is similar to the one presented by Lee et al. (2003), and obtains an accuracy of about 98%.
    In addition, special attention is paid to prefixes and suffixes: in order to reduce the number of spurious tokens we re-merge the prefixes or suffixes to their corresponding stem if they are not essential to the classification process.
    For this purpose, we collect the following statistics for each prefix/suffix from the ACE training data: the frequency of occurring as a mention by itself ( ) and the frequency of occurring as a part of mention ( ).
    If the ratio is be
