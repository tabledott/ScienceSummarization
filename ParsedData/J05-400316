st words would have no translation equivalents; in contrast, in an alignment between parallel sentences, most words would be aligned.
    Automatically computed alignments, however, may have incorrect connections; for example, on the right side of Figure 3, the Arabic word issue is connected to the comma; and in Figure 4, the Arabic word at is connected to the English phrase its case to the.
    Such errors are due to noisy dictionary entries and to Alignments between two non-parallel sentences. shortcomings of the model used to generate the alignments.
    Thus, merely looking at the number of unconnected words, while helpful, is not discriminative enough.
    Still, automatically produced alignments have certain additional characteristics that can be exploited.
    We follow Brown et al. (1993) in defining the fertility of a word in an alignment as the number of words it is connected to.
    The presence, in an automatically computed alignment between a pair of sentences, of words of high fertility (such as
