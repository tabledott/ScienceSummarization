ved from a broad variety of sources, including newswire; therefore systems must be domain-independent.
    The inferences required are, from a human perspective, fairly superficial: no long chains of reasoning are involved.
    However, there are &#8220;trick&#8221; questions expressly designed to foil simplistic techniques.
    The definition of entailment is informal and approximate: whether a competent speaker with basic knowledge of the world would typically infer the hypothesis from the text.
    Entailments will certainly depend on linguistic knowledge, and may also depend on world knowledge; however, the scope of required world knowledge is left unspecified.4 Despite the informality of the problem definition, human judges exhibit very good agreement on the RTE task, with agreement rate of 91&#8211;96% (Dagan et al., 2005).
    In principle, then, the upper bound for machine performance is quite high.
    In practice, however, the RTE task is exceedingly difficult for computers.
