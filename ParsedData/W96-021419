S data prepared by Bod, which contained much more significant revisions.
    Ten data sets were constructed by randomly splitting minimally edited ATIS (Hemphill et al., 1990) sentences into a 700 sentence training set, and 88 sentence test set, then discarding sentences of length &gt; 30.
    For each of the ten sets, both the DOP algorithm outlined here and the grammar induction experiment of Pereira and Schabes were run.
    Crossing brackets, zero crossing brackets, and the paired differences are presented in Table 1.
    All sentences output by the parser were made binary branching (see the section covering analysis of Bod's data), since otherwise the crossing brackets measures are meaningless (Magerman, 1994).
    IA diff file between the original ATIS data and the cleaned up version, in a form usable by the &amp;quot;ed&amp;quot; program, is available by anonymous FTP from ftp://ftp.das.harvard.edu/pub/goodman/atis-ed/ ti_tb.par-ed and ti_tb.pos-ed.
    Note that the number of changes made was small.
