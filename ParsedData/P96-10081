 parsing (Magerman 1995).
    Nevertheless, most natural language systems remain primarily rule based, and even systems that do use statistical techniques, such as AT&amp;T Chronus (Levin and Pieraccini 1995), continue to require a significant rule based component.
    Development of a complete end-to-end statistical understanding system has been the focus of several ongoing research efforts, including (Miller et al. 1995) and (Koppelman et al.
    1995).
    In this paper, we present such a system.
    The overall structure of our approach is conventional, consisting of a parser, a semantic interpreter, and a discourse module.
    The implementation and integration of these elements is far less conventional.
    Within each module, every processing step is assigned a probability value, and very large numbers of alternative theories are pursued in parallel.
    The individual modules are integrated through an n-best paradigm, in which many theories are passed from one stage to the next, together with their as
