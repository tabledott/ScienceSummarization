provement is in the range of 25% to 58%, e.g. for the NIST 2003 evaluation set about 58% of the improvement using reordering can be attributed to the maximum-entropy based reordering model.
    We also measured the classification performance for the NIST task.
    The general tendencies are identical to the BTEC task.
  
  
    We have presented a novel discriminative reordering model for statistical machine translation.
    This model is trained on the word aligned bilingual corpus using the maximum entropy principle.
    Several types of features have been used: We have evaluated the performance of the reordering model on a held-out word-aligned corpus.
    We have shown that the model is able to predict the orientation very well, e.g. for Arabic-English the classification error rate is only 2.1%.
    We presented improved translation results for three language pairs on the BTEC task and for the large data track of the Chinese-English NIST task.
    In none of the cases additional features have hurt the cla
