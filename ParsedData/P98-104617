ich the subject does not actually move, but has a shape that could describe a path for the verb (e.g., The stream twists through the valley).
    These verbs are listed in the intersective classes with meander verbs of existence.
  
  
    The Portuguese verbs we examined behaved much more similarly to their English counterparts than we expected.
    Many of the verbs participate in alternations that are direct translations of the English alternations.
    However, there are some interesting differences in which sense extensions are allowed.
    We have made a preliminary study of the Portuguese translation of the carry verb class.
    As in English, these verbs seem to take different alternations, and the ability of each to participate in an alternation is related to its semantic content.
    Table 1 shows how these Portuguese verbs naturally cluster into two different subclasses, based on their ability to take the conative and apart alternations as well as path prepositions.
    These subclasses correspond
