de long sentences, inserts discourse boundaries after each comma.
    The second baseline ( ) uses syntactic information; because long sentences often have embedded sentences, inserts discourse boundaries after each text span whose corresponding syntactic subtree is labeled S, SBAR, or STNV.
    We also compute the agreement between human annotators on the discourse segmentation task ( ), using the doubly-annotated discourse corpus mentioned in Section 2. described in this paper ( ) using syntactic trees produced by Charniak&#8217;s parser (2000), in comparison with the results obtained by the algorithm described in (Marcu, 2000) ( ), and baseline algorithms and , on the same test set.
    Crucial to the performance of the discourse segmenter is the recall figure, because we want to find as many discourse boundaries as possible.
    The baseline algorithms are too simplistic to yield good results (recall figures of 28.2% and 25.4%).
    The algorithm presented in this paper gives an error reduction in missed
