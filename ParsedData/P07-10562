which developers annotate corpora for a small number of domains, train classifiers on those corpora, and then apply them to other similar corpora.
    However, this approach raises two important questions.
    First, it is well known that trained classifiers lose accuracy when the test data distribution is significantly different from the training data distribution 1.
    Second, it is not clear which notion of domain similarity should be used to select domains to annotate that would be good proxies for many other domains.
    We propose solutions to these two questions and evaluate them on a corpus of reviews for four different types of products from Amazon: books, DVDs, electronics, and kitchen appliances2.
    First, we show how to extend the recently proposed structural correspondence learning (SCL) domain adaptation algorithm (Blitzer et al., 2006) for use in sentiment classification.
    A key step in SCL is the selection of pivot features that are used to link the source and target domains.
    We sugg
