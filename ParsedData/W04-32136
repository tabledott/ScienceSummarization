frames along with the semantic role assigned to each slot of a frame.
    Throughout the paper we use the term &#8220;frame&#8221; to refer to a syntactic frame&#8212;the set of syntactic arguments of a verb&#8212;possibly labelled with roles, as exemplified in the VerbNet entry in Table 1.
    While FrameNet uses semantic roles specific to a particular situation (such as Speaker, Message, [admire, adore, appreciate, cherish, enjoy, ...] Addressee), and PropBank uses roles specific to a verb (such as Arg0, Arg1, Arg2), VerbNet uses an intermediate level of thematic roles (such as Agent, Theme, Recipient).
    These general thematic roles are commonly assumed in linguistic theory, and have some advantages in terms of capturing commonalities of argument relations across a wide range of predicates.
    It is worth noting that although there are fewer of these thematic roles than the more situation-specific roles of FrameNet, the role labelling task is not necessarily easier: there may be more data per role, but
