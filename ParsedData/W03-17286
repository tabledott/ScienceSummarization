e of suffixes, MM tags stems with affixes and LR tags stems without affixes.
    Representing the distributions of hanzi with LMR tags also makes it easy to use machine learning algorithms which has been successfully applied to other tagging problems, such as POS-tagging and IOB tagging used in text chunking.
    In this paper we present Chinese word segmentation algorithms based on the socalled LMR tagging.
    Our LMR taggers are implemented with the Maximum Entropy Markov Model and we then use Transformation-Based Learning to combine the results of the two LMR taggers that scan the input in opposite directions.
    Our system achieves F-scores of and on the Academia Sinica corpus and the Hong Kong City University corpus respectively.
  
  
    Our algorithm consists of two parts.
    We first implement two Maximum Entropy taggers, one of which scans the input from left to right and the other scans the input from right to left.
    Then we implement a Transformation Based Algorithm to combine the results of
