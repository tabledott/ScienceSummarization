			In order to describe the algorithm, we will need to first describe the direct link model.
			Figure 1 shows two sequences where the top sequence is considered the source sequence and the bottom sequence the target sequence.
			Each sequence can have auxilliary information such as Arabic segmentation or English WordNet (Miller, 1990) information as shown.
			Given the source and target sequences, there are a number of different ways to link each target word to a sourceword.
			Each target word has a link li which indi cates which source position it links to.
			The range of li is from 0 to K and there are M of these links.
			The source word position 0 is used to indicate NULL which we imagine gives rise to unaligned Englishwords.
			In this paper, we refer to these words as be ing spontaneous.
