l hierarchical phrase-based translation rules for that sentence in the training corpus.
			976 We first review suffix arrays (?2) and hierarchicalphrase-based translation (?3).
			We show that the obvious approach using state-of-the-art pattern match ing algorithms is hopelessly inefficient (?4).
			We then describe a series of algorithms to address thisinefficiency (?5).
			Our algorithms reduce computa tion time by two orders of magnitude, making the approach feasible (?6).
			We close with a discussion that describes several applications of our work (?7).
	
	
			A suffix array is a data structure representing all suf fixes of a corpus in lexicographical order (Manber and Myers, 1993).
			Formally, for a text T , the ith suffix of T is the substring of the text beginning atposition i and continuing to the end of T . This suf fix can be uniquely identified by the index i of itsfirst word.
			The suffix array SAT of T is a permuta tion of [1, |T |] arranged by the lexicographical order of the corresponding su
