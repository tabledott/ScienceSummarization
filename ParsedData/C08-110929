			We used an ME approach augmented with combination features and a series of thresholds.
			This system is currently incorporated in the Criterion writing evaluationservice.
			Second, we showed that the standard ap proach to evaluating NLP error detection systems (comparing a system?s output with a gold-standard annotation) can greatly skew system results when the annotation is done by only one rater.
			However, one reason why a single rater is commonly used is that building a corpus of learner errors can be extremely costly and time consuming.
			To address this efficiency issue, we presented a samplin
