simple word-overlapbased filter (Section 2.2), thus obtaining candidate sentence pairs.
    The candidates are presented to a maximum entropy (ME) classifier (Section 2.3) that decides whether the sentences in each pair are mutual translations of each other.
    The resources required by the system are minimal: a bilingual dictionary and a small amount of parallel data (used for training the ME classifier).
    The dictionaries used in our experiments are learned automatically from (out-of-domain) parallel corpora;2 thus, the only resource used by our system consists of parallel sentences.
    2 If such a resource is unavailable, other dictionaries can be used.
    Our comparable corpus consists of two large, non-parallel, news corpora, one in English and the other in the foreign language of interest (in our case, Chinese or Arabic).
    The parallel sentence extraction process begins by selecting, for each foreign article, English articles that are likely to contain sentences that are parallel to those in th
