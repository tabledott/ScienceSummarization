    The descriptive architecture of LFG as extended by Kaplan and Halvorsen provides for multiple levels of structure to be related by separate correspondences, and these correspondences allow descriptions of the various structures to be constructed, either by analysis or composition, from the properties of other structures.
    Earlier researchers have applied these mechanisms to the linguistic structures for sentences in a single language.
    In this paper, we extend this system one step further: we introduce correspondences between structures for sentences in different languages that stand in a translation relation to one another.
    The description of the target language structures are derived via analysis and codescription from the source language structures, by virtue of additional annotations in c-structure rules and lexical entries.
    Those descriptions are solved to find satisfying solutions, and these solutions are then the input to the target generation process.
    In the two language arra
