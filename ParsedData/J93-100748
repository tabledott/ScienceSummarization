amp;quot;noun&#8212; adjective,&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;noun&#8212;noun.&amp;quot; To simplify, we abbreviate them respectively: VO, SV, NJ, NN.
    For sentence (10) below, for example, the labels produced are shown in Figure 9.
    10.
    &amp;quot;Wall Street faced a major test with stock traders returning to action for the first time since last week's epic selloff and investors awaited signs of life from the 5-year-old bull market.&amp;quot; Input: A set of sentences each associated with a set of labels as shown in Figure 9.
    Output: Collocations with associated syntactic labels as shown in Figure 10.
    Discussion: For any given sentence containing both w and w,, two cases are possible: either there is a label for the bigram (w, w,), or there is none.
    For example, for sentence (10), there is a syntactic label for the bigram faced-test, but there is none for the bigram stock-returning.
    Faced-test enters into a verb object relation, and stock-returning does not enter into any type of relation.
