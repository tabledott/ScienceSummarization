			Our experiments have shown that the parser is very fast.
			Table 1 lists the parsing time and the number of parses for several ex- ample sentences.
			The correct parses for all the sentences in TM)le 1 are returned by the parser.
			Even though the lexicon is derived from ma- chine readable dictionaries and contains a \]a.rge number of senses for many words, the ratio be- tween the number of parse trees and the sen- tence length here is well bellow the ratio re- ported in (Black et al, 1992).
