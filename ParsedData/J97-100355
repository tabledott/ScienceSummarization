s the need to take into account the length of both sides of the valley, since a valley that has high peaks on both sides indicates that not only has the vocabulary on the left decreased in score, but the vocabulary on the right has increasing score, thus signaling a strong subtopic change.
    Figure 4(c) shows another potentially problematic case, in which two strong peaks flank a long, flat valley.
    The question becomes which of gaps c2, c3, or both, should be assigned a boundary.
    Such &amp;quot;plateaus&amp;quot; occur when vocabulary changes very gradually and reflect a poor fit of the corresponding portion of the document to the model A sketch illustrating the computation of depth scores in three different situations.
    The x-axis indicates token sequence gap number and the y-axis indicates lexical score. assumed by TextTiling.
    When the plateau occurs over a longer stretch, usually it is reasonable to choose both bordering gaps as boundaries.
    However, when such a plateau occurs over a ve
