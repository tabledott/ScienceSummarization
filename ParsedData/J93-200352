h string.
    Obviously, T[i]k should be placed in one of these vacancies.
    Models 3 and 4 are deficient precisely because we fail to enforce this constraint for the one-word cepts.
    Let v(j, 41-1, T[]l&amp;quot;) be the number of vacancies up to and including position j just before we place Ttipc.
    In the interest of notational brevity, a noble but elusive goal, we write this simply as v1.
    We retain two sets of distortion parameters, as in Model 4, and continue to refer to them as d1 and d&gt;1.
    We assume that, for [ii &gt; 0, = 7-(!,, 0(1), e) = (vilB(.6), voi_i, vin - + 1)(1 - 6(v1, vj-i))&#8226; (48) The number of vacancies up to j is the same as the number of vacancies up to j - 1 only when j is not itself vacant.
    The last factor, therefore, is 1 when j is vacant and 0 otherwise.
    In the final parameter of d1, um is the number of vacancies remaining in the French string.
    If ON = 1, then rto may be placed in any of these vacancies; if Oki = 2, 7-Ni may be placed in any but the
