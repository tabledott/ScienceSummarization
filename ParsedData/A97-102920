 harmonic mean of precision and recall: (/32 +1)RP where if represents the relative weight of recall to precision (and typically has the value 1).
    To our knowledge, our learned name-finding system has achieved a higher F-measure than any other learned system when compared to state-of-the-art manual (rule-based) systems on similar data.
    Our test set of English data for reporting results is that of the MUC-6 test set, a collection of 30 WSJ documents (we used a different test set during development).
    Our Spanish test set is that used for MET, comprised of articles from the news agency AFP.
    Table 4.1 illustrates Nymble's performance as compared to the best reported scores for each category.

    With any learning technique one of the important questions is how much training data is required to get acceptable performance.
    More generally how does performance vary as the training set size is increased or decreased?
    We ran a sequence of experiments in English and in Spanish to
