    A fundamental flaw with all sentence compression systems is that model parameters are set with the assumption that there is a single correct answer for each sentence.
    Of course, like most compression and translation tasks, this is not true, consider, TapeWare , which supports DOS and NetWare 286 , is a value-added process that lets you directly connect the QA150-EXAT to a file server and issue a command from any workstation to back up the server The human annotated compression is, TapeWare supports DOS and NetWare 286.
    However, another completely valid compression might be, TapeWare lets you connect the QA150-EXAT to a fi le server.
    These two compressions overlap by a single word.
    Our learning algorithm may unnecessarily lower the score of some perfectly valid compressions just because they were not the exact compression chosen by the human annotator.
    A possible direction of research is to investigate multilabel learning techniques for structured data (McDonald et al., 2005a) that
