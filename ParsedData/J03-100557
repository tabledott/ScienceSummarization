ch errors and mWER on the TEST-331 test set (no cardinality pruning carried out: t, = &#8734;).
    A cardinality histogram pruning of 200,000 is applied to restrict the maximum overall size of the search space.
    The negative logarithm of tc is reported. leads to a higher word error rate, since the optimal path through the translation lattice is missed, resulting in translation errors.
    Two automatically generated reference probabilities are used.
    These probabilities are computed separately for the reordering constraints GE and S3 (the difference is not shown in the notation, but will be clear from the context): Qref: A forced alignment is carried out between each of the test sentences and its corresponding reference translation; only a single reference translation for each test sentence is used.
    The probability obtained for the reference translation is denoted by Qref.
    QF&#8727;: A translation is carried out with conservatively large pruning thresholds, yielding a translation close to the o
