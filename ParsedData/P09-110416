M(a*) consists only of alignments which have all the sure alignments in a*, but may have some subset of the possible alignments in a*.
    See Figure 3 for a specific example where m* = 1.
    Our modified likelihood objective is given by, Note that this objective is no longer convex, as it involves a logarithm of a summation, however we still utilize gradient-based optimization.
    Summing and obtaining feature expectations over M(a*) can be done efficiently using a constrained variant of the inside-outside algorithm where sure alignments not present in a* are disallowed, and the number of missing sure alignments is appended to the state of the bitext cell.6 One advantage of the likelihood-based objective is that we can obtain posteriors over individual alignment cells, We obtain posterior ITG alignments by including all alignment cells (i, j) such that PIV((i, j)|x) exceeds a fixed threshold t. Posterior thresholding allows us to easily trade-off precision and recall in our alignments by raising or lowerin
