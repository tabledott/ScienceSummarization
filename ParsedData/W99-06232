ach parse hybridization.
    The substructures that are unanimously hypothesized by the parsers should be preserved after combination, and the combination technique should not foolishly create substructures for which there is no supporting evidence.
    These two principles guide experimentation in this framework, and together with the evaluation measures help us decide which specific type of substructure to combine.
    The precision and recall measures (described in more detail in Section 3) used in evaluating Treebank parsing treat each constituent as a separate entity, a minimal unit of correctness.
    Since our goal is to perform well under these measures we will similarly treat constituents as the minimal substructures for combination.
    One hybridization strategy is to let the parsers vote on constituents' membership in the hypothesized set.
    If enough parsers suggest that a particular constituent belongs in the parse, we include it.
    We call this technique constituent voting.
    We include a
