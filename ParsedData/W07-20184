ludes roughly 780 frames with roughly 10,000 word senses (lexical units).
			It also contains roughly 150,000 annotation sets, of which 139,000are lexicographic examples, with each sentence an notated for a single predicator.
			The remainder are from full-text annotation in which each sentence isannotated for all predicators; 1,700 sentences are annotated in the full-text portion of the database, ac counting for roughly 11,700 annotation sets, or 6.8 predicators (=annotation sets) per sentence.
			Nearly all of the frames are connected into a single graph by frame-to-frame relations, almost all of which have associated FE-to-FE relations (Fillmore et al, 2004a) 2.1 Frame Semantics of texts.
			The ultimate goal is to represent the lexical se mantics of all the sentences in a text, based onthe relations between predicators and their depen dents, including both phrases and clauses, which may, in turn, include other predicators; although this has been a long-standing goal of FN (Fillmore and Baker, 2001), autom
