he benefit of this assumption is clear: We only have to translate (say, 300) sentences.
    We will now provide empirical evidence that we can make this assumption. true BLEU on 100 broad samples of 300 sentences: Assuming the 30,000 sentence BLEU as true score, three mistakes (3%) are made: on test set no.
    10, 81, and 88 fidence intervals computed for 100 test sets of 300 sentences.
    For each of the 100 test sets, we compute the confidence interval as described before: We repeatedly (1000 times) generate BLEU scores on test sets of 300 sentences drawn from this one test set of 300 sentences.
    We use the 1000 BLEU scores to estimate the confidence interval.
    We drop the top 25 and bottom 25 BLEU scores, so that the displayed interval ranges from the 26th best BLEU score to the 975th best.
    For the first test set, we obtain a confidence interval of [26.5,30.7], for the second test set a confidence interval of [27.5,33.0], and so on.
    We do not know the true BLEU score for this system, which
