    A node value corresponding to such a row or a column cannot participate in any solution, so it can be abandoned without further checking.
    The filtering algorithm identifies such inconsistent values and removes them from the domains.
    Removing a value from one domain may make another value in another domain inconsistent, so the process is propagated over the network until the network becomes arc consistent.
    Filtering does not generate solutions, but may significantly reduce the search space.
    In our example, the constraint network shown in Figure 5 is already arc consistent, so nothing can be done by filtering at this point.
  
  
    To illustrate how we can add new constraints to narrow down the ambiguity, let us introduce additional constraints (G2b-1) and (G2b-2), assuming that appropriate syntactic and/or semantic features are attached to each word and that the function NO is provided to access these features.
    Note that these constraints are not purely syntactic.
    Any kind of
