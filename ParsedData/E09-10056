hat makes any graph fulfill the property of being aperiodic and irreducible, and thus guarantees that PageRank calculation converges to a unique stationary distribution.
    In the traditional PageRank formulation the vector v is a stochastic normalized vector whose element values are all 1N, thus assigning equal probabilities to all nodes in the graph in case of random jumps.
    However, as pointed out by (Haveliwala, 2002), the vector v can be non-uniform and assign stronger probabilities to certain kinds of nodes, effectively biasing the resulting PageRank vector to prefer these nodes.
    For example, if we concentrate all the probability mass on a unique node i, all random jumps on the walk will return to i and thus its rank will be high; moreover, the high rank of i will make all the nodes in its vicinity also receive a high rank.
    Thus, the importance of node i given by the initial distribution of v spreads along the graph on successive iterations of the algorithm.
