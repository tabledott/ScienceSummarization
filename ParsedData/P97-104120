uot; In contrast to the low initial Thai score, the greedy algorithm gave an initial English segmentation score of F=73.2.
    Our rule-based algorithm learned a sequence of 800 transformations, 'The average length of a word in our English data was 4.46 characters, compared to 5.01 for Thai and 1.60 for Chinese.
    10Note that the portion of the WSJ corpus used to compile the word list was independent of both the training and test sets used in the segmentation experiments. which improved the score from 73.2 to 79.0, a 21.6% error reduction.
    The difference in the greedy scores for English and Thai demonstrates the dependence on the word list in the greedy algorithm.
    For example, an experiment in which we randomly removed half of the words from the English list reduced the performance of the greedy algorithm from 73.2 to 32.3; although this reduced English word list was nearly twice the size of the Thai word list (17136 vs. 9939), the longest match segmentation utilizing the list was much lower (32.3 v
