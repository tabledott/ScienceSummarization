    Crossing constraints are implicit in many phrasal matching approaches, both constituency-oriented (Kaji, Kida, and Morimoto 1992; Cranias, Papageorgiou, and Peperidis 1994; Grishman 1994) and dependency-oriented (Sadler and Vendelmans 1990; Matsumoto, Ishimoto, and Utsuro 1993).
    The theoretical cross-linguistic hypothesis here is that the core arguments of frames tend to stay together over different languages.
    The constraint is also useful for computational reasons, since it helps avoid exponential bilingual matching times.
    ITGs inherently implement a crossing constraint; in fact, the version enforced by ITGs is even stronger.
    This is because even within a single constituent, immediate subtrees are only permitted to cross in exact inverted order.
    As we shall argue below, this restriction reduces matching flexibility in a desirable fashion.
    Rank Constraints.
    The second expressiveness desideratum for a matching formalism is to somehow limit the rank of constituents (the number o
