2;1) and Ax1 which are updated independently of any links.
    Based on this alone and regardless of whether a link is created from put to on, Aput 2 will be updated by the word on, which is indeed the second argument of the verb put.
    The update of Axi by a is given by operations The update of Axi by a begins by incrementing the count: #(Axi ) += 1 If a is a boundary symbol (0l or 0r) or if x and a are words separated by stopping punctuation (full stop, question mark, exclamation mark, semicolon, comma or dash): (In practice, only l = [a] and the 10 strongest labels in A&#945;Sign(&#8722;i) are updated.
    Because of the exponential decay in the strength of labels in A&#945; Sign(&#8722;i), this is a good approximation.)
    If i = &#8722;1,1 and a is not a boundary or blocked by punctuation, simple bootstrapping takes place by updating the following properties: To understand the way the labels and properties are calculated, it is best to look at an example.
    The following table gives the linking prop
