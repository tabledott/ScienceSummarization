ion of pronominal reference: the use of a pronoun to realize the Cb signals the hearer that the speaker is continuing to talk about the same thing.
    Note that Rule 1 does not preclude using pronouns for other entities so long as the Cb is realized with a pronoun.
    (This is illustrated in examples 7-10 in Section 5.)
    Psychological research (Gordon, Grosz, and Gilliom 1993; Hudson-D'Zmura 1988) and cross-linguistic research (Di Eugenio 1990; Kameyama 1985, 1986, 1988; Walker, Iida, and Cote 1990, 1994) have validated that the Cb is preferentially realized by a pronoun in English and by equivalent forms (i.e., zero pronouns) in other languages.
    The basic constraint on center movement is given by Rule 2.
    Sequences of continuation are preferred over sequences of retaining; and sequences of retaining are to be preferred over sequences of shifting.
    In particular, a pair continuations across Un and across Un+1, represented as Cont(Un,Un+i) and Cont(Un+1,Un+2) respectively, is preferred over a pa
