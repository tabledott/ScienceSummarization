 avail in the frequent situation when the different senses of the word show the same syntactic behavior, having the same part of speech and even the same subcategorization frame.
    Substantial application of semantic or pragmatic knowledge about the word and its context requires compiling huge amounts of knowledge, the usefulness of which for practical applications in broad domains has not yet been proven (e.g., Lenat et al. 1990; Nirenburg et al.
    1988; Chodorow, Byrd, and Heidron 1985).
    Moreover, such methods usually do not reflect word usages.
    Statistical approaches, which were popular several decades ago, have recently reawakened and were found to be useful for computational linguistics.
    Within this framework, a possible (though partial) alternative to using manually constructed knowledge can be found in the use of statistical data on the occurrence of lexical relations in large corpora (e.g., Grishman, Hirschman, and Nhan 1986).
    The use of such relations (mainly relations between ver
