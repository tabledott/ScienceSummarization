he weight or cost of the transition.
    A transition in which a = 0 and f3 = 0 is called a head transition.
    The interpretation of q, q', w, and v in transitions is similar to left-to-right transducers, i.e., in transitioning from state q to state q', the transducer &amp;quot;reads&amp;quot; input symbol w and &amp;quot;writes&amp;quot; output symbol v, and as usual if w (or v) is &#8364; then no read (respectively write) takes place for the transition.
    The difference lies in the interpretation of the read position a and the write position 0.
    To interpret the transition positions as transducer actions, we consider notional input and output tapes divided into squares.
    On such a tape, one square is numbered 0, and the other squares are numbered 1, 2, ... rightwards from square 0, and &#8212;1, &#8212;2, leftwards from square 0 (Figure 1).
    A transition with input position a and output position 0 is interpreted as reading w from square a on the input tape and writing v to square 0 of the outpu
