: union.
    Given an input string w, a transducer union of T1 and T2 gives the set union of the strings obtained by application of Ti to w and 12 to w. We denote by Tl + T2 the union of TI and T2.
    The following theorem specifies the type of the transducer TI +7-2, implying in particular the closure under union of p-subsequential transducers.
    It can be proved in a way similar to the composition theorem.
    Theorem 2 Let f: E* &#8212;&gt; A* be a sequential (resp. p-subsequential) and g: E* --&gt; A* be a sequential (resp. q-subsequential) function, then g + f is 2-subsequential (resp.
    (p + q)subsequential).
    2-subsequential transducer 73, obtained by composition of 71 and 12.
    The union transducer Ti + T2 can be constructed from Ti and 7-2 in a way close to the union of automata.
    One can indeed introduce a new initial state connected to the old initial states of Ti and T2 by transitions labeled with the empty string both on input and output.
    But the transducer obtained using this co
