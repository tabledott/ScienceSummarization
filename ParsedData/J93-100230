equirement places a greater load on the grammar writer and is inconsistent with most recent unification-based grammar formalisms, which represent grammatical categories entirely as feature bundles (e.g.
    Gazdar et al. 1985; Pollard and Sag 1987; Zeevat, Calder, and Klein 1987).
    In addition, it violates the principle that grammatical formalisms should be declarative and defined independently of parsing procedure, since different definitions of the CF portion of the grammar will, at least, effect the efficiency of the resulting parser and might, in principle, lead to nontermination on certain inputs in a manner similar to that described by Shieber (1985).
    In what follows, we will assume that the unification-based grammars we are considering are represented in the ANLT object grammar formalism (Briscoe et al. 1987).
    This formalism is a notational variant of Definite Clause Grammar (e.g.
    Pereira and Warren 1980), in which rules consist of a mother category and one or more daughter categories, d
