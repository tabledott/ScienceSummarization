entical or indistinguishable by the language and translation models.
    These are recombined by the function Recombine.
    We expand the search space such that only hypotheses with the same number of target language words are recombined.
    In the pruning step, we use two different types of pruning.
    First, we perform pruning relative to the score Q&#710; of the current best hypothesis.
    We ignore all hypotheses that have a probability lower than log(tp)+&#710;Q, where tp is an adjustable pruning parameter.
    This type of pruning can be performed when the hypothesis extensions are computed.
    Second, in histogram pruning (Steinbiss, Tran, and Ney 1994), we maintain only the best Np hypotheses.
    The two pruning parameters tp and Np have to be optimized with respect to the trade-off between efficiency and quality.
    In this section, we describe various issues involved in performing an efficient implementation of a search algorithm for the alignment template approach.
