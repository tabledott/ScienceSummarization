in computational linguistics and in artificial intelligence have called these expressions anaphors (cf., Woods 1978, Sidner 1983, Bobrow 1977, Hirst 1981, Webber 1983).
    Linguists, however, have used this term somewhat differently.
    Many have restricted its use to expressions (usually pronouns) that can be treated analogously to variables in a logical language (Chomsky 1980).
    A view in linguistics that comes somewhat closer to the Al model can be found in a paper by Sag and Hankamer (1984), who distinguish what they call deep (or modelinterpretive) anaphora from what they call surface anaphora (or ellipsis).
    Under the former, they include personal pronouns, sentential &amp;quot;it,&amp;quot; and null-complement anaphora, and under the latter, verb phrase (VP) ellipsis, sluicing, gapping, and stripping.
    The two types are distinguished by whether they make reference to the interpretation of an antecedent&#8212;i.e., some object in a model of the world constructed by the interpreter of the sent
