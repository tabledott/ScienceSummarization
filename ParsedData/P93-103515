 used in all of these experiments, as well in the experiments of (PS92, SR093).)
    When parsing free text, we cannot assume that the text will be tagged with the accuracy of a human annotator.
    Instead, an automatic tagger would have to be used to first tag the text before parsing.
    To address this issue, we ran one experiment where we randomly induced a 5% tagging error rate beyond the error rate of the human annotator.
    Errors were induced in such a way as to preserve the unigram part of speech tag probability distribution in the corpus.
    The experiment was run for sentences of length 2-15, with a training set of 1000 sentences and a test set of 500 sentences.
    The resulting bracketing accuracy was 90.1%, compared to 91.6% accuracy when using an unadulterated training corpus.
    Accuracy only degraded by a small amount when training on the corpus with adulterated part of speech tags, suggesting that high parsing accuracy rates could be achieved if tagging of the input were done automatical
