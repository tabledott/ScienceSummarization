he algorithm finds the 10 most prominent topic boundaries, i.e. the automatic termination procedure is inactive.
    Test results (table 3) show ranking is crucial to C99.
    There is a 10% difference between row 3 and 6 for T. This confirms the cosine metric is inaccurate for short text segments but the order between values, or rank, is significant.
    Future experiments will establish the relationship between segment size and accuracy.
    Stemming is generally believed to improve segmentation accuracy.
    This is confirmed by the experiment results.
    However, we discovered that the process can introduce errors when segmenting short segments.
    There is a 0.7% difference between row 1 and 3 for T3,5.
    Finally, the termination strategy in C99 is not effective for short topic segments.
    There is a 6.3% improvement between row 1 and 2 for T3,5.
    However, its performance for larger segments is exceptional (0.6% difference between row 1 and 2 for T).
    The aim is to establish the relationship
