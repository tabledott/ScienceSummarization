ng 3, t is set for highest f-score.
  
  
    We have presented a reparsing scheme that produces results with accuracy higher than the best individual parsers available by combining their results.
    We have shown that in the case of dependencies, the reparsing approach successfully addresses the issue of constructing high-accuracy well-formed structures from the output of several parsers.
    In constituent reparsing, held-out data can be used for setting a parameter that allows for balancing precision and recall, or increasing f-score.
    By combining several parsers with f-scores ranging from 91.0% to 86.7%, we obtain reparsed results with a 92.1% f-score.
