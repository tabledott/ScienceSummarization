by the degrees of freedom dftotal = ic &#8722; 1.
    This can be expressed as the sum of the squares of the differences between all of the judgments pairs without regard to items, again scaled by the appropriate factor.
    The notation x&#175; is the overall mean of all the judgments in the data.
    Now that we have removed references to means from our formulas, we can abstract over the measure of variance.
    We define a distance function d which takes two numbers and returns the square of their difference.
    We also simplify the computation by counting all the identical value assignments together.
    Each unique value used by the coders will be considered a category k &#8712; K. We use nik for the number of times item i is given the value k, that is, the number of coders that make such a judgment.
    For every (ordered) pair of distinct values ka, kb &#8712; K there are nikanikb pairs of judgments of item i, whereas for non-distinct values there are nika(nika &#8722; 1) pairs.
    We use this notati
