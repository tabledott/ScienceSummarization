nd Croft, 1998; Masuichi et al., 2000; Sadat et al., 2003)), but transliteration in the context of comparable corpora has not been well addressed.
    The general idea of exploiting frequency correlations to acquire word translations from comparable corpora has been explored in several previous studies (e.g., (Fung, 1995; Rapp, 1995; Tanaka and Iwasaki, 1996)).Recently, a method based on Pearson correlation was proposed to mine word pairs from comparable corpora (Tao and Zhai, 2005), an idea similar to the method used in (Kay and Roscheisen, 1993) for sentence alignment.
    In our work, we adopt the method proposed in (Tao and Zhai, 2005) and apply it to the problem of transliteration.
    We also study several variations of the similarity measures.
    Mining transliterations from multilingual web pages was studied in (Zhang and Vines, 2004); Our work differs from this work in that we use comparable corpora (in particular, news data) and leverage the time correlation information naturally available in compa
