			Clustering is done using k-means and the number of clusters was automatically discoveredusing the Adapted Gap Statistic.
			No parameter tun ing is performed.
			upv si: A self-term expansion method based onco-ocurrence, where the terms of the corpus are ex panded by its best co-ocurrence terms in the samecorpus.
			The clustering is done using one implemen tation of the KStar method where the stop criterionhas been modified.
			The trial data was used for de termining the corpus structure.
			No further tuning is performed.UOY: A graph based system which creates a co occurrence hypergraph model.
			The hypergraph isfiltered and weighted according to some associa tion rules.
			The clustering is performed by selecting the nodes o
