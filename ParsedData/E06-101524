igh learning complexity forced the authors to train different SVMs on different slices of training data.
    Our FTK, adapted for the LTAG tree kernel, would have allowed SVMs to be trained on the whole data.
    In (Cumby and Roth, 2003), a feature description language was used to extract structural features from the syntactic shallow parse trees associated with named entities.
    The experiments on the named entity categorization showed that when the description language selects an adequate set of tree fragments the Voted Perceptron algorithm increases its classification accuracy.
    The explanation was that the complete tree fragment set contains many irrelevant features and may cause overfitting.
  
  
    In this paper, we have shown that tree kernels can effectively be adopted in practical natural language applications.
    The main arguments against their use are their efficiency and accuracy lower than traditional feature based approaches.
    We have shown that a fast algorithm (FTK) can evaluate t
