 the initial phrase length limit used in training (as it does in our experiments), but in practice it can be adjusted separately to maximize accuracy or speed.
    We often want to find not only the best derivation for a French sentence but a list of the k-best derivations.
    These are used for minimum-error-rate training and for rescoring with a language model (Section 5.3.1).
    We describe here how to do this using the lazy algorithm of Huang and Chiang (2005).
    Part of this method will also be reused in our algorithm for fast parsing with a language model (Section 5.3.4).
    If we conceive of lists as functions from indices to values, we may create a virtual list, a function that computes member values on demand instead of storing all the values statically.
    The heart of the k-best algorithm is a function MERGEPRODUCTS, which takes a set G of tuples of (virtual) lists with an operator &#8855; and returns a virtual list: Example illustrating MERGEPRODUCTS, where L1 = {1, 2,6, 10} and L2 = {1, 4,
