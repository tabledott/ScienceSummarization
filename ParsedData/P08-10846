antic role labeling (Yarowsky et al., 2000; Diab and Resnik, 2002; Xi and Hwa, 2005; Pad&#180;o and Lapata, 2006).
    Most of this research assumes that one language has annotations for the task of interest.
    Given a parallel corpus, the annotations are projected from this source language to its counterpart, and the resulting annotations are used for supervised training in the target language.
    In fact, Rogati et al., (2003) employ this method to learn arabic morphology assuming annotations provided by an English stemmer.
    An alternative approach has been proposed by Feldman, Hana and Brew (2004; 2006).
    While their approach does not require a parallel corpus it does assume the availability of annotations in one language.
    Rather than being fully projected, the source annotations provide co-occurrence statistics used by a model in the resource-poor target language.
    The key assumption here is that certain distributional properties are invariant across languages from the same language famili
