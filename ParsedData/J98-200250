nouni but had different noun2, and their PP-attachment sites go both ways in the same data, i.e., both to verb and to nouni.
    Clearly, for these examples, the PP-attachment site cannot be reliably determined without knowing noun2.
    Table 15 shows some of these examples.
    (We adopted the attachment sites given in the Penn Tree Bank, without correcting apparently wrong judgements.)
    MDL and TEL.
    We chose TEL as an example of the quadruple approach.
    This method was designed specifically for the purpose of resolving PP-attachment ambiguities, and seems to perform slightly better than ours.
    As we remarked earlier, however, the input data required by our method (triples) could be generated automatically from unparsed corpora making use of existing heuristic rules (Brent 1993; Smadja 1993), although for the experiments we report here we used a parsed corpus.
    Thus it would seem to be easier to obtain more data in the future for MDL and other methods based on unsupervised learning.
