iness to move to the next stage of the plan.
    In other cases, where participants perceive obstacles to their goals being achieved, they resort to interruptions and we have tried to make explicit the rules by which they do this.
    In addition our methodology is different from other studies because we have attempted to provide an explanation for whole dialogues rather than fragments of dialogues, and used explicit criteria in a bottom-up manner to identify discourse structures.
    The number of dialogues was small and taken from a single problem domain.
    It seems likely therefore that some of our findings (e.g the central shift) will be specific to the diagnostic dialogues we studied.
    Further research applying the same techniques to a broader set of data should establish the generality of the control rules suggested here.
