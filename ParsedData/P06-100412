et al., 2001).
    Of particular concern are words that may not be common in general English discourse but that occur throughout the text for a particular lecture or subject.
    For example, in a lecture about support vector machines, the occurrence of the term &#8220;SVM&#8221; is not going to convey a lot of information about the distribution of sub-topics, even though it is a fairly rare term in general English and bears much semantic content.
    The same words can convey varying degrees of information across different lectures, and term weighting specific to individual lectures becomes important in the similarity computation.
    In order to address this issue, we introduce a variation on the tf-idf scoring scheme used in the information-retrieval literature (Salton and Buckley, 1988).
    A transcript is split uniformly into N chunks; each chunk serves as the equivalent of documents in the tf-idf computation.
    The weights are computed separately for each transcript, since topic and word distribution
