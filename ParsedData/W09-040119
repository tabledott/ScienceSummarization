ked combinations, and by indicating whether they have a statistically significant difference with the best individual systems.
    In general, system combinations performed as well as the best individual systems, but not statistically significantly better than them.
    Moreover, it was hard to draw a distinction between the different system combination strategies themselves.
    There are a number of possibilities as to why we failed to find significant differences: &#8226; The number of judgments that we collected were not sufficient to find a difference.
    Although we collected several thousand judgments for each language pair, most pairs of systems were judged together fewer than 100 times. generally difficult to draw a statistically significant differences between the two groups, and between the combinations themselves. there is significant overlap in the strategies that they employ.
    Improved system combination warrants further investigation.
    We would suggest collecting additional judgments, an
