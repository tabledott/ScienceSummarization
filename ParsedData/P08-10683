ssary to reach this target.
    We show that our semi-supervised approach yields improvements for fixed datasets by performing parsing experiments on the Penn Treebank (Marcus et al., 1993) and Prague Dependency Treebank (Haji&#711;c, 1998; Haji&#711;c et al., 2001) (see Sections 4.1 and 4.3).
    By conducting experiments on datasets of varying sizes, we demonstrate that for fixed levels of performance, the cluster-based approach can reduce the need for supervised data by roughly half, which is a substantial savings in data-annotation costs (see Sections 4.2 and 4.4).
    The remainder of this paper is divided as follows: Section 2 gives background on dependency parsing and clustering, Section 3 describes the cluster-based features, Section 4 presents our experimental results, Section 5 discusses related work, and Section 6 concludes with ideas for future research.
  
  
    Recent work (Buchholz and Marsi, 2006; Nivre et al., 2007) has focused on dependency parsing.
