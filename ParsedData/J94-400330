    A promising approach may be to use aligned bilingual corpora, especially for augmenting existing lexicons with domain-specific terminology (Brown et al. 1993; Dagan, Church, and Gale 1993).
    In any case, it seems that any translation system is limited by the completeness of its bilingual lexicon, which makes our assumption a reasonable one.
    Another problem we should address is the statistical significance of the data&#8212;what confidence do we have that the data indeed reflect the phenomenon.
    If the decision is based on small counts, then the difference in the counts might be due to chance.
    For example, we should have more confidence in the odds ratio 151/112 = 3 when n1 = 30 and n2 = 10 than when n1 = 3 and n2 = 1.
    Consequently, we shall use a dynamic threshold for 151 /1112, which is large when the counts are small and decreases as the counts increase.
    A common method for determining the statistical significance of estimates is the use of confidence intervals.
