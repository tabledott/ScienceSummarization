ies for semantic roles from the syntactic and lexical features.
  Both training and test sentences were automatically parsed, as no hand- annotated parse trees were available for the corpus.
  While the errors introduced by the parser no doubt negatively affected the results obtained, there was no direct way of quantifying this effect.
  One of the systems evaluated for the Message Understanding Conference task (Miller et al.
  1998) made use of an integrated syntactic and semantic model producing a full parse tree and achieved results comparable to other systems that did not make use of a complete parse.
  As in the FrameNet case, the parser was not 94 Table 9 Semantic roles for different frame sets of kick.
