lignment mod- els (Och and Ney, 2000) should improve performance for all of the applications studied in this paper, as would iterative re- alignments using richer alignment features (including lemma and part-of-speech) derived from this research.
  The current somewhat lower performance on Czech is due to several factors.
  They include (a) very low accuracy ini- tial word-alignments due to often non-parallel translations of the Reader?s Digest sample and the failure of the initial word-alignment models to handle the highly inflected Czech morphology.
  (b) the small size of the Czech parallel cor- pus (less than twice the length of the Bible).
  (c) the com- mon occurrence in Czech of two very similar perfective and non-perfective root variants (e.g.
  odola?vat and odolat, both of which mean to resist).
  A simple monolingual dictionary- derived list of canonical roots would resolve ambiguity re- garding which is the appropriate target.
  Many of the errors are due to all (or most) inflections of a sin- gle
