o the training abstracts).
    The learning system is a rule induction system with bagging.
    Our system consists of the TextRank approach described in Section 3.1, with a co-occurrence windowsize set to two, three, five, or ten words.
    Table 1 lists the results obtained with TextRank, and the best results reported in (Hulth, 2003).
    For each method, the table lists the total number of keywords assigned, the mean number of keywords per abstract, the total number of correct keywords, as evaluated against the set of keywords assigned by professional indexers, and the mean number of correct keywords.
    The table also lists precision, recall, and F-measure.
    Discussion.
    TextRank achieves the highest precision and F-measure across all systems, although the recall is not as high as in supervised methods &#8211; possibly due the limitation imposed by our approach on the number of keywords selected, which is not made in the supervised systema.
    A larger window does not seem to help &#8211; on the
