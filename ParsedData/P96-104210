(tlw) (as described in Section 2).
    Both types of the parameters we sample have the form of multinomial distributions.
    Each multinomial random variable corresponds to a conditioning event and its values are given by the corresponding set of conditioned events.
    For example, a transition probability parameter P(ti&#8212;+t3) has conditioning event ti and conditioned event ti.
    Let { ui} denote the set of possible values of a given multinomial variable, and let S = Ind denote a set of statistics extracted from the training set for that variable, where ni is the number of times that the value ui appears in the training set for the variable, defining N = Ei ni.
    The parameters whose posterior distributions we wish to estimate are ai = P(ui).
    The maximum likelihood estimate for each of the multinomial's distribution parameters, ai, is &amp; = .
    In practice, this estimator is usually smoothed in some way to compensate for data sparseness.
    Such smoothing typically reduces slightly the est
