se and one that extracts many instances.
    The recall of a pattern p can be approximated by the fraction of input instances that are extracted by p. Since it is non-trivial to estimate automatically the precision of a pattern, we are wary of keeping patterns that generate many instances (i.e., patterns that generate high recall but potentially disastrous precision).
    Hence, we desire patterns that are highly associated with the input instances.
    Pointwise mutual information (Cover and Thomas 1991) is a commonly used metric for measuring this strength of association between two events x and y: We define the reliability of a pattern p, r&#960;(p), as its average strength of association across each input instance i in I, weighted by the reliability of each instance i: where r&#953;(i) is the reliability of instance i (defined below) and maxpmi is the maximum pointwise mutual information between all patterns and all instances. r&#960;(p) ranges from [0,1].
