e approaches are often inadequate to perform fine-level textual analysis.
    An improvement on BOW is given by the use of syntactic parse trees, e.g. for question classification (Zhang and Lee, 2003), but these, too are inadequate when dealing with definitional answers expressed by long and articulated sentences or even paragraphs.
    On the contrary, shallow semantic representations, bearing a more &#8220;compact&#8221; information, could prevent the sparseness of deep structural approaches and the weakness of BOW models.
    Initiatives such as PropBank (PB) (Kingsbury and Palmer, 2002) have made possible the design of accurate automatic Semantic Role Labeling (SRL) systems (Carreras and M`arquez, 2005).
    Attempting an application of SRL to QA hence seems natural, as pinpointing the answer to a question relies on a deep understanding of the semantics of both.
    Let us consider the PB annotation: [ARG1 Antigens] were [AM&#8722;TMP originally] [rel defined] [ARG2 as non-self molecules].
