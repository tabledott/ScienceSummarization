s: e.g. on A-E, gains under 3g (3.6 BLEU points on MJ-1, 0.2 points on MJ-2) are higher than the gains with 2g (2.4 BLEU points on MJ-1, 0.1 points on MJ-2).

			On A-E, MJ-1 and MJ-2 yield larger im provements on News relative to the other genres;on C-E, the gains are larger on Speeches and Ed itorials relative to News.
			We hypothesize that thePhrase-Pair Inventory, reordering models and lan guage models could all have been biased away from the test set due to the training data.
			There may also be less movement across these other genres.
