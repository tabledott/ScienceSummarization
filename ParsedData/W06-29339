hment score.
    A very similar pattern is found for Spanish (Civit Torruella and MartiAntonin, 2002), although this cannot be explained by a high proportion of non-projective structures.
    One possible explanation in this case may be the fact that dependency graphs in the Spanish data are sparsely labeled, which may cause problem for a parser that relies on dependency labels as features.
    The results for Arabic (Haji&#711;c et al., 2004; Smr&#711;z et al., 2002) are characterized by low root accuracy as well as a rapid degradation of attachment score with arc length (from about 93% for length 1 to 67% for length 2).
    By contrast, Turkish (Oflazer et al., 2003; Atalay et al., 2003) exhibits high root accuracy but consistently low attachment scores (about 88% for length 1 and 68% for length 2).
    It is noteworthy that Arabic and Turkish, being &#8220;typological outliers&#8221;, show patterns that are different both from each other and from most of the other languages.
