  Many Japanese verbs can be made into empathy-loaded verbs because of a pro- ductive verb-compounding operation by which these empathy-loaded verbs are used as the auxiliary verb, attaching to the main verb}  6 For example, kureru can be used as a suffix, to mark OBJ or OBJ2 as the EMPATHY LOCUS.
  The attachment of yaru marks SUBJECT as the EMPATHY LOCUS.
  The complex predicate made by this operation inherits the EMPATHY LOCUS of  the suffixed verb.
  For example: Example 19 Hanako ga Taroo ni hon o yonde-kureta.
  Hanako SUBJ Taroo OBJ2 book OBJ read-gave Hanako did Taroo a favor in reading a book.
  EMPATHY = OBJ2 = TAROO In this case Taroo is interpreted as the EMPATHY LOCUS because of the auxiliary kureta attached to the main verb.
  Similarly in example 20, the speaker indicates empa- thy with Hanako by using the past tense form yatta of the verb yaru as an auxiliary verb to the main verb tazuneru.
