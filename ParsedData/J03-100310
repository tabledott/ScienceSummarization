s selected (since type information is always selected).
    It rules out d4 (which is a cat).
    Next we consider the color of d1; the animal is brown.
    This property rules out d3 (which is a black and white dog) and is selected.
    Finally, we consider the size of our target object, which is small.
    This properly rules out the remaining distractor d2 (which is a large brown dog) and hence is included as well.
    At this point, all distractors are ruled out (success!
    ), and the set of selected properties is {dog, brown, small}, which a linguistic realizer might express as &#8220;the small brown dog.&#8221; This is a successful distinguishing description but not a minimal one: The property brown is, strictly speaking, made redundant by the later inclusion of the property small.
    Since there is no backtracking in the incremental algorithm however, every selected property is realized (hence &#8220;incremental&#8221;).
    This aspect is largely responsible for the computational efficiency of the
