artly reflects the fact that non-boundaries greatly outnumber boundaries, an average of 89 versus 11 majority opinions per transcript.
    The low variances, or spread around the average, show that subjects are also consistent with one another.
    Defining a task so as to maximize percent agreement can be difficult.
    The high and consistent levels of agreement for our task suggest that we have found a useful experimental formulation of the task of discourse segmentation.
    Furthermore, our percent agreement figures are comparable with the results of other segmentation studies discussed above.
    While studies of other tasks have achieved stronger results (e.g., 96.8% in a word-sense disambiguation study (Gale et al., 1992)), the meaning of percent agreement in isolation is unclear.
    For example, a percent agreement figure of less than 90% could still be very meaningful if the probability of obtaining such a figure is low, In the next section we demonstrate the significance of our findings.
