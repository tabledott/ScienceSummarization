d Lapata (2008) discuss ParaMetric, another automatic measure that may be used to evaluate paraphrase extraction methods.
    This work follows directly from the work done by the authors to create the paraphraseannotated corpus described in the previous section.
    Recall that this corpus contains paraphrastic sentence pairs with annotations in the form of alignments between their respective words and phrases.
    It is posited that to evaluate any paraphrase generation method, one could simply have it produce its own set of alignments for the sentence pairs in the corpus and precision and recall could then be computed over alignments instead of phrase pairs.
    These alignment-oriented precision (Palign) and recall (Ralign) measures are computed as follows: where (s1,s2) denotes a sentence pair, NM(s1,s2) denotes the phrases extracted via the manual alignments for the pair (s1, s2), and NP(s1,s2) denotes the phrases extracted via the automatic alignments induced using the paraphrase method P that is to be
