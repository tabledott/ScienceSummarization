uadratic Kernel.
    It implies that XQK can only deal with feature combination of size up to two.
    On the other hand, PKE is more general and can also be applied not only to the Quadratic Kernel but also to the general-style of polynomial kernels (1 + |X &#8745; Y |)d. In PKE, there are no theoretical constrains to limit the size of combinations.
    In addition, Isozaki et al. did not mention how to expand the feature combinations.
    They seem to use a naive exhaustive method to expand them, which is not always scalable and efficient for extracting three or more feature combinations.
    PKE takes a basket mining approach to enumerating effective feature combinations more efficiently than their exhaustive method.
  
  
    We focused on a Polynomial Kernel of degree d, which has been widely applied in many tasks in NLP and can attain feature combination that is crucial to improving the performance of tasks in NLP.
    Then, we introduced two fast classification algorithms for this kernel.
    One is PK
