sis on parallel texts, also known as multitexts.
    Figure 1 shows some of the ways in which ordinary parsing can be generalized.
    A synchronous parser is an algorithm that can infer the syntactic structure of each component text in a multitext and simultaneously infer the correspondence relation between these structures.'
    When a parser&#8217;s input can have fewer dimensions than the parser&#8217;s grammar, we call it a translator.
    When a parser&#8217;s grammar can have fewer dimensions than the parser&#8217;s input, we call it a synchronizer.
    The corresponding processes are called translation and synchronization.
    To our knowledge, synchronization has never been explored as a class of algorithms.
    Neither has the relationship between parsing and word alignment.
    The relationship between translation and ordinary parsing was noted a long time 'A suitable set of ordinary parsers can also infer the syntactic structure of each component, but cannot infer the correspondence relation betwe
