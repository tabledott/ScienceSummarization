mental Algorithm cannot be proven to be intersectively complete concerns the semantic relation between different Values of a given Attribute: their extensions should not &#8220;overlap&#8221; in the following precise sense: van Deemter Generating Referring Expressions (If Vi,j and Vi,k do not overlap, then either [[Vi,j]] &#57738; [[Vi,k]], or [[Vi,k]] &#57738; [[Vi,j]], or [[Vi,j]] and [[Vi,k]] have an empty intersection.)
    Values can overlap for different reasons.
    Some Attributes (e.g., COLOR) have &#8220;vague&#8221; Values (e.g., RED, ORANGE), which may be modeled as overlapping: some objects may count as both red and orange.
    Also, Values may derive from particular parts or aspects of an object; for example, if an object counts as METAL (PLASTIC) because it has some METAL (PLASTIC) parts, then it may be listed as both METAL and PLASTIC.
    Further examples arise if the KB models relations through unanalyzed properties.
    For example, a desk, or a particular type of desk, can stand in a given
