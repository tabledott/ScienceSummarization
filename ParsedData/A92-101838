    This approach to phrase recognition in some cases captures only parts of some phrases; however, our approach minimizes false positives, so that we can rely on the recognizers' results.
    Part-of-speech tagging in and of itself is a useful tool in lexical disambiguation; for example, knowing that &amp;quot;dig&amp;quot; is being used as a noun rather than as a verb indicates the word's appropriate meaning.
    But many words have multiple meanings even while occupying the same part of speech.
    To this end, the tagger has been used in the implementation of an experimental noun homograph disambiguation algorithm [Hearst, 1991].
    The algorithm (known as CatchWord) performs supervised training over a large text corpus, gathering lexical, orthographic, and simple syntactic evidence for each sense of the ambiguous noun.
    After a period of training, Catch Word classifies new instances of the noun by checking its context against that of previously observed instances and choosing the sense for whic
