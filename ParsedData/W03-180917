ution by taking a collocation to consist of three events: the type of dependency relationship, the head lexical item, and the modifier.
    A phrase a was then said to be non-compositional iff there exists no phrase Q where: (a) Q can be produced by substitution of the components of a as described above, and (b) there is an overlap between the 95% confidence interval of the mutual information values of a and Q.
    These judgements were evaluated by comparison with a dictionary of idioms.
    If an item was in the dictionary then it was said to be non-compositional.
    Scores of 15.7% for precision and 13.7% for recall are reported.
    There are, to our minds, significant problems with the underlying assumptions of Lin&#8217;s method.
    The theoretical basis of the technique is that compositional items should have a similar distribution to items formed by replacing components words with semantically similar ones.
    The idea presumably is that if an item is the result of the free combination of words, or
