mittee-based sampling algorithm was initialized using the first 1,000 words from the corpus, and then sequentially examined the following examples in the corpus for possible labeling.
    The training set consisted of the first million words in the corpus, with sentence ordering randomized to compensate for inhomogeneity in corpus composition.
    The test set was a separate portion of the corpus, consisting of 20,000 words.
    We compare the amount of training required by different selection methods to achieve a given tagging accuracy on the test set, where both the amount of training and tagging accuracy are measured over ambiguous words.'
    The effectiveness of randomized committee-based 5Note that most other work on tagging has measured accuracy over all words, not just ambiguous ones.
    Complete training of our system on 1,000,000 words gave us an accuracy of 93.5% over ambiguous words, which corresponds to an accuracy of 95.9% over all words in the selection for part-of-speech tagging, with 5 and 1
