consider a case of observation bias (Klein and Manning, 2002) for a first-order left-toright CMM.
    The word to has only one tag (TO) in the PTB tag set.
    The TO tag is often preceded by nouns, but rarely by modals (MD).
    In a sequence will to fight, that trend indicates that will should be a noun rather than a modal verb.
    However, that effect is completely lost in a CMM like (a): P(twill |will, hstarti) prefers the modal tagging, and P(TO|to, twill) is roughly 1 regardless of twill.
    While the model has an arrow between the two tag positions, that path of influence is severed.3 The same problem exists in the other direction.
    If we use the symmetric rightto-left model, fight will receive its more common noun tagging by symmetric reasoning.
    However, the bidirectional model (c) discussed in the next section makes both directions available for conditioning at all locations, using replicated models of P(t0|t&#8722;1, t+1, w0), and will be able to get this example correct.4 While the structu
