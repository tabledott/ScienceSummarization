ces of labels encoding the analysis.
    In language processing, examples of such tasks include part-of-speech tagging, named-entity recognition, and the task we shall focus on here, shallow parsing.
    Shallow parsing identifies the non-recursive cores of various phrase types in text, possibly as a precursor to full parsing or information extraction (Abney, 1991).
    The paradigmatic shallowparsing problem is NP chunking, which finds the nonrecursive cores of noun phrases called base NPs.
    The pioneering work of Ramshaw and Marcus (1995) introduced NP chunking as a machine-learning problem, with standard datasets and evaluation metrics.
    The task was extended to additional phrase types for the CoNLL2000 shared task (Tjong Kim Sang and Buchholz, 2000), which is now the standard evaluation task for shallow parsing.
    Most previous work used two main machine-learning approaches to sequence labeling.
    The first approach relies on k-order generative probabilistic models of paired input sequences and
