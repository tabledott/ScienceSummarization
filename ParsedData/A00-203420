    Resnik used syntactic information from the bracketing within the Penn Treebank corpus.
    Research into the identification of other diathesis alternations has been advanced by the availability of automatic syntactic processing.
    Most work using corpus evidence for verb classification has relied on a priori knowledge in the form of linguistic cues specific to the phenomena being observed (Lapata, 1999; Stevenson and Merlo, 1999).
    Our approach, whilst being applicable only to RsAs, does not require human input specific to the alternation at hand.
