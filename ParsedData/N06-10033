    However, for any given test set, a huge amount of training data has to be observed before translations are learned for a reasonable percentage of the test phrases.
    Figure 1 shows the extent of this problem.
    For a training corpus containing 10,000 words translations will have been learned for only 10% of the unigrams (types, not tokens).
    For a training corpus containing 100,000 words this increases to 30%.
    It is not until nearly 10,000,000 words worth of training data have been analyzed that translation for more than 90% of the vocabulary items have been learned.
    This problem is obviously compounded for higher-order n-grams (longer phrases), and for morphologically richer languages. phrases for the Spanish words encargarnos and usado along with their English translations which were automatically learned from the Europarl corpus Currently most statistical machine translation systems are simply unable to handle unknown words.
