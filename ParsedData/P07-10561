    Sentiment detection and classification has received considerable attention recently (Pang et al., 2002; Turney, 2002; Goldberg and Zhu, 2004).
    While movie reviews have been the most studied domain, sentiment analysis has extended to a number of new domains, ranging from stock message boards to congressional floor debates (Das and Chen, 2001; Thomas et al., 2006).
    Research results have been deployed industrially in systems that gauge market reaction and summarize opinion from Web pages, discussion boards, and blogs.
    With such widely-varying domains, researchers and engineers who build sentiment classification systems need to collect and curate data for each new domain they encounter.
    Even in the case of market analysis, if automatic sentiment classification were to be used across a wide range of domains, the effort to annotate corpora for each domain may become prohibitive, especially since product features change over time.
    We envision a scenario in
