    We have shown that this description format makes it easy to find parsers that compute values in any w-continuous semiring.
    The same description can be used to find reverse values in commutative wcontinuous semirings, and in many noncommutative ones as well.
    This description format can also be used to describe grammar transformations, including transformations to CNF and GNF, which preserve values in any commutative w-continuous semiring.
    While theoretical in nature, this paper is of some practical value.
    There are three reasons the results of this paper would be used in practice: first, these techniques make computation of the outside values simple and mechanical; second, these techniques make it easy to show that a parser will work in any w-continuous semiring; and third, these techniques isolate computation of infinite sums in a given semiring from the parser specification process.
