  The package allows annotators to correct POS assignment errors by positioning the cursor on an incorrectly tagged word and then entering the desired correct ag (or sequence of multiple tags).
  The annotators input is automatically checked against the list of legal tags in Table 2 and, if valid, appended to the original word-tag pair separated by an asterisk.
  Appending the new tag rather than replacing the old tag allows us to easily identify recurring errors at the automatic POS assignment s age.
  We believe that the confusion matrices that can be extracted from this information should also prove useful in designing better automatic taggers in the future.
  The result of this second stage of POS tagging is shown in Figure 2.
