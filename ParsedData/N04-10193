volves comparison of a peer summary (baseline, or produced by human or system) by comparing its content to a gold standard, or model.
    In 2003 they provided four human summaries for each of the 30 multi-document test sets, any one of which could serve as the model, with no criteria for choosing among possible models.
    The four human summaries for each of the 2003 document sets made our study possible.
    As described in Section 3, we used three of these sets, and collected six additional summaries per set, in order to study the distribution of content units across increasingly many summaries.
    The procedure used for evaluating summaries in DUC is the following: The final score is based on the content unit coverage.
    In the official DUC results tables, the score for the entire summary is the average of the scores of all the content model units, thus a number between 0 and 1.
    Some participants use slightly modified versions of the coverage metric, where the proportion of marked peer units to th
