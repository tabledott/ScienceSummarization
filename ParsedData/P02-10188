l function annotation at least 50% of the time in the training corpus; all such verbs are relabelled whether or not any particular instance is followed by an NP.
    Intuitively, transitivity would seem to be a powerful cue that there is an empty node following a verb.
    Experiments on the development corpus showed that transitivity annotation provides a small but useful improvement to the algorithm&#8217;s performance.
    The accuracy of transitivity labelling was not systematically evaluated here.
    Informally, patterns are minimal connected tree fragments containing an empty node and all nodes co-indexed with it.
    The intuition is that the path from the empty node to its antecedents specifies important aspects of the context in which the empty node can appear.
    There are many different possible ways of realizing this intuition, but all of the ones tried gave approximately similar results so we present the simplest one here.
    The results given below were generated where the pattern for an empt
