 possibility of an embedded narrative that will elaborate that event or situation (past, upcoming, or hypothetical) in more detail, as in Example 19.

    At this point, using additional reasoning, the listener may recognize an anaphoric relation between Clause 19c and the discourse entity evoked by her trip to Alaska.
    Support for this, rather than assuming that an event-denoting NP sets up a pot
