ng alignments to each English version.
  As illustrated in Figure 10, different aligned Bible pairs may exhibit (or be missing) different full or partial bridge links for a given word (due both to different lexical usage and poor textual parallelism in some text-regions or version pairs).
  
  Even if one has only one Bible in a given source language, each alignment with a distinct English version gives new bridging opportunities with no additional resources needed on the source language side.
  The baseline approach (evaluated here) is simply to concatenate the different aligned versions together.
  While word- pair instances translated the same way in each version will be re- peated, this rather reasonably reflects the increased confidence in this particular alignment.
  An alternate model would weight version pairs differently based on the otherwise-measured translation faith- fulness and alignment quality between the version pairs.
  Doing so would help decrease noise.
