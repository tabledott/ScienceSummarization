t of English, ordered by average absolute value.
    We did not calculate correlations with the human judgments for the system combinations for the out of English direction, because none of them had more than 4 items.
    We measured the correlation of the automatic metrics with the human judgments of translation quality at the system-level using Spearman&#8217;s rank correlation coefficient &#961;.
    We converted the raw scores assigned to each system into ranks.
    We assigned a human ranking to the systems based on the percent of time that their translations were judged to be better than or equal to the translations of any other system in the manual evaluation.
    The reference was not included as an extra translation.
    When there are no ties, &#961; can be calculated using the simplified equation: where di is the difference between the rank for systemi and n is the number of systems.
    The possible values of &#961; range between 1(where all systems are ranked in the same order) and &#8722;1 (wher
