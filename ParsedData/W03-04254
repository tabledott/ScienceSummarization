 proposing, evaluating and selecting the classification changes that maximally decrease the number of errors.
    TBL has some attractive qualities that make it suitable for the language-related tasks: it can automatically integrate heterogeneous types of knowledge, without the need for explicit modeling, it is error&#8211;driven, and has an inherently dynamic behavior.
    The particular setup in which fnTBL is used in this work is described in Florian (2002a): in a first phase, TBL is used to identify the entity boundaries, followed by a sequence classification stage, where the entities identified at the first step are classified using internal and external clues3.
    The HMM classifier used in the experiments in Section 4 follows the system description in (Bikel et al., 1999), and it performs sequence classification by assigning each word either one of the named entity types or the label NOT-A-NAME to represent &amp;quot;not a named entity&amp;quot;.
    The states in the HMM are organized into regions, o
