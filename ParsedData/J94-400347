 of the random examples, there is only a 5% chance that the real figure is less than 86% (for the given domain and corpus).
    The confidence interval was computed as follows: p (1-)64 --165 64 6 70 &#8226; 70 70 = 0.86, 70 where a = 0.05 and the variance is estimated by p(1 - P)/ n. With the same confidence, our method improves the Word Frequencies method by at least 18% (relative to the actual improvement of 28% in the given test set).
    Let p1 be the proportion of cases for which our method succeeds and the Word Frequencies method fails (pi = 22/70) and p2 be the proportion of cases for which the Word Frequencies method succeeds and ours fails (p2 = 2/70).
    The confidence interval is for the difference of proportions in multinomial distribution and is computed as follows: Out of the 54 ambiguous German words, for 27 the bound Bc, did not pass the threshold (applicability of 50%).
    The remaining 27 examples were distributed according to Table 3.
    Thus, the precision of the statistical model was
