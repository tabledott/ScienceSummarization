etailed discussion would take us beyond the intended scope of this paper.
    The different noiational conventions of DCGs and LFG make the two formalisms less similar on the surface than they actually are from the computational point of view.
    The objects that appear as arguments in DCG rules are tree fragments every node of which has a number of children predetermined by the functor that labels the node.
    Explicit variables mark unspecified parts of the tree.
    In contrast, the functional structure nodes that are implicitly mentioned in LFG equations do not have a predefined number of children, and unspecified parts are either omitted or defined implicitly through equations.
    As a first approximation, a DCG rule such as The DCG rule can be read as &amp;quot;an s with structure / \ Subj Obj is an up with structure Subj followed by a vp with structure Obj.&#8226; The LFG rule can be read as 'an S is an NP followed by a VP, where the value of the subj attribute of the S is the functional structure o
