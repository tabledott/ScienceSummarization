 of relation instances and corpora of less than a million words.
    Many early algorithms for relation extraction used little or no syntactic information.
    For example, the DIPRE algorithm by Brin (1998) used string-based regular expressions in order to recognize relations such as author-book, while the SNOWBALL algorithm by Agichtein and Gravano (2000) learned similar regular expression patterns over words and named entity tags.
    Hearst (1992) used a small number of regular expressions over words and part-of-speech tags to find examples of the hypernym relation.
    The use of these patterns has been widely replicated in successful systems, for example by Etzioni et al. (2005).
    Other work such as Ravichandran and Hovy (2002) and Pantel and Pennacchiotti (2006) use the same formalism of learning regular expressions over words and part-of-speech tags to discover patterns indicating a variety of relations.
    More recent approaches have used deeper syntactic information derived from parses of the in
