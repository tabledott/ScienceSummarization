ieved by syntactic analysis of both the source and target languages, instead of the simple tri-gram model used by Brown et al. In a broader sense, this can be viewed as a tradeoff between the different components of a translation system: having better analysis and generation models may reduce some burden from the transfer model.
    In our opinion, the method proposed in this paper may have immediate practical value, beyond its theoretical aspects.
    As we argue below, we believe that the method is feasible for practical machine translation systems and can provide a cost-effective improvement on target word selection methods.
    The identification of syntactic relations in the source sentence is available in any machine translation system that uses some form of syntactic parsing.
    Trivially, a bilingual lexicon is available.
    A parser for the target language becomes common in many systems that offer bidirectional translation capabilities, requiring parsers for several languages (see Miller 1993, for
