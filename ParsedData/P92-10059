), form(&lt;type=vpellipsis&gt;, P-P(term(th&lt;type=name&gt;,J-name(J,'John'), exists,john)), _e)).
    This is a conjunction of the QLF for the antecedent clause (Each boy claimed he was clever under a bound pronoun reading) with a form expression for the verb phrase ellipsis.
    Solutions for instantiating the meta-variable _e for the ellipsis are the result of applying a property P1, derived from the antecedent clause, to the term with index +j.
    The sentence has two readings: a sloppy reading where John claims that he is clever, and a strict one where John claims that each of the boys is clever.
    The choice between a strict or sloppy reading depends on how the term he is reinterpreted in the ellipsis resolution.
    Intuitively, strict identity involves referring to the same object as before, whereas sloppy identity involves referring to a relevantly similar object.
    In QLF, a strict reading results from reinterpreting the ellipsis pronoun as co-indexed with the original, i.e. taking P1 to be:
