  Machine Translation by Triangulation: Making Effective Use of Multi-Parallel Corpora
  
    Current phrase-based SMT systems perform poorly when using small training sets.
    This is a consequence of unreliable translation estimates and low coverage over source and target phrases.
    This paper presents a method which alleviates this problem by exploiting multiple translations of the same source Central to our approach is triangulathe process of translating from a source to a target language via an intermediate third language.
    This allows the use of a much wider range of parallel corpora for training, and can be combined with a standard phrase-table using conventional smoothing methods.
    Experimental results demonstrate BLEU improvements for triangulated models over a standard phrase-based system.
  
  
    Statistical machine translation (Brown et al., 1993) has seen many improvements in recent years, most notably the transition from word- to phrase-based models (Koehn et al., 2003).
