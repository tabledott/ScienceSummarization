nd level of inference.
    We call the technique two-stage prediction aggregation.
    We implemented the token-majority and the entity-majority features discussed in (Krishnan and Manning, 2006); however, instead of document and corpus majority tags, we used relative frequency of the tags in a 1000 token window.
    Both context aggregation and two-stage prediction aggregation treat all tokens in the text similarly.
    However, we observed that the named entities in the beginning of the documents tended to be more easily identifiable and matched gazetteers more often.
    This is due to the fact that when a named entity is introduced for the first time in text, a canonical name is used, while in the following discussion abbreviated mentions, pronouns, and other references are used.
    To break the symmetry, when using beamsearch or greedy left-to-right decoding, we use the fact that when we are making a prediction for token instance xi, we have already made predictions y1, ... , yi&#8722;1 for token instan
