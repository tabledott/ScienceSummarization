p will give parents a new and potentially revolutionary device to block out programs they don't want their children to see.
    The success rate computes the percentage of system's reduction decisions that agree with those of humans.
    We compute the success rate in the following way.
    The reduction process can be considered as a series of decision-making process along the edges of a sentence parse tree.
    At each node of the parse tree, both the human and the program make a decision whether to remove the node or to keep it.
    If a node is removed, the subtree with that node as the root is removed as a whole, thus no decisions are needed for the descendants of the removed node.
    If the node is kept, we consider that node as the root and repeat this process.
    Suppose we have an input sentence (ABCDEFGH), which has a parse tree shown in Figure 2.
    Suppose a human reduces the sentence to (ABDGH), which can be translated to a series of decisions made along edges in the sentence parse tree as sho
