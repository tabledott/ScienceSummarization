and Matsumoto, 2002).
    We use a standard data set (Ramshaw and Marcus, 1995) consisting of sections 15-19 of the WSJ corpus as training and section 20 as testing.
    Since there are no explicit spaces between words in Japanese sentences, we must first identify the word boundaries before analyzing deep structure of a sentence.
    Japanese word segmentation is formalized as a simple classification task.
    Let s = c1c2 &#183; &#183; &#183; cm be a sequence of Japanese characters, t = t1t2 &#183; &#183; &#183; tm be a sequence of Japanese character types 3 associated with each character, and yi &#8712; {+1, &#8722;1}, (i = (1, 2,...,m&#8722; 1)) be a boundary marker.
    If there is a boundary between ci and ci+1, yi = 1, otherwise yi = &#8722;1.
    The feature set of example xi is given by all characters as well as character types in some constant window (e.g., 5): {ci&#8722;2, ci&#8722;1, &#183;&#183;&#183; , ci+2, ci+3, ti&#8722;2, ti&#8722;1, &#183;&#183;&#183; , ti+2, ti+3}.
    Note that we distingu
