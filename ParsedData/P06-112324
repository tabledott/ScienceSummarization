 either allowing each nonterminal to generate both terminals and other nonterminals (Groves et al., 2004; Chiang, 2005), or, given a constraining parse tree, to &#8220;flatten&#8221; it (Fox, 2002; Zens and Ney, 2003; Galley et al., 2004).
    Both of these approaches can increase coverage of the training data, but, as explained in Section 2, they risk losing generalization ability.
    Our study suggests that there might be some benefits to an alternative approach using discontinuous constituents, as proposed, e.g., by Melamed et al. (2004) and Simard et al.
    (2005).
    The large differences in failure rates between the first and second columns of Table 3 are largely independent of the tightness of our lower bounds.
    Synchronous parsing with discontinuities is computationally expensive in the worst case, but recently invented data structures make it feasible for typical inputs, as long as the number of gaps allowed per constituent is fixed at a small maximum (Waxmonsky and Melamed, 2006).
