reference resolution, we constructed entity classes simply by clustering nouns on the basis of their identity.
    In other words, each noun in a text corresponds to a different entity in a grid, and two nouns are considered coreferent only if they are identical.
    The performance of the model (Syntax+Salience) is shown in the third row of Table 4.
    While coreference resolution improved model performance in ordering, it caused a decrease in accuracy in summary evaluation.
    This drop in performance can be attributed to two factors related to the nature of our corpus &#8212; machine-generated texts.
    First, an automatic coreference resolution tool expectedly decreases in accuracy because it was trained on well-formed human-authored texts.
    Second, automatic summarization systems do not use anaphoric expressions as often as humans do.
    Therefore, a simple entity clustering method is more suitable for automatic summaries.
