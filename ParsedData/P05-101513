ore divergent labels to similar items.
    In this paper, we only report supervised-learning experiments in which the nearest neighbors for any given test item were drawn from the training set alone.
    In such a setting, the labeling decisions for different test items are independent, so that solving the requisite optimization problem is simple.
    Aside: transduction The above formulation also allows for transductive semi-supervised learning as well, in that we could allow nearest neighbors to come from both the training and test sets.
    We intend to address this case in future work, since there are important settings in which one has a small number of labeled reviews and a large number of unlabeled reviews, in which case considering similarities between unlabeled texts could prove quite helpful.
    In full generality, the corresponding multi-label optimization problem is intractable, but for many families of functions (e.g., convex) there exist practical exact or approximation algorithms based on tech
