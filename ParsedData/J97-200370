 it to several word lattices obtained in the 60,000-word ARPA North American Business News task (NAB).
    These lattices were already determinized.
    Table 2 shows the average reduction factors we obtained when using the minimization algorithms with several subsequential lattices obtained for utterances of the NAB task.
    The reduction factors help to measure the gain of minimization alone, since the lattices are already subsequential.
    The numbers in example 2, an example of reduction we obtained, correspond to a typical case.
    An important characteristic of the determinization algorithm is that it can be used on-the-fly.
    Indeed, the determinization algorithm is such that given a subset representing a state of the resulting transducer, the definition of the transitions leaving that state depends only on that state or, equivalently, on the states of that subset, and on the transducer to determinize.
    In particular, the definition and construction of these transitions do not depend directly o
