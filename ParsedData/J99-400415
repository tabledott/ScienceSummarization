    In this subsection, we define and discuss semirings (see Kuich [19971 for an introduction).
    A semiring has two operations, ED and 0, that intuitively have most (but not necessarily all) of the properties of the conventional + and x operations on the positive integers.
    In particular, we require the following properties: 0 is associative and commutative; 0 is associative and distributes over ED.
    If 0 is commutative, we will say that the semiring is commutative.
    We assume an additive identity element, which we write as 0, and a multiplicative identity element, which we write as 1.
    Both addition and multiplication can be defined over finite sets of elements; if the set is empty, then the value is the respective identity element, 0 or 1.
    We also assume that x = x = 0 for all x.
    In other words, a semiring is just like a ring, except that the additive operator need not have an inverse.
    We will write (A, ED, 0, 0, 1) to indicate a semiring over the set A with additive operato
