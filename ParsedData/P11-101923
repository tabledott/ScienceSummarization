 lower correlation compared to i(a) and i(b), it is likely that a random ordering of ngrams with N &gt; 3 will further decrease performance.
    A modification of type ii, where words with the same PoS within a sentence are swapped, results in a Pearson and Spearman correlation of 0.634 and 0.761 respectively.
    Analysis of the results showed that our system predicted higher scores than the ones assigned by the examiner.
    This can be explained by the fact that texts produced using modification type ii contain a small portion of correct sentences.
    However, the marking criteria are based on the overall writing quality.
    The final case, where correct sentences are randomly ordered, receives the lowest correlation.
    As our system is not measuring discourse cohesion, discrepancies are much higher; the system&#8217;s predicted scores are high whilst the ones assigned by the examiner are very low.
    However, for a writer to be able to generate text of this type already requires significant linguisti
