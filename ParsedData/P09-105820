; Jiang et al., 2008b).
    Table 7 compares the F1 results with previous studies on CTB 5.0.
    The result of our error-driven model is superior to previous reported results for both Seg and Seg &amp; Tag, and the result of our baseline model compares favorably to the others.
    Following Zhang and Clark (2008), we first generated CTB 3.0 from CTB 4.0 using sentence IDs 1&#8211;10364.
    We then divided CTB 3.0 into ten equal sets and conducted 10-fold cross validation.
    Unfortunately, Zhang and Clark&#8217;s experimental setting did not allow us to use our errordriven policy since performing 10-fold cross validation again on each main cross validation trial is computationally too expensive.
    Therefore, we used our baseline policy in this setting and fixed r = 3 for all cross validation runs.
    Table 8 compares the F1 results of our baseline model with Nakagawa and Uchimoto (2007) and Zhang and Clark (2008) on CTB 3.0.
    Table 9 shows a summary of averaged F1 results on CTB 3.0.
