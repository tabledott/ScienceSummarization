dependent system has been trained on general function tags such as MANNER and TEMpoRAL by Blaheta and Charniak (2000).
  
  
    We divide the task of labeling frame elements into two subtasks: that of identifying the boundaries of the frame elements in the sentences, and that of labeling each frame element, given its boundaries, with the correct role.
    We first give results for a system which labels roles using human-annotated boundaries, returning to the question of automatically identifying the boundaries in Section 5.3.
    The system is a statistical one, based on training a classifier on a labeled training set, and testing on an unlabeled test set.
    The system is trained by first using the Collins parser (Collins, 1997) to parse the 36,995 training sentences, matching annotated frame elements to parse constituents, and extracting various features from the string of words and the parse tree.
    During testing, the parser is run on the test sentences and the same features extracted.
