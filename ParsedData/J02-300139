 divided the FrameNet corpus as follows: one-tenth of the annotated sentences for each target word were reserved as a test set, and another onetenth were set aside as a tuning set for developing our system.
    A few target words where fewer than 10 examples had been chosen for annotation were removed from the corpus.
    (Section 9 will discuss generalization to unseen predicates.)
    In our corpus, the average number of sentences per target word is only 34, and the number of sentences per frame is 732, both relatively small amounts of data on which to train frame element classifiers.
    To label the semantic role of a constituent automatically, we wish to estimate a probability distribution indicating how likely the constituent is to fill each possible Distributions calculated for semantic role identification: r indicates semantic role, pt phrase type, gov grammatical function, h head word, and t target word, or predicate.
