    Indeed, this tenis a difficult trend to capture in a because often the high and low attachments involve the very same rules.
    Even if not, attachment height is modeled by a it is somehow explicitly encoded into category labels.
    More complex parsing models have indirectly overcome this by modeling distance (rather than height). distance is difficult to encode in a &#8211; marking nodes with the size of their yields masmultiplies the state Therefore, we wish to find indirect indicators that distinguish high from low ones.
    In the case of two a with the question of whether the a second modifier of the leftmost should attach lower, inside the first the important distinction is usually that the lower site is a base Collins (1999) captures this by introducing the notion of a base in any dominates only preterminals is with a Further, if an not have non-base it is given one with a unary production.
    This was helpful, but substantially less than marking base the unary, whose presence actually erased
