 running time, some limited pre-processing was done on the Russian side.
    All classes, whose temporal distributions were close to uniform (i.e. words with a similar likelihood of occurrence throughout the corpus) were deemed common and not considered as NE candidates.
    Unique words were thus grouped into 14,781 equivalence classes.
    Unless mentioned otherwise, the transliteration model was initialized with a set of 20 pairs of English NEs and their Russian transliterations.
    Negative examples here and during the rest of the training were pairs of randomly selected non-NE English and Russian words.
    New features were discovered throughout training; all but top 3000 features from positive and 3000 from negative examples were pruned based on the number of their occurrences so far.
    Features remaining at the end of training were used for NE discovery.
    Insertions/omissions features were not used in the experiments as they provided no tangible benefit for the languages of our corpus.
