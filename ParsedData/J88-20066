 had already been evoked by some other NP.
    (In that case, one would say that the two NPs co-specified the same entity.)
    This basic arrangement is illustrated in Examples 1-3 above and is shown in Figure la.5 Formally, one could say that there is an anaphoric function a, whose value, given the anaphoric noun phrase NPb and the discourse entity Ea, is Ea thatis, a(NPb,Ea) = Ea.
    This can also be read as NPb specifies Ea by virtue of Ea.
    Definite pronouns are most often anaphoric in just this way.
    The other way an NP would be considered a discourse anaphor would be if it used some existing discourse entity Ea to evoke and specify a new discourse entity Eb, as in where NPb&#8212;the driver&#8212;makes use of the entity associated with the bus mentioned in 5a to specify a new entity&#8212;the driver of that bus.
    Here the anaphoric function is of the form a(NPb,Ea) = Eb.
    In cooperative discourse, there have to be constraints on the value of a(NPb,Ea), since only NPb is given explicitly.
