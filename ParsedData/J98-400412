e WSJ corpus are subsumed by the NP NP PP production in this way.
    Thus PP adjunctions to NP in the maximum-likelihood parses using this PCFG always appear as Chomsky adjunctions, even though the original treebank uses a two-level representation!
    A large number of productions in the PCFG induced from sections 2-21 of the WSJ corpus are subsumed by higher-likelihood combinations of shorter, higher-probability productions.
    Of the 14,962 productions in the PCFG, 1,327 productions, or just under 9%, are subsumed by combinations of two or more productions.'
    Since the subsumed productions are never used to construct a maximum-likelihood parse, they can be ignored if only maximum-likelihood parses are required.
    Moreover, since these subsumed productions tend to be longer than the productions that subsume them, removing them from the grammar reduces the average parse time of the exhaustive PCFG parser used here by more than 9%.
    Finally, note that the overgeneration of the PCFG model of the two-
