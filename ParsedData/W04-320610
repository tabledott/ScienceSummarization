    Before presenting the acquisition method we first define its output.
    A template is a dependency parsetree fragment, with variable slots at some tree nodes (e.g.
    &#8216;X s+_ prevent &#65533; Y&#8217;).
    An entailment relation between two templates T1 and T2 holds if the meaning of T2 can be inferred from the meaning of T1 (or vice versa) in some contexts, but not necessarily all, under the same variable instantiation.
    For example, &#8216;X s+ prevent 0* Y&#8217; entails &#8216;X s+_ reduce -* Y risk&#8217; because the sentence &#8220;aspirin reduces heart attack risk&#8221; can be inferred from &#8220;aspirin prevents a first heart attack&#8221;.
    Our output consists of pairs of templates for which an entailment relation holds.
    The goal of this phase is to find a substantial number of promising anchor sets for each pivot.
    A good anchor-set should satisfy a proper balance between specificity and generality.
    On one hand, an anchor set should correspond to a sufficiently spec
