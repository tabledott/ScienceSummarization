 the primary focus of subsequent discourse; the first entity on this list is the preferred center, Cp(Un).
    Un actually centers, or is &amp;quot;about&amp;quot;, only one entity at a time, the backward-looking center, Cb(Un).
    The backward center is a confirmation of an entity that has already been introduced into the discourse; more specifically, it must be realized in the immediately preceding utterance, Un_.1.
    There are several distinct types of transitions from one utterance to the next.
    The typology of transitions is based on two factors: whether or not the center of attention, Cb, is the same from Un_1 to Un, and whether or not this entity coincides with the preferred center of Un.
    Definitions of these transition types appear in figure 1.
    These transitions describe how utterances are linked together in a coherent local segment of discourse.
    If a speaker has a number of propositions to express, one very simple way to do this coherently is to express all the propositions about a
