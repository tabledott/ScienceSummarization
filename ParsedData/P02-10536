an adjective or an adverb and the second provides context.
    First a part-of-speech tagger is applied to the review (Brill, 1994).3 Two consecutive words are extracted from the review if their tags conform to any of the patterns in Table 1.
    The JJ tags indicate adjectives, the NN tags are nouns, the RB tags are adverbs, and the VB tags are verbs.4 The second pattern, for example, means that two consecutive words are extracted if the first word is an adverb and the second word is an adjective, but the third word (which is not extracted) cannot be a noun.
    NNP and NNPS (singular and plural proper nouns) are avoided, so that the names of the items in the review cannot influence the classification.
    The second step is to estimate the semantic orientation of the extracted phrases, using the PMI-IR algorithm.
    This algorithm uses mutual information as a measure of the strength of semantic association between two words (Church &amp; Hanks, 1989).
    PMI-IR has been empirically evaluated using 80 syno
