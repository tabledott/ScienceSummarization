ficient per sample.
    Note that for split grammars, a posterior parse sample can be drawn by sampling a derivation and projecting away the substates.
    Fig.
    2 shows the results of the following experiment.
    We constructed 10-best lists from the full grammar G in Sec.
    2 using the parser of Petrov et al. (2006).
    We then took the same grammar and extracted 500-sample lists using the method of Finkel et al. (2006).
    The minimum risk parse candidate was selected for various loss functions.
    As can be seen, in most cases, risk minimization reduces test-set loss of the relevant quantity.
    Exact match is problematic, however, because 500 samples is often too few to draw a match when a sentence has a very flat posterior, and so there are many all-way ties.2 Since exact match permits a non-sampled calculation of the expected risk, we show this option as well, which is substantially superior.
    This experiment highlights that the correct procedure for exact match is to find the most probabl
