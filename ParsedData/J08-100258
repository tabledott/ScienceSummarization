es that we cannot further improve the accuracy simply by increasing the size of the training data set.
    The exploration of new types of features is necessary for higher accuracy.
    It should also be noted that the upper bound of the accuracy is not 100%, because the grammar cannot produce completely correct parse results for uncovered sentences.
    Figure 24 shows the accuracy for each sentence length.
    It is apparent from this figure that the accuracy is significantly higher for sentences with less than 10 words.
    This implies that experiments with only short sentences overestimate the performance of parsers.
    Sentences with at least 10 words are necessary to properly evaluate the performance of parsing real-world texts.
    The accuracies for the sentences with more than 10 words are not very different, although data points for sentences with more than 50 words are not reliable.
    Table 14 shows the accuracies for predicate&#8211;argument relations when partsof-speech tags are assigned auto
