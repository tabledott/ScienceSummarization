to the work in (Lita et al., 2003), we tag each word in a sentence with one of the tags: For training a given capitalizer one needs to convert running text into uniform case text accompanied by the above capitalization tags.
    For example, PrimeTime continues on ABC .PERIOD Now ,COMMA from Los Angeles ,COMMA Diane Sawyer .PERIOD The text is assumed to be already segmented into sentences.
    Any sequence labeling algorithm can then be trained for tagging lowercase word sequences with capitalization tags.
    At test time, the uniform case text to be capitalized is first segmented into sentences1 after which each sentence is tagged.
    A widespread algorithm used for capitalization is the 1-gram tagger: for every word in a given vocabulary (usually large, 100kwds or more) use the most frequent tag encountered in a large amount of training data.
    As a special case for automatic capitalization, the most frequent tag for the first word in a sentence is overridden by CAP, thus capitalizing on the fact that t
