    We will summarize the learning mechanism briefly in this section, but readers should refer to (Tsochantaridis et al., 2004) for more details.
    SVM learning is most easily expressed as a constrained numerical optimization problem.
    All constraints mentioned in this section are constraints on this optimizer, and have nothing to do with the cohesion constraint from Section 2.
    Traditional SVMs attempt to find a linear separator that creates the largest possible margin between two classes of vectors.
    Structured output SVMs attempt to separate the correct structure from all incorrect structures by the largest possible margin, for all training instances.
    This may sound like a much more difficult problem, but with a few assumptions in place, the task begins to look very similar to a traditional SVM.
    As in most discriminative training methods, we begin by assuming that a candidate structure y, built for an input instance x, can be adequately described using a feature vector IF(x, y).
