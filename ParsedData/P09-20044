e relation sense (Section 4) prediction tasks for explicit connectives in written text.
    For both tasks we report high classification accuracies close to 95%.
    2 Corpus and features In our work we use the Penn Discourse Treebank (PDTB) (Prasad et al., 2008), the largest public resource containing discourse annotations.
    The corpus contains annotations of 18,459 instances of 100 explicit discourse connectives.
    Each discourse connective is assigned a sense from a threelevel hierarchy of senses.
    In our experiments we consider only the top level categories: Expansion (one clause is elaborating information in the other), Comparison (information in the two clauses is compared or contrasted), Contingency (one clause expresses the cause of the other), and Temporal (information in two clauses are related because of their timing).
    These top-level discourse relation senses are general enough to be annotated with high inter-annotator agreement and are common to most theories of discourse.
