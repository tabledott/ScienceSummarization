;quot; a count of two, sufficient to be listed as the only hypernym for the cluster.
    It might be useful to have some stricter criterion for hypernyms, say, that they occur with a certain percentage of the nouns below them in the tree.
    Additional hypernym data would also be helpful in this case, and should be easily obtainable by looking for other patterns in the text as suggested by Hearst (1992).
    Because the tree is built in a binary fashion, when, e.g., three clusters should all be distinct children of a common parent, two of them must merge first, giving an artificial intermediate level in the tree.
    For example, in the current tree a cluster with best hypernym &amp;quot;agency&amp;quot; and one with best hypernym &amp;quot;exchange&amp;quot; (as in &amp;quot;stock exchange&amp;quot;) have a parent with two best hypernyms &amp;quot;agency/exchange&amp;quot; , rather than both of these nodes simply being attached to the next level up with best hypernym &amp;quot;group&amp;quot;.
