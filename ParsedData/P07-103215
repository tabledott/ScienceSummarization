 argument slot.
    In this example, if the lexical category of the preposition is PP/NP, then the second argument of (S[dcl]\NP)/PP maps to iobj; thus in The loss stems from several factors the relation between the verb and preposition is (iobj stems from).
    If the lexical category of the preposition is PP/(S[ng]\NP), then the GR is xcomp; thus in The future depends on building ties the relation between the verb and preposition is (xcomp depends on).
    There are a number of CCG dependencies with similar constraints, many of them covering the iobj/xcomp distinction.
    The second difficulty is that not all the GRs are binary relations, whereas the CCG dependencies are all binary.
    The primary example of this is to-infinitival constructions.
    For example, in the sentence The company wants to wean itself away from expensive gimmicks, the CCG parser produces two dependencies relating wants, to and wean, whereas there is only one GR: (xcomp to wants wean).
    The final row of Table 3 gives an example
