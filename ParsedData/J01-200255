show the combined value of the two inverse errors preceding it.'
    As with the word errors above, we see substantial differences between the base taggers.
    Unlike the situation with words, there are now a number of cases where base taggers perform better than the combiner.
    Partly, this is because the base tagger is outvoted to such a degree that its quality cannot be maintained, e.g., NN JJ.
    Furthermore, it is probably unfair to look at only one half of a pair.
    Any attempt to decrease the number of errors of type X --+ Y will tend to increase the number of errors of type Y X.
    The balance between the two is best shown in the &amp;quot;pair&amp;quot; rows, and 26 The tags are: CS = subordinating conjunction, IN = preposition, JJ =- adjective, NN = singular common noun, RP = adverbial particle, VB = base form of verb, VBD = past tense of verb, VBN =past participle.
    27 RP IN is not actually in any top seven, but has been added to complete the last pair of inverse errors. here the combiner
