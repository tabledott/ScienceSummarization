    Manually going through the output is not unreasonable, because each non-compositional expression has to be individually dealt with in a lexicon anyway.
    To find out the benefit of using the dependency relationships identified by a parser instead of simple co-occurrence relationships between words, we also created a database of the co-occurrence relationship between part-of-speech tagged words.
    We aggregated all word pairs that occurred within a 4-word window of each other.
    The same algorithm and similarity measure for the dependency database are used to construct a thesaurus using the co-occurrence database.
    Appendix B shows all the word pairs that satisfies the condition (3) and that involve one of the 10 words {have, company, make, do, take, path, lock, resort, column, gulf}.
    It is clear that Appendix B contains far fewer true non-compositional phrases than Appendix A.
  
  
    There have been numerous previous research on extracting collocations from cor
