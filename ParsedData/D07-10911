ns, such as lemmas instead of surface forms of words, can draw on richer statistics and overcome the data sparseness problems caused by limited training data.?
			Many aspects of translation can be best explained on a morphological, syntactic, or semantic level.
			Having such information avail able to the translation model allows the directmodeling of these aspects.
			For instance: re ordering at the sentence level is mostly driven word word part-of-speech OutputInput morphology part-of-speech morphology word class lemma word class lemma ......Figure 1: Factored representations of input and out put words incorporate additional annotation into the statistical translation model.
			by general syntactic principles, local agreement constraints show up in morphology, etc.Therefore, we extended the phrase-based ap proach to statistical translation to tightly integrate additional information.
			The new approach allows additional annotation at the word level.
			A word in our framework is not only a token, but a v
