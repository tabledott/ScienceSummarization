ining its possible senses (Navigli and Lapata, 2007).
    The Out-degree (outD) score for vertex v is the weighted sum of v&#8217;s outgoing edges, normalized by the number of other nodes in the graph.
    This measure captures only productivity, while the next three measures consider both productivity and popularity.
    The Total-degree (totD) score for vertex v is the weighted sum of both incoming and outgoing edges, normalized by the number of other nodes in the graph.
    The Betweenness (BT) score (Freeman, 1979) considers a vertex to be important if it occurs on many shortest paths between other vertices. where Qst is the number of shortest paths from s to t, and Qst(v) is the number of shortest paths from s to t that pass through vertex v. PageRank (Page et al., 1998) establishes the relative importance of a vertex v through an iterative Markov chain model.
    The PageRank (PR) score of a vertex v is determined on the basis of the nodes it is connected to. a is a damping factor that we set to 0.85.
