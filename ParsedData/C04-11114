erland and Charniak (1999) used similar pattern-based tech niques and other heuristics to extract meronymy (part-whole) relations.
			They reported an accuracy of about 55% precision on a corpus of 100,000 words.
			Girju et al (2003) improved upon Berland and Charniak's work using a machine learning filter.
			Mann (2002) and Fleischman et al (2003) used part of speech patterns to extract a subset of hyponym relations involving proper nouns.
			Our pattern-based algorithm differs from these approaches in two ways.
			We learn lexico-POS patterns in an automatic way.
			Also, the patterns are learned with the specific goal of scaling to the terascale (see Table 2).
			2.2 Co-occurrence-based approaches.
			The second class of algorithms uses co occurrence statistics (Hindle 1990, Lin 1998).
			These systems mostly employ clustering algo rithms to group words according to their meanings in text.
			Assuming the distributional hypothesis (Harris 1985), words that occur in similar gram matical contexts are simil
