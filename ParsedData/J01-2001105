 claims appear to be strongly supported by the present study.
    The two points are these: the generative view is that there is inevitably an idiosyncratic character to Universal Grammar that amounts to a substantive innate capacity, on the grounds (in part) that the task of discovering the correct grammar of a human language, given only the corpus available to the child, is insurmountable, because this corpus is not sufficient to home in on the correct grammar.
    The research strategy associated with this position is to hypothesize certain compression techniques (generally called &amp;quot;rule formalisms&amp;quot; in generative grammar) that lead to significant reduction in the size of the grammars of a number of natural languages, compared to what would have been possible without them.
    Sequential rule ordering is one such suggestion discussed at length in LSLT.
    To reformulate this in a fashion that allows us to make a clearer comparison with MDL, we may formulate early generative grammar in the
