o a cue word.
    Word2 is assigned the second lexical item if cue2 is true, NA otherwise.
    As with the pause features, the cue phrase features were motivated by previous results in the literature.
    Initial phrase position (cuei) was correlated with discourse signaling uses of cue words in Hirschberg and Litman (1993).
    A potential correlation between discourse signaling uses of cue words and adjacency patterns between cue words (cue2) was also suggested.
    Finally, Litman (1996) found that treating cue phrases individually rather than as a class (wordi, word2) enhanced the results of Hirschberg and Litman (1993).
    Two of the noun phrase (NP) features are hand coded, along with Functionally Independent Clause Units (FICUs; see below), following Passonneau (1994).
    The two authors coded independently and merged their results.
    Coding was performed on automatically created coding sheets for each narrative, consulting transcripts that were specially formatted to show prosodic phrase boundarie
