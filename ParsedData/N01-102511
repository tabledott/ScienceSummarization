rds, their part-of-speech tags as well as the chunk labels.
    More precisely, we give the following features to identify the chunk label for the-th word: Here,is the word appearing at-th position, is the POS tag of, and is the (extended) chunk label for-th word.
    In addition, we can reverse the parsing direction (from right to left) by using two chunk tags which appear to the r.h.s. of the current token ( ).
    In this paper, we call the method which parses from left to right as forward parsing, and the method which parses from right to left as backward parsing.
    Since the preceding chunk labels ( for forward parsing , for backward parsing) are not given in the test data, they are decided dynamically during the tagging of chunk labels.
    The technique can be regarded as a sort of Dynamic Programming (DP) matching, in which the best answer is searched by maximizing the total certainty score for the combination of tags.
    In using DP matching, we limit a number of ambiguities by applying beam searc
