, it probably would not have posited that &#8220;she&#8221; and &#8220;Clinton&#8221; are coreferent.
    The aforementioned Cardie and Wagstaff algorithm attempts to address this problem in a heuristic manner.
    It would be desirable to learn a model that can classify whether an NP to be resolved is coreferent with a preceding, possibly partially-formed, cluster.
    This model is commonly known as the entity-mention model.
    Since the entity-mention model aims to classify whether an NP is coreferent with a preceding cluster, each of its training instances (1) corresponds to an NP, NPk, and a preceding cluster, Cj, and (2) is labeled with either POSITIVE or NEGATIVE, depending on whether NPk should be assigned to Cj.
    Consequently, we can represent each instance by a set of cluster-level features (i.e., features that are defined over an arbitrary subset of the NPs in Cj).
    A cluster-level feature can be computed from a feature employed by the mention-pair model by applying a logical predicate.
