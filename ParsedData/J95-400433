uot; otherwise.'
    Below, we list the set of allowable transformations.
    Change the tag of an unknown word (from X) to Y if: 17 If we change the tagger to tag all unknown words as common nouns, then a number of rules are learned of the form: change tag to proper noun if the prefix is &amp;quot;E&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;A&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;B&amp;quot;, etc., since the learner is not provided with the concept of upper case in its set of transformation templates.
    The first 20 transformations for unknown words.
    An unannotated text can be used to check the conditions in all of the above transformation templates.
    Annotated text is necessary in training to measure the effect of transformations on tagging accuracy.
    Since the goal is to label each lexical entry for new words as accurately as possible, accuracy is measured on a per type and not a per token basis.
    Figure 6 shows the first 20 transformations learned for tagging unknown words in the Wall Street Journal corpus.
