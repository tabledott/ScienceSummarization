rk itself, and are obtained using gold standard POS tags.
    With automatically assigned POS tags, using the POS tagger of Curran and Clark (2003), the accuracies drop to 91.5% and 32.5%.
    An accuracy of 91&#8211;92% may appear reasonable given the large lexical category set; however, the low sentence accuracy suggests that the supertagger may not be accurate enough to serve as a front-end to a parser.
    Clark (2002) reports that a significant loss in coverage results if the supertagger is used as a front-end to the parser of Hockenmaier and Steedman (2002b).
    In order to increase the number of words assigned the correct category, we develop a CCG multitagger, which is able to assign more than one category to each word.
    Here yi is to be thought of as a constant category, whereas yj ( j =&#65533; i) varies over the possible categories for word j.
    In words, the probability of category yi, given the sentence, is the sum of the probabilities of all sequences containing yi.
    This sum can be cal
