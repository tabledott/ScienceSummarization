37 cases of repairs, the correct edit was found in 27 cases, while in 7 more an incorrect edit was found; in 3 cases no opinion was registered.
    While these numbers are quite promising, they may improve even more when information from syntax and semantics is combined with that from acoustics.
  
  
    A third source of information that can be helpful in detecting repairs is acoustics.
    In this section we describe first how prosodic information can help in distinguishing repairs from false positives for patterns involving matched words.
    Second, we report promising results from a preliminary study of cue words such as &amp;quot;no&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;well.&amp;quot; And third, we discuss how acoustic information can aid in the detection of word fragments, which occur frequently and which pose difficulty for automatic speech recognition systems.
    Acoustic features reported in the following analyses were obtained by listening to the sound files associated with each transcription, and by inspecti
