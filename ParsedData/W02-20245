 and Mayfield (2002) have applied support vector machines to the data of the shared task.
    Their system used many binary features for representing words (almost 9000).
    They have evaluated different parameter settings of the system and have selected a cascaded approach in which first entity boundaries were predicted and then entity classes (Spanish test set: F,3=1=60.97; Dutch test set: F,3=1=59.52).
    Black and Vasilakopoulos (2002) have evaluated two approaches to the shared task.
    The first was a transformation-based method which generated in rules in a single pass rather than in many passes.
    The second method was a decision tree method.
    They found that the transformation-based method consistently outperformed the decision trees (Spanish test set: F,3=1=67.49; Dutch test set: F,3=1=56.43) Tsukamoto, Mitsuishi and Sassano (2002) used a stacked AdaBoost classifier for finding named entities.
    They found that cascading classifiers helped improved performance.
    Their final system consi
