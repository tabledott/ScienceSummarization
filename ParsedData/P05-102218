development data.
    It is worth noting that developing feature schemata is much more of an art than a science, as adding or deleting a single schema usually does not have a significant effect on performance, yet the overall impact of many well-chosen schemata can be dramatic.
    Using the 50-best parser output described here, there are 1,148,697 features that meet the count threshold of at least 5 on the main training data (i.e., Penn treebank sections 2&#8211;21).
    We list each feature schema&#8217;s name, followed by the number of features in that schema with a count of at least 5, together with a brief description of the instances of the schema and the schema&#8217;s parameters.
    CoPar (10) The instances of this schema indicate conjunct parallelism at various different depths.
    For example, conjuncts which have the same label are parallel at depth 0, conjuncts with the same label and whose children have the same label are parallel at depth 1, etc.
