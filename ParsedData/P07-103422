 more on the set of labeled target instances, which is only a biased sample of the whole target domain.
    The POS data set and the CTS data set have previously been used for testing other adaptation methods (Daum&#180;e III and Marcu, 2006; Blitzer et al., 2006), though the setup there is different from ours.
    Our performance using instance weighting is comparable to their best performance (slightly worse for POS and better for CTS).
    In the third set of experiments, we assume that we do not have any labeled target instances.
    We tried two bootstrapping methods.
    The first is a standard bootstrapping method, in which we gradually added the most confidently predicted unlabeled target instances with their predicted labels to the training set.
    Since we believe that the target instances should in general be given more weight because they better represent the target domain than the source instances, in the second method, we gave the added target instances more weight in the objective function.
