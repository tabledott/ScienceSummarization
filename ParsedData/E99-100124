, 1998).
    The table in Figure 3 shows the progress of the performance of the system we fielded for the muc competition through the five stages.
    As one would expect, the sure-fire rules give very high precision (around 96-98%), but very low recall&#8212;in other words, they don't find many named entities, but the ones they find are correct.
    Subsequent phases of processing add gradually more and more named entities (recall increases from around 40% to around 90%), but on occasion introduce errors (resulting in a slight drop in precision).
    Our final score for ORGANISATION, PERSON and LOCATION is given in the bottom line of Figure 3.
  
  
    Our system fielded for the muc competition made extensive use of gazetteers, containing around 4,900 names of countries and other place names, some 30,000 names of companies and other organisations, and around 10,000 first names of people.
    As explained in the previous section, these lists were used in a judicious way, taking into account other internal an
