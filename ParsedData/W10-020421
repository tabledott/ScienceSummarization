 show that words marked as having a negative semantic orientation in the General Inquirer are mostly marked as negative by the Turkers.
    And similarly, the positives in GI are annotated as positive.
    Again, this is confirmation that the quality of annotation obtained is high.
    The EmoLexWAL rows show that anger, disgust, fear, and sadness terms tend not to have a positive semantic orientation and are mostly negative.
    In contrast, and expectedly, the joy terms are positive.
    The surprise terms are more than twice as likely to be positive than negative.
    In order to analyze how often the annotators agreed with each other, for each term&#8211;emotion pair, we calculated the percentage of times the majority class has size 5 (all Turkers agree), size 4 (all but one agree), size 3, and size 2.
    Table 10 presents these agreement values.
    Observe that for more than 50% of the terms, at least four annotators agree with each other.
    Table 11 gives agreement values at the twointensity level.
