p;quot;correct&amp;quot; analysis trees in a portion of the treebank held out for testing purposes.
    This study uses the 1,578 sentences in section 22 of the WSJ corpus of length 40 or less for this purpose.
    The labeled precision and recall figures are obtained by regarding the sequence of trees :f produced by a parser as a multiset or bag E(i-) of edges, i.e., triples (N r) where N is a nonterminal label and 1 and r are left and right string positions in yield of the entire corpus.
    (Root nodes and preterminal nodes are not included in these edge sets, as they are given as input to the parser).
    Relative to a test sequence of trees (here section 22 of the WSJ corpus) the labeled precision and recall of a sequence of trees f- with the same yield as are calculated as follows, where the n operation denotes multiset intersection.
    Thus, precision is the fraction of edges in the tree sequence to be evaluated that also appear in the test tree sequence, and recall is the fraction of edges in the tes
