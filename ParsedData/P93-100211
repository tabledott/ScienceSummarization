 and one French sentence, two English sentences and one French sentence, and one English sentence and two French sentences.
    We refer to these as 1:0, 0:1, 1:1, 2:1, and 1:2 sentence beads, respectively.
    For 1:1 sentence beads, we take where B ranges over beadings consistent with [E; F] and where p1:1 is the probability of generating a 1:1 sentence bead.
    To model 1:0 sentence beads, we use a similar equation except that we only use 1:0 word beads, and we do not need to sum over beadings since there is only one word beading consistent with a 1:0 sentence bead.
    We take Notice that n = I.
    We use an analogous equation for 0:1 sentence beads.
    For 2:1 sentence beads, we take Due to space limitations, we cannot describe the implementation in full detail.
    We present its most significant characteristics in this section; for a more complete discussion please refer to (Chen, 1993).
    We chose to model sentence length using a Poisson distribution, i.e., we took for some Aim, and analogously f
