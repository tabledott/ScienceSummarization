ion is an important stage that effectively reduces the number of argument candidates after the pruning stage.
  Given an argument candidate, an argu- ment identifier is a binary classifier that decides whether or not the candidate should be considered as an argument.
  To evaluate the influence of full parsing information in this stage, the candidate list used here is the outputs of the pruning heuristic applied on the gold-standard parse trees.
  The heuristic results in a total number of 323,155 positive and 686,887 negative examples in the training set, and 18,988 positive and 39,585 negative examples in the test set.
  Similar to the argument classification stage, the only difference between full parsing?
  and shallow parsing?based systems is in the construction of some features.
  Specifically, phrase type, head word, POS tag of the head word, path, and subcategorization features are approximated using chunks and clauses when the binary classifier is trained using shallow parsing information.
