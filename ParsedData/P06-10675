llmann et al., 1997) proposed a DP-based monotone search algorithm for SMT.
    Their proposed solution to address the necessary word reordering is to rewrite the input sentence such that it has a similar word order to the desired target sentence.
    The paper suggests that reordering the input reduces the translation error rate.
    However, it does not provide a methodology on how to perform this reordering.
    (Xia and McCord, 2004) propose a method to automatically acquire rewrite patterns that can be applied to any given input sentence so that the rewritten source and target sentences have similar word order.
    These rewrite patterns are automatically extracted by parsing the source and target sides of the training parallel corpus.
    Their approach show a statistically-significant improvement over a phrase-based monotone decoder.
    Their experiments also suggest that allowing the decoder to consider some word order permutations in addition to the rewrite patterns already applied to the source sen
