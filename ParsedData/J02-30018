es from the British National Corpus hand-labeled with these frame elements.
    This article presents our system in stages, beginning in Section 2 with a more detailed description of the data and the set of frame elements or semantic roles used.
    We then introduce (in Section 3) the statistical classification technique used and examine in turn the knowledge sources of which our system makes use.
    Section 4 describes the basic syntactic and lexical features used by our system, which are derived from a Penn Treebank&#8211;style parse of individual sentences to be analyzed.
    We break our task into two subproblems: finding the relevant sentence constituents (deferred until Section 5), and giving them the correct semantic labels (Sections 4.2 and 4.3).
    Section 6 adds higher-level semantic knowledge to the system, attempting to model the selectional restrictions on role fillers not directly captured by lexical statistics.
    We compare hand-built and automatically derived resources for providing this
