nce in details of the counting procedures described above.
    The verbs in group 1 had been used in an earlier study in which it was important to minimize noisy data (Stevenson and Merlo 1997a), so they generally underwent greater manual intervention in the counts.
    In adding group 2 for the classification experiment, we chose to minimize the intervention in order to demonstrate that the classification process is robust enough to withstand the resulting noise in the data.
    For group 2, the transitivity, voice, and VBN counts were done automatically without any manual intervention.
    For group 1, these three counts were done automatically by regular expression patterns, and then subjected to correction, partly by hand and partly automatically, by one of the authors.
    For transitivity, the adjustments vary for the individual verbs.
    Most of the reassignments from a transitive to an intransitive labelling occurred when the following noun was not the direct object but rather a measure phrase or a d
