f errors.
    This would determine whether the metrics are consistent in applying penalties, or whether they favor certain kinds of errors over others.
    For these trials, we generated the reference segmentation using a uniform distribution of segment sizes in the (15, 35) range.
    We picked this range because it has reasonably high segment size variation, but segment size does not dip below k. For the Average error score for Pk, Pk, and WD over 10 trials of 100 measurements each, shown by segment size distribution range.
    (a) False negatives were placed with probability 0.05 at each boundary; (b) false positives were placed with probability 0.05, uniformly distributed within each segment; and (c) both false negatives and false positives were placed with probability 0.05.
    (d) False negatives were placed with probability 0.25 at each boundary; (e) false positives were placed with probability 0.25, uniformly distributed within each segment; and (f) both false negatives and false positives were placed
