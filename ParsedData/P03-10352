rd sequence, in which each word belongs to one word type.
    For each word type, a channel model is used to estimate the generative probability of a character string given the word type.
    So there are multiple channel models.
    We shall show in this paper that our models provide a statistical framework to corporate a wide variety linguistic knowledge and statistical models in a unified way.
    We evaluate the performance of our system using an annotated test set.
    We also compare our system with several state-of-the-art systems, taking into account the fact that the definition of Chinese words often varies from system to system.
    In the rest of this paper: Section 2 discusses previous work.
    Section 3 gives the detailed definition of Chinese words.
    Sections 4 to 6 describe in detail the improved source-channel models.
    Section 8 describes the evaluation results.
    Section 9 presents our conclusion.
  
  
    Many methods of Chinese word segmentation have been proposed: reviews include
