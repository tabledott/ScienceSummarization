mance of an oracle, if allowed to choose the correct translation if it appears within the top-N in any language, would provide an upper bound for the performance of the combination methods.
    Results for such oracles are also reported in Table 6.
    The methods corresponding to &amp;quot;oracle-1&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;distance&amp;quot; are choosing from the same set of proposed targets, and the &amp;quot;distance&amp;quot; method achieves performance close to that of the oracle (77 vs. 82.8).
  
  
    This section investigates the effect of different pathway configurations on the performance of the final multi-path system by examining the following situations: The results of these experiments are shown in Table 8.3 3Key: en=English, pt=Portuguese, fr=French, it=Italian, es=Spanish, ro=Romanian, du=Dutch, no=Norwegian, de=German, da=Danish, cz=Czech, uk=Ukrainian, po=Polish, sr=Serbian, ru=Russian The data sets used in these experiments were approximately the same size as those used in the previous expe
