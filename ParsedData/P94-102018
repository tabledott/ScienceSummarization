dependent of the variables mapping to node c given the values of the variables mapping to node a.
    In the case of Model 4, Figure 1 graphically depicts the fact that the value of the morphological variable ending is conditionally independent of the values of all other contextual features given the sense tag of the ambiguous word.
    The Markov field depicted in Figure 1 is represented by an undirected graph because conditional independence is a symmetric relationship.
    But decomposable models can also be characterized by directed graphs and interpreted according to the semantics of a Bayesian network ([21]; also described as &amp;quot;recursive causal models&amp;quot; in [27] and [16]).
    In a Bayesian network, the notions of causation and influence replace the notion of conditional independence in a Markov field.
    The parents of a variable (or set of variables) V are those variables judged to be the direct causes or to have direct influence on the value of V; V is called a &amp;quot;response&amp;
