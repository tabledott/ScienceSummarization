 the training corpus, are used in the decision process as prior probabilities.
    For each test example, the evidence in its local context is combined in a Bayesian-type model of the probability of each sense, and the most probable sense is selected.
    Performance ranges from 77-84% correct on the test words, where a lower bound for performance based on always selecting the most frequent sense for the same words (i.e., the sense with the greatest prior probability) would yield 53-80% correct.
    Yarowsky (1994), building on his earlier work, designed a classifier that looks at words within &#177;k positions from the target; lemma forms are obtained through morphological analysis; and a coarse part-of-speech assignment is performed by dictionary lookup.
    Context is represented by collocations based on words or parts of speech at specific positions within the window or, less specifically, in any position.
    Also coded are some special classes of words, such as WEEKDAY, that might serve to distinguish a
