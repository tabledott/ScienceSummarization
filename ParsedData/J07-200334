ms their consequent item according to Example illustrating hybrid method for incorporating the LM.
    Numbers are negative the +LM parser.
    Note that the LM makes this &#8855; only approximately monotonic.
    This means that the enumeration of new items will not necessarily be best-first.
    To alleviate this problem, we stop the enumeration not as soon as an item falls outside the beam, but as soon as an item falls outside the beam by a margin of e. This quantity e expresses our guess as to how much the scores of the enumerated items can fluctuate because of the LM.
    A simpler approach, and probably better in practice, would be simply to set e = 0, that is, to ignore any fluctuation, but increase R and b to compensate.
    See Figure 9b for an example of cube pruning.
    The upper-left grid cell is enumerated first, as in the k-best example in Section 5.2, but the choice of the second is different, because of the added LM costs.
    Then, the third item is enumerated and merged with the first (unli
