nd combining the resulting alignments into one symmetrized alignment.
    From this symmetrized alignment, the lexicon probabilities as well as the so-called alignment templates are extracted.
    The latter are translation patterns which capture phrase-level translation pairs.
    The following evaluation criteria were used in the experiments: BLEU (Bilingual Evaluation Understudy): This score, proposed by Papineni et al. (2001), is based on the notion of modified n-gram precision, with n &#8712; {1,...,4}: All candidate unigram, bigram, trigram, and four-gram counts are collected and clipped against their corresponding maximum reference counts.
    The reference n-gram counts are calculated on a corpus of reference translations for each input sentence.
    The clipped candidate counts are summed and normalized by the total number of candidate ngrams.
    The geometric mean of the modified precision scores for a test corpus is calculated and multiplied by an exponential brevity penalty factor to penalize too
