ed the task to two kinds of relation extraction tasks and proposed a machine learning-based method which combines contextual clues and statistical clues.
    Their experimental results showed that the model using contextual clues improved the performance.
    However since the contextual information in a domain is specific, the model got by their approach can not easily converted to other domains.
    Choi et al. (2006) used an integer linear programming approach to jointly extract entities and relations in the context of opinion oriented information extraction.
    They identified expressions of opinions, sources of opinions and the linking relation that exists between them.
    The sources of opinions denote to the person or entity that holds the opinion.
    Another area related to our work is opinion expressions identification (Wilson et al., 2005a; Breck et al., 2007).
    They worked on identifying the words and phrases that express opinions in text.
    According to Wiebe et al. (2005), there are two t
