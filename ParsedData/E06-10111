drawn in the plane with none crossing.
    Sometimes a non-projective representations are preferred, as in the sentence in Figure 2.1 In particular, for freer-word order languages, non-projectivity is a common phenomenon since the relative positional constraints on dependents is much less rigid.
    The dependency structures in Figures 1 and 2 satisfy the tree constraint: they are weakly connected graphs with a unique root node, and each non-root node has a exactly one parent.
    Though trees are more common, some formalisms allow for words to modify multiple parents (Hudson, 1984).
    Recently, McDonald et al. (2005c) have shown that treating dependency parsing as the search for the highest scoring maximum spanning tree (MST) in a graph yields efficient algorithms for both projective and non-projective trees.
    When combined with a discriminative online learning algorithm and a rich feature set, these models provide state-of-the-art performance across multiple languages.
    However, the parsing algorith
