   The binomial confidence intervals give a sense of the spread of plausible population values around the test-set-based point estimates of accuracy.
    Where appropriate and interesting, we compare the accuracy of two specific models statistically with an exact Fisher test on the contingency table of correct and wrong responses given by the two models.
    This approach to significance testing is problematic in many respects, the most important being that we ignore dependencies in correct and wrong counts due to the fact that the algorithms are evaluated on the same test set (Dietterich 1998).
    More appropriate tests, however, would require access to the fully itemized results from the compared algorithms, whereas in most cases we only know the point estimate reported in the earlier literature.
    For similar reasons, we do not make significance claims regarding other performance measures, such as macro-averaged F. Other forms of statistical analysis of the results are introduced herein when they are us
