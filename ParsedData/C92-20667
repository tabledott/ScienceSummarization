			that tbe sum of the probabilities of all the rules that can be applied to any non-terminal nnotated with a stack is equal to one.
			More precisely if, VX E VN,Vp E VI: ~ p(xt..pl -~ A) = 1 A P(X \[..p\] --* A) should be interpreted as the probability that X\[..p\] is rewritten as A. A derivation starts from S associated with the empty stack (S\[$\]) and each level of the derivation must be validated by a production rule.
			The language of a SLIG is defined as follows: L = {w E VT~ \[ S\[$\]~w}.
			The probability of a derivation is defined as the prod- uct of tile probabilities of all individual rules involved (counting repetition) in the derivation, the derivation being validated by a correct configuration of the stack at each level.
			The probability of a sentence is then com- puted as the sum of the probabilities of all derivations of tile sentence.
			Following tile construction described in (Vijay- Shanker and Weir, 1991), given a LTAG, Glaa, we con- struct an equivalent LIG, G,ua.
