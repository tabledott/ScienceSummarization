  Syntactic Constraints on Paraphrases Extracted from Parallel Corpora
  
    We improve the quality of paraphrases extracted from parallel corpora by requiring that phrases and their paraphrases be the same syntactic type.
    This is achieved by parsing the English side of a parallel corpus and altering the phrase extraction algorithm to extract phrase labels alongside bilingual phrase pairs.
    In order to retain broad coverage of non-constituent phrases, complex syntactic labels are introduced.
    A manual evaluation indicates a 19% absolute improvement in paraphrase quality over the baseline method.
  
  
    Paraphrases are alternative ways of expressing the same information.
    Being able to identify or generate paraphrases automatically is useful in a wide range of natural language applications.
    Recent work has shown how paraphrases can improve question answering through query expansion (Riezler et al., 2007), automatic evaluation of translation and summarization by modeling alternative lexica
