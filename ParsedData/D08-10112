 are two challenging issues that make MT hypothesis alignment difficult.
    First, different hypotheses may use different synonymous words to express the same meaning, and these synonyms need to be aligned to each other.
    Second, correct translations may have different word orderings in different hypotheses and these words need to be properly reordered in hypothesis alignment.
    In this paper, we propose an indirect hidden Markov model (IHMM) for MT hypothesis alignment.
    The HMM provides a way to model both synonym matching and word ordering.
    Unlike traditional HMMs whose parameters are trained via maximum likelihood estimation (MLE), the parameters of the IHMM are estimated indirectly from a variety of sources including word semantic similarity, word surface similarity, and a distancebased distortion penalty, without using large amount of training data.
    Our combined SMT system using the proposed method gave the best result on the Chinese-to-English test in the constrained training track of
