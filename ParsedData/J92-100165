ed texts, such as newspaper articles.
    We have developed a substantial knowledge base for text processing, including a word sensebased lexicon that contains both core senses and dynamically triggered entries.
    We have also created a number of concept-cluster definitions describing common semantic contexts and a conceptual hierarchy that acts as a sense-disambiguated thesaurus.
    Our approach to word sense discrimination uses information drawn from the knowledge base and the structure of the text, combining the strongest, most obvious sense preferences created by syntactic tags, word frequencies, collocations, semantic context (clusters), selectional restrictions, and syntactic cues.
    To apply this information most efficiently, the approach introduces a preprocessing phase that uses preference information available prior to parsing to eliminate some of the lexical ambiguity and establish baseline preferences.
    Then, during parsing, the system combines the baseline preferences with preferences cre
