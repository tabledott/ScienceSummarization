Tjong Kim Sang, 2000a; Tjong Kim Sang et al., 2000).
    Our experiments achieve the accuracy of 93.76 94.11 for baseNP-S, and 95.29 - 95.34 for baseNPL even with a single chunk representation.
    In addition, by applying the weighted voting framework, we achieve accuracy of 94.22 for baseNP-S, and 95.77 for baseNP-L data set.
    As far as accuracies are concerned, our model outperforms Tjong Kim Sang&#8217;s model.
    In the CoNLL-2000 shared task, we achieved the accuracy of 93.48 using IOB2-F representation (Kudo and Matsumoto, 2000b) 5.
    By combining weighted voting schemes, we achieve accuracy of 93.91.
    In addition, our method also outperforms other methods based on the weighted voting(van Halteren, 2000; Tjong Kim Sang, 2000b).
    Applying to other chunking tasks Our chunking method can be equally applicable to other chunking task, such as English POS tagging, Japanese chunk(bunsetsu) identification and named entity extraction.
    For future, we will apply our method to those chunking tasks
