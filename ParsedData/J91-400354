two sentences in Example 58, and their relative prototypicality. a.
    The prisoner escaped last night. b.
    The prisoner ate dinner last night.
    Both of these sentences are obviously well-formed syntactically, but there is a definite sense that the predication in 58(a) is &amp;quot;tighter&amp;quot; or more prototypical than that in 58(b).
    What would account for such a difference?
    Intuitively, we associate prisoner with an escaping event more strongly than an eating event.
    Yet this is not information that comes from a fixed inheritance structure, but is rather usually assumed to be cornmonsense knowledge.
    In what follows, however, I will show that such distinctions can be captured within a theory of lexical semantics by means of generating ad hoc categories.
    First, we give a definition for the fixed inheritance structure of a lexical item (cf.
    Touretzky 1986).
    Let Q and P be concepts in our model of lexical organization.
    Then: Definition A sequence (Qi , PO is an inherit
