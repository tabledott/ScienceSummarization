    To improve the comparability of search hypotheses, we introduce heuristic functions.
    A heuristic function estimates the probabilities of reaching the goal node from a certain search node.
    An admissible heuristic function is always an optimistic estimate; that is, for each search node, the product of edge probabilities of reaching a goal node is always equal to or smaller than the estimated probability.
    For an A*-based search algorithm, a good heuristic function is crucial to being able to translate long sentences.
    For a beam search algorithm, the heuristic function has a different motivation.
    It is used to improve the scoring of search hypotheses.
    The goal is to make the probabilities of all hypotheses more comparable, in order to minimize the chance that the hypothesis leading to the optimal translation is pruned away.
    Heuristic functions for search in statistical MT have been used in Wang and Waibel (1997) and Och, Ueffing, and Ney (2001).
