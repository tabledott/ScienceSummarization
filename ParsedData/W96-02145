 included, even trivial ones corresponding to rules in a PCFG, novel sentences with unseen contexts Unfortunately, the number of subtrees is huge; therefore Bod randomly samples 5% of the subtrees, throwing away the rest.
    This significantly speeds up parsing.
    There are two existing ways to parse using the DOP model.
    First, one can find the most probable derivation.
    That is, there can be many ways a given sentence could be derived from the STSG.
    Using the most probable derivation criterion, one simply finds the most probable way that a sentence could be produced.
    Figure 3 shows a simple example STSG.
    For the string xx, what is the most probable derivation?
    The parse tree has probability i of being generated by the trivial derivation containing a single tree.
    This tree corresponds to the most probable derivation of xx.
    One could try to find the most probable parse tree.
    For a given sentence and a given parse tree, there are many different derivations that could lead t
