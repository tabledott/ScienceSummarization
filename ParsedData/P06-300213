 word&#8217;s suffix or its capitalization for OOV words.
    Here, we examine the effects of Compact Patricia Trie classifiers (CPT) trained on prefixes and suffixes.
    We use the implementation of (Witschel and Biemann, 2005).
    For OOV words, the category-wise product of both classifier&#8217;s distributions serve as probabilities P(ci|ti): Let w=ab=cd be a word, a be the longest common prefix of w that can be found in all lexicon words, and d be the longest common suffix of w that can be found in all lexicon words.
    Then
  
  
    We adopt the methodology of (Freitag 2004) and measure cluster-conditional tag perplexity PP as the average amount of uncertainty to predict the tags of a POS-tagged corpus, given the tagging with classes from the unsupervised method.
    Let be the mutual information between two random variables X and Y.
    Then the clusterconditional tag perplexity for a gold-standard tagging T and a tagging resulting from clusters C is computed as Minimum PP is 1.0, connoting a perfec
