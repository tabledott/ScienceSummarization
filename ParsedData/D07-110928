o be evidence for not just that sense and its immediate neighbors in the hyponomy tree but for all of the sense?s children and ancestors.
			Like McCarthy (2004), our unsupervised system acquires a single predominant sense for a domain based on a synthesis of information derived from a 1031textual corpus, topics, and WORDNET-derived sim ilarity, a probabilistic information content measure.
			By adding syntactic information from a thesaurusderived from syntactic features (taken from Lin?s au tomatically generated thesaurus (1998)), McCarthy achieved 48% accuracy in a similar evaluation onSEMCOR; LDAWN is thus substantially less effec tive in disambiguation compared to state-of-the-artmethods.
			This suggests, however, that other meth ods might be improved by adding topics and that ourmethod might be improved by using more informa tion than word counts.
	
	
			The LDAWN model presented here makes two contributions to research in automatic word sense disambiguation.
			First, we demonstrate a method for au tom
