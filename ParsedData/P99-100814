or each target, only 8% were parts, as opposed to the 55% for our program.
    We also compared out parts list to those of WordNet.
    Table 5 shows the parts of &amp;quot;car&amp;quot; in WordNet that are not in our top 20 (+) and the words in our top 20 that are not in WordNet (&#8212;).
    There are definite tradeoffs, although we would argue that our top20 set is both more specific and more comprehensive.
    Two notable words our top 20 lack are &amp;quot;engine&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;door&amp;quot;, both of which occur before 100.
    More generally, all WordNet parts occur somewhere before 500, with the exception of &amp;quot;tailfin&amp;quot;, which never occurs with car.
    It would seem that our program would be a good tool for expanding Wordnet, as a person can to the entire statistical NLP group at Brown, and scan and mark the list of part words in a few minutes. particularly to Mark Johnson, Brian Roark, Gideon Mann, and Ana-Maria Popescu who provided invaluable help on the project.
