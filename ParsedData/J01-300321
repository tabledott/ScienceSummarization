ation of unergatives (in contrast to analytic causativization) is a distributionally rarer phenomenon&#8212;found in fewer languages&#8212;than lexical causatives of unaccusatives.
    In asking native speakers about our verbs, we have found that lexical causatives of unergative verbs are not attested in Italian, French, German, Portuguese, Gungbe (Kwa family), and Czech.
    On the other hand, the lexical causatives are possible for unaccusative verbs (i.e., where the object is a Theme) in all these languages.
    Vietnamese appears to allow a very restricted form of causativization of unergatives limited to only those cases that have a comitative reading.
    The typological distribution test thus indicates that unergatives are more marked than unaccusatives in the transitive form.
    From these observations, we can conclude that unergatives (such as race) have the most marked transitive argument structure, unaccusatives (such as melt) have an intermediately marked transitive argument structure, and object
