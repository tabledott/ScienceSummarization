h information has been hedged in biomedical literature is an important subtask of information extraction because extracted information that falls in the scope of hedge cues cannot be presented as factual information.
    It should be discarded or presented separately with lower confidence.
    The amount of hedged information present in texts cannot be understimated.
    Vincze et al. (2008) report that 17.70% of the sentences in the abstracts section of the BioScope corpus and 19.44% of the sentences in the full papers section contain hedge cues.
    Light et al. (2004) estimate that 11% of sentences in MEDLINE abstracts contain speculative fragments.
    Szarvas (2008) reports that 32.41% of gene names mentioned in the hedge classification dataset described in Medlock and Briscoe (2007) appears in a speculative sentence.
    In this paper we present a machine learning system that finds the scope of hedge cues in biomedical texts.
    Finding the scope of a hedge cue means determining at sentence level which
