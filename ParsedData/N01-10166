whether a word token is edited.
    Our boosting classifier is directly based on the greedy boosting algorithm described by Collins [7].
    This paper contains important implementation details that are not repeated here.
    We chose Collins&#8217; algorithm because it offers good performance and scales to hundreds of thousands of possible feature combinations.
    This section describes the kinds of linear classifiers that the boosting algorithm infers.
    Abstractly, we regard each word token as an event characterized by a finite tuple of random variables (Y,X1,...,Xm).
    Y is the the conditioned variable and ranges over {&#8722;1, +1}, with Y = +1 indicating that the word is not edited.
    X1, ... , Xm are the conditioning variables; each Xj ranges over a finite set Xj.
    For example, X1 is the orthographic form of the word and X1 is the set of all words observed in the training section of the corpus.
    Our classifiers use m = 18 conditioning variables.
