fficulties dealing with the extracted, rather than annotated, CEs.
    CEAF assigns a zero score to each twinless extracted CE and weights all coreference chains equally, irrespective of their size.
    As a result, runs with extracted CEs exhibit very low CEAF precision, leading to unreliable scores. sion as above when ce has a twin, and computes the precision as 1/|RCe |if ce is twinless.
    (Similarly, recall(ce) = 1/|KC  |if ce is twinless.)
    The second option, B30, discards twinless extracted CEs, but penalizes recall by setting recall(ce) = 0 for all twinless annotated CEs.
    Thus, B30 presumes that all twinless extracted CEs are spurious.
    Results.
    Table 3, box 1 shows the performance of RECONCILEACL09 using a default (0.5) coreference classifier threshold.
    The MUC score is highest for the MUC6 data set, while the four ACE data sets show much higher B3 scores as compared to the two MUC data sets.
    The latter occurs because the ACE data sets include singletons.
