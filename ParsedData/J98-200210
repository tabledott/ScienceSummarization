different classes, e.g., bird is a member of both BIRD and MEAT.
    Thorough treatment of this problem is beyond the scope of the present paper; we simply note that one can employ an existing word-sense disambiguation technique (e.g.,Yarowsky 1992, 1994) in preprocessing, and use the disambiguated word senses as virtual words in the following case-pattern acquisition process.
    It is also possible to extend our model so that each word probabilistically belongs to several different classes, which would allow us to resolve both structural and word-sense ambiguities at the time of disambiguation.2 Employing probabilistic membership, however, would make the estimation process significantly more computationally demanding.
    We therefore leave this issue as a future topic, and employ a simple heuristic of equally distributing each word occurrence in the data to all of its potential word senses in our experiments.
    Since our learning method based on MDL is robust against noise, this should not significantly
