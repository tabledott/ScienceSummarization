a module like Nominator still requires considerable human effort to discover reliable heuristics, particularly when only minimal information is used.
    These heuristics are somewhat domain dependent: different generalizations hold for names of drugs and chemicals than those identified for names of people or organizations.
    In addition, as the heuristics depend on linguistic conventions, they are language dependent, and need updating when stylistic conventions change.
    Note, for example, the recent popularity of software names which include exclamation points as part of the name.
    Because of these difficulties, we believe that for the forseeable future, practical applications to discover new names in text will continue to require the sort of human effort invested in Nominator.
