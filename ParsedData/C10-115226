			We use ?mteval-v11b.pl?9 as the evaluation tool.
			CWand SW are used respectively as source and ref erence sentences.
			TSM obtains a very high BLEU score (0.38) but not as high as Moses (0.55).
			However, the original complex sentences (CW) from Normal Wikipedia get a rather high BLEU (0.50), when compared to the simple sentences.
			We also find that most of the sentences generated by Moses are exactly the same as those in CW:this shows that Moses only performs few modi fications to the original complex sentences.
			This is confirmed by MT evaluation measures: if we set CW as both source and reference, the BLEU score obtained by Moses is 0.78.
			TSM gets 0.55 in the same setting which is significantly smaller than Moses and demonstrates that TSM is able to generate simplifications with a greater amount of variation from the original sentence.
