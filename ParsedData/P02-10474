lly from two corpora: a corpus of 41,147,805 English sentences that have no annotations, and BLIPP, a corpus of 1,796,386 automatically parsed English sentences (Charniak, 2000), which is available from the Linguistic Data Consortium (www.ldc.upenn.edu).
    We study empirically the adequacy of various features for the task of discourse relation classification and we show that some discourse relations can be correctly recognized with accuracies as high as 93%.
  
  
    In order to build a discourse relation classifier, one first needs to decide what relation definitions one is going to use.
    In Section 1, we simply relied on the reader&#8217;s intuition when we claimed that a CONTRAST relation holds between the sentences in (1).
    In reality though, associating a discourse relation with a text span pair is a choice that is clearly influenced by the theoretical framework one is willing to adopt.
    If we adopt, for example, Knott and Sanders&#8217;s (1998) account, we would say that the relation between
