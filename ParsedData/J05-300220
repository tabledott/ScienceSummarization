    We also transform all passive-voice sentences to the active voice, changing the order of affected children.
    While the alignment algorithm described in Section 3.1.2 produces one-to-one mappings, in practice some paraphrases are not decomposable to words, forming one-to-many or many-to-many paraphrases.
    Our manual analysis of paraphrased sentences (Barzilay 2003) revealed that such alignments most frequently occur in pairs of noun phrases (e.g., faculty member and professor) and pairs including verbs with particles (e.g., stand up, rise).
