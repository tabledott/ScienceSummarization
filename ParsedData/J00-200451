bles in the experiment: method of translation and whether function words were included.
    Some applications, such as query translation for CUR, don't care about function words.
    To get a sense of the relative effectiveness of the different translation model estimation methods when function words are taken out of the equation, I removed from the gold standard all link tokens where one or both of the linked words were closed-class words.
    Then, I removed all closed-class words (including nonalphabetic symbols) from the models and renormalized the conditional probabilities.
    The method of translation was either single-best or whole distribution.
    Singlebest translation is the kind that somebody might use to get the gist of a foreignlanguage document.
    The input to the task was one side of the gold standard bitext.
    The output was the model's single best guess about the translation of each word in the input, together with the input word.
    In other words, each model produced link tokens cons
