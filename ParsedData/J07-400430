s ambiguity entirely, by defining exactly one normal-form derivation for each semantic equivalence class of derivations.
    The idea is to restrict the combination of categories produced by composition; more specifically, any constituent which is the result of a forward composition cannot serve as the primary (left) functor in another forward composition or forward application.
    Similarly, any constituent which is the result of a backward composition cannot serve as the primary (right) functor in another backward composition or backward application.
    Eisner only deals with a grammar without type-raising, and so the constraints cannot guarantee a normal-form derivation when applied to the grammars used in this article.
    However, the constraints can still be used to significantly reduce the parsing space.
    Section 9.3 describes the various normal-form constraints used in our experiments.
    A recent development in the theory of CCG is the multi-modal treatment given by Baldridge (2002) and Baldrid
