ut we also see that the guided models in all cases improve over their base parser and, in most cases, also over their guide parser.
    The general trend is that MST improves more than Malt, except for adjectives and conjunctions, where Malt has a greater disadvantage from the start and therefore benefits more from the guide features.
    Considering the results for parts of speech, as well as those for dependency length and root distance, it is interesting to note that the guided models often improve even in situations where their base parsers are more accurate than their guide models.
    This suggests that the improvement is not a simple function of the raw accuracy of the guide model but depends on the fact that labeled dependency decisions interact in inference algorithms for both graph-based and transition-based parsing systems.
    Thus, if a parser can improve its accuracy on one class of dependencies, e.g., longer ones, then we can expect to see improvements on all types of dependencies &#8211; as we
