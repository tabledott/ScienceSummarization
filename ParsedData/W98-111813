irst-name feature fires on &amp;quot;April&amp;quot;, the lexical and date-dictionary features for &amp;quot;April&amp;quot; will also fire and, assuming that the use of April as &amp;quot;date&amp;quot; exceeded the use of April as person_start or person_unique, we can expect that the lexical feature will have a high enough a value to outweigh the first-name-dictionary feature.
    This was confirmed in our test runs: no instance of &amp;quot;April&amp;quot; was tagged as a name, including one case, &amp;quot;The death of Ron Brown in April in a similar plane crash ...&amp;quot; which could be thought of as somewhat tricky because the month was not followed by a specific date.
    Note that the system isn't foolproof: if a &amp;quot;dangerous&amp;quot; dictionary word appeared in only one dictionary and did not appear often enough in the training corpus to be included in the vocabulary, but did appear in the test corpus, we would probably mistag it.
