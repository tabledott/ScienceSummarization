  From each foreign document and set of associated English documents, we take all possible sentence pairs and pass them through a word-overlap filter.
    The filter verifies that the ratio of the lengths of the two sentences is no greater than two.
    It then checks that at least half the words in each sentence have a translation in the other sentence, according to the dictionary.
    Pairs that do not fulfill these two conditions are discarded.
    The others are passed on to the parallel sentence selection stage.
    This step removes most of the noise (i.e., pairs of non-parallel sentences) introduced by our recall-oriented document selection procedure.
    It also removes good pairs that fail to pass the filter because the dictionary does not contain the necessary entries; but those pairs could not have been handled reliably anyway, so the overall effect of the filter is to improve the precision and robustness of the system.
    However, the filter also accepts many wrong pairs, because the word-overlap
