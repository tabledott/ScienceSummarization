f r of the type (A &#8212;* B C, s, m, e, i) is in the derivation y and 1 otherwise.
    This definition would lead to L(x, y, &#710;y) being the number of CFrule-tuples in y&#710; which are not seen in y.4 Finally, we define indicator variables I(x, y, r) which are 1 if r &#8712; R(x, y), 0 otherwise.
    We also define sets R(xi) = &#8746;yEG(xi)R(xi, y) for the training examples i = 1... n. Thus, R(xi) is the set of parts that is seen in at least one of the objects {(xi, y) : y &#8712; G(xi)}.
  
  
    The dual in Eq.
    3 involves variables &#945;i,y for all i = 1... n, y &#8712; G(xi), and the objective is quadratic in these &#945; variables.
    In addition, it turns out that the set of dual variables &#945;i = {&#945;i,y : y &#8712; G(xi)} for each example i is constrained to be non-negative and sum to 1.
    It is interesting that, while the parameters w lose their probabilistic interpretation, the dual variables &#945;i for each sentence actually form a kind of probability distribution.
