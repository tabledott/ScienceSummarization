he subjectivity annotated Romanian corpus and tested on the same gold standard as used in our experiments.
    Table 3 shows the results obtained in those experiments by using the high-coverage OpinionFinder classifier.
    Among our experiments, experiments two and three are closest to those proposed in (Mihalcea et al., 2007).
    By using machine translation, from English into Romanian (experiment two) or Romanian into English (experiment three), and annotating this dataset with the high-coverage OpinionFinder classifier, we obtain an F-measure of 63.69%, and 65.87% respectively, using Naive Bayes (the same machine learning classifier as used in (Mihalcea et al., 2007)).
    This implies that at most 4% in Fmeasure can be gained by using a parallel corpus as compared to an automatically translated corpus, further suggesting that machine translation is a viable alternative to devising subjectivity classification in a target language leveraged on the tools existent in a source language.
    As English is a l
