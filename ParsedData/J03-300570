extracted more accurately using POS tagging and chunking techniques.
    Finally, it will be crucial to test the usefulness of Web-based frequencies for realistic NLP tasks.
    Preliminary results are reported by Lapata and Keller (2003), who use Web counts successfully for a range of NLP tasks, including candidate selection for machine translation, context-sensitive spelling correction, bracketing and interpretation of compounds, adjective ordering, and PP attachment.
  
  
    This work was conducted while both authors were at the Department of Computational Linguistics, Saarland University, Saarbr&#168;ucken.
    The work was inspired by a talk that Gregory Grefenstette gave in Saarbr&#168;ucken in 2001 about his research on using the Web as a corpus.
    The present article is an extended and revised version of Keller, Lapata, and Ourioupina (2002).
    Stephen Clark and Stefan Riezler provided valuable comments on this research.
