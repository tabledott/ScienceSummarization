 sound novel, a moment's reflection on LISP implementation techniques should assure the reader that this structure is far less different from that of older parsers like Parsifal and Fidditch (Hindle 831 than it might sound.)
    As we shall see below, however, a parser which embodies IDtheory can recover (in some sense) from some of the constructions which would terminally confuse (or &amp;quot;garden path&amp;quot;) a parser based on the deterministic tree-building theory.
    For D-theory to be psychologically valid, of course, it must be the case that just those constructions which do garden path a Dtheory parser garden path people as well.
    (We might note in passing that recent experimental paradigms which explore online syntactic processing using eye-tracking technology promise to provide delicate tests of these hypotheses, e.g.
    (Rayner &amp; Frazier 831.)
    Another goal of this earlier work was to find some way of procedurally representing grammars of natural languages which is brief and perspi
