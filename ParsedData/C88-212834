  How- ever, the "tasks" placed on the agenda were at the same time more powerful (corresponding to unconstrained rewrite rules) and more pro- cedural (allowing register operations and other procedural constructs).
  This work merely applies the notion in the context of the simple declar- ative formalisms presupposed, and provides it with a logical founda- tion on which a proof of correctness can be developed.
  TM Because the formalisms are simpler, the agenda need only keep track of one type of task: addition of a chart item.
  7 Fur ther  Kesearch Perhaps the most immediate problem raised by the methodology for generation i troduced in this paper is the strong requirement of se- mantic monotonicity, which serves as yet another instance of the strait- jacket of compositionality, The semantic-monotonicity onstraint al- lows the goal logical form to be systematically decomposed so that a. dynamic-programming generation process can be indexed by the parts of the decomposition (the subformulas), just as the c
