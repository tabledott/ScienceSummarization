    Therefore, we need to insert an additional noun level, which also includes the adjuncts Dutch and publishing, which receive both the category N/N: However, because nominal compounds in the Treebank have no internal bracketing, we always assume a right-branching analysis, and are therefore not able to obtain the correct dependencies for cases such as (lung cancer) deaths.
    QPs (&#8220;quantifier phrases&#8221;) are another type of constituent where the Treebank annotation lacks internal structure: We use a number of heuristics to identify the internal structure of these constituents&#8212; for example, to detect conjuncts and prepositions.
