  When estimated using a 1.2 million word subset of the French Hansards, for example, the MProj measure alone achives 98.5% precision on 32.7% of the inflected French verbs in the corpus (constitut- ing 97.6% of the tokens in the corpus).
  Unlike traditional string- transduction-based morphology induction methods where irregular verbs pose the greatest challenges, these typically high-frequency words are often the best modelled data in the vocabulary making these multilingual projection techniques a natural complement
