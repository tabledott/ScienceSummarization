 whereas a log-linear model alone can only estimate probabilities where the category-conditioned probability distributions of the pre-defined inputs are in a restricted form of the exponential family (Bishop, 1995).
    2We use the cross-entropy error function, which ensures that the minimum of the error function converges to the desired probabilities as the amount of training data increases (Bishop, 1995).
    This implies that the minimum for any given dataset is an estimate of the true probabilities.
    We use the on-line version of Backpropagation to perform the gradient descent. are also input.
    If the explicit features include the previous decision and the other history representations include the previous history representation , then (by induction) any information about the derivation history could conceivably be included in .
    Thus such a model is making no a priori independence assumptions.
    However, some of this information is more likely to be included than other of this information, whi
