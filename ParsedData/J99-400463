 that could possibly follow w1 wn.
    Jelinek and Lafferty (1991) and Stolcke (1993) both give algorithms for computing these prefix probabilities.
    Elsewhere (Goodman 1998), we show how to produce an item-based description of a prefix parser.
    There are two main advantages to using an item-based description: ease of derivation, and reusability.
    First, the conventional derivations are somewhat complex, requiring a fair amount of inside-semiring-specific mathematics.
    In contrast, using item-based descriptions, we only need to derive a parser that has the property that there is one item derivation for each (complete) grammar derivation that would produce the prefix.
    The value of any prefix given the parser will then automatically be the sum of all grammar derivations that include that prefix.
    The other advantage is that the same description can be used to compute many values, not just the prefix probability.
    For instance, we can use this description with the Viterbi-derivation semirin
