ii) only the text word appears in a negative-polarity context, or (iii) only the hypothesis word does.
    Modality features.
    Modality features capture simple patterns of modal reasoning, as in ID 98, which illustrates the heuristic that possibility does not entail actuality.
    According to the occurrence (or not) of predefined modality markers, such as must or maybe, we map the text and the hypothesis to one of six modalities: possible, not possible, actual, not actual, necessary, and not necessary.
    The text/hypothesis modality pair is then mapped into one of the following entailment judgments: yes, weak yes, don&#8217;t know, weak no, or no.
    For example: (not possible |= not actual)?
    &#8658; yes (possible |= necessary)?
    &#8658; weak no Factivity features.
    The context in which a verb phrase is embedded may carry semantic presuppositions giving rise to (non-)entailments such as The gangster tried to escape 6|= The gangster escaped.
    This pattern of entailment, like others, can be
