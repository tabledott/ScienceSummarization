l to select an analysis.
			The model paramaters are estimated using a discriminative method, that is,one which requires all incorrect parses for a sentence as well as the correct parse.
			Since an auto matically extracted CCG grammar can produce anextremely large number of parses, the use of a su pertagger is crucial in limiting the total number of parses for the training data to a computationally manageable number.
			The supertagger is also crucial for increasing thespeed of the parser.
			We show that spectacular in creases in speed can be obtained, without affectingaccuracy or coverage, by tightly integrating the su pertagger with the CCG grammar and parser.
			To achieve maximum speed, the supertagger initially assigns only a small number of CCG categories toeach word, and the parser only requests more cate gories from the supertagger if it cannot provide an analysis.
			We also demonstrate how extra constraints on the category combinations, and the application of beam search using the parsing model, c
