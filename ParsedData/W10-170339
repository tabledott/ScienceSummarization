anual and automatic evaluation of machine translation performance for translating from European languages into English, and vice versa.
    The number of participants grew substantially compared to previous editions of the WMT workshop, with 33 groups from 29 institutions participating in WMT10.
    Most groups participated in the translation task only, while the system combination task attracted a somewhat smaller number of participants Unfortunately, fewer rule-based systems participated in this year&#8217;s edition of WMT, compared to previous editions.
    We hope to attract more rule-based systems in future editions as they increase the variation of translation output and for some language pairs, such as German-English, tend to outperform statistical machine translation systems.
    This was the first time that the WMT workshop was held as a joint workshop with NIST&#8217;s MetricsMATR evaluation initiative.
    This joint effort was very productive as it allowed us to focus more on the two evaluation di
