g that RU sees a large gain as it is a highly inflected language, making observations of lexical features far more sparse.
    Some languages, e.g., FR, NL, and ZH see much smaller gains.
    One likely culprit is a divergence between the tokenization schemes used in the treebank and in our unlabeled data, which for Indo-European languages is closely related to the Penn Treebank tokenization.
    For example, the NL treebank contains many multi-word tokens that are typically broken apart by our automatic tokenizer.
    The NER results, in terms of F1 measure, are listed in Table 4.
    Introducing word cluster features for NER reduces relative errors on the test set by 21% (39% on the development set) on average.
    Broken down per language, reductions on the test set vary from substantial for NL (30%) and EN (26%), down to more modest for DE (17%) and ES (12%).
    The addition of cluster features most markedly improve recognition of the PER category, with an average error reduction on the test set of 44%,
