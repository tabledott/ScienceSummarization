and hence constant growth property) of the languages generated.
    In considering the recognition of these languages, we were forced to be more specific regarding the relationship between the structures derived by these formalisms and the substrings they span.
    We insisted that each structure dominates a bounded number of (not necessarily adjacent) substrings.
    The composition operations are mapped onto operations that use concatenation to define the substrings spanned by the resulting structures.
    We showed that any system defined in this way can be recognized in polynomial time.
    Members of LCFRS whose operations have this property can be translated into the ILFP notation (Rounds, 1985).
    However, in order to capture the properties of various grammatical systems under consideration, our notation is more restrictive that ILFP, which was designed as a general logical notation to characterize the complete class of languages that are recognizable in polynomial time.
    It is known that CFG's, H
