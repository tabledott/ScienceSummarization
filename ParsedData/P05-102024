only rewards correct identification of coreferent links, B-CUBED additionally rewards successful recognition of noncoreference relationships.
    Second, the MUC scorer applies the same penalty to each erroneous merging decision, whereas B-CUBED penalizes erroneous merging decisions involving two large clusters more heavily than those involving two small clusters.
    Both of the above differences can potentially cause B-CUBED to assign a narrower range of Fmeasure scores to each set of 54 candidate partitions than the MUC scorer, for the following reasons.
    First, our candidate partitions in general agree more on singleton clusters than on non-singleton clusters.
    Second, by employing a non-uniform penalty function B-CUBED effectively removes a bias inherent in the MUC scorer that leads to under-penalization of partitions in which entities are over-clustered.
    Nevertheless, our B-CUBED results suggest that 6The rank of a partition is computed in the same way as in Section 3.2, except that we now ado
