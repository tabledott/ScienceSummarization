ften skewed to emphasize the differences between system outputs.
    In the tuning scenario, MERT optimizes translation quality with respect to the tuning metric.
    If a metric is biased (for example, assigning more weight to recall than precision), it will guide the MERT search toward pathological translations that receive lower scores across other metrics.
    Balanced between precision and recall, content and function words, and word choice versus fragmentation, the Tuning version of Meteor is significantly less susceptible to gaming.
    Chosen as the official submission for WMT 2011, we believe that this Tuning version of Meteor will further generalize to other tuning scenarios.
  
  
    We have presented Ranking, Adequacy, and Tuning versions of Meteor 1.3.
    The Ranking and Adequacy versions are shown to have high correlation with human judgments except in cases of overfitting due to skewed tuning data.
    We believe that these overfitting issues are lessened when tuning to combined 2009 and 2010
