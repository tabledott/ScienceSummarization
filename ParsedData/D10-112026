r to learn than others regardless of their frequency, so their presence in the specified ruleset yields stronger performance gains.
    Varying the Constraint Threshold In our main experiments we require that at least 80% of the expected dependencies satisfy the rule constraints.
    We arrived at this threshold by tuning on the basis of English only.
    As shown in Figure 2, for English a broad band of threshold values from 75% to 90% yields results within 2.5% of each other, with a slight peak at 80%.
    To further study the sensitivity of our method to how the threshold is set, we perform post hoc experiments with other threshold values on each of the other languages.
    As Figure 2 also shows, on average a value of 80% is optimal across languages, though again accuracy is stable within 2.5% between thresholds of 75% to 90%.
    These results demonstrate that a single threshold is broadly applicable across languages.
    Interestingly, setting the threshold value independently for each language to its &
