rization, information retrieval, and question answering.
			Our ultimate goal is to apply current SMT techniques to the problems of paraphrase recognition and generation.
			We feel that this is a natural extension of the body of recent developments in SMT; perhaps explorations in monolingual data may have a reciprocal impact.
			The field of SMT, long focused on closely aligned data, is only now beginning to address the kinds of problems immediately encountered in monolingual paraphrase (including phrasal translations and large scale reorderings).
			Algorithms to address these phenomena will be equally applicable to both fields.
			Of course a broad-domain SMT-influenced paraphrase solution will require very large corpora of sentential paraphrases.
			In this paper we have described just one example of a class of data extraction techniques that we hope will scale to this task.
