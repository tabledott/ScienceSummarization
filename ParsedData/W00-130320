their training and testing, they achieve around 87.2% accuracy by building statistical model based on Maximum Entropy framework.
    For the training data, we used exactly the same data that they used in order to make a fair comparison.
    In our experiments, the accuracy of 89.09% is achieved using same training data.
    Our model outperforms Uchimoto's model as far as the accuracies are compared.
    Although Uchimoto suggests that the importance of considering combination of features, in ME framework we must expand these combination by introducing new feature set.
    Uchimoto heuristically selects &amp;quot;effective&amp;quot; combination of features.
    However, such a manual selection does not always cover all relevant combinations that are important in the determination of dependency relation.
    We believe that our model is better than others from the viewpoints of coverage and consistency, since our model learns the combination of features without increasing the computational complexity.
