    This information goes to a pre-trained maximum entropy model (see Mikheev (1998) for more details on this aproach).
    This model takes into account contextual information for named entities, such as their position in the sentence, whether they exist in lowercase in general, whether they were used in lowercase elsewhere in the same document, etc.
    These features are passed to the model as attributes of the partially matched words.
    If the model provides a positive answer for a partial match, the system makes a definite assignment.
    Once this has been done, the system again applies the grammar rules.
    But this time the rules have much more relaxed contextual constraints and extensively use th
