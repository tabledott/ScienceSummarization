entific texts and also provide the right kind of information to enable the construction of better summaries for a practical application.
    Another requirement is that the analysis should be applicable to research articles from different presentational traditions and subject matters.
    For the development of our scheme, we used the chronologically first 80 articles in our corpus of conference articles in computational linguistics (articles presented at COLING, ANLP, and (E)ACL conferences or workshops).
    Because of the interdisciplinarity of the field, the papers in this collection cover a challenging range of subject matters, such as logic programming, statistical language modeling, theoretical semantics, computational dialectology, and computational psycholinguistics.
    Also, the research methodology and tradition of presentation is very different among these fields; (computer scientists write very different papers than theoretical linguists).
    We thus expect our analysis to be equally applicable
