 generation system that knows how grammatical relationships are actually expressed in English (or whatever the target language is).
    For example, it is the surface generator that knows what function words and word order relationships are used in English for imperative, interrogative, and negated sentences; it is the surface generator that knows which auxiliaries are required for the various English tenses; and it is the surface generator that knows when pronominalization is syntactically required (John scolded himself, not John scolded John). with (almost?) no backtracking The grammars and grammar representations used by the systems examined are quite different, but all systems process the grammars with a top-down algorithm that uses minimal, if any, backtracking.
    None of the systems use the semantic head-driven generation algorithm [Shieber et at., 1990], although this is probably the single best-known algorithm for surface generation; Elhadad [1992, chapter 4] claims that such an algorithm is only ne
