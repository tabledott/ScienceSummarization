nction kernel with parameters C, gamma, and epsilon tuned on a development set (305 training instances).
    The model was trained with 10-fold cross validation and the tuning process was restarted several times using different starting points and step sizes to avoid overfitting.
    The final model was selected based on its performance on the development set and the number of support vectors.
    UU (R, S): System &#8220;UU best&#8221; uses the 17 baseline features, plus 82 features from Hardmeier (2011) (with some redundancy and some overlap with baseline features), and constituency trees over input sentences generated by the Stanford parser and dependency trees over both input and output sentences generated by the MaltParser.
    System &#8220;UU bltk&#8221; uses only the 17 baseline features plus constituency and dependency trees as above.
    The machine learning component in both cases is SVM regression (SVMlight software).
    For the ranking task, the ranking induced by the regression output is used.
