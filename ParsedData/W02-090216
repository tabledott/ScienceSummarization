in Section 2.1.
    It consists of 1339 entries, of which are (88.9%) correct according to the existing bilingual lexicon.
    Due to computational constraints,6 we focus on the additional mapping of only 1,000 German and English words.
    These 1,000 words are chosen from the 1,000 most frequent lexicon entries in the dictionary, without duplications of words.
    This frequency is defined by the sum of two word frequencies of the words in the entry, as found in the monolingual corpora.
    We did not collect statistics of the actual use of lexical entries in, say, a parallel corpus.
    In a different experimental set-up we also simply tried to match the 1,000 most frequent German words with the 1,000 most frequent English words.
    The results do not differ significantly.
    Each of the four clues described in the Sections 2.2 to 2.5 provide a matching score between a German and an English word.
    The likelihood of these two words being actual translations of each other should correlate to these score
