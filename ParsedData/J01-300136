ne sense for each ambiguous word in the sentence without any indication of the system's confidence in its choice, but we adapted the system to return a set of suggested senses for each ambiguous word in the sentence.
    Our next partial tagger returns the set of senses for each word that is licensed by selectional preferences (in the sense of Wilks 1975).
    LDOCE senses are marked with selectional restrictions expressed by 36 semantic codes not ordered in a hierarchy.
    However, the codes are clearly not of equal levels of generality; for example, the code H is used to represent all humans, while M represents human males.
    Thus for a restriction with type H, we would want to allow words with the more specific semantic class M to meet it.
    This can be computed if the semantic categories are organized into a hierarchy.
    Then all categories subsumed by another category will be regarded as satisfying the restriction.
    Bruce and Guthrie (1992) manually identified relations between the LDOCE semant
