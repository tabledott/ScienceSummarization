rminal symbols in the synchronous grammar.
    As an alternative way to relax strict parser-based constituency requirements, they explore the use of phrases spanning generalized, categorial-style constituents in the parse tree, e.g. type NP/NN denotes a phrase like the great that lacks only a head noun (say, wall) in order to comprise an NP.
    In addition, various researchers have explored the use of hard linguistic constraints on the source side, e.g. via &#8220;chunking&#8221; noun phrases and translating them separately (Owczarzak et al., 2006), or by performing hard reorderings of source parse trees in order to more closely approximate target-language word order (Wang et al., 2007a; Collins et al., 2005).
    Finally, another soft-constraint approach that can also be viewed as coming from the data-driven side, adding syntax, is taken by Riezler and Maxwell (2006).
    They use LFG dependency trees on both source and target sides, and relax syntactic constraints by adding a &#8220;fragment grammar&#8221;
