 all adjectives which share a sentence with the topic of the text.
    TOPIC-sentence POT The average POT value of all adjectives which share a sentence with the topic of the text.
    TOPIC-sentence ACT The average ACT value of all adjectives which share a sentence with the topic of the text.
    The grouping of these classes should reflect some common degree of reliability of features within a given class, but due to data sparseness what might have been more natural class groupings&#8212;for example including value-phrase preposition topicentity as a distinct class&#8212;often had to be conflated in order to get features with enough occurrences to be representative.
    For each of these classes a value may be derived for a text.
    Representing each text as a vector of these real-valued features forms the basis for the SVM model.
    In the case of data for which no explicit topic information is available, only the Turney value is used from the first list, and the Text-wide EVA, POT, and ACT values from t
