mined, using heuristics adapted from Magerman (1994) and Collins (1999), which take the label of a node and its parent into account.6 We assume that NP daughters of VPs are complements, unless they carry a function tag such as -LOC, -DIR, -TMP, and so on, but treat all PPs as adjuncts unless they carry the -CLR function tag.
    In our example, we therefore treat passing as transitive, even though it should subcategorize for the PP: This binarization process inserts dummy nodes into the tree such that all children to the left of the head branch off in a right-branching tree, and then all children to the right of the head branch off in a left-branching tree.7 We assign CCG categories to the nodes in this binary tree in the following manner: 4.3.1 The Root Node.
    The category of the root node is determined by the label of the root of the Treebank tree (e.g., {VP} &#8594; S\NP, {S, SINV, SQ} &#8594; S).8 If the root node has the category S, it typically carries a feature that distinguishes different types of
