ature has a 5-8% negative effect on performance, again similar to the cross-validation results.
    (Although note that the precise accuracy achieved is not the same in each case as with 10-fold cross-validation, indicating that there is some sensitivity to the precise make-up of the training set when using a subset of the features.)
    Table 12 presents the results of the single hold-out experiments in terms of performance within each class, using an F measure with balanced precision and recall.'
    The first line of the table shows clearly that, using all five features, the unergatives are classified with greater accuracy (F 73.9%) than the unaccusative and object-drop verbs (F scores of 68.6% and 64.9%, respectively).
    The features appear to be better at distinguishing unergatives than the other two verb classes.
    The remaining lines of Table 12 show that this pattern holds for all of the subsets of features as well.
    Clearly, future work on our verb classification task will need to focus on det
