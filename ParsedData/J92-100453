nted to keep the natural language component tightly restricted to sentences with a likely overall success.
    In this way we were able to increase the coverage of an independent test set of 560 utterances from 69% to 76%, with a corresponding increase in perplexity, as shown in Table 3.
    Perplexity was quite low even without probabilities; this is due mainly to an extensive semantic filtering scheme.
    Probabilities decreased the perplexity by a factor of three, however, which is still quite significant.
    An encouraging result was that both perplexity and coverage were of comparable values for the training and test sets, as shown in the table.
    As mentioned previously, generation mode has been a very useful device for detecting overgeneralization problems in a grammar.
    After the addition of a number of semantically loaded nodes and semantic filters, the VOYAGER version of the grammar is now restricted mainly to sentences that are semantically as well as syntactically legitimate.
