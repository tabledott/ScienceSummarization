orm distribution over .
    We experimented several schemes of approximation, including a uniform distribution, and (4) worked the best and is adopted here.
    One may consider training directly and use it to score paths in the Bell tree.
    The problem is that 1) the size of from which takes value is variable; 2) the start action depends on all entities in , which makes it difficult to train directly.
  
  
    As shown in Section 2, the search space of the coreference problem can be represented by the Bell tree.
    Thus, the search problem reduces to creating the Bell tree while keeping track of path scores and picking the top-N best paths.
    This is exactly what is described in Algorithm 1.
    In Algorithm 1, contains all the hypotheses, or paths from the root to the current layer of nodes.
    Variable stores the cumulative score for a coreference result .
    At line 1, is initialized with a single entity consisting of mention , which corresponds to the root node of the Bell tree in Figure 1.
