default label, which leads to a drop in labeled attach ment score.
			For English, however, empty stack initialization did not improve accuracy despite the fact that dependencies from the artificial root have a unique label.
			5This technique is similar to the one used by Yamada and Matsumoto (2003), but with only a single post-processing pass parsing complexity remains linear in string length.

			figure is 10% or less.6 The cumulative improvement after optimization of parsing algorithm parameters was a modest 0.32 percentage points on average over all ten languages, with a minimum of 0.00 (Arabic, English) and a maximum of 0.83 (Czech) (cf.
