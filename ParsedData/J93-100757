    Without him this evaluation would not have been possible. us to evaluate the performances of the third stage of Xtract and the overall quality of the total output of Xtract in a single experiment.
    The experiment was as follows: We gave the 4,000 collocations to evaluate to the lexicographer, asking him to select the ones that he would consider for a domain-specific dictionary and to cross out the others.
