    We use the universal POS tagset of Petrov et al. (2011) in our experiments.10 This set C consists of the following 12 coarse-grained tags: NOUN (nouns), VERB (verbs), ADJ (adjectives), ADV (adverbs), PRON (pronouns), DET (determiners), ADP (prepositions or postpositions), NUM (numerals), CONJ (conjunctions), PRT (particles), PUNC (punctuation marks) and X (a catch-all for other categories such as abbreviations or foreign words).
    While there might be some controversy about the exact definition of such a tagset, these 12 categories cover the most frequent part-of-speech and exist in one form or another in all of the languages that we studied.
    For each language under consideration, Petrov et al. (2011) provide a mapping A from the fine-grained language specific POS tags in the foreign treebank to the universal POS tags.
    The supervised POS tagging accuracies (on this tagset) are shown in the last row of Table 2.
    The taggers were trained on datasets labeled with the universal tags.
