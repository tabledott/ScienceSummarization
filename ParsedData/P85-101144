  Since BI satisfies the requirement, it is simple to obasrve that the nodes in ~1 will, even after the adjunctiou of ~1 in "at.
  However, because the quadruple associated with X I are different, the quadruples of the nodes above X t" must reflect this cbuge.
  It is easy to check the existence of an anxKinr?
  tree such that the nodes above X t satisfy the requirements a s ta~l  above.
  It can alan be argued am the basis of the design of g ramme GI, that there exisu trees which ailow this new auxiliary tree to be adjoined ~t the appropriate place.
  This then allows us to conclude that there exmt a derived tree for etch derived tree beiongin to D(~) as in our claim.
