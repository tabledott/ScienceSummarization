e indexed by the heads of potential antecedents, such that the entry for noun N contains the index of the last occurrence of an antecedent with head N. Finally, we considered combinations of segmentation and recency.
    (The results of these two heuristics are compared in Section 5.2.
    In general, however, when matching a definite description with a potential antecedent the information provided by the prenon-tinal and the postnominal part of the noun phrases also has to be taken into account.
    For example, a blue car cannot serve as the antecedent for the red car, or the house on the left for the house on the right.
    In our corpus, cases of antecedents that would incorrectly match by simply matching heads without regarding premodificatiort include: Vieira and Poesio Processing Definite Descriptions Again, taking proper account of the semantic contribution of these premodifiers would, in general, require commonsense reasoning.
    For the moment, we only developed heuristic solutions to the problem,
