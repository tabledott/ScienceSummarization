ted network.
			Ideally, the network would include the entire dictionary, but for practical reasons we limit the number of repetitions and thus restrict tile size of the network to a few thousand nodes and 10 to 20 thousand transitions.
			All words in the network are reduced to their lemmas, and grammatical words are excluded.
			The different sense nodes tor a given word are interconnected by lateral inhibitory links.

			Inhibitory Link When the network is run, the input word nodes are activated first.
			Then each input word node sends activation to its sense nodes, which in turn send activation to the word nodes to which they are connected, and so on throughout he network for a number of cycles.
			At each cycle, word and sense nodes receive feedback from connected nodes.
			Competing sense nodes send inhibition to one another.
			Feedback and inhibition cooperate in a "wi
