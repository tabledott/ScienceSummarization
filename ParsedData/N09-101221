hat the model will only start to ignore the backoff distribuOur first experiments examine smoothing the distributions over an argument in the DMV and EVG models.
    In DMV we smooth the probability of argument A given head part-of-speech H and direction d with a distribution that ignores H. In EVG, which conditions on H, d and argument position v we back off two ways.
    The first is to ignore v and use backoff conditioning event H, d. This yields a backoff distribution with the same conditioning information as the argument distribution from DMV.
    We call this EVG smoothed-skip-val.
    The second possibility is to have the backoff distribution ignore the head part-of-speech H and use backoff conditioning event v, d. This assumes that arguments share a common distribution across heads.
    We call this EVG smoothed-skip-head.
    As we see below, backing off by ignoring the part-ofspeech of the head H worked better than ignoring the argument position v. For L-EVG we smooth the argument part-ofspeech dist
