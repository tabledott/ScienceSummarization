rvations and discusses a sample of the observations table collected from the Brown corpus.
    Lerner identifies verbs in two stages, each carried out on a separate pass through the corpus.
    First, strings that sometimes occur as verbs are identified.
    Second, occurrences of those strings in context are judged as likely or unlikely to be verbal occurrences.
    The second stage is necessary because of lexical ambiguity.
    The first stage uses the fact that all English verbs can occur both with and without the suffix -ing.
    Words are taken as potential verbs if and only if they display this alternation in the corpus.2 There are a few words that meet this criterion but do not occur as verbs, including income/incoming (*incame/incomed), ear/earring, her/herring, and middle/middling.
    However, the second stage of verb detection, combined with the statistical criteria, prevent these pairs from introducing errors.
    Lerner assumes that a potential verb is functioning as a verb unless the context sug
