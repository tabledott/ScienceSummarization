tion can be used to design a shallow semantic representation that can be matched against other semantically similar sentences, e.g.
    [ARG0 Researchers] [rel describe] [ARG1 antigens] [ARG2 as foreign molecules] [ARGM&#8722;LOC in For this purpose, we can represent the above annotated sentences using the tree structures described in Figure 1.
    In this compact representation, hereafter Predicate-Argument Structures (PAS), arguments are replaced with their most important word &#8211; often referred to as the semantic head.
    This reduces data sparseness with respect to a typical BOW representation.
    However, sentences rarely contain a single predicate; it happens more generally that propositions contain one or more subordinate clauses.
    For instance let us consider a slight modification of the first sentence: &#8220;Antigens were originally defined as non-self molecules which bound specifically to antibodies2.&#8221; Here, the main predicate is &#8220;defined&#8221;, followed by a subordinate predi
