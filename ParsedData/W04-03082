the input (Abney, 1991; Daelemans et al., 1999).
    But since they normally output a sequence of unconnected phrases or chunks, they fail to satisfy the constraint of incrementality for a different reason.
    Deterministic dependency parsing has recently been proposed as a robust and efficient method for syntactic parsing of unrestricted natural language text (Yamada and Matsumoto, 2003; Nivre, 2003).
    In some ways, this approach can be seen as a compromise between traditional full and partial parsing.
    Essentially, it is a kind of full parsing in that the goal is to build a complete syntactic analysis for the input string, not just identify major constituents.
    But it resembles partial parsing in being robust, efficient and deterministic.
    Taken together, these properties seem to make dependency parsing suitable for incremental processing, although existing implementations normally do not satisfy this constraint.
    For example, Yamada and Matsumoto (2003) use a multipass bottom-up algorithm,
