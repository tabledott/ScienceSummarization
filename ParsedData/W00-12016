    The probability of an entire parse tree is the product of the probabilities of generating all of the elements of that parse tree, The hidden nonterminal +BEGIN+ is used to provide a convenient mechanism for determining the initial probability of the underlying Markov process generating the modifying nonterminals; the hidden nonterminal +END+ is used to provide consistency to the underlying Markov process, i.e., so
