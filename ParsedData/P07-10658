sure that the actual quantised count cannot be larger than this value.
    As the counts are quantised logarithmically, the counter will be incremented only a small number of times.
    The training and testing routines are given here as Algorithms 1 and 2 respectively.
    Errors for the log-frequency BF scheme are onesided: frequencies will never be underestimated.
    Algorithm 2 Test frequency BF Input: x, MAXQCOUNT, {h1, ...hk} and BF Output: Upper bound on qc(x) &#8712; Strain for j = 1 to MAXQCOUNT do for i = 1 to k do The probability of overestimating an item&#8217;s frequency decays exponentially with the size of the overestimation error d (i.e. as fd for d &gt; 0) since each erroneous increment corresponds to a single false positive and d such independent events must occur together.
    The error analysis in Section 2 focused on the false positive rate of a BF; if we deploy a BF within an SMT decoder, however, the actual error rate will also depend on the a priori membership probability of items pre
