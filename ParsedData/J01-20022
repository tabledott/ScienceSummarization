rficial) information, as well as limited resources for reasoning with that information, such language models tend to make errors when the system is tested on new material.
    The engineering task in NLP is to design systems that make as few errors as possible with as little effort as possible.
    Common ways to reduce the error rate are to devise better representations of the problem, to spend more time on encoding language knowledge (in the case of hand-crafted systems), or to find more training data (in the case of data-driven systems).
    However, given limited resources, these options are not always available.
    Rather than devising a new representation for our task, in this paper, we combine different systems employing known representations.
    The observation that suggests this approach is that systems that are designed differently, either because they use a different formalism or because they contain different knowledge, will typically produce different errors.
    We hope to make use of this fac
