em seemed to benefit from a heuristic that captured the most confident links before considering less confident ones, and also made use of the information in the guidelines in a slightly more refined manner than other systems.
    They also included appositives and copular constructions in their calculations.
    Although OntoNotes does not count those as instances of IDENT coreference, using that information may have helped their system discover additional useful links.
    &#8226; It is interesting to note that the developers of the lee system also did the experiment of running their system using gold standard information on the individual layers, rather than automatic model predictions.
    The somewhat surprising result was that using perfect information for the other layers did not end up improving coreference performance much, if at all.
    It is not clear whether this means that: i) Automatic predictors for the individual layers are accurate enough already; ii) Information captured by those supplementa
