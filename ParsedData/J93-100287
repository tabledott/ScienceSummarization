ears to be most relevant.
    Integrating a probabilistic ranking of the resultant logical forms with the probabilistic ranking of the distinct syntactic analyses presents no problems, in principle.
    However, once again, the acquisition of the relevant statistical information will be difficult, because it will require considerable quantities of analyzed text as training material.
    One way to ameliorate the problem might be to reduce the size of the 'vocabulary' for which statistics need to be gathered by replacing lexical items with their superordinate terms (or a disjunction of such terms in the case of ambiguity).
    Copestake (1990, 1992) describes a program capable of extracting the genus term of a definition from an LDOCE definition, resolving the sense of such terms, and constructing hierarchical taxonomies of the resulting word senses.
    Taxonomies of this form might be used to replace PP complement heads and postmodified heads in corpus data with a smaller number of superordinate concepts.
