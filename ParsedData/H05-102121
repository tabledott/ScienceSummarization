			4.2 Scaling to Large Bitext Training Sets.
			We here describe the integration of the phrase re ordering model in an MT system trained on largebitexts.
			The text processing and language models have been described in ? 4.1.
			Alignment Mod els are trained on all available bitext (7.6M chunk pairs/207.4M English words/175.7M Chinese words on C-E and 5.1M chunk pairs/132.6M English words/123.0M Arabic words on A-E), and word alignments are obtained over the bitext.
			Phrase-pairs are then extracted from the word alignments (Koehn et al, 2003).
			MJ-1 model parameters are estimated over all bitext on A-E and
