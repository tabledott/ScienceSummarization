achine Translation 4.1.1 Alignment Template Selection.
    To score the use of an alignment template, we use the probability p(z  |f&#732;) defined in Section 3.
    We establish a corresponding feature Here, j&#960;k&#8722;1 + 1 is the position of the first word of alignment template zk in the source language sentence and j&#960;k is the position of the last word of that alignment template.
    Note that this feature function requires that a translation of a new sentence be composed of a set of alignment templates that covers both the source sentence and the produced translation.
    There is no notion of &#8220;empty phrase&#8221; that corresponds to the &#8220;empty word&#8221; in word-based statistical alignment models.
    The alignment on the phrase level is actually a permutation, and no insertions or deletions are allowed.
    4.1.2 Word Selection.
    For scoring the use of target language words, we use a lexicon probability p(e  |f), which is estimated using relative frequencies as described in Sect
