 5 and increases by 5 at each iteration.)
    The first modification &#8212; cautiousness &#8212; is a relatively minor change.
    It was motivated by the observation that the (Yarowsky 95) algorithm added a very large number of rules in the first few iterations.
    Taking only the highest frequency rules is much &amp;quot;safer&amp;quot;, as they tend to be very accurate.
    This intuition is born out by the experimental results.
    The second modification is more important, and is discussed in the next section.
    An important reason for separating the two types of features is that this opens up the possibility of theoretical analysis of the use of unlabeled examples.
    (Blum and Mitchell 98) describe learning in the following situation: X = X1 X X2 where X1 and X2 correspond to two different &amp;quot;views&amp;quot; of an example.
    In the named entity task, X1 might be the instance space for the spelling features, X2 might be the instance space for the contextual features.
    By this assumption
