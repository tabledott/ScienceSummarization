the mention count number associated with each candidate NP, which is used to obtain P(ajma).
    The four probabilities are multiplied together.
    The procedure is repeated for each proposed NP in W and the one with the highest combined probability is selected as the antecedent.
  
  
    The algorithm has two modules.
    One collects the statistics on the training corpus required by equation (8) and the other uses these probabilities to resolve pronouns in the test corpus.
    Our data consists of 93,931 words (3975 sentences) and contains 2477 pronouns, 1371 of which are singular (he, she and it).
    The corpus is manually tagged with reference indices and referents' repetition numbers.
    The result presented here is the accuracy of the program in finding antecedents for he, she, and it and their various forms (e.g. him, his, himself, etc.)
    The cases where &amp;quot;it&amp;quot; is merely a dummy subject in a cleft sentence (example 1) or has conventional unspecified referents (example 2) are excl
