e we wanted models that were capable of modelling properties of the whole string; though in English and in other European languages, local statistics such as those used by n-gram models are adequate to capture most morphological regularities, in other languages this is not the case.
    Moreover, we wish to have comparatively weak models otherwise the algorithm will capture irrelevant orthotactic regularities &#8212; such as a class of words starting with &amp;quot;st&amp;quot; in English.
    In addition we can modify this to incorporate information about frequency.
    We know that rare words are more likely to be nouns, proper nouns or members of some other open word class rather than say pronouns or articles.
    We can do this simply by adding prior class probabilities ai to the above equation giving We can use the maximum likelihood estimates for ozi which are just the number of distinct types in cluster i, divided by the total number of types in the corpus.
    This just has the effect of discriminatin
