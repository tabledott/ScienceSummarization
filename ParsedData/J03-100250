 method.
    By forming a union or intersection of the alignments, we can obtain very high recall or precision values on both the Hansards task and the Verbmobil task.
    Alignment models similar to those studied in this article have been used as a starting point for refined phrase-based statistical machine translation systems (Alshawi, Bangalore, and Douglas 1998; Och, Tillmann, and Ney 1999; Ney et al. 2000).
    In Och and Ney (2000), the overall result of the experimental evaluation has been that an improved alignment quality yields an improved subjective quality of the statistical machine translation system as well.
  
  
    In this article, we have discussed in detail various statistical and heuristic word alignment models and described various modifications and extensions to models known in the literature.
    We have developed a new statistical alignment model (Model 6) that has yielded the best results among all the models we considered in the experiments we have conducted.
    We have presented tw
