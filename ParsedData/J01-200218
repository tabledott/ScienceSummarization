aper, weights a combination of order n with a factor n!, a number based on the observation that a combination of order m contains m combinations of order (m &#8212; 1) that have to be competed with.
    Its only parameter is a threshold for the number of times a combination must be observed in the training data in order to be used, which helps prevent a combinatorial explosion when there are too many atomic features.'
    In contrast to voting, stacking classifiers allows the combination of the outputs of component systems with additional information about the decision's context.
    We investigated several versions of this approach.
    In the basic version (Tags), each training case for the second-level learner consists of the tags suggested by the component taggers and the correct tag (Figure 4).
    In the more advanced versions, we add information about the word in question (Tags+Word) and the tags suggested by all taggers for the previous and the next position (Tags+Context).
    These types of extended
