hich gave the most accuracy improvement in their experiments.
    Here the category of a character is the set of tags seen on the character during training.
    Other morphological features from Tseng et al. (2005) are not used because they require extra web corpora besides the training data.
    During training, the baseline POS tagger stores special word-tag pairs into a tag dictionary (Ratnaparkhi, 1996).
    Such information is used by the decoder to prune unlikely tags.
    For each word occurring more than N times in the training data, the decoder can only assign a tag the word has been seen with in the training data.
    This method led to improvement in the decoding speed as well as the output accuracy for English POS tagging (Ratnaparkhi, 1996).
    Besides tags for frequent words, our baseline POS tagger also uses the tag dictionary to store closed-set tags (Xia, 2000) &#8211; those associated only with a limited number of Chinese words.
