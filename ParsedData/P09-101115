some noise c+ = w &#8722; v &gt; 0 or c&#8722; = v &#8722; w &gt; 0.
    We model c+ and c&#8722; as geometric distributions.5 In summary, we allow six possible ways of generating the word w given v: v rv15 LvI5 round5(v) v &#8722; c&#8722; v + c+ Separate probabilities for choosing among these possibilities are learned for each field type (see Figure 3 for an example).
    String Fields (t = STR) Strings fields are intended to represent values which we expect to be realized in the text via a simple surface-level transformation.
    For example, a name field with value v = Moe Williams is sometimes referenced in the text by just Williams.
    We used a simple generic model of rendering string fields: Let w be a word chosen uniformly from those in v. Categorical Fields (t = CAT) Unlike string fields, categorical fields are not tied down to any lexical representation; in fact, the identities of the categorical field values are irrelevant.
    For each categorical field f and possible value v, we have a , clear
