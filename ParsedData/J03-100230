M instead of Model 2 in bootstrapping the fertility-based alignment models, the alignment quality can be significantly improved.
    In the Appendix, we present an efficient training algorithm of the fertilitybased alignment models.
    When using the EM algorithm on the standard versions of Models 3 and 4, we observe that during the EM iterations more and more words are aligned with the empty word.
    This results in a poor alignment quality, because too many words are aligned to the empty word.
    This progressive increase in the number of words aligned with the empty word does not occur when the other alignment models are used.
    We believe that this is due to the deficiency of Model 3 and Model 4.
    The use of the EM algorithm guarantees that the likelihood increases for each iteration.
    This holds for both deficient and nondeficient models.
    For deficient models, however, as the amount of deficiency in the model is reduced, the likelihood increases.
