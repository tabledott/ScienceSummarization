nd therefore benefit more from the combination of topical and local context; (d) the precision of TLC can be considerably improved at the price of recall, a trade-off that may be desirable in some interactive NLP applications.
    A final observation we can make is that when topical and local information is combined, what we have called &amp;quot;nontopical senses&amp;quot; can reduce overall accuracy.
    For example, the 'textual' sense of line is relatively topic-independent.
    The results of the line experiment were not affected too adversely because the nontopical sense of line accounted for only 10% of the training examples.
    The effects of nontopical senses will be more serious when most senses are nontopical, as in the case of many adjectives and verbs.
    The generality of these conclusions must, of course, be tested with additional words, which brings us to the problem of obtaining training and testing corpora.
    On one hand, it is surprising that a purely statistical classifier can &amp;quo
