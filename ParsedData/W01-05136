in European languages delimited by the space character).
    However, in such languages, it seems more prudent to simply take advantage of delimiters rather than introducing potential errors by trying to find word boundaries while ignoring knowledge of the level and identify appropriate word combinations.
    Some researchers start with words and propose MWU induction methods that make use of parts of speech, lexicons, syntax or other linguistic structure (Justeson and Katz, 1995; Jacquemin, et al., 1997; Daille, 1996).
    For example, Justeson and Katz indicated that the patterns NOUN NOUN and ADJ NOUN are very typical of MWUs.
    Daille also suggests that in French, technical MWUs follow patterns such as &#8220;NOUN de NOUN&amp;quot; (1996, p. 50).
    To find word combinations that satisfy such patterns in both of these situations necessitates the use of a lexicon equipped with part of speech tags.
    Since we are interested in knowledge-free induction of MWUs, these approaches are less directly related
