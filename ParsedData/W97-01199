b, c and d are computed from the segments in the monolingual text of the non-parallel corpus.
    W(wz, w5) is the weighted mutual information in our algorithm since it is most suitable for lexicon compilation of mid-frequency technical words or terms: As an initial step, all Pr(w, = 1) are pre-computed for the seed words in both languages.
    We have experimented with various segment sizes, ranging from phrases delimited by all punctuations, a sentence, to an entire paragraph.
    From our experiment results, we conclude that the right segment size is a function of the frequency of the seed words: segment size oc frequency(W,) If the seed words are frequent, and if the segment size is as large as a paragraph size, then these frequent seed words could occur in every single segment.
    In this case, the chances for co-occurrence between such seed words and all new words are very high, close to one.
    With large segments, such seed words are too biasing and thus, smaller segment size must be used.
