analysis, and that the statistics related to lexical dependencies approximate this notion of plausibility.
    Implicitly, we would be just as well off (maybe even better off) if statistics were calculated between items at the predicate-argument level, with no reference to structure.
    The distance preferences under this interpretation are just a way of mitigating sparse-data problems: When the lexical statistics are too sparse, then falling back on some structural preference is not ideal, but is at least better than chance.
    This hypothesis is suggested by previous work on specific cases of attachment ambiguity such as PP attachment (see, e.g., Collins and Brooks 1995), which has showed that models will perform better given lexical statistics, and that a straight structural preference is merely a fallback.
    But some examples suggest this is not the case: that, in fact, many sentences have several equally semantically plausible analyses, but that structural preferences distinguish strongly among them.
