model with valence).
    We begin at the ROOT.
    In the standard way, each head generates a series of nonSTOP arguments to one side, then a STOP argument to that side, then non-STOP arguments to the other side, then a second STOP.
    For example, in the dependency structure in figure 1, we first generate a single child of ROOT, here fell.
    Then we recurse to the subtree under fell.
    This subtree begins with generating the right argument in.
    We then recurse to the subtree under in (generating September to the right, a right STOP, and a left STOP).
    Since there are no more right arguments after in, its right STOP is generated, and the process moves on to the left arguments offell.
    In this process, there are two kinds of derivation events, whose local probability factors constitute the model&#8217;s parameters.
    First, there is the decision at any point whether to terminate (generate STOP) or not: PSTOP(STOP1h, dir, adj).
    This is a binary decision conditioned on three things: the head
