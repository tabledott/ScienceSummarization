ation of other grammatical structures where constituents do not appear in their default positions.
  Null elements are used in most cases to mark the fronting (or "topicalization" of any element of an S before the subject (except in inversion).
  If an adjunct is topicalized, the fronted element does not leave a trace since the level of attachment is the same, only the word order is different.
  Topicalized arguments, on the other hand, always are marked by a null element: (S (NP-TPC-5 This) (NP-SBJ every man) (VP contains (NP *T*-5) (PP-LOC within (liP him) ) ) ) Again, this makes predicate argument interpretat ion straightforward, if the null element is simply replaced by the constituent to which it is co-indexed.
  Similarly, if the predicate has moved out of VP, it leaves a null element *T* in the VP node.
