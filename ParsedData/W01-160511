    Our methodology for determining the &#8220;best&#8221; guidelines was much more of a consensus-building process, taking into consideration multiple factors at each step.
    The final tagging manual, over 80 pages in length, contains extensive examples from the corpus to illustrate text segmentation, nuclearity, selection of relations, and discourse cues.
    The manual can be downloaded from the following web site: http://www.isi.edu/~marcu/discourse.
    The actual tagging of the corpus progressed in three developmental phases.
    During the initial phase of about four months, the team created a preliminary corpus of 100 tagged documents.
    This was followed by a one-month reassessment phase, during which we measured consistency across the group on a select set of documents, and refined the annotation rules.
    At this point, we decided to proceed by pre-segmenting all of the texts on hard copy, to ensure a higher overall quality to the final corpus.
