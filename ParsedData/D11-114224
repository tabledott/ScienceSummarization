e external systems.
    REVERB has much higher precision than the other systems at nearly all levels of recall.
    In particular, more than 30% of REVERB&#8217;s extractions are at precision 0.8 or higher, compared to virtually none for the other systems.
    WOEparse achieves a slightly higher recall than REVERB (0.62 versus 0.64), but at the cost of lower precision.
    In order to highlight the role of the relational model of each system, we also evaluate their performance on the subtask of extracting just the relation phrases from the input text.
    Figure 5 shows the precision-recall curves for each system on the relation phrase-only evaluation.
    In this case, REVERB has both higher precision and recall than the other systems.
    REVERB&#8217;s biggest improvement came from the elimination of incoherent extractions.
    Incoherent extractions were a large fraction of the errors made by previous systems, accounting for approximately 13% of TEXTRUNNER&#8217;s extractions, 15% of WOEpOs&#8217;s, and 3
