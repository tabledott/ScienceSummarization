onal linguistics community since the construction of the Penn Treebank (Marcus et al., 1993).
    This includes work on phrasestructure parsing (Collins, 1997; Charniak, 2000; Petrov et al., 2006), dependency parsing (McDonald et al., 2005; Nivre et al., 2006) as well as a number of other formalisms (Clark and Curran, 2004; Wang and Harper, 2004; Shen and Joshi, 2008).
    As underlying modeling techniques have improved, these parsers have begun to converge to high levels of accuracy for English newswire text.
    Subsequently, researchers have begun to look at both porting these parsers to new domains (Gildea, 2001; McClosky et al., 2006; Petrov et al., 2010) and constructing parsers for new languages (Collins et al., 1999; Buchholz and Marsi, 2006; Nivre et al., 2007).
    One major obstacle in building statistical parsers for new languages is that they often lack the manually annotated resources available for English.
    This observation has led to a vast amount of research on unsupervised grammar inducti
