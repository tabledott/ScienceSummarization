n a cluster share a particular context word, we consider these pairs to be linked (with respect to this word).
    The relative frequency for a word is the number of such links, relative to the maximal possible number of links ( for a cluster of pairs).
    If the relative frequency is , the word is shared by all NE pairs.
    Although we obtained some meaningful relations in small clusters, we have omitted the small clusters because the common words in such small clusters might be unreliable.
    We found that all large clusters had appropriate relations and that the common words which occurred frequently in those clusters accurately represented the relations.
    In other words, the frequent common words could be regarded as suitable labels for the relations.
  
  
    The results of our experiments revealed good performance.
    The performance was a little higher in the PER-GPE domain than in the COM-COM domain, perhaps because there were more NE pairs with high cosine similarity in the PER-GPE domain tha
