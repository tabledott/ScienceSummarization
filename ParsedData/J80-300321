 A knows whether a proposition P is true if A KNOWs that P or A KNOWs that &#8212;P.
    Knowing what the referent of a description is requires quantification into belief.
    One of its arguments is a formula with exactly one free variable.
    A KNOWREF the departure time of TRAIN1 if TRAIN1 has a unique departure time y, and if A believes that y is TRAIN l's unique departure time.
    We let W(A,P) (usually written WA(P)) mean &amp;quot;agent A wants P to be true&amp;quot;.
    P can be either a state or the execution of some action.
    In the latter case, if ACT is the name of an action, WA(ACT(b)) means &amp;quot;A wants b to do ACT&amp;quot;.
    The logic of want is even more difficult than that of belief.
    It is necessary for us to accept the following: American Journal of Computational Linguistics, Volume 6, Number 3-4, July-December 1980 171 The most interesting interactions between the belief and want operators come from the models that agents have of each other's abilities to act and to recogn
