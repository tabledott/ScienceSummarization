  We added the sentence boundary marker to them.

  -~)p(wdtO (8) Equation (8) suggests that, to find the maxlmmn P(I,Vi,7]) for each ul, we need only to: remember the maximum P(W?_I, 7]_1), extend each of these prob- abilities to every ul by computing Eqnation (8), and select the m;uxinmm P(~/Vi,Ti) for each ui.
  thus, by increasing i by 1 to n, selecting the u.  ttlat maximize P(W.,7]~), and backtracing the sequence leading to the nmxinmm probability, we can get the optimal tag seqnence.
