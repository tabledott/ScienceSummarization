 was generated from the same concept and should be linked.
    To test this hypothesis, I ran one iteration of Method A on 300,000 aligned sentence pairs from the Canadian Hansards bitext.
    I then plotted the of the competitive linking process, because in the first iteration, linking decisions are based only on the initial similarity metric.
    Information about how often words co-occur without being linked can be used to bias the estimation of translation model parameters.
    The smaller the ratio icionokcsuu&amp;quot;vv?, the more likely it is that u and v are not mutual translations, and that links posited between tokens of u and v are noise.
    The bias can be implemented via auxiliary parameters that model the curve illustrated in Figure 2.
    The competitive linking algorithm creates all the links of a given type independently of each other.'
    So, the distribution of the number links (u, v) of links connecting word types u and v can be modeled by a binomial distribution with parameters cooc(u,
