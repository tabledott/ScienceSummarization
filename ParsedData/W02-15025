 of the matrix starter kit and already have contributed to a series of discussions on cross-lingual HPSG design aspects, specifically in the areas of argument structure representations in the lexicon and basic assumptions about constituent structure (in one view, Norwegian exhibits a VSO topology in the main clause).
    The user groups have suggested refinements and extensions of the basic inventory, and it is expected that general solutions, as they are identified jointly, will propagate into the existing grammars too.
  
  
    As an example of the level of detail involved in the grammar matrix, in this section we consider the analysis of intersective and scopal modification.
    The matrix is built to give Minimal Recursion Semantics (MRS; Copestake et al., 2001; Copestake, Flickinger, Sag, &amp; Pollard, 1999; Copestake, Flickinger, Malouf, Riehemann, &amp; Sag, 1995) representations.
    The two English examples in (1) exemplify the difference between intersective and scopal modification:1 The MRSs for
