 linearin the size of the input, while the algorithm of Ya mada and Matsumoto is quadratic in the worst case.
			Another difference is that Yamada and Matsumoto use support vector machines (Vapnik, 1995), whilewe instead rely on memory-based learning (Daele mans, 1999).
			Most importantly, however, the parser presented in this paper constructs labeled dependency graphs, i.e. dependency graphs where arcs are labeled with dependency types.
			As far as we know, this makesit different from all previous systems for dependency parsing applied to the Penn Treebank (Eis ner, 1996; Yamada and Matsumoto, 2003), althoughthere are systems that extract labeled grammatical relations based on shallow parsing, e.g. Buchholz (2002).
			The fact that we are working with labeled dependency graphs is also one of the motivations for choosing memory-based learning over sup port vector machines, since we require a multi-class classifier.
			Even though it is possible to use SVMfor multi-class classification, this can get cumber s
