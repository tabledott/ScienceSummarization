  Extracting Semantic Orientations Of Words Using Spin Model
  
    We propose a method for extracting semantic orientations of words: desirable or undesirable.
    Regarding semantic orientations as spins of electrons, we use the mean field approximation to compute the approximate probability function of the system instead of the intractable actual probability function.
    We also propose a criterion for parameter selection on the basis of magnetization.
    Given only a small number of seed words, the proposed method extracts semantic orientations with high accuracy in the experiments on English lexicon.
    The result is comparable to the best value ever reported.
  
  
    Identification of emotions (including opinions and attitudes) in text is an important task which has a variety of possible applications.
    For example, we can efficiently collect opinions on a new product from the internet, if opinions in bulletin boards are automatically identified.
    We will also be able to grasp people&#8217;s
