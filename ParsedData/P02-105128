the blind set are generally more accurate than the human translations in the development test.
    Another reason might be the fact that the human translator who translated the development test is not a professional translator.
    The only exception to this trend is organizations.
    After reviewing the translations, we discovered that many of the organization translations provided by the human translator in the blind test set that were judged incorrect were acronyms or abbreviations for the full name of the organization (e.g., the INC instead of the Iraqi National Congress).
    As we described earlier in this paper, our translation system first generates a list of translation candidates, then re-scores them using several re-scoring methods.
    The list of translation candidates we used for these experiments are of size 20.
    The re-scoring methods are applied incrementally where the reranked list of one module is the input to the next module.
    Table 3 shows the translation accuracy after each of the
