ystem based on the Maximum Entropy method.
    For the SVM system, we used the feature set {hw, pre, suf, pos, hmmi[&#8722;3,&#183;&#183;&#183; ,3], lwc3, rwc3, pc[&#8722;2,&#8722;1]}, which is shown to be the best in the previous experiment.
    The compared system is a maximum entropy tagging model described in (Kazama et al., 2001).
    Though it supports several character type features such as number and hyphen and some conjunctive features such as word n-gram, we do not use these features to compare the performance under as close a condition as possible.
    The feature set used in the maximum entropy system is expressed as {hw,pre,suf,pos,hmmi[&#8722;2,&#183;&#183;&#183;,2], pc[&#8722;2,&#8722;1]}.10 Both systems use the BIO representation with splitting.
    Table 4 shows the accuracies of both systems.
    For the SVM system, we show the results with the inner product kernel and several polynomial kernels.
