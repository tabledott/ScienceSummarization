their occurrences in the training set are in objective sentences.
    WBO also includes a binary feature for each of the following: the presence in the sentence of a pronoun, an adjective, a cardinal number, a modal other than will, and an adverb other than not.
    We also added manually-developed features found by other researchers.
    We created 14 feature sets representing some classes from (Levin, 1993; Ballmer and Brennenstuhl, 1981), some Framenet lemmas with frame element experiencer (Baker et al., 1998), adjectives manually annotated for polarity (Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown, 1997), and some subjectivity clues listed in (Wiebe, 1990).
    We represented each set as a three-valued feature based on the presence of 0, 1, or &gt; 2 members of the set.
    We will refer to these as the manual features.
    We created discourse features to capture the density of clues in the text surrounding a sentence.
    First, we computed the average number of subjective clues and objective clues per sentence, normal
