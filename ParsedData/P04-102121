n Table 9.
    One observes that n-gram TM consistently outperforms ID3 decision tree in all tests.
    Three factors could have contributed: 1) English transliteration unit size ranges from 1 letter to 7 letters.
    The fixed size windows in ID3 obviously find difficult to capture the dynamics of various ranges. n-gram TM seems to have better captured the dynamics of transliteration units; 2) The backoff smoothing of n-gram TM is more effective than that of ID3; 3) Unlike n-gram TM, ID3 requires a separate aligning process for bilingual dictionary.
    The resulting alignment may not be optimal for tree construction.
    Nevertheless, ID3 presents another successful implementation of DOM framework.
    Due to lack of standard data sets, it is difficult to compare the performance of the n-gram TM to that of other approaches.
    For reference purpose, we list some reported studies on other databases of E2C transliteration tasks in Table 10.
    As in the references, only character and Pinyin error rates are
