en-Shannon divergence (total divergence to the average), the L1 norm, and the confusion probability.
    Our experiments on a frequency-controlled pseudoword disambiguation task showed that using any of the three in a distance-weighted averaging scheme yielded large improvements over Katz's backoff smoothing method in predicting unseen coocurrences.
    Furthermore, by using a restricted version of model (1) that stripped incomparable parameters, we were able to empirically demonstrate that the confusion probability is fundamentally worse at selecting useful similar words.
    D. Lin also found that the choice of similarity function can affect the quality of automatically-constructed thesauri to a statistically significant degree (1998a) and the ability to determine common morphological roots by as much as 49% in precision (1998b).
    3-The term &amp;quot;similarity-based&amp;quot;, which we have used previously, has been applied to describe other models as well (L. Lee, 1997; Karov and Edelman, 1998).
