ection 6.
    In Section 6, I argued that vectors need to record the conceptual information involved when finding mappings between a source and target.
    What metaphor-maps do is freeze (some of) the conceptual information involved in particular metaphorical relations.
    There is some theoretical convergence here between our approaches; it would be interesting to explore this further.
    Moreover, the metaphors studied so far in CS seem linked to certain conventional metaphors because certain types of ground have recurred, types which resemble Lakoff and Johnson's (1980) structural metaphors.
    Two types of ground have cropped up so far.
    Example 28 &amp;quot;Time flies.&amp;quot; The first is a use-up-a-resource metaphor which occurs in (20) and in (28) when viewed as noun-verb sentence.
    Both sentences are analyzed by meta5.
    Use-up-a-resource resembles structural metaphors like TIME IS A RESOURCE and LABOR IS A RESOURCE which, according to Lakoff and Johnson (1980, p. 66), both employ the s
