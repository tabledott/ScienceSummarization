    In terms of the present study, Jacquemin's algorithm consists of (1) finding signatures with the longest possible stems and (2) establishing pairs of stems that occur together in two or more windows of length 5 or less.
    He tests his results on 100 random pairs discovered in this fashion, placing upper bounds on the length of the suffix permitted between one and five letters, and independently varying the length of the window in question.
    He does not vary the minimum size of the stem, a consideration that turns out to be quite important in Germanic languages, though less so in Romance languages.
    He finds that precision varies from 97% when suffixes are limited to a length of one letter, to 64% when suffixes may be five letters long, with both figures assuming an adjacency window of two words; precision falls to 15% when a window of four words is permitted.
    Jacquemin also employs the term signature in a sense not entirely dissimilar t
