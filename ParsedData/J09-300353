iMBL and 3.2% for Ripper.
    Although no feature sets stand out in Table 13 as far as giving an overall high performance, there are some features that consistently improve performance across the different algorithms.
    The reliability class of the clue instance (RELIABILITY-CLASS) improves accuracy over the baseline for all four algorithms.
    It is the only feature that does so.
    The RELCLASS-MOD features give improvements for all metrics for BoosTexter, Ripper, and TiMBL, as well as improving polar F-measure for SVM.
    The PARTS-OFSPEECH features are also fairly consistent, improving performance for all the algorithms except for SVM.
    There are also a couple of feature sets that consistently do not improve performance for any of the algorithms: the INTENSIFY and PRECEDED-POS features.
    For the second step of recognizing contextual polarity, we classify the polarity of all clue instances identified as polar in step one.
    The features for polarity classification were listed in Table 9 and de
