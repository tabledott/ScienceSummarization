nd Lapata, 2007), the main difference lying on the initial method for extracting the context subgraph.
    Whereas (Navigli and Lapata, 2007) apply a depth-first search algorithm over the LKB graph &#8212;and restrict the depth of the subtree to a value of 3&#8212;, Spr relies on shortest paths between word synsets.
    Navigli and Lapata don&#8217;t report overall results and therefore, we can&#8217;t directly compare our results with theirs.
    However, we can see that on a PoS-basis evaluation our results are consistently better for nouns and verbs (especially the Ppr w2w method) and rather similar for adjectives.
    (Tsatsaronis et al., 2007) is another example of a two-stage process, the first one consisting on finding a relevant subgraph by performing a BFS dataset, including MFS and the best supervised system in the competition. search over the LKB.
    The authors apply a spreading activation algorithm over the subgraph for node ranking.
    Edges of the subgraph are weighted according to its type,
