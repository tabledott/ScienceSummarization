lgorithm which attempt to find a grammar to maximize the probability of the training corpus in hope that this grammar will match the grammar that provides the most accurate structural descriptions, the transformation-based learner can readily use any desired success measure in learning.
    We have already begun the next step in this project: automatically labelling the nonterminal nodes.
    The parser will first use the transformational grammar to output a parse tree without nonterminal labels, and then a separate algorithm will be applied to that tree to label the nonterminals.
    The nonterminal-node labelling algorithm makes use of ideas suggested in (Bri92), where nonterminals are labelled as a function of the labels of their daughters.
    In addition, we plan to experiment with other types of transformations.
    Currently, each transformation in the learned list is only applied once in each appropriate environment.
    For a transformation to be applied more than once in one environment, it must app
