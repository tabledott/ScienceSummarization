r short passages.
    Second, synonyms are considered negative evidence, e.g. car E s, and automobile E si implies s, and si are dissimilar.
    The first problem was addressed by replacing with its rank Rii (eq.
    2, r defines the local context).
    The idea is, the difference in magnitude is inaccurate, thus one can only use the order as evidence for segmentation.
    Consider X = {xl,x2,x3} = {1,3,6} as the length of three objects.
    If X was measured with an ordinary ruler, one can conclude that x2 is three times longer than x1.
    This is a quantitative analysis of X, i.e. the quantity is significant.
    However, if the ruler was warped, but the order of the markings is preserved, one can only conclude that x1 &lt; x2 &lt; x3.
    This is a qualitative analysis of X, i.e. the order is significant but the relative value has no meaning.
    This is a more robust interpretation of X.
    The second problem was addressed by applying a stemming algorithm (Porter, 1980) to S, such that syntactically mot
