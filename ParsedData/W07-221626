    In the spirit of our effort to understand the nature of exact non-projective algorithms, we examine dependency models that introduce arity constraints as well as permit edge decisions to be dependent on a limited neighbourhood of other edges in the graph.
    Both kinds of models can no longer be considered edge-factored, since the likelihood of a dependency occurring in a particular analysis is now dependent on properties beyond the edge itself.
    One feature of the edge-factored models is that no restriction is imposed on the arity of the nodes in the dependency trees.
    As a consequence, these models can generate dependency trees of unbounded arity.
    We show below that this is a crucial feature in the development of the complexity results we have obtained in the previous sections.
    Let us assume a graph G(&#65533;) x ) is now defined as the set of all directed spanning trees for G(&#65533;) x rooted in node 0, such that every node i E Vx has arity smaller than or equal to 0(i).
