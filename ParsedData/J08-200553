ole labeling, one possible way is to combine different SRL systems through a joint inference stage, given that the systems are derived using different full parse trees.
  To test this idea, we first build two SRL systems that use Collins?s parser (Collins 1999)3 and Charniak?s parser (Charniak 2001), respectively.
  In fact, these two parsers have noticeably different outputs.
  Applying the pruning heuristics on the output of Collins?s parser produces a list of candidates with 81.05% recall.
  Although this number is significantly lower than the 86.08% recall produced by Charniak?s parser, the union of the two candidate lists still significantly improves recall to 91.37%.
  We construct the two systems by implementing the first three stages, namely, pruning, argument identifi- cation, and argument classification.
  When a test sentence is given, a joint inference stage is used to resolve the inconsistency of the output of argument classification in these two systems.
  We first briefly review the objective f
