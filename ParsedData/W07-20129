e, have low ambiguity.
			Being rare names implies that in averagethere are fewer documents returned by the search engine (47,20 per name), which also reduces the pos sibilities to find ambiguity.
			2.1.3 Test data For the test data we followed the same process described for the training.
			In the name selection wetried to maintain a similar distribution of ambiguity degrees and scenario.
			For that reason we ran domly extracted 10 person names from the English Wikipedia and another 10 names from participantsin the ACL-06 conference.
			In the case of the US census names, we decided to focus on relatively com mon names, to avoid the problems explained above.
			Unfortunately, after the annotation was finished (once the submission deadline had expired), wefound a major increase in the ambiguity degrees (Ta ble 2) of all data sets.
			While we expected a raise in the case of the US census names, the other two cases just show that there is a high (and unpredictable) variability, which would require much large
