 a path weight and &#174; is used to combine the weights of alternative paths.
    To sum over infinite sets of cyclic paths we also need a closure operation *, interpreted as k* = (D'0 ki.
    The usual finite-state algorithms work if (K, &#174;, &#174;, *) has the structure of a closed semiring.15 Ordinary probabilities fall in the semiring (R&gt;0, +, x, *).16 Our novel weights fall in a novel If an arc has probability p and value v, we give it the weight (p, pv), so that our invariant (see above) holds if H consists of a single length-0 or length-1 path.
    The above definitions are designed to preserve our invariant as we build up larger paths and pathsets.
    &#174; lets us concatenate (e.g.) simple paths &#960;1, &#960;2 to get a longer path &#960; with P(&#960;) = P(&#960;1)P(&#960;2) and val(&#960;) = val(&#960;1) + val(&#960;2).
    The definition of &#174; guarantees that path &#960;&#8217;s weight will be (P(&#960;), P(&#960;) &#183; val(&#960;)).
    &#174; lets us take the union of two disjoin
