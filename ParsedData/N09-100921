: bilities corresponding to a verbal parent (any parent, using the coarse tags of Cohen et al., 2008).
    Let V be the set of part-of-speech tags which belong to the verb category.
    For each direction D (left or right), the set of multinomials of the form Oc(&#183;  |v, D), for v E V , all share a normal expert.
    For each direction D and each boolean value B of the predicate firsty(&#183;), the set of multinomials Os(&#183;  |x, D, v), for v E V share a normal expert.
    Since inference for a model with parameter tying can be computationally intensive, we first run the inference algorithm without parameter tying, and then add parameter tying to the rest of the inference algorithm&#8217;s execution until convergence.
    Initialization is important for the inference algorithm, because the variational bound is a nonconcave function.
    For the expected values of the normal experts, we use the initializer from Klein and Manning (2004).
    For the covariance matrices, we follow the setting in Cohen et a
