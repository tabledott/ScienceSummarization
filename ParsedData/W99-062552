od to a substantial number of paragraph pairs from news articles, and compared results to baseline and standard information retrieval techniques.
    Our results indicate that our method outperforms the standard techniques for detecting similarity, and the system has been successfully integrated into a larger multipledocument summarization system [McKeown et al. 1999].
    We are currently working on incorporating a clustering algorithm in order to give as output a set of textual units which are mutually similar rather than just pairwise similar.
    Future work includes testing on textual units of different size, comparing with additional techniques proposed for document similarity in the information retrieval and computational linguistics literature, and extending the feature set to incorporate other types of linguistic information in the statistical learning method.
