    Part-of-speech tagging is an active area of research; a great deal of work has been done in this area over the past few years (e.g., Jelinek 1985; Church 1988; Derose 1988; Hindle 1989; DeMarcken 1990; Merialdo 1994; Brill 1992; Black et al. 1992; Cutting et al.
    1992; Kupiec 1992; Charniak et al. 1993; Weischedel et al.
    1993; Schutze and Singer 1994).
    Part-of-speech tagging is also a very practical application, with uses in many areas, including speech recognition and generation, machine translation, parsing, information retrieval and lexicography.
    Insofar as tagging can be seen as a prototypical problem in lexical ambiguity, advances in part-of-speech tagging could readily translate to progress in other areas of lexical, and perhaps structural, ambiguity, such as wordsense disambiguation and prepositional phrase attachment disambiguation.'
    Also, it is possible to cast a number of other useful problems as part-of-speech tagging problems, such as letter-to-sound tr
