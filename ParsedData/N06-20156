onding improvement in word sense disambiguation performance.
    Training on this new data, Chen and Palmer (2005) report 86.3% accuracy for verbs using a smoothed maximum entropy model and rich linguistic features, which is 10% higher than their earlier, stateof-the art performance on ungrouped, fine-grained senses.
    We follow a similar procedure for the annotation of nouns.
    The same individual who groups WordNet verb senses also creates noun senses, starting with WordNet and other dictionaries.
    We aim to double-annotate the 1100 most frequent polysemous nouns in the initial corpus by the end of 2006, while maximizing overlap with the sentences containing annotated verbs.
    Certain nouns carry predicate structure; these include nominalizations (whose structure obviously is derived from their verbal form) and various types of relational nouns (like father, President, and believer, that express relations between entities, often stated using of).
    We have identified a limited set of these whose
