t vector w by keeping the norm of the change in the weight vector as small as possible.
    With this framework, we can formulate the optimization problem as follows (McDonald, 2006): where bestk(xt; w(i)) E Yt represents a set of top k-best paths given the weight vector w(i).
    The above quadratic programming (QP) problem can be solved using Hildreth&#8217;s algorithm (Yair Censor, 1997).
    Replacing Eq.
    (2) into line 4 of Algorithm 1, we obtain k-best MIRA.
    The next question is how to efficiently generate bestk(xt; w(i)).
    In this paper, we apply a dynamic programming search (Nagata, 1994) to kbest MIRA.
    The algorithm has two main search steps: forward and backward.
    For the forward search, we use Viterbi-style decoding to find the best partial path and its score up to each node in the lattice.
    For the backward search, we use A*style decoding to generate the top k-best paths.
    A complete path is found when the backward search reaches the beginning node of the lattice, and the al
