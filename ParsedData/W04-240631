haracteristic features used by the instances belonging to the same cluster.
    By comparing such descriptive features of each cluster with the words that occur in actual dictionary definitions of the target word, we plan to carry out fully automated word sense disambiguation that does not rely on any manually annotated text.
  
  
    We present an extensive comparative analysis of word sense discrimination techniques using first order and second order context vectors, where both can be employed in similarity and vector space.
    We conclude that for larger amounts of homogeneous data such as the Line, Hard and Serve data, the first order context vector representation and the UPGMA clustering algorithm are the most effective at word sense discrimination.
    We believe this is the case because in a large sample of data, it is very likely that the features that occur in the training data will also occur in the test data, making it possible to represent test instances with fairly rich feature sets.
