spoken by solving Equation 3: arg maxsp(s I A) = arg maxsp(s)p(A I s) (3) where A denotes the acoustic signal.
    The first term on the right, p(s), is the language model, and is what we compute via parsing in Equation 2.
    Virtually all current speech recognition systems use the so-called trigram language model in which the probability of a string is broken down into conditional probabilities on each word given On the other hand, in the last few years there has been interest in designing language models based upon parsing and Equation 2.
    We now turn to this previous research.
  
  
    There is, of course, a very large body of literature on language modeling (for an overview, see [10]) and even the literature on grammatical language models is becoming moderately large [4, 9,15,16,17].
    The research presented in this paper is most closely related to two previous efforts, that by Chelba and Jelinek [4] (C&amp;J) and that by Roark [15], and this review concentrates on these two papers.
    While these
