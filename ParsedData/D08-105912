 to build different parse trees can vary.
    For example, the three-word sentence &#8220;A B C&#8221; can be parsed by the sequence of three actions &#8220;Shift ArcRight ArcRight&#8221; (B modifies A; C modifies B) or the sequence of four actions &#8220;Shift ArcLeft Shift ArcRight&#8221; (both A and C modifies B).
    To ensure that all final state items are built by the same number of transition actions, we require that the final state transfer the best items from output to agenda Output: the best item in agenda items must 1) have fully-built parse trees; and 2) have only one root word left on the stack.
    In this way, popping actions should be made even after a complete parse tree is built, if the stack still contains more than one word.
    Now because each word excluding the root must be pushed to the stack once and popped off once during the parsing process, the number of actions Inputs: training examples (xi, yi) Initialization: set w&#65533; = 0 needed to parse a sentence is always 2n &#8722; 1, w
