one text in detail, describing changes at the single-word level, and focusing on within-paragraph and withinsentence events.
    Examples of events are changes in characters, occurrences of dialogue, and descriptions of places, each of which ranges in length from one clause to a few sentences.
    He also finds that paragraph boundaries are not always predicted&#8212;sometimes the onset of a new paragraph is signaled by the occurrence of a valley in the graph, but often paragraph onset is not signaled until one or two sentences beyond onset.'
    One of Youmans' main foci is an attempt to cast the resulting peaks in terms of co-ordination and subordination relations.
    However, in the discussion he notes that this does not seem like an appropriate use of the graphs.
    No systematic evaluation of the algorithm is presented, nor is there any discussion of how one might automatically determine the significance of the peaks and valleys.
    Nomoto and Nitta (1994) attempt to use Youmans' algorithm for disting
