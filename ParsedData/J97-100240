ogues and maps to take away and code in their own time.
    The four coders did not speak to each other about the exercise.
    Three of the four coders asked for clarification of the OVERVIEW distinction, which turned out to be a major source of unreliability; there were no other queries.
    4.5.1 Measures.
    Overall, each coder marked roughly a tenth of move boundaries as transaction boundaries.
    When all coders were taken together as a group, the agreement reached on whether or not conversational move boundaries are transaction boundaries was K = .59 (N = 657, k = 5).
    The same level of agreement (K = .59) was reached when the expert was left out of the pool.
    This suggests the disagreement is general rather than arising from problems with the written instructions.
    Kappa for different pairings of naive coders with the expert were .68, .65, .53, and .43, showing considerable variation from subject to subject.
    Note that the expert interacted minimally with the coders, and therefore differ
