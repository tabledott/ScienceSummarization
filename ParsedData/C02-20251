(often year- or decade-long) evolution of a large-scale treebank tend to fall behind the development of the field.
  LinGO Redwoods aims at the development of a novel treebanking methodology, rich in nature and dynamic both in the ways linguistic data can be retrieved from the treebank in varying granularity and in the constant evolution and regular updating of the treebank itself.
  Since October 2001, the project is working to build the foun- dations for this new type of treebank, to develop a basic set of tools for treebank construction and maintenance, and to con- struct an initial set of 10,000 annotated trees to be distributed together with the tools under an open-source license.
  1 Why Another (Type of) Treebank?
  For the past decade or more, symbolic, linguistically ori- ented methods and statistical or machine learning ap- proaches to NLP have often been perceived as incompat- ible or even competing paradigms.
  While shallow and probabilistic processing techniques have produced use- ful results in
