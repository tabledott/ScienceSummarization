s component and uses more features to handle the unknown words better, and this contributes to the slightly higher performance in the incomplete dictionary cases, when compared to the IP+EM model.
  
  
    The method proposed in this paper is simple&#8212; once an integer program is produced, there are solvers available which directly give us the solution.
    In addition, we do not require any complex parameter estimation techniques; we train our models using simple EM, which proves to be efficient for this task.
    While some previous methods introduced for the same task have achieved big tagging improvements using additional linguistic knowledge or manual supervision, our models are not provided with any additional information.
    Figure 10 illustrates for the 45-tag set some of the common mistakes that our best tagging model (92.3%) makes.
    In some cases, the model actually gets a reasonable tagging but is penalized perhaps unfairly.
    For example, &#8220;to&#8221; is tagged as IN by our model som
