ertheless acceptable so that the WER measure alone could be misleading.
    In order to overcome this problem, we introduce as additional measure the positionindependent word error rate (PER).
    This measure compares the words in the two sentences without taking the word order into account.
    Words that have no matching counterparts are counted as substitution errors.
    Depending on whether the translated sentence is longer or shorter than the target translation, the remaining words result in either insertion or deletion errors in addition to substitution errors.
    The PER is guaranteed to be less than or equal to the WER.
    For a more detailed analysis, subjective judgments by test persons are necessary.
    Each translated sentence was judged by a human examiner according to an error scale from 0.0 to 1.0.
    A score of 0.0 means that the translation is semantically and syntactically correct, a score of 0.5 means that a sentence is semantically correct but syntactically wrong and a score of 1.0 m
