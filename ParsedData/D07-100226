			In other words, we wanted to assess whether questions and answers often evoke the sameor related frames (with similar roles).
			This is a prerequisite for semantic structure matching and ulti mately answer extraction.
			(3) Do the graph-basedmodels introduced in this paper bring any perfor mance gains over state-of-the-art shallow semanticparsers or more conventional syntax-based QA systems?
			Recall that our graph-based models were de signed especially for the QA answer extraction task.
			Our results are summarized in Tables 1?3.
			Table 1 records the number of questions to be answered forthe TREC02?05 datasets (Total).
			We also give infor mation regarding the number of questions which arein principle unanswerable with a FrameNet-style se mantic role analysis.
			Column NoFrame shows the number of questions which don?t have an appropriate frame or predicate in the database.
			For example, there is currently no predicate entry for sponsor or sink (e.g., Q: Who is the sponsor of the Internation
