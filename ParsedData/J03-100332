e, (un)connected, etc.
    ), and the performance results will vary with the properties of the scene graph.
    If the scene graph is fully connected, finding distinguishing graphs is much harder then when it is fully unconnected.
    Nevertheless, to give the reader some insight into the performance of the implementation, we applied it to seven test scene graphs of a specific form.
    The first is our running example: the graph in Figure 3.
    The other six are obtained by scaling up this graph and permutating (plus, if necessary, adding) properties to make sure that each object can be uniquely described.
    This implies that only the first test graph is fully connected.
    The other graphs consist of n4 connected subgraphs, where n is the number of vertices in the graph.
    Thus, the bigger graphs are relatively less complex than the smaller ones.
    Each graph consists of 4n looping edges (representing properties) and 3n nonlooping edges (representing spatial relations), again with n the number of ve
