ifiers are adjoined independently of each other in the tree.
    The extension of Eisner&#8217;s algorithm to the second-order model is similar to the algorithm described in (Carreras, 2007), but again with explicit use of word senses and left/right automata.
    The resulting algorithms run in O(Gn3) and O(Hn4) time for the first-order and second-order models respectively, where G and H are grammar constants.
    The efficiency of the parsing algorithm is important in applying the parsing model to test sentences, and also when training the model using discriminative methods.
    The grammar constants G and H introduced in the previous section are polynomial in factors such as the number of possible spines in the model, and the number of possible states in the finite-state automata implicit in the parsing algorithm.
    These constants are large, making exhaustive parsing very expensive.
    To deal with this problem, we use a simple initial model to prune the search space of the more complex model.
