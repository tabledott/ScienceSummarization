is (a Boolean string b, of the form f 0,1f*, abbreviated bk) indicating whether (or not) the ith suffix is contained in the subsignature.
    If a stem t occurs [t] times, then the probability that it occurs without a particular suffix]; is (1 &#8212; prob(fri))[t]; the probability that it occurs without all of the suffixes missing from the particular subsignature b = {bk} is and the probability that the particular subsignature b will arise at all is the sum of those values over all of the stems in the signature: Thus all that is necessary is to estimate the hidden parameters of the frequencies of the individual suffixes in the entire paradigm.
    See the following note as well.
    32 There may appear to be a contradiction between this observation about paradigms and the statement in the preceding paragraph that MDL rejects signature mergers&#8212;but there is no contradiction.
    The rejection of signature mergers is performed (so to speak) by the model which posits that frequencies of suffixes inside a s
