 if it is of the form ~= X I I I  wle= E I .
  V~ That is, the root node of ~ is labelled with a :on-terminal X and the frontier nodes are all labelled with terminals ymbols except one which is labelled X.
  The node labelled by X on the frontier will be c~dl~l the foot node of ~.
  The frontiers of initial trees belong to r-*, whereas the frontiers of the auxiliary trees belong to ~ N ~ U ~+ N -*.
  ~/e will now define a compoeition operation called adjoining, (or adlunetion) which compo6es an auxiliary tree ~ with a tree 3.
  Let 3 be a tree with a node n labelled X and let ~ be an auxiliary tree with the root labelled with the same symbol X.
  (Note that mnst have, by definition, a node (and only one) labelled X on the frontier.)
