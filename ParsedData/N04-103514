cial: they are examples of frontier graph fragments.
    We first define the frontier set of an alignment graph to be the set of nodes n that satisfy the following property: for every node n' of the alignment graph that is connected to n but is neither an ancestor nor a descendant of n, span(n') n closure(span(n)) = 0.
    We then define a frontier graph fragment of an alignment graph to be a graph fragment such that the root and all sinks are in the frontier set.
    Frontier graph fragments have the property that the spans of the sinks of the fragment are each contiguous and form a partition of the span of the root, which is also contiguous.
    This allows the following transformation process: take the tree part of the fragment (i.e. project the fragment on T).
    This forms the output of the rule.
    Figure 6 shows the rules derived from the given graph fragments.
    We have the following result.
    Theorem 1 Rules constructed according to the above procedure are in PA(S, T).
