ses of nominals, and how such techniques can fine-tune the lexical structures acquired from an initial seeding of a machine-readable dictionary.
    In addition to conventional lexical semantic relations, we show how information concerning lexical presuppositions and preference relations can also be acquired from corpora, when analyzed with the appropriate semantic tools.
    Finally, we discuss the potential that corpus studies have for enriching the data set for theoretical linguistic research, as well as helping to confirm or disconfirm linguistic hypotheses.
  
  
    The proliferation of on-line textual information poses an interesting challenge to linguistic researchers for several reasons.
    First, it provides the linguist with sentence and word usage information that has been difficult to collect and consequently largely ignored by linguists.
    Second, it has intensified the search for efficient automated indexing and retrieval techniques.
    Full-text indexing, in which all the content words in
