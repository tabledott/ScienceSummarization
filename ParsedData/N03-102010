stics we use in the following sections are based on the following formula: Where j &#8805; i, i and j range from 1 to 4, and wn is 1/(ji+1).
    Ngram(1, 4) is a weighted variable length n-gram match score similar to the IBM BLEU score; while Ngram(k, k), i.e. i = j = k, is simply the average k-gram coverage score Ck.
    With these formulas, we describe how to evaluate them in the next section.
  
  
    In order to evaluate the effectiveness of automatic evaluation metrics, we propose two criteria: cients of different DUC 2001 data between Ngram(1, 4)n rankings and human rankings including (S) and excluding (SX) stopwords.
    SD-100 is for single document summaries of 100 words and MD-50, 100, 200, and 400 are for multi-document summaries of 50, 100, 200, and 400 words.
    MD-All averages results from summaries of all sizes. should be a good predictor of the statistical significance of human assessments with high reliability.
    The first criterion ensures whenever a human recognizes a good summary/trans
