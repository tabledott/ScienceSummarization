a more flexible modeling scheme than previous methods of application of maximum entropy models to natural language processing.
    Furthermore, it is applicable to complex data structures where an event is difficult to decompose into independent sub-events.
    We also demonstrated that feature forest models are applicable to probabilistic modeling of linguistic structures such as the syntactic structures of HPSG and predicate&#8211; argument structures including non-local dependencies.
    The presented approach can be regarded as a general solution to the probabilistic modeling of syntactic analysis with lexicalized grammars.
    Table 16 summarizes the best performance of the HPSG parser described in this article.
    The parser demonstrated impressively high coverage and accuracy for real-world texts.
    We therefore conclude that the HPSG parser for English is moving toward a practical level of use in real-world applications.
    Recently, the applicability of the HPSG parser to practical applications,
