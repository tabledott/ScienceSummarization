  Exploiting Diversity In Natural Language Processing: Combining Parsers
  
    Three state-of-the-art statistical parsers are combined to produce more accurate parses, as well as new bounds on achievable Treebank parsing accuracy.
    Two general approaches are presented and two combination techniques are described for each approach.
    Both parametric and non-parametric models are explored.
    The resulting parsers surpass the best previously published performance results for the Penn Treebank.
  
  
    The natural language processing community is in the strong position of having many available approaches to solving some of its most fundamental problems.
    The machine learning community has been in a similar situation and has studied the combination of multiple classifiers (Wolpert, 1992; Heath et al., 1996).
    Their theoretical finding is simply stated: classification error rate decreases toward the noise rate exponentially in the number of independent, accurate classifiers.
    The theory has also
