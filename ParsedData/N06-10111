h attention in NLP research in recent years, since it is seen as a significant component of higher level NLP tasks such as information distillation and question answering, and an enabling technology for better information access.
    Most successful approaches to NER employ machine learning techniques, which require supervised training data.
    However, for many languages, these resources do not exist.
    Moreover, it is often difficult to find experts in these languages both for the expensive annotation effort and even for language specific clues.
    On the other hand, comparable multilingual data (such as multilingual news streams) are increasingly available (see section 4).
    In this work, we make two independent observations about Named Entities encountered in such corpora, and use them to develop an algorithm that extracts pairs of NEs across languages.
    Specifically, given a bilingual corpora that is weakly temporally aligned, and a capability to annotate the text in one of the languages with NE
