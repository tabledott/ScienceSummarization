timate the values of the parameters in these probabilistic models.
    Thus, for example, we might estimate the probability distribution for the word Kennedy in the Brown Corpus by modeling the distribution with a binomial, and then use the frequency of Kennedy in the Brown Corpus (140) to fit the model to the data.
    The classic example of a binomial process is coin tossing.
    Suppose that the coin comes up heads with probability p. Then the probability that it will come up heads exactly m times in n tosses is Here which is called the binomial coefficient, is the number of ways the m positions can be chosen from the n coin tosses.
    It is equal to where n!
    (n factorial) is equal to 1 x 2 x &#8226; &#8226; &#8226; x n. For example, tossing a fair coin three times (n = 3, p = 1/2) will result in 0, 1, 2, and 3 heads with probability 1/8, 3/8, 3/8, and 1/8, respectively.
    This set of probabilities is called the binomial distribution for n and p. The expected value of the binomial distribution is np
