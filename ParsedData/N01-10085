    Section 3 presents the knowledgemining components of COCKTAIL that use WordNet for deriving semantic consistency as well as gender information.
    Section 4 presents an entropy-based method for optimally combining coreference rules and Section 5 presents the bootstrapping mechanism.

    The gender attributes may have the values: Gender attributes are assigned by the two following heuristics: Heuristic 1 If a collocation fom a WordNet synset contains the word male, the expression G for the whole sysnet is m. If the collocation contains the words female or woman, G= f .
    Heuristic 2 Consider the first four words from the synset gloss.
