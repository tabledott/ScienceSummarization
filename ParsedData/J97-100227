but useful 'benchmarks&amp;quot; (p. 165).
    Krippendorff also points out that where one coding distinction relies on the results of another, the second distinction cannot be reasonable unless the first also is.
    For instance, it would be odd to consider a classification scheme acceptable if coders were unable to agree on how to identify units in the first place.
    In addition, when assessing segmentation, it is important to choose the class of possible boundaries sensibly.
    Although kappa corrects for chance expected agreement, it is still susceptible to order of magnitude differences in the number of units being classified, when the absolute number of units placed in one of the categories remains the same.
    For instance, one would obtain different values for kappa on agreement for move segment boundaries using transcribed word boundaries and transcribed letter boundaries, simply because there are so many extra agreed nonboundaries in the transcribed letter case.
    Despite these warnings, kapp
