    We presented first-order expectation semirings and inside-outside computation in more detail than (Eisner, 2002), and developed extensions to higher-order expectation semirings.
    This enables efficient computation of many interesting quantities over the exponentially many derivations encoded in a hypergraph: second derivatives (Hessians), expectations of products (covariances), and expectations such as risk and entropy along with their derivatives.
    To our knowledge, algorithms for these problems have not been presented before.
    Our approach is theoretically elegant, like other work in this vein (Goodman, 1999; Lopez, 2009; Gimpel and Smith, 2009).
    We used it practically to enable a new form of minimum-risk training that improved Chinese-English MT by 1.0 BLEU point.
    Our implementation will be released within the open-source MT toolkit Joshua (Li et al., 2009a).
