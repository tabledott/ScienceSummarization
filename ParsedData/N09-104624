ing extensions to this work that we intend to explore in the future.
    First, unsupervised segmentation approaches offer a very compelling alternative to the manually crafted segmentation lattices that we created.
    Recent work suggests that unsupervised segmentation of inflectional affixal morphology works quite well (Poon et al., 2009), and extending this work to compounding morphology should be feasible, obviating the need for expensive hand-crafted reference lattices.
    Second, incorporating target language information into a segmentation model holds considerable promise for inducing more effective translation models that perform especially well for segmentation lattice inputs.
