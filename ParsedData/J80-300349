    It seems that in this case (Example 6 of section 4.4) the plausibility of the inferences after step 3 should be strongly decreased.
    Unfortunately it is not obvious that this can be done without making ,the rating heuristics sensitive to syntax.
    The indirect interpretation can also be downgraded in the presence of stronger expectations.
    If a speaker entered a room full of aspiring candidates for employment and said: &amp;quot;I want to know how many people here can write a sort/merge program&amp;quot; and then turning to each individually asked &amp;quot;Can you write a sort/merge?&amp;quot; the question would not be intended as a request to write a program, and would not be recognized as such by a PI algorithm which rated highly an illocutionary act which fits well in an expectation.
    In several of the earlier examples of questions intended as indirect requests, the literal interpretation is blocked because it leads to acts whose effects were true before the utterance.
    The literal inter
