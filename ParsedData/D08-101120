 constrained training condition of NIST MT08 evaluation.
    These single systems are optimized with maximum-BLEU training on different subsets of the previous NIST MT test data.
    The bilingual translation models used to compute the semantic similarity are from the worddependent HMMs proposed by He (2007), which are trained on two million parallel sentence-pairs selected from the training corpus allowed by the constrained training condition of MT08.
    In the IHMM-based method, the smoothing factor for surface similarity model is set to &#961; = 3, the interpolation factor of the overall similarity model is set to &#945; = 0.3, and the controlling factor of the distance-based distortion parameters is set to K=2.
    These settings are optimized on the dev set.
    Individual system results and system combination results using both IHMM and TER alignment, on both the dev and test sets, are presented in Table 1.
    The TER-based hypothesis alignment tool used in our experiments is the publicly available TE
