rs where the LTR model made an incorrect guess and the combined model CMB guessed accurately.
  
  
    We have presented a method for using word pronunciation information to improve spelling correction accuracy.
    The proposed method substantially reduces the error rate of the previous best spelling correction model.
    A subject of future research is looking for a better way to combine the two error models or building a single model that can recognize whether there is a phonetic or typographic error.
    Another interesting task is exploring the potential of our model in different settings such as the Web, e-mail, or as a specialized model for non-native English speakers of particular origin.
