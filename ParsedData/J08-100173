s (and are thus abstracts), whereas others have been produced by systems following different summarization paradigms (some systems perform rewriting whereas others extract sentences verbatim from the source documents).
    This means that LSA may consider a summary coherent simply because its vocabulary is familiar (i.e., it contains words for which reliable vectors have been obtained).
    Analogously, a summary with a large number of out-of-vocabulary lexical items will be given low similarity scores, irrespective of whether it is coherent or not.
    This is not uncommon in summaries with many proper names.
    These often do not overlap with the proper names found in the North American News Corpus used for training the LSA model.
    Lexical differences exert much less influence on the entity-grid model which abstracts away from alternative verbalizations of the same content and captures coherence solely on the basis of grid topology.
