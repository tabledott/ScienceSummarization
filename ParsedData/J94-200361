TAROO ] Cf: [TAROO] CONTINUE Using Taroo as the subject in example 29a is not enough to establish this discourse segment as being about Taroo.
  It is the use of the zero in example 29b that serves to instantiate Taroo as the Cb.
  By our definition of CONTINUE, 29b is a continue transition, because Cb(29b) = Cp(29b) and there was no Cb in 29a.
  However, Kuno argues that referring to a discourse ntity with a zero is equivalent to marking it as the grammatical topic with wa (Kuno 1972).
  Our interpretation of this argument is that the use of wa in a discourse-initial utterance instantiates the wa-marked entity as the Cb in one utterance.
  This claim is supported by the contrast with the GA-WA alternation in examples 30 and 31, where there is a shift in interpretation depending on whether Taroo is marked with wa in the first sentence.
