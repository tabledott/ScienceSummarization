ajor protein modification types and their reverse reactions.
    For capturing the ways in which different entities participate in these events, the task extends the GE argument roles with two new roles specific to the domain, Sidechain and Contextgene.
    The task design and setup are oriented toward the needs of pathway extraction and curation for domain databases (Wu et al., 2003; Ongenaert et al., 2008) and are informed by previous studies on extraction of the target events (Ohta et al., 2010b; Ohta et al., 2010c).
    The ID task (Pyysalo et al., 2011a) concerns the extraction of events relevant to biomolecular mechanisms of infectious diseases from full-text publications.
    The task follows the basic design of BioNLPST 2009, and the ID entities and extraction targets are a superset of the GE ones.
    The task extends considerably on core entities, adding to PROTEIN four new entity types, including CHEMICAL and ORGANISM.
    The events extend on the GE definitions in allowing arguments of the new ent
