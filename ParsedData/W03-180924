tional (i.e. have one component item contributing a conventional meaning), it would seem to be the case, according to the assumptions made by the technique, that the substitutability of each item will give us some insight into its semantic contribution.
    The thesaurus used by Lin has been generously made available online.
    However this is not adequate for our purposes since it includes only verbs, nouns and adjectives/adverbs.
    We therefore replicated the approach described in Lin (1998a) to build the thesaurus, using BNC data and including prepositions.
    Method 2 is very similar to Method 1, except that instead of using a thesaurus based on Lin&#8217;s method, we took a knowledge-free approach to obtaining synonyms.
    Our technique is very similar to the approach taken to building a &#8220;context space&#8221; by Sch&#168;utze (1998).
    We measured the frequency of co-occurrence of our target words (the 20,000 most frequent words, including all of our VPCs2 and all of their component verbs an
