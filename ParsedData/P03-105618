ight conjunct is verbal (a VP or IP), and those where it is nominal the latter case is illustrated in CRDHN and CRDLN in Figure 4.7 The equivocal majority of low over high verbal attachment errors contrasts qualitatively with ETB parsing, where low attachment is more common and parsers tend to err toward high attachment.
    There are two major sources of ambiguous attachment sites: (i) any VP can be parsed as an IP plus a unary IP&#8212;NP, so due to pro-drop any VP coordination is ambiguous with a higher IP coordination; (ii) VPs are multilevel, giving rise to ambiguities of scope over adjuncts.
    It seems that (i) is a difficult problem; in some cases, certain &amp;quot;discourse-level&amp;quot; adverbs such as however and )E,42t_ A./especially prefer IP modification and are thus strong indicators of high attachment.
    To capture this we mark those adverbs possessing an IP grandparent.
    We address (ii) to some extent by marking VPs as adjunction or complementation structures, as shown before in Figu
