 stage process.
  The first stage provides a structural representa- tion for a sentence on which the second stage ap- plies a sequence of rules to identify and extract he components that can be simplified.
  One could use a parser to obtain the complete structure of the sentence.
  If all the constituents of the sentence along with the dependency relations are given, simplification is straightforward, ttowever, full parsing is slow and prone to failure, especially on complex sentences.
  To overcome the limitations of full parsers, researchers have adopted FSG based approaches to parsing (Abney, 1994; Hobbs et al., 1992; Grishman, 1995).
  These parsers are fast and reasonably robust; they produce sequences of noun and verb groups without any hierarchical structure.
  Section 3 discusses an FSG based ap- proach to simplification.
  An alternative approach which is both fast and yields hierarchical struc- ture is discussed in Section 4.
  In Section 5 we compare the two approaches, and address some general con
