the presence of a possessive pronoun.
    So we can get away with treating possessive pronouns like regular adjectives, greatly simplifying our grammar.
    We have also been able to simplify the generation of morphological variants.
    While true irregular forms (e.g., child I children) must be kept in a small exception table, the problem of &amp;quot;multiple regular&amp;quot; patterns usually increases the size of this table dramatically.
    For example, there are two ways to pluralize a noun ending in -o, but often only one is correct for a given noun (potatoes, but photos).
    There are many such inflectional and derivational patterns.
    Our approach is to apply all patterns and insert all results into the word lattice.
    Fortunately, the statistical model steers clear of sentences containing nonwords like potatos and photoes.
    We thus get by with a very small exception table, and furthermore, our spelling habits automatically adapt to the training corpus.
    Most importantly, the two-level ge
