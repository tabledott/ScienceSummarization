e an effective method for handling systematic differences in word order between source and target languages within the context of statistical machine translation (SMT) systems (Xia and McCord, 2004; Collins et al, 2005).
			In reordering approaches, sentences in the source language are first parsed, for example using a Treebank-trained parser.
			A series of transformations is then applied to the resulting parse tree, with the goal of transforming the source language sentence into a word order that is closer to that of the targetlanguage.
			The reordering process is used to prepro cess both the training and test data used within an existing SMT system.
			Reordering approaches have given significant improvements in performance fortranslation from French to English (Xia and Mc Cord, 2004) and from German to English (Collins et al, 2005).This paper describes a syntactic reordering approach for translation from Chinese to English.
