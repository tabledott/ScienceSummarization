periments and the new experiment reported in the previous section made use of the Altavista search engine to locate &amp;quot;parent&amp;quot; pages, pointing off to multiple language versions of the same text.
    However, the same basic mechanism is easily extended to locate &amp;quot;sibling&amp;quot; pages: cases where the page in one language contains a link directly to the translated page in the other language.
    Exploration of the Web suggests that parent pages and sibling pages cover the major relationships between parallel translations on the Web.

    As a first step in increasing the number of generated candidate page pairs, STRAND was extended to permit both parent and sibling search criteria.
    Relating monolingual sub-trees is an i
