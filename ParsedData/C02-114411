r c ? L in sorted order Compute the centroid of c by averaging the frequency vectors of its elements and computing the mutual information vector of the centroid in the same way as we did for individual elements.
			If c?s similarity to the centroid of each committee previously added to C is be low a threshold ?1, add c to C. Step 4: If C is empty, we are done and return C. Step 5: For each element e ? E If e?s similarity to every committee in C is below threshold ?2, add e to a list of resi dues R. Step 6: If R is empty, we are done and return C. Otherwise, return the union of C and the output of a recursive call to Phase II us ing the same input except replacing E with R. Output: A list of committees.

			Phase II of CBC.
			Step 4 terminates the recursion if no committee is found in the previous step.
			The residue elements are identified in Step 5 and if no residues are found, the algorithm terminates; otherwise, we recursively apply the algorithm to the residue elements.
