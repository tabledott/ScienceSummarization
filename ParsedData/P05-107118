solved randomly.
    We present the performance in Figure 4.
    We see that the best performing combination algorithm on TE1 is Maj, and on TE2 it is Rip.
    Recall that the Yamcha classifiers are trained on TR1; in addition, Rip is trained on the output of these Yamcha classifiers on TR2.
    The difference in performance between TE1 and TE2 shows the difference between the ATB1 and ATB2 (different source of news, and also small differences in annotation).
    However, the results for Rip show that retraining the Rip classifier on a new corpus can improve the results, without the need for retraining all ten Yamcha classifiers (which takes considerable time).
    Figure 4 presents the accuracy of tagging using the whole complex morphological tagset.
    We can project this complex tagset to a simpler tagset, for example, POS.
    Then the minimum tagging accuracy for the simpler tagset must be greater than or equal to the accuracy of the complex morphological tagset.
    Even if a combining algorithm choose
