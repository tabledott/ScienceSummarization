 affect the perceived difficulty of the task.
    It can seem to be a very hard problem (Soon et al., 2001) or one that is somewhat easier (Culotta et al., 2007).
    Given the space constraints, we refer the reader to Stoyanov et al. (2009) for a detailed treatment of the issue.
    Limitations in the size and scope of the available datasets have also constrained research progress.
    The MUC and ACE corpora are the two that have been used most for reporting comparative results, but they differ in the types of entities and coreference annotated.
    The ACE corpus is also one that evolved over a period of almost five years, with different incarnations of the task definition and different corpus cross-sections on which performance numbers have been reported, making it hard to untangle and interpret the results.
    The availability of the OntoNotes data offered an opportunity to define a coreference task based on a larger, more broad-coverage corpus.
    We have tried to design the task so that it not only c
