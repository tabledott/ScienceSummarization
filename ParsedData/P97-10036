    A post-processing stage could add this detail to the parser output, but we give two reasons for making the distinction while parsing: First, identifying complements is complex enough to warrant a probabilistic treatment.
    Lexical information is needed &#8212; for example, knowledge that &amp;quot;week&amp;quot; is likely to be a temporal modifier.
    Knowledge about subcategorisation preferences &#8212; for example that a verb takes exactly one subject &#8212; is also required.
    These problems are not restricted to NPs, compare &amp;quot;The spokeswoman said (SBAR that the asbestos was dangerous)&amp;quot; vs. &amp;quot;Bonds beat short-term investments (SBAR because the market is down)&amp;quot;, where an SBAR headed by &amp;quot;that&amp;quot; is a complement, but an SBAR headed by &amp;quot;because&amp;quot; is an adjunct.
    The second reason for making the complement/adjunct distinction while parsing is that it may help parsing accuracy.
    The assumption that complements are generated in
