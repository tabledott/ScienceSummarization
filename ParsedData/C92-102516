ve even though they are not necessary or even probable from a formal point of view.
  We at least were surprised by some of our results.
  The most important  of these delightful discoveries are: (1) Small case studies can be mis- leading.
  The composition of a rule trans- ducer against a lexicon containing a hand- ful of words is so much larger than the input lexicon that one is tempted to con- clude that the method can never succeed on a large scale.
  However,  this b lowup seems not to occur when the lexicon is already large.
  (2) Intersections and compositions of rule transducers tend to be large, but not nearly as large as they might be.
  The result of intersecting a few dozen two- level rules may have thousands or tens of thousands of states, but not trillions as the worst case scenario predicts.
  Many rules tend to apply either in quite similar or in quite different environments.
  The finite state machinery can represent such pat- terns without multiplying state sets.
