 measures, it is difficult to variation of information between clusterings induced by the assigned and gold standard tags as the amount of information in the dictionary is varied.
    Standard deviations (Q) for the BHMM results fell below those shown in each column.
    The percentage of ambiguous tokens and average number of tags per token for each value of d is also shown. evaluate the quality of a syntactic clustering when no dictionary is used, since cluster names are interchangeable.
    We therefore introduce another evaluation measure for these experiments, a distance metric on clusterings known as variation of information (Meil&#711;a, 2002).
    The variation of information (VI) between two clusterings C (the gold standard) and C&#8242; (the found clustering) of a set of data points is a sum of the amount of information lost in moving from C to C&#8242;, and the amount that must be gained.
    It is defined in terms of entropy H and mutual information I: V I(C, C&#8242;) = H(C) + H(C&#8242;) &#8722;
