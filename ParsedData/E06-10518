.
    As a consequence, the examples are generated as described above with the following difference: an example is labeled 1 if a relation holds between the two candidate interacting entities; 0 otherwise.
  
  
    The basic idea behind kernel methods is to embed the input data into a suitable feature space F via a mapping function 0 : X &#8594; F, and then use a linear algorithm for discovering nonlinear patterns.
    Instead of using the explicit mapping 0, we can use a kernel function K : X x X &#8594; R, that corresponds to the inner product in a feature space which is, in general, different from the input space.
    Kernel methods allow us to design a modular system, in which the kernel function acts as an interface between the data and the learning algorithm.
    Thus the kernel function is the only domain specific module of the system, while the learning algorithm is a general purpose component.
    Potentially any kernel function can work with any kernel-based algorithm.
    In our approach we use Su
