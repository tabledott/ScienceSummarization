to be put into the class that the individual-document classifier disprefers, but at the same time, highly associated speech segments tend not to be put in different classes.
    As has been previously observed and exploited in the NLP literature (Pang and Lee, 2004; Agarwal and Bhattacharyya, 2005; Barzilay and Lapata, 2005), the above optimization function, unlike many others that have been proposed for graph or set partitioning, can be solved exactly in an provably efficient manner via methods for finding minimum cuts in graphs.
    In our view, the contribution of our work is the examination of new types of relationships, not the method by which such relationships are incorporated into the classification decision.
    In our experiments, we employed the well-known classifier SVM&amp;quot;ght to obtain individual-document classification scores, treating Y as the positive class and using plain unigrams as features.5 Following standard practice in sentiment analysis (Pang et al., 2002), the input to SVM&amp;q
