  Rule sequences now underlie all the major processing steps in Alembic.
  part-of- speech tagging, syntactic analysis, inference, and even some of the set-fill processing in the Template Elemen t task (TE) .
  We have found this approach to provide almost an embarrassment of advantages, speed an d accuracy being the most externally visible benefits .
  In addition, most of our rule sequence processors ar e trainable, typically from small samples .
  The rules acquired in this way also have the characteristic that the y allow one to readily mix hand-crafted and machine-learned elements .
  We have exploited this opportunity t o apply both machine-learned and hand-crafted rules extensively, choosing in some instances to run sequence s that were primarily machine-learned, and in other cases to run sequences that were entirely crafted by hand .
  ALEMBICS OVERALL ARCHITECTUR E For all the changes that the system has undergone, the coarse architecture of the Muc-6 version ofAlembic is remarkably close to that of
