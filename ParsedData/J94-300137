ntersection by establishing the following proposition: R is a same-length regular relation if and only if it is accepted by an &amp;free finite-state transducer.
    The transitions of an &amp;free transducer T set the symbols of the string-pairs it accepts in one-to-one correspondence, so trivially, R(T) is same-length.
    The proof in the other direction is more tedious.
    Suppose R is a same-length regular relation accepted by some transducer T which has transitions of the form u:c or &#8364;: v (with u and v not c; we know all e: E transitions can be eliminated by the obvious generalization of the one-tape E-removal algorithm).
    We systematically remove all E-containing transitions in a finite sequence of steps each of which preserves the accepted relation.
    A path from the start-state to a given nonfinal state will contain some number of u : E transitions and some number of E: v transitions, and those two numbers will not necessarily be identical.
    However, for all paths to that state the dif
