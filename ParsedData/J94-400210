essed the problem of pleonastic pronouns.
    It could be argued that recognizing pleonastic uses of pronouns is a task for levels of syntactic/semantic analysis that precede anaphora resolution.
    With the help of semantic classes defined in the lexicon, it should be possible to include exhaustive tests for these constructions in It is Modaladj that S It is Modaladj (for NP) to VP It is Cogv-ed that S It seems/appears/means/follows (that) S NP makes/finds it Modaladj (for NP) to VP It is time to VP It is thanks to NP that S analysis grammars.3 following formulation of the binding algorithm is defined by the following hierarchy of argument slots: Here subj is the surface subject slot, agent is the deep subject slot of a verb heading a passive VP, obj is the direct object slot, lob] is the indirect object slot, and pobj is the object of a PP complement of a verb, as in put NP on NP.
