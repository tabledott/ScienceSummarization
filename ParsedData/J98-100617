l, and Voorhees (1993) found that some senses of the noun line are not susceptible to disambiguation with topical context.
    For example, the 'textual' sense of line can appear with any topic, whereas the 'product' sense of line cannot.
    When it happens that a nontopical sense accounts for a large proportion of occurrences (in our study, all senses of hard are nontopical), then adding topical context to local will have little benefit and may even reduce accuracy.
    One should not conclude from these results that the topical classifiers and TLC are inferior to the classifiers reviewed in Section 2.
    In our experiments, monosemous collocations in WordNet that contain the target word were systematically removed from the training and testing materials.
    This was done on the assumption that these words are not ambiguous.
    Removing them undoubtedly made the task more difficult than it would normally be.
    How much more difficult?
    An estimate is possible.
