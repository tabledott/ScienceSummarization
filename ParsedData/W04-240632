iven smaller amounts of data like SENSEVAL-2, second order context vectors and a hybrid clustering method like Repeated Bisections perform better.
    This occurs because in small and sparse data, direct first order features are seldom observed in both the training and the test data.
    However, the indirect second order co&#8211;occurrence relationships that are captured by these methods provide sufficient information for discrimination to proceed.
