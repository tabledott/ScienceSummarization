 are interested in collocations between the head of a PP complement, a preposition and the head of the phrase being postmodified.
    In general, these words will not be adjacent in the text, so it will not be possible to use existing approaches unmodified (e.g.
    Church and Hanks 1989), because these apply to adjacent words in unanalyzed text.
    Hindle and Rooth (1991) report good results using a mutual information measure of collocation applied within such a structurally defined context, and their approach should carry over to our framework straightforwardly.
    One way of integrating 'structural' collocational information into the system presented above would be to make use of the semantic component of the (ANLT) grammar.
    This component pairs logical forms with each distinct syntactic analysis that represent, among other things, the predicate-argument structure of the input.
    In the resolution of PP attachment and similar ambiguities, it is 'collocation' at this level of representation that app
