 the size of the full vocabulary is a good balance in this trade-off.
    We did not observe the algorithm to not converge unless we used fractions above half of the vocabulary size.
    We typically ran the clustering for 20 to 30 iterations after which the number of words exchanged in each iteration starts to stabilize at less than 5 percent of the vocabulary size.
    Figure 1 shows the number of words exchanged in each of 34 iterations when clustering the approximately 300,000 word vocabulary of the Arabic side of the English-Arabic parallel training data into 512 and 2,048 clusters.
    Despite a steady reduction in the number of words exchanged per iteration, we observed the convergence in regards to log-likelihood to be far from monotone.
    In our experiments we were able to achieve significantly more monotone and faster convergence by employing the following heuristic.
    As described in Section 5, we start out the first iteration with a random partition of the vocabulary into subsets each assigned
