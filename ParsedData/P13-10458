    The input to Henderson&#8217;s model consists of pairs of frequent words and their part-of-speech (POS) tags.
    Both the original parsing system and its probabilistic interpretation (Titov and Henderson, 2007) learn features that represent the parsing history and do not provide a principled linguistic representation like our phrase representations.
    Other related work includes (Henderson, 2004), who discriminatively trains a parser based on synchrony networks and (Titov and Henderson, 2006), who use an SVM to adapt a generative parser to different domains.
    Costa et al. (2003) apply recursive neural networks to re-rank possible phrase attachments in an incremental parser.
    Their work is the first to show that RNNs can capture enough information to make correct parsing decisions, but they only test on a subset of 2000 sentences.
    Menchetti et al. (2005) use RNNs to re-rank different parses.
    For their results on full sentence parsing, they rerank candidate trees created by the Collins
