e-nominal rule; RULE-HAN chose the head using the head rules in the Stanford parser, and included the apposition rule and predicate-nominal rule.
    Past results on ACE were obtained on different releases of the datasets, e.g., Haghighi and Klein (2007) used the ACE-2004 training corpus, Ng (2005) and Denis and Baldridge (2007) used ACE Phrase-2, and Culotta et al. (2007) used the ACE2004 formal test set.
    In this paper, we used the ACE-2004 training corpus and ACE Phrase-2 (ACE2) to enable direct comparisons with Haghighi &amp; Klein (2007), Ng (2005), and Denis and Baldridge (2007).
    Due to license restrictions, we were not able to obtain the ACE-2004 formal test set and so cannot compare directly to Culotta et al. (2007).
    The English version of the ACE-2004 training corpus contains two sections, BNEWS and NWIRE, with 220 and 128 documents, respectively.
    ACE-2 contains a training set and a test set.
    In our experiments, we only used the test set, which contains three sections, BNEWS, NWIRE
