theses are only different from each other in one word or two.
			This means, there is not so much noise and variance introduced in this query model.
			2.2.3 Translation Model as a Query Model To fully leverage the available knowledge from the translation system, the translation model can be used to guide the language model adaptation process.
			As introduced in section 1, the translation model represents the full knowledge of translating words, as it encodes all possible translations candidates for a given source sentence.
			Thus the query model based on the translation model, has potential advantages over both 1TQ and TNQ . To utilize the translation model, all the n-grams from the source sentence are extracted, and the corresponding candidate translations are collected from the translation model.
			These are then converted into a bag-of-words representation as follows: }|),{( ),,;;,,( ,2,1,,2,1, 1111 TMiii nsssnsssTM Vwfw wwwwwwQ IIII ?= = LLL where is is a source n-gram, and I is the number of n-grams
