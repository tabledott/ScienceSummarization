Although the log-linear model offers only a small improvement on pair classification than the simpler but prediction rule, it confers the important advantage 5When morphology is to be used as a supplementary predictor, we remove the morphologically related pairs from the training and testing sets. of rating each prediction between 0 and 1.
    We make extensive use of this in the next phase of our algorithm.
  
  
    The third phase of our method assigns the adjectives into groups, placing adjectives of the same (but unknown) orientation in the same group.
    Each pair of adjectives has an associated dissimilarity value between 0 and 1; adjectives connected by sameorientation links have low dissimilarities, and conversely, different-orientation links result in high dissimilarities.
    Adjective pairs with no connecting links are assigned the neutral dissimilarity 0.5.
    The baseline and but methods make qualitative distinctions only (i.e., same-orientation, differentorientation, or unknown); for them, we
