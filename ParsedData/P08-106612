 a traditional dependency tree.
    Figure 5 shows the four operations to combine partial dependency structures, which are left adjoining (LA), right adjoining (RA), left concatenation (LC) and right concatenation (RC).
    Child and parent subtrees can be combined with adjoining which is similar to the traditional dependency formalism.
    We can either adjoin a fixed structure or a floating structure to the head of a fixed structure.
    Complete siblings can be combined via concatenation.
    We can concatenate two fixed structures, one fixed structure with one floating structure, or two floating structures in the same direction.
    The flexibility of the order of operation allows us to take adWe use the same names for the operations on categories for the sake of convenience.
    We can easily use the meta category operations to define the four combinatory operations.
    The definition of the operations in the left direction is as follows.
    Those in the right direction are similar.
    It is easy to v
