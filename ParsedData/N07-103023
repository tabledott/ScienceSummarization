  Although both are global approaches, CRFs and ILP have important differences.
    ILP uses separate local classifiers which are learned without knowledge of the output constraints and are then integrated into a larger inference task.
    CRFs estimate a global model that directly uses the constraints of the domain.
    This involves heavy computations which cause CRFs to generally be slow and inefficient (even using dynamic programming).
    Again, the results presented in McCallum and Wellner (2004) are hard to compare with our own results.
    They only consider proper names, and they only tackled the task of identifying the correct antecedent only for mentions which have a true antecedent.
    A third global approach is offered by Ng (2005), who proposes a global reranking over partitions generated by different coreference systems.
    This approach proceeds by first generating 54 candidate partitions, which are each generated by a different system.
    These different coreference systems are obtained as
