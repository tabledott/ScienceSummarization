arsers and formalisms.
  
  
    One of the key questions currently facing researchers in statistical parsing is how to adapt existing parsers to new domains.
    There is some experimental evidence showing that, perhaps not surprisingly, the performance of parsers trained on the WSJ Penn Treebank drops significantly when the parser is applied to domains outside of newspaper text (Gildea 2001; Lease and Charniak 2005).
    The difficulty is that developing new treebanks for each of these domains is infeasible.
    Developing the techniques to extract a CCG grammar from the Penn Treebank, together with the preprocessing of the Penn Treebank which was required, took a number of years; and developing the Penn Treebank itself also took a number of years.
    Clark, Steedman, and Curran (2004) applied the parser described in this article to questions from the TREC Question Answering (QA) track.
    Because of the small number of questions in the Penn Treebank, the performance of the parser was extremely poor&#8212
