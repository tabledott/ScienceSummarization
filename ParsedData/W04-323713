direction.
    Another possibility to adapt the background model is to do minimum KL divergence (MinDiv) training (Pietra et al., 1995) between the background exponential model B &#8212; assumed fixed &#8212; and an exponential model A built using the Fbackground U Fadapt feature set.
    It can be shown that, if we smooth the A model with a Gaussian prior on the feature weights that is centered at 0 &#8212; following the approach in (Chen and Rosenfeld, 2000) for smoothing maximum entropy models &#8212; then the MinDiv update equations for estimating A on the adaptation data are identical to the MAP adaptation procedure we proposed5.
    However, we wish to point out that the equivalence holds only if the feature set for the new model A is Fbackground U Fadapt.
    The straightforward application of MinDiv training &#8212; by using only the Fadapt feature set for A &#8212; will not result in an equivalent procedure to ours.
    In fact, the difference in performance between this latter approach and ours coul
