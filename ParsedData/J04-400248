 word-word entries, but also multi-word translations, especially for the large number of German compound words.
    To counteract the sparseness of the training data, a couple of straightforward rule-based preprocessing steps were applied before any other type of processing: So far, in machine translation research there is no generally accepted criterion for the evaluation of experimental results.
    Therefore, we use various criteria.
    In the following experiments, we use: In the following, we analyze the effect of various system components: alignment template length, search pruning, and language model n-gram size.
    A systematic evaluation of the alignment template system comparing it with other translation approaches (e.g., rule-based) has been performed in the VERBMOBiL project and is described in Tessiore and von Hahn (2000).
    There, the alignment-template-based system achieved a significantly larger number of &#8220;approximately correct&#8221; translations than the competing translation system
