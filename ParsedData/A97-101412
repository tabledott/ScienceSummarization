icient to recover theory-specific structures from our `underspecified' representations.
    For instance, the first, determiner among the NK's can be treated as the specifier of the phrase.
    The head of the phrase can be determined in a similar way according to theory-specific assumptions.
    In addition, a. number of clear-cut NP cornponents can be defined outside that, juxtapositional kernel: pre- and postnominal genitives (GL, GR), relative clauses (RC), clausal and sentential complements (OC).
    They are all treated as siblings of NK's regardless of their position (in situ or extraposed).
    Adjunct attachment often gives rise to structural ambiguities or structural uncertainty.
    However, full or partial disambiguation takes place in context, and the annotators do not consider unrealistic readings.
    In addition, we have adopted a simple convention for those cases in which context information is insufficient, for total disambiguation: the highest possible attachment, site is chosen.
