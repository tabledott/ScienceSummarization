 to a relation in the predicate-argument structure of the CCG derivation, and cause the path feature to be used.
    The phrase type feature is replaced with the lexical category of the maximal projection of the PropBank argument&#8217;s head word in the CCG derivation tree.
    For example, the category of plans is N, and the category of denied is (S[dcl]\NP)/NP.
    The voice feature can be read off the CCG categories, since the CCG categories of past participles carry different features in active and passive voice (eg. sold can be (S[pt]\NP)/NP or S[pss]\NP).
    The head word of a constituent is indicated in the derivations returned by the CCG parser.
    We use data from the November 2002 release of PropBank.
    The dataset contains annotations for 72,109 predicate-argument structures with 190,815 individual arguments (of which 75% are core, or numbered, arguments) and has includes examples from 2462 lexical predicates (types).
    Annotations from Sections 2 through 21 of the Treebank were used for tra
