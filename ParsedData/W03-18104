 as a gold-standard to compare various measures aimed at detecting non-compositionality.
    In the following section we look at related work.
    In section 3 we show how phrasals are identified by our parser.
    We talk about the generation of the goldstandard set of compositionality judgements in section 4.
    In section 5 we describe the construction of the automatic thesaurus and the measurements we explored for detecting compositionality.
    In section 6 we show the correlations of our measures with the gold-standard, and compare these to some statistics commonly used for identifying compositional multiwords.
    In section 7 we analyse our findings, and conclude (section 8) with directions for future work.
  
  
    There has been a lot of recent work on extraction of multiwords from corpora we focus specifically on work involving multiword verbs, and detecting compositionality of multiwords.
    There have been a number of methods proposed in the literature for extracting multiword verb constructio
