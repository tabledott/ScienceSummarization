    Consider the example sentence in figure 1A, which demonstrates how a particular type of alignment error prevents the extraction of many useful transducer rules.
    The mistaken link [la ==&gt;. the] intervenes between ax&#180;es and carri`er, which both align within an English adjective phrase, while la aligns to a distant subspan of the English parse tree.
    In this way, the alignment violates the constituent structure of the English parse.
    While alignment errors are undesirable in general, this error is particularly problematic for a syntax-based translation system.
    In a phrase-based system, this link would block extraction of the phrases [ax&#180;es sur la carri`er ==&gt;. career oriented] and [les emplois ==&gt;. the jobs] because the error overlaps with both.
    However, the intervening phrase [emplois sont ==&gt;. jobs are] would still be extracted, at least capturing the transfer of subject-verb agreement.
    By contrast, the tree transducer extraction method fails to extract any of th
