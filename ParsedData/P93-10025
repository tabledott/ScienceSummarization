d a model for English-to-French translaassuming that successive sentences translate independently of each other.
    This value should be relatively large, since F1 is a good translation of El and (F2, F3) is a good translation of E2.
    Another possible alignment A2 is one where E1 maps to nothing and E2 maps to F1, F2, and F3.
    We get This value should be fairly low, since the alignment does not map the English sentences to their translations.
    Hence, if our translation model is accurate we will have In general, the more sentences that are mapped to their translations in an alignment A, the higher the value of P(Y , AV).
    We can extend this idea to produce an alignment algorithm given a translation model.
    In particular, we take the alignment of a corpus (C, .T) to be the alignment A that maximizes P(..r , Ale).
    The more accurate the translation model, the more accurate the resulting alignment will be.
    However, because the parameters are all of the form P (FAL') where E is a sentence, t
