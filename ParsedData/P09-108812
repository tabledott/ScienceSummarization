nal distributions.
    Phrasal SCFG models are subject to a degenerate maximum likelihood solution in which all probability mass is placed on long, or whole sentence, phrase translations (DeNero et al., 2006).
    Therefore, careful consideration must be given when specifying the P1 distribution on terminals in order to counter this behavior.
    To construct a prior over string pairs, first we define the probability of a monolingual string (s): P0X (s) = PPoisson(|s|; 1) X where the PPoisson(k; 1) is the probability under a Poisson distribution of length k given an expected length of 1, while VX is the vocabulary size of language X.
    This distribution has a strong bias towards short strings.
    In particular note that generally a string of length k will be less probable than two of length k2, a property very useful for finding &#8216;minimal&#8217; translation units.
    This contrasts with a geometric distribution in which a string of length k will be more probable than its segmentations.
    We define
