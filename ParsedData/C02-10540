	Efficient Support Vector Classifiers For Named Entity Recognition
		Named Entity (NE) recognition is a task in whichproper nouns and numerical information are extracted from documents and are classified into cat egories such as person, organization, and date.
		It is a key technology of Information Extraction and Open-Domain Question Answering.
		First, we showthat an NE recognizer based on Support Vector Ma chines (SVMs) gives better scores than conventional systems.
		However, off-the-shelf SVM classifiers are too inefficient for this task.
		Therefore, we present a method that makes the system substantially faster.This approach can also be applied to other similar tasks such as chunking and part-of-speech tagging.
		We also present an SVM-based feature selec tion method and an efficient training method.
