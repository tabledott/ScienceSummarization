ually analysed using as context the entire article in which they appeared.
    In some cases, the sequence was not a noun compound (nouns can appear adjacent to one another across various constituent boundaries) and was marked as an error.
    Other compounds exhibited what Hindle and Rooth (1993) have termed SEMANTIC INDETERMINACY where the two possible bracketings cannot be distinguished in the context.
    The remaining compounds were assigned either a left-branching or right-branching analysis.
    Table 1 shows the number of each kind and an example of each.
    Accuracy figures in all the results reported below were computed using only those 244 compounds which received a parse.
    One problem with applying lexical association to noun compounds is the enormous number of parameters required, one for every possible pair of nouns.
    Not only does this require a vast amount of memory space, it creates a severe data sparseness problem since we require at least some data about each parameter.
