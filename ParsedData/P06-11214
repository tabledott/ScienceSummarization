ragment.Its leaves are either lexicalized (e.g. does) or variables (x0, x1, etc).
			rhs(ri) is represented as a se quence of target-language words and variables.
			Now we give a brief overview of how such transformational rules are acquired automaticallyin GHKM.1 In Figure 1, the (pi, f ,a) triple is represented as a directed graph G (edges going down ward), with no distinction between edges of pi and alignments.
			Each node of the graph is labeled with its span and complement span (the latter in italic in the figure).
			The span of a node n is defined by the indices of the first and last word in f that are reachable from n. The complement span of n is the union of the spans of all nodes n?
			in G that are neither descendants nor ancestors of n. Nodesof G whose spans and complement spans are non overlapping form the frontier set F ? G.What is particularly interesting about the fron tier set?
			For any frontier of graph G containinga given node n ? F , spans on that frontier de fine an ordering between n
