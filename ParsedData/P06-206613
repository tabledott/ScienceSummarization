sis consists of two, mutually constraining graphs: the ID graph represents information about immediate dominance, the LP graph models the topological structure of a sentence.
    As a principle of the grammar, the LP graph is required to be a lift of the ID graph; this lifting can be constrained in the lexicon.
  
  
    The structural conditions we have presented here naturally fall into two groups: multiplanarity, gap degree and edge degree are parametric constraints with an infinite scale of possible values; planarity and well-nestedness come as binary constraints.
    We discuss these two groups in turn.
    Parametric constraints With respect to the graded constraints, we find that multiplanarity is different from both gap degree and edge degree in that it involves a notion of optimization: since every dependency graph is m-planar for some sufficiently large m (put each edge onto a separate plane), the interesting question in the context of multiplanarity is about the minimal values for m that occur in r
