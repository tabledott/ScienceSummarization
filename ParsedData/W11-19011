ses, named entities and coreference) that could support joint models, should help to energize ongoing research in the task of entity and event coreference.
  
  
    The importance of coreference resolution for the entity/event detection task, namely identifying all mentions of entities and events in text and clustering them into equivalence classes, has been well recognized in the natural language processing community.
    Automatic identification of coreferring entities and events in text has been an uphill battle for several decades, partly because it can require world knowledge which is not well-defined and partly owing to the lack of substantial annotated data.
    Early work on corpus-based coreference resolution dates back to the mid-90s by McCarthy and Lenhert (1995) where they experimented with using decision trees and hand-written rules.
    A systematic study was then conducted using decision trees by Soon et al. (2001).
