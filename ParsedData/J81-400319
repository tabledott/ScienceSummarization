ever, a node can have more than one incoming edge &#8212; in fact, one such edge for each of the symbols on the lefthand side of the rule corresponding to that node.
    Of these edges, only the one corresponding to the leading symbol is used to define the left-to-right order of the symbols in the sentence whose derivation is represented by the graph.
    If one deletes from a derivation graph all except the first of the incoming edges to every node, the result is a tree analogous to a parse tree.
    For example, Figure 7.1 shows the derivation graph for the string &amp;quot;aabbcc&amp;quot; according to the XG: This XG defines the language formed by the set of all strings anbnen for n&gt;0.
    The example shows, incidentally, that XGs, even without arguments, are strictly more powerful than CFGs, since the language described is not context-free.
    The topology of derivation graphs reflects clearly the bracketing constraint.
    Assume the following two conventions for the drawing of a derivation graph, w
