l (Turney and Littman 2005).
    For some of the applications, such as information extraction, LRA might be suitable if it is adjusted for high precision, at the expense of low recall.
    Another limitation is speed; it took almost 9 days for LRA to answer 374 analogy questions.
    However, with progress in computer hardware, speed will gradually become less of a concern.
    Also, the software has not been optimized for speed; there are several places where the efficiency could be increased and many operations are parallelizable.
    It may also be possible to precompute much of the information for LRA, although this would require substantial changes to the algorithm.
    The difference in performance between VSM-AV and VSM-WMTS shows that VSM is sensitive to the size of the corpus.
    Although LRA is able to surpass VSM-AV when the WMTS corpus is only about one tenth the size of the AV corpus, it seems likely that LRA would perform better with a larger corpus.
    The WMTS corpus requires one terabyte of
