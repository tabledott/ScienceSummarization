 and &#8220;y&#8221;.
    Similarly, the pair cannot be generated using concepts (&#8220;a c&#8221; : &#8220;x&#8221;) and (&#8220;b&#8221; : &#8220;y&#8221;) because the sequence &#8220;a b c&#8221; cannot be created by catenating the phrases &#8220;a c&#8221; and &#8220;b&#8221;.
    We say that a set of concepts can be linearized into a sentence pair (E, F) if E and F can be obtained by permuting the phrasesandthat characterize concepts .
    We denote this property using the predicate .
    Under this model, the probability of a given sentence pair (E, F) can then be obtained by summing up over all possible ways of generating bags of concepts that can linearized to (E, F).
    (1) 2.2 Model 2 Although Model 1 is fairly unsophisticated, we have found that it produces in practice fairly good alignments.
    However, this model is clearly unsuited for translating unseen sentences as it imposes no constraints on the ordering of the phrases associated with a given concept.
    In order to account for this, we
