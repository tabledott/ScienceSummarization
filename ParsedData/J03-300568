tantiate the claim that the Web counts can be used to overcome data sparseness, we compared bigram counts obtained from the Web with bigram counts recreated using a class-based smoothing technique (a variant of the one proposed by Resnik [1993]).
    We found that Web frequencies and re-created frequencies are reliably correlated, and that Web frequencies are better at predicting plausibility judgments than smoothed frequencies.
    This holds both for unseen bigrams and for seen bigrams that are treated as unseen by omitting them from the training corpus.
    Finally, we tested the performance of our frequencies in a standard pseudodisambiguation task.
    We applied our method to three data sets from the literature.
    The results show that Web counts outperform counts re-created using a number of classbased smoothing techniques.
    However, counts re-created using an EM-based smoothing approach yielded better pseudodisambiguation performance than Web counts.
    To summarize, we have proposed a simple he
