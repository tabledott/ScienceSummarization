ness of the n-gram language model.
    We also propose a novel metric to measure word order similarity (or differences) between any pair of languages based on word alignments.
    Our metric shows that Chinese-English have a closer word order than Arabic-English.
    Our proposed distortion model relies solely on word alignments and is conditioned on the source words.
    The majority of word movement in translation is mainly due to syntactic differences between the source and target language.
    For example, Arabic is verb-initial for the most part.
    So, when translating into English, one needs to move the verb after the subject, which is often a long compounded phrase.
    Therefore, we would like to incorporate syntactic or part-of-speech information in our distortion model.
