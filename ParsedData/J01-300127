    Part-of-speech error: It is possible for the part-of-speech tagger to assign an incorrect part of speech, leading to the correct homograph being removed from consideration.
    It is worth mentioning that this situation has two possible outcomes: first, some homographs, with incorrect parts of speech, may remain; or second, all homographs may have been removed from consideration.
    In Table 3 we show in the column labelled Count the number of words in our five articles which fall into each of the four categories.
    The relative performance of the baseline method (choosing the first sense) compared to the reported algorithm (removing homographs using part-of-speech tags) are shown in the rightmost two columns.
