e HMM network by I empty words ci+ 1.2I The English word ci has a co l rest)onding eml)ty word el+ I.
  The I)osition of the eml)ty word encodes the previously visited English word.
  We enforce the following constraints for the tran- sitions in the HMM network (i _&lt; I, i _&lt; I): p(i  + I l i  , I )  = pff .
  5( i , i  ) V(i + I l l   + I, I )  = J J .
  5( i , i  ) p(i l i   + I, 1) = p(iIi  ,1) The parameter pff is the 1)robability of a transition to the emt)ty word.
  In our extleriments we set pIl = 0.2.
  Smooth ing For a t)etter estimation of infrequent events we in- troduce the following smoothing of alignment )rob- abilities: 1 F(a j I~ j - , ,~)  = ~" ~- + (1 - , , ) .p (a j la j _ l  , I ) in our exlleriments we use (t = 0.4.
