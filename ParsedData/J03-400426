sambiguation, rather than selectional preferences in isolation.
    Light and Greiff (2002) summarize some earlier WSD results for automatically acquired selectional preferences.
    These results were obtained for three systems (Resnik 1997; Abney and Light 1999; Ciaramita and Johnson 2000) on a training and test data set constructed by Resnik containing nouns occurring as direct objects of 100 verbs that select strongly for their objects.
    Both the test and training sets were extracted from the section of the Brown corpus within the Penn Treebank and used the treebank parses.
    The test set comprised the portion of this data within SemCor containing these 100 verbs, and the training set comprised 800,000 words from the Penn Treebank parses of the Brown corpus not within SemCor.
    All three systems obtained higher precision than the results we report here, with Ciaramita and Johnson&#8217;s Bayesian belief networks achieving the best accuracy at 51.4%.
    These results are not comparable with ours, h
