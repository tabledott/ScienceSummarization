native log-linear joint model for semantic role labeling, which incorporates more global features and achieves superior performance in comparison to state-of-the-art models.
    To deal with the computational complexity of the task, we employ dynamic programming and reranking approaches.
    We present performance results on the February 2004 version of PropBank on gold-standard parse trees as well as results on automatic parses generated by Charniak&#8217;s parser (Charniak, 2000).
  
  
    Consider the pair of sentences, Despite the different syntactic positions of the labeled phrases, we recognize that each plays the same role &#8211; indicated by the label &#8211; in the meaning of this sense of the verb give.
    We call such phrases fillers of semantic roles and our task is, given a sentence and a target verb, to return all such phrases along with their correct labels.
    Therefore one subtask is to group the words of a sentence into phrases or constituents.
    As in most previous work on semantic ro
