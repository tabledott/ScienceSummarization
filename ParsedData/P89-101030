    The proposed association ratio score provides a practical and objective measure which is often a fairly good approximation to the &amp;quot;art.&amp;quot; Since the proposed measure is objective, it can be applied in a systematic way over a large body of material, steadily improving consistency and productivity.
    But on the other hand, the objective score can be misleading.
    The score takes only distributional evidence into account.
    For example, the measure favors &amp;quot;set ... for&amp;quot; over &amp;quot;set ... down&amp;quot;; it doesn't
