ng being useful (necessary, even) in improving low-level OCR.
    There are several directions for improving accuracy.
    The biggest problem is that raw English frequency counts are not the best indication of whether a word is a possible source for transliteration.
    Alternative data collection methods must be considered.
    We may also consider changes to the model sequence itself.
