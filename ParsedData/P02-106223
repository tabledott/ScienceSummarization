not appearing as part of an entity, so should be almost whether is or in this context!
    The decision which effectively created the entity University for was the decision to tag for as C, and this has already been made.
    The independence assumptions in maximum-entropy taggers of this form often lead points of local ambiguity (in this example the tag for the word for) to create globally implausible structures with unreasonably high scores.
    See (Collins 1999) section 8.4.2 for a discussion of this problem in the context of parsing.
    Acknowledgements Many thanks to Jack Minisi for annotating the named-entity data used in the experiments.
