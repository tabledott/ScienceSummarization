 well for these pairs.
    Fung and McKeown's work also focuses on word alignment from noisy parallel corpora, where there are no clear sentence boundaries or perfect translations.
    Work on the translation of single words into multiword sequences that integrates techniques for machine-readable dictionaries with statistical corpus analysis (Klavans and Tzoukermann 1990; Klavans and Tzoukermann in press) is also relevant.
    While this work focuses on a smaller set of words for translation (movement verbs), it provides a sophisticated approach using multiple knowledge sources to address both one-to-many word translations and the problem of sense disambiguation.
    Given only one word in the source, their system, BICORD, uses the corpus to extend dictionary definitions and provide translations that are appropriate for a given sense but do not occur in the dictionary, producing a bilingual lexicon of movement verbs as output.
