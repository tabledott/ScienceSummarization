w to identify independent existential NPs requires that we have an understanding of why these NPs are existential.
    We classified independent existentials into two groups, semantic and syntactic.
    Semantically independent NPs are existential because they are understood by readers who share a collective understanding of current events and world knowledge.
    For example, we understand the meaning of &amp;quot;the F.B.I.&amp;quot; without needing any other information.
    Syntactically independent NPs, on the other hand, gain this quality because they are modified structurally.
    For example, in &amp;quot;the man who shot Liberty Valence,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;the man&amp;quot; is existential because the relative clause uniquely identifies its referent.
  
  
    Our goal is to build a system that can identify independent existential noun phrases automatically.
    In the previous section, we observed that &amp;quot;existentialism&amp;quot; can be granted to a definite noun phrase either through syntax
