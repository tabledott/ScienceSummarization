l-at-once, character-based&#8221; POS tagging in (Ng and Low, 2004), except that we are only tagging proper nouns.
    We call the 4label extension CRF-Lex-NR.
    The segmentation and MT performance of CRF-Lex-NR is listed in Table 7.
    With the 4-label extension, the OOV recall rate improved by 3.29%; while the IV recall rate stays the same.
    Similar to (Ng and Low, 2004), we found the overall F measure only goes up a tiny bit, but we do find a significant OOV recall rate improvement.
    On the MT performance, CRF-Lex-NR has a 0.32 BLEU gain on the test set MT05.
    In addition to the BLEU improvement, CRF-Lex-NR also provides extra information about proper nouns, which can be combined with postprocessing named entity translation modules to further improve MT performance.
  
  
    In this paper, we investigated what segmentation properties can improve machine translation performance.
    First, we found that neither character-based nor a standard word segmentation standard are optimal for MT, and sh
