hese differing tree representations of PP modification theoretically by considering their effect on very simple corpora, and empirically by means of a tree transformation/detransformation methodology introduced below.
    The corpus used as the source for the empirical study is version II of the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) corpus constructed at the University of Pennsylvania, modified as described in Charniak (1996), in that:
  
  
    The theory of PCFGs is described elsewhere (e.g., Charniak [1993]), so it is only summarized here.
    A PCFG is a CFG in which each production A -4 a in the grammar's set of productions P is associated with an emission probability P(A a) that satisfies a normalization constraint and a consistency or tightness constraint not discussed here, that PCFGs estimated from tree banks using the relative frequency estimator always satisfy (Chi and Geman 1998).
    A PCFG defines a probability distribution over the (finite) parse trees generated by the grammar, where the probability of a t
