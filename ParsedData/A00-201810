ctly the same form as Equation 4 in the following fashion: Note that the first term of the equation gives a probability based upon little conditioning information and that each subsequent term is a number from zero to positive infinity that is greater or smaller than one if the new information being considered makes the probability greater or smaller than the previous estimate.
    As it stands, this last equation is pretty much content-free.
    But let us look at how it works for a particular case in our parsing scheme.
    Consider the probability distribution for choosing the pre-terminal for the head of a constituent.
    In Equation 1 we wrote this as p(t I 1, H).
    As we discuss in more detail in Section 5, several different features in the context surrounding c are useful to include in H: the label, head pre-terminal and head of the parent of c (denoted as lp, tp, hp), the label of c's left sibling (lb for &amp;quot;before&amp;quot;), and the label of the grandparent of c (la).
    That is, we wish
