			However, we find no good correlation between the two as the preposition with the most senses is of (16), and that with the fewest is from (1), thus negating the idea that fewer senses make a preposition easierto learn.
			The reason may therefore be found else where, e.g. in the lexical properties of the contexts.
			A good picture of the model?s errors can be had by looking at the confusion matrix in Table 5,which reports, for each preposition, what the clas sifier?s incorrect decision was.
			Analysis of these errors may establish whether they are related to thedataset size issue noted above, or
