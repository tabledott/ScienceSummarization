    Our task is to automatically build a classifier that can distinguish the three major classes of optionally intransitive verbs in English.
    As described above, these classes are differentiated by their argument structures.
    In the first subsection below, we elaborate on our description of the thematic role assignments for each of the verb classes under investigation&#8212;unergative, unaccusative, and object-drop.
    This analysis yields a distinctive pattern of thematic assignment for each class.
    (For more detailed discussion concerning the linguistic properties of these classes, and the behavior of their component verbs, please see Stevenson and Merlo [1997b]; Merlo and Stevenson [2000b].)
    Of course, the key to any automatic classification task is to determine a set of useful features for discriminating the items to be classif
