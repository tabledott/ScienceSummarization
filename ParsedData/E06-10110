  Online Learning Of Approximate Dependency Parsing Algorithms
  
    In this paper we extend the maximum spanning tree (MST) dependency parsing framework of McDonald et al. (2005c) to incorporate higher-order feature representations and allow dependency structures with multiple parents per word.
    We show that those extensions can make the MST framework computationally intractable, but that the intractability can be circumvented with new approximate parsing algorithms.
    We conclude with experiments showing that discriminative online learning using those approximate algorithms achieves the best reported parsing accuracy for Czech and Danish.
  
  
    Dependency representations of sentences (Hudson, 1984; Me&#180;l&#711;cuk, 1988) model head-dependent syntactic relations as edges in a directed graph.
    Figure 1 displays a dependency representation for the sentence John hit the ball with the bat.
    This sentence is an example of a projective (or nested) tree representation, in which all edges can be
