nformation (Hindle, 1990; Church and Hanks, 1990; Dagan et al., 1995; Luk, 1995; D. Lin, 1998a).
    It does not apply in the present setting because it does not measure the similarity between two arbitrary probability distributions (in our case, P(Vin) and P(V1m)), but rather the similarity between a joint distribution P(Xi, X2) and the corresponding product distribution P(Xi)P(X2)&#8226; Hamming-type metrics (Cardie, 1993; Zavrel and Daelemans, 1997) are intended for data with symbolic features, since they count feature label mismatches, whereas we are dealing feature values that are probabilities.
    Variations of the value difference metric (Stanfill and Waltz, 1986) have been employed for supervised disambiguation (Ng and H.B.
    Lee, 1996; Ng, 1997); but it is not reasonable in language modeling to expect training data tagged with correct probabilities.
    The Dice coefficient (Smadja et al., 1996; D. Lin, 1998a, 1998b) is monotonic in Jaccard's coefficient (van Rijsbergen, 1979), so its inclusion in
