ly evaluated against until final ablation testing when writing this paper.
    The total number of features is 3.7 million, all of which are used under pure L2 regularization; but only 60,000 are selected by elastic net regularization with (A1, A2) = (0.25, 2), which achieves nearly the same (but no better) accuracy as pure L2,16 and we use it for all experiments.
    We observed that it was 16We conducted a grid search for the regularizer values on part of DAILY547, and many regularizer values give the best or nearly the best results.
    We suspect a different setup would have yielded similar results. possible to get radically smaller models with only a slight degradation in performance: (4, 0.06) has 0.5% worse accuracy but uses only 1,632 features, a small enough number to browse through manually.
    First, we evaluate on the new test set, training on all of OCT27.
    Due to DAILY547&#8217;s statistical representativeness, we believe this gives the best view of the tagger&#8217;s accuracy on English Twi
