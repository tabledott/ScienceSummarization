ormation in some practical applications: for instance, systems that use selected authors (e.g., the Rotten Tomatoes movie-review website &#8212; where, we note, not all authors provide explicit ratings) could require that someone submit rating-labeled samples of newlyadmitted authors&#8217; work.
    Moreover, our results at least partially generalize to mixed-author situations (see Section 5.2).
  
  
    Recall that the problem we are considering is multicategory classification in which the labels can be naturally mapped to a metric space (e.g., points on a line); for simplicity, we assume the distance metric throughout.
    In this section, we present three approaches to this problem in order of increasingly explicit use of pairwise similarity information between items and between labels.
    In order to make comparisons between these methods meaningful, we base all three of them on Support Vector Machines (SVMs) as implemented in Joachims&#8217; The standard SVM formulation applies only to binary classifi
