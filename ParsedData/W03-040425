ploit extraction patterns.
    (Turney, 2002) used patterns representing part-of-speech sequences, (Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown, 1997) recognized adjectival phrases, and (Wiebe et al., 2001) learned N-grams.
    The extraction patterns used in our research are linguistically richer patterns, requiring shallow parsing and syntactic role assignment.
    In recent years several techniques have been developed for semantic lexicon creation (e.g., (Hearst, 1992; Riloff and Shepherd, 1997; Roark and Charniak, 1998; Caraballo, 1999)).
    Semantic word learning is different from subjective word learning, but we have shown that MetaBootstrapping and Basilisk could be successfully applied to subjectivity learning.
    Perhaps some of these other methods could also be used to learn subjective words.
  
  
    This research produced interesting insights as well as performance results.
    First, we demonstrated that weakly supervised bootstrapping techniques can learn subjective terms from unannotated texts.
