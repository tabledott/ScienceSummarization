rnel, which is a special case of our tree kernel (if m=1 in Equation (3)).
			Our tree kernel not only counts the occurrence of each context-free sub-tree, which does not consider its ancestors, but also counts the occurrence of each context-sensitive sub-tree, which con siders its ancestors.
			As a result, our tree kernel is not limited by the constraints in previous tree kernels (as discussed in Section 2), such as Collins and Duffy (2001), Zhang et al(2006), Culotta and Sorensen (2004) and Bunescu and Mooney (2005a).
			Finally, let?s study the computational issue with our tree kernel.
			Although our tree kernel takes the context sensitive sub-trees into consideration, it only slightly increases the computational burden, compared with Collins and Duffy?s convolution tree kernel.
			This is due to that 0])2[],1[( 11 =D nn holds for the major ity of context-free sub-tree pairs (Collins and Duffy 2001) and that computation for context-sensitive sub tree pairs is necessary only when 0])2[],1[( 11 ?D nn and t
