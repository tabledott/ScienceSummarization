    And the cross-domain training set is smaller than in-domain in MP3, but it also achieve competitive performance with the in-domain.
    On the other hand, SVM-2&#8217;s result decreased compared with the in-domain experiments because the test domain changed.
    At the same time, SVM-PTree outperforms other methods which is similar in in-domain experiments.
  
  
    Opinion mining has recently received considerable attention.
    Amount of works have been done on sentimental classification in different levels (Zhang et al., 2009; Somasundaran et al., 2008; Pang et al., 2002; Dave et al., 2003; Kim and Hovy, 2004; Takamura et al., 2005).
