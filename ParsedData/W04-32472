    Extractive summarization produces summaries by choosing a subset of the sentences in the original documents.
    This process can be viewed as choosing the most central sentences in a (multi-document) cluster that give the necessary and enough amount of information related to the main theme of the cluster.
    Centrality of a sentence is often defined in terms of the centrality of the words that it contains.
    A common way of assessing word centrality is to look at the centroid.
    The centroid of a cluster is a pseudodocument which consists of words that have frequency*IDF scores above a predefined threshold.
    In centroid-based summarization (Radev et al., 2000), the sentences that contain more words from the centroid of the cluster are considered as central.
    Formally, the centroid score of a sentence is the cosine of the angle between the centroid vector of the whole cluster and the individual centroid of the sentence.
