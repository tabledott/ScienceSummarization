e)&amp;quot; in the post-conjunct.
    The dependency tree of this sentence that is supplemented correctly with the omitted modifiers is shown in Figure 15.
    Another type of ellipsis in CSs that is a serious problem is the omission of predicates in incomplete conjunctive structures.
    This type of ellipsis can be found by examining the failures of dependency analysis.
    The failure of dependency analysis here means that a head bunsetsu cannot be found for a certain bunsetsu in a certain range of analysis.
    When two predicates in a conjunctive predicative clause are the same, the first predicate is sometimes omitted and the remaining part constitutes the incomplete conjunctive structure (Figures 16a and 16b).
    In these structures, neither conjunct can be parsed into a dependency tree, because there is no predicate in it that should become the root node of a dependency tree.
    For this reason, by checking dependency analysis failures, we find incomplete conjunctive structures and start the proces
