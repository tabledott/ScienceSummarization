Table 3).
    Cf. column two of Table 4.
    &#8226; The first module can restrict the number of decisions to be made by the second one.
    This is the case in the combination of the chunking steps and the relations finder.
    Without the chunker, the relations finder would have to decide for every word, whether it is the head of a constituent that bears a relation to the verb.
    With the churlker., the relations finder has to make this decision for fewer words, namely only for those which are the last word in a chunk resp. the preposition of a PP chunk.
    Practically, this reduction of the number of decisions (which translates into a reduction of instances) as can be seen in the third column of Table 4.
    &#8226; The first module can reduce the number of elements used for the instances by counting one chunk as just one context element.
    We can see the effect in the feature that indicates the distance in elements between the focus and the verb.
    The more chunks are used, the smaller the average
