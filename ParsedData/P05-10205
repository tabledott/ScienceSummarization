n the three data sets for one of the performance metrics.
  
  
    As mentioned before, our approach differs from the standard approach primarily by (1) explicitly learning a ranker and (2) optimizing for clustering-level accuracy.
    In this section we will focus on discussing related work along these two dimensions.
    Ranking candidate partitions.
    Although we are not aware of any previous attempt on training a ranking model using global features of an NP partition, there is some related work on partition ranking where the score of a partition is computed via a heuristic function of the probabilities of its NP pairs being coreferent.2 For instance, Harabagiu et al. (2001) introduce a greedy algorithm for finding the highest-scored partition by performing a beam search in the space of possible partitions.
    At each step of this search process, candidate partitions are ranked based on their heuristically computed scores.
