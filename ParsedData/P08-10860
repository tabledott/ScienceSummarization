  Distributed Word Clustering for Large Scale Class-Based Language Modeling in Machine Translation
  
    In statistical language modeling, one technique to reduce the problematic effects of data sparsity is to partition the vocabulary into equivalence classes.
    In this paper we investigate the effects of applying such a technique to highermodels trained on large corpora.
    We introduce a modification of the exchange clustering algorithm with improved efficiency for certain partially class-based models and a distributed version of this algorithm to efficiently obtain automatic word classifications large vocabularies million words) ussuch large training corpora billion tokens).
    The resulting clusterings are then used in training partially class-based language models.
    We show that combining them with wordmodels in the log-linear model of a state-of-the-art statistical machine translation system leads to improvements in translation quality as indicated by the BLEU score.
