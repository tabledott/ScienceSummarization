parse for a sentence given the learned model.
    Previous work has shown that high-quality unlexicalized PCFGs can be learned from a treebank, either by manual annotation (Klein and Manning, 2003) or automatic state splitting (Matsuzaki et al., 2005; Petrov et al., 2006).
    In particular, we demonstrated in Petrov et al. (2006) that a hierarchically split PCFG could exceed the accuracy of lexicalized PCFGs (Collins, 1999; Charniak and Johnson, 2005).
    However, many questions about inference with such split PCFGs remain open.
    In this work, we present In Sec.
    3, we present a novel coarse-to-fine processing scheme for hierarchically split PCFGs.
    Our method considers the splitting history of the final grammar, projecting it onto its increasingly refined prior stages.
    For any projection of a grammar, we give a new method for efficiently estimating the projection&#8217;s parameters from the source PCFG itself (rather than a treebank), using techniques for infinite tree distributions (Corazza a
