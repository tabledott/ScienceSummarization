YP3A4 activity was decreased by L, S and F with IC(50) values of about 200 mM.
    In accordance with other Calibratable verbs such as rise, fall, decline, etc., this phrase would be labeled as an Arg2-EXTENT, regardless of its syntactic role.
    A Propbank has been built on top of the Penn Treebank, and has been used to train &#8220;semantic taggers&#8221;, for extracting argument roles for the predicates of interest, regardless of the particular syntactic context.1 Such semantic taggers have been developed by using machine learning techniques trained on the Penn Propbank (Surdeanu et al., 2003; Gildea and Palmer, 2002; Kingsbury and Palmer, 2002).
    However, the Penn Treebank and Propbank involve the annotation of Wall Street Journal text.
    This text, being a financial domain, differs in significant ways from the biomedical text, and so it is necessary for this approach to have a corpus of biomedical texts such as MEDLINE articles annotated for both syntactic structure (Treebanking) and shallow semant
