    Words home and place are paraphrases in the sense of &#8220;habitat&#8221;, but in the reference sentence &#8220;place&#8221; occurs in a different sense, being part of the collocation &#8220;take place&#8221;.
    In this case, the pair (home, place) cannot be used to rewrite the reference sentence.
    We formulate contextual substitution as a binary classification task: given a context r1 ... ri_1&#10065;ri+1 ... rm, we aim to predict whether wj can occur in this context at position i.
    For each candidate word wj we train a classifier that models contextual preferences of wj.
    To train such a classifier, we collect a large corpus of sentences that contain the word wj and an equal number of randomly extracted sentences that do not contain this word.
    The former category forms positive instances, while the latter represents the negative.
    For the negative examples, a random position in a sentence is selected for extracting the context.
    This corpus is acquired automatically, and does not
