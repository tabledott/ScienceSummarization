tain role in the relation.
    From this example, we create a two-by-two table, where each column represents the roles of the entities, and each row represents a different article, as shown in the bottom of Figure 2.
    We can extend this table by finding another article in the same manner.
    In this way, we gradually extend a table while retaining a relation among its columns.
    In this example, the obtained table is just what an IE system (whose task is to find a hurricane name and the affected place) would create.
    However, these articles might also include other things, which could represent different relations.
    For example, the governments might call for help or some casualties might have been reported.
    To obtain such relations, we need to choose different entities from the articles.
    Several existing works have tried to extract a certain type of relation by manually choosing different pairs of entities (Brin, 1998; Ravichandran and Hovy, 2002).
    Hasegawa et al. (2004) tried to extr
