 between languages.
    We then use a constraint driven learning algorithm to adapt the transferred parsers to the respective target language, obtaining an additional 16% error reduction on average in a multi-source setting.
    Our final parsers achieve state-of-the-art accuracies on eight Indo-European languages, significantly outperforming previous unsupervised and projected systems.
