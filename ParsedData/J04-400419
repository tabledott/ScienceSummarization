rules pick out a head that is preceded by a noninitial CC (Jane), will moving the head to be a child to the left of the CC (John) yield a coordinated phrase?
    If so, then the head should be moved&#8212;except when the parent is NPB. vi feature is true when generating right-hand +STOP+ nonterminal, because the NP the will to continue contains a verb.
  
  
    The trainer&#8217;s job is to decompose annotated training trees into a series of head- and modifier-generation steps, recording the counts of each of these steps.
    Referring to (1), each H, Li, and Ri are generated conditioning on previously generated items, and each of these events consisting of a generated item and some maximal history context is counted.
    Even with all this decomposition, sparse data are still a problem, and so each probability estimate for some generated item given a maximal context is smoothed with coarser distributions using less context, whose counts are derived from these &#8220;top-level&#8221; head- and modifier-gener
