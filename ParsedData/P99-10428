o answers for the human metric, in which case the system receives zero points for the question.
    This occurs 11% of the time in our test corpus.
    The question is still counted, meaning that the system receives a penalty in these cases.
    Thus the highest score a system could achieve for HumSent is 89%.
    Given that our current system can only respond with sentences from the text, this penalty is appropriate.
    The automated routine for preparing the answer key in AutSent selects as the answer key the sentence(s) with the highest recall (here sentence 1).
    Thus only sentence 1 would be counted as a correct answer.
    We have implemented all three metrics.
    HumSent and AutSent are comparable with human benchmarks, since they provide a binary score, as would a teacher for a student's answer.
    In contrast, the precision and recall scores of P&amp;R lack such a straightforward comparability.
    However, word recall from P&amp;R (called AnsWdRecall in Figure 3) closely mimics the scores of Hu
