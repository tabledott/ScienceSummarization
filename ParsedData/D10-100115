 d &#8712; D, y(i, j) = d(i, j) for all (i, j) &#8712; Ifirst} This problem has a very similar structure to the problem of integrated parsing and tagging, and we can derive a similar dual decomposition algorithm.
    The Lagrange multipliers u are a vector in R|Ifirst| enforcing agreement between dependency assignments.
    The algorithm (omitted for brevity) is identical to the algorithm in figure 1, but with Iuni, Y, Z, Bhead, and Ocfg, and Btag replaced with Ifirst, H, D, Bdep respectively.
    The algorithm only requires decoding algorithms for the two models, together with simple updates to the Lagrange multipliers.
  
  
    We now give formal guarantees for the algorithms in the previous section, showing that they solve LP relaxations of the problems in Eqs.
    2 and 3.
    To make the connection to linear programming, we first introduce the idea of marginal polytopes in section 5.1.
    In section 5.2, we give a precise statement of the LP relaxations that are being solved by the example algorithms,
