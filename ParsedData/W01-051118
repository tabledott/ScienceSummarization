l indicator variables were used as input to a neural network.
    This approach is of interest to see to what extent, if any, the MeSH-based features affect performance.
    Note also that this lexical neural-network approach is feasible in this setting because the number of unique words is limited (1184) &#8211; such an approach would not scale to larger problems.
    In Table 4 and in Figure 1 we report the results from these experiments.
    Neural network using lexical features only yields 62% accuracy on average across all 18 relations.
    A neural net trained on Model 6 using the MeSH terms to represent the nouns yields an accuracy of 61% on average across all 18 relations.
    Note that reasonable performance is also obtained for Model 2, which is a much more general representation.
    Table 4 shows that both methods achieve up to 78% accuracy at including the correct relation among the top three hypothesized.
    Multi-class classification is a difficult problem (Vapnik, 1998).
    In this problem,
