me test cases were disappointing.
    CorMet found no mapping between THEORY and ARCHITECTURE.
    This seems to be an artifact of the low-quality corpora obtained for these domains.
    The documents intended to be relevant to architecture were often about zoning or building policy, not the structure of buildings.
    For theory, many documents were calls for papers or about university department policy.
    It is unsurprising that there are no particular mappings between two sets of miscellaneous administrative and policy documents.
    The weakness of the ARCHITECTURE corpus also prevented CorMet from discovering any BODY &#8594; ARCHITECTURE mappings.
    Accuracy could be improved by refining the process by which domain-specific corpora are obtained to eliminate administrative documents or by requiring documents to have a higher density of domain-relevant terms.
    Is it meaningful when CorMet finds a mapping, or will it find a mapping between any pair of domains?
    To answer this question, CorMet was
