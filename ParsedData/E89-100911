ve rise (by default) to sentences such as: A2:&lt;sing fern nom&gt; == &amp;quot;Alxplur fern nom&gt;&amp;quot;.
    Using default inference, the example theory we used to illustrate global inference can be phrased more succinctly: In this version, we state that anything not specifically mentioned for V is inherited (by default) from CAT, whereas before we had to list cases (only 'sing' in the example) explicitly.
    Similarly Al inherits by default from CAT, and A2 from Al.
    The operation of path closure is non-monotonic: if we add more sentences to our original theory, some of our derived sentences may cease to be true.
    The two forms of inference in DATR are combined by taking the path closure of a theory first, and then applying the inference rules to the result.
    In other words, given a theory qc and a sentence S, S is provable from T if $ rd(pc1( 2)).
