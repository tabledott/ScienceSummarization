    Assigning a sense demands examining 10 to 20 members of each cluster, and each sense may be represented by several clusters.
    This method reduces the amount of manual intervention but still requires the examination of a hundred or so occurrences for each ambiguous word.
    A more serious issue for this method is that it is not clear what the senses derived from the clusters correspond to (see, for example Pereira, Tishby, and Lee [1993]); moreover, the senses are not directly usable by other systems, since they are derived from the corpus itself.
    Brown et al. (1991) and Gale, Church, and Yarowsky, (1992a, 1993) propose the use of bilingual corpora to avoid hand-tagging of training data.
    Their premise is that different senses of a given word often translate differently in another language (for example, pen in English is stylo in French for its 'writing implement' sense, and encls for its 'enclosure' sense).
    By using a parallel aligned corpus, the translation of each occurrence of a wor
