consider all possible word forms corresponding to each lemma (Shieber et al., 1990).
    In practice, it is advantageous to have morphological generation as a postprocessing component that is separate from the rest of the NLG system.
    A benefit is that since there are no competing claims on the representation framework from other types of linguistic and non-linguistic knowledge, the developer of the morphological generator is free to express morphological information in a perspicuous and elegant manner.
    A further benefit is that localising morphological knowledge in a single component facilitates more systematic and reliable updating.
    From a software engineering perspective. modularisation is likely to reduce system development costs and increase system reliability.
    As an individual module, the morphological generator will be more easily shareable between several different NLG applications, and integrated into new ones.
    Finally, such a generator can be used on its own in other types of appl
