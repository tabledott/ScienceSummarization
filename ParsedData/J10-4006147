with any of the research directions we have mentioned here.
    Indeed, we believe that the generalized nature of DM represents a precondition for distributional semantics to be able to satisfactorily address these more advanced challenges.
    A multi-purpose, distributional semantic resource like DM can allow researchers to focus on the next steps of semantic modeling.
    These include compositionality, but also modulating word meaning in context (Erk and Pad&#180;o 2008; Mitchell and Lapata 2008) and finding ways to embed the distributional memory in complex NLP systems (e.g., for question answering or textual entailment) or even embodied agents and robots.
    DM-style triples predicating a relation between two entities are common currency in many semantic representation models (e.g., semantic networks) and knowledgeexchange formalisms such as RDF.
    This might also pave the way to the integration of corpus-based information with other knowledge sources.
    It is hard to see how such integration could
