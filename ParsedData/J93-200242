this line of inquiry may lead to algorithms that can learn much of the grammar of a language starting with only a corpus and a general theory of the kinds of formal regularities to be found in natural languages.
    Some elements of syntax may not be learnable in this way (Lightfoot 1991), but the lexicon, morphology, and phonology together make up a substantial portion of the grammar of a language.
    If it does not prove possible to learn these aspects of grammar starting from a general ontology of linguistic regularities and using distributional analysis then that, too, is an interesting result.
    It would suggest that the task requires a more substantive initial theory of possible grammars, or some semantic information about input sentences, or both.
    In any case this line of inquiry promises to shed light on the nature of language, learning, and language learning.
  
  
    The experiments described above used the following 193 verbs, selected at random from the tagged version of the Brown Corpus.
