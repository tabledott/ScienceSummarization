grating over the distribution.
    However, in case of Student&#8217;s t-distribution, the solution to this does not exist in closed form, but we can use numerical methods.
    The size of the confidence interval can be computed by (5) The factor depends on the desired p-level of statistical significance and the sample size.
    See Table 2 for typical values.
    We described the standard method to compute statistical significance for some machine translation evaluation metrics.
    Unfortunately, this method to compute confidence intervals does not work for the BLEU metric, since the BLEU metric is not the mean of single sentence scores.
  
  
    Recall that we want to answer the following question: Given a test result of BLEU, we want to compute with a confidence (or p-level ) that the true BLEU score lies in an interval .
    Instead of using an analytical method to compute confidence intervals for the BLEU score, we resort to a randomized method, called bootstrap resampling.
    Bootstrap resampling has
