p2 when aFskip2/aRskip2=aFskip2/aPskip2, and C is the combination function.
    We call the skip-bigram-based Fmeasure, i.e.
    Equation 15, ROUGE-S.
    Using Equation 15 with ,B = 1 and S1 as the reference, S2&#8217;s ROUGE-S score is 0.5, S3 is 0.167, and S4 is 0.333.
    Therefore, S2 is better than S3 and S4, and S4 is better than S3.
    This result is more intuitive than using BLEU-2 and ROUGE-L. One advantage of skip-bigram vs. BLEU is that it does not require consecutive matches but is still sensitive to word order.
    Comparing skip-bigram with LCS, skip-bigram counts all in-order matching word pairs while LCS only counts one longest common subsequence.
    We can limit the maximum skip distance, dskip, between two in-order words that is allowed to form a skip-bigram.
    Applying such constraint, we limit skip-bigram formation to a fix window size.
    Therefore, computation time can be reduced and hopefully performance can be as good as the version without such constraint.
    For example, if we
