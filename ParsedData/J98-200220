Initially t is set to the entire tree.
    Also input to the algorithm is a co-occurrence data.
    The algorithm: Find-MDL. simple and efficient algorithm based on dynamic programming, which is guaranteed to find a model with the minimum description length.
    Our algorithm, which we call Find-MDL, recursively finds the optimal MDL model for each child subtree of a given tree and appends all the optimal models of these subtrees and returns the appended models, unless collapsing all the lower-level optimal models into a model consisting of a single node (the root node of the given tree) reduces the total descript
