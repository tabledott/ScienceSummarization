o using a constant but lower threshold just to reduce the failure rate.
    For example, running the algorithm at an initial threshold of 0.3 and a final threshold of 0.6 gives a failure rate of 0.45%, much less than the failure rate of 6.59% which corresponds to a constant threshold of 0.3 for both stages.'
    The above analyses show that the algorithm fails quite rarely when the threshold is low, and its performance can be improved with a sequence of increasing thresholds.
    We also studied cases where the algorithm does fail.
    For this purpose, we stratified 14 The curves in Figure 3 become noticeably less smooth for values of the final threshold that are greater than 0.8.
    This happens for all settings of a in Figure 3.
    This apparently different behavior for high threshold values can be traced to sampling issues.
    Since few of the 20,000 points in each sample meet the criterion of having Dice(AB, X) greater or equal to the threshold for high final threshold values, the estimate of the perc
