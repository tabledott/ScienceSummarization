 influence of linguistic knowledge on model performance by comparing models with varying degrees of linguistic complexity.
    To be able to assess the performance of our models across tasks (e.g., sentence ordering vs. summarization), we experimented with the same model types introduced in the previous experiment (see Section 4.3).
    We also investigate the training requirements for these models on the summary coherence task.
    Experiment 1 differs from the present study in the way coreference information was obtained.
    In Experiment 1, a coreference resolution tool was applied to humanwritten texts, which are grammatical and coherent.
    Here, we apply a coreference tool to automatically generated summaries.
    Because many summaries in our corpus are fraught with coherence violations, the performance of a coreference resolution tool is likely to drop.
    Unfortunately, resolving coreference in the input documents would require a multi-document coreference tool, which is currently unavailable to u
