 which is directly a request while 5.b is primarily a yes/no question.
    However, as Brown [1980] points out, this fails to account for responses to 5.a which follow from its literal form.
    One can answer &amp;quot;Yes&amp;quot; to 5.a and then go on to pass the salt.
    Brown proposes what she calls &amp;quot;frozen ISA forms&amp;quot; which directly relate surface form and indirect illocutionary force, bypassing the literal force.
    Frozen forms differ from normal rules mapping illocutionary forces to illocutionary forces in that they point to the relevant normal rule which provides the information necessary to the generation of responses to the surface forms.
    The speaker of 5.b or 5.c may in fact want the hearer to reach the salt, as does the speaker of 5.a, but he does not want his intention to be recognized by the hearer.
    Thus it appears that from the hearer's point of view the chain of inferences at the intended level should get turned off, soon after the recognition of the literal act.
