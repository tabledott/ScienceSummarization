 for relatively small corpora, we used the data made available for the WMT06 shared task (WMT, 2006).
    This exercise is conducted openly with access to all needed resources and is thus ideal for benchmarking statistical phrasebased translation systems on a number of language pairs.
    The WMT06 corpus is based on sentences extracted from the proceedings of the European Parliament.
    Separate sentence-aligned parallel corpora of about 700,000 sentences (about 150MB) are provided for the three language pairs having one of French, Spanish and German with English.
    SRILM language models based on the same source are also provided for each of the four languages.
    We used the provided 2000-sentence devsets for tuning loglinear parameters, and tested on the 3064-sentence test sets.
    Results are shown in table 1 for relativefrequency (RF), Good-Turing (GT), Kneser-Ney with 1 (KN1) and 3 (KN3) discount coefficients; and loglinear combinations of both RF and KN3 phrasetables with Zens-Ney-IBM1 (ZN-IBM1) s
