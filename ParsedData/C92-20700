  Word-Sense Disambiguation Using Statistical Models of Rogets Categories Trained on Large Corpora David Yarowsky AT&amp;T Bell  Laboratories 600 Mountain Avenue Murray  Hil l  N J, 07974 yarowsky@research.att .com Abst rac t This paper describes a program that disambignates English word senses in unrestricted text using statistical models of the major Rogets Thesaurus categories.
  Rogets categories serve as approximations of conceptual classes.
  The categories li ted for a word in Rogers index tend to correspond to sense distinctions; thus selecting the most likely category provides a useful evel of sense disambiguatiou.
  The selection of categories is accomplished by identifying and weighting words that are indicative of each category when seen in context, using a Bayesian theoretical framework.
  Other statistical approaches have required special corpora or hand-labeled training examples for much of the lexicon.
  Our use of class models overcomes this knowledge acquisition bottleneck, enabling trainin
