 introduce a dependency between the classifications of the sentence&#8217;s various constituents with a single parameter.
    Thus, it can handle the alternation of our example without, for example, introducing the role chosen for one constituent as an additional feature in the probability distribution for the next constituent&#8217;s role.
    It appears that because introducing additional features can further fragment our already sparse data, it is preferable to have a single parameter for the FEG prior.
    An interesting result reinforcing this conclusion is that some of the argumentstructure features that aided the system when individual frame elements were considered independently are unnecessary when using FEG priors.
    Removing the features passive and position from the system and using a smaller lattice of only the distributions not employing these features yields an improved performance of 82.8% on the role-labeling task using hand-annotated boundaries.
    We believe that, because these features
