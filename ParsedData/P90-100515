riented (nodes are words) and that an exclusion matrix is used to represent the co-occurrence conditions between modification links.
    A syntactic graph is, however, built after context-free parsing and is therefore used to represent only context-free parse trees.
    The formal descriptive power of syntactic graphs is not known.
    As will be discussed in Section 4, the formal descriptive power of CDG is strictly greater than that of CFG and hence, a constraint network can represent non-context-free parse trees as well.
    Sugimura et al. (1988) propose the use of a constraint logic program for analyzing modifier-modifiee relationships of Japanese.
    An arbitrary logical formula can be a constraint, and a constraint solver called CIL (Mukai 1985) is responsible for solving the constraints.
    The generative capacity and the computational complexity of this formalism are not clear.
    The above-mentioned works seem to have concentrated on the efficient representation of the output of a parsing process
