is equivalent to completeness of D&amp;RPlural, the proof of which is analogous to that of the completeness of D&amp;R, replacing {r} by S. Induction step: Suppose the lemma is true for all n &lt; i.
    Now consider a CNF cp whose longest union has length i; let cp contain m unions of length i, namely, cp1 n &#183; &#183; &#183; n cpm.
    Then cp can be written as the CNF x n cp1 n &#183; &#183; &#183; n cpm, where all the unions in x have length &lt; i.
    The lemma is true for all n &lt; i, so if x is sent to D&amp;RBoolean, then the output is some x' such that [[x']] = [[x]], in fewer than i phases; so if, instead, cp is sent to D&amp;RBoolean, then, after i &#8722; 1 phases, some possibly incomplete description 77 has been found, such that [[77]] C [[x]].
    Also, [[cp]] C [77]].
    Phase i inspects all unions of length i, including each of cp1, ... , cpm.
    Therefore, unless a description coextensive with cp is found before phase i, one will be found during phase i.
    To see this, suppose the al
