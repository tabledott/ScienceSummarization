ring, (b) A is a set of labeled arcs (wi, r, wj) (where wi, wj ? W and r ? R).
			We write wi  wj to express that wi precedes wj in the string W (i.e., i  j); we write wi r?
			wj to say that there is an arc from wi to wj labeled r, and wi ? wj to say that there is an arc from wi to wj (regardless of the label); we use ??
			to denote the reflexive and transitive closure of the unlabeled arcrelation; and we use ? and ??
			for the correspond ing undirected relations, i.e. wi ? wj iff wi ? wj or wj ? wi.
			the five conditions given in Figure 2 are satisfied.

			2.2 Parsing Algorithm.
			The parsing algorithm presented in Nivre (2003) is in many ways similar to the basic shift-reduce algorithm for context-free grammars (Aho et al, 1986), although theparse actions are different given that no nonterminal sym bols are used.
			Moreover, unlike the algorithm of Yamadaand Matsumoto (2003),
