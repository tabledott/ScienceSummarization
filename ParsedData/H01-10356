  Due to lack of space, the following sections will serve primarily as an overview of the algorithm and its salient issues.
  4.1 Part-of-speech Projection Issues First, because of considerable cross-language differences in fine- grained tag set inventories, this work focuses on accurately assign- ing core POS categories (e.g.
  noun, verb, adverb, adjective, etc.
  ), with additional distinctions in verb tense, noun number and pro- noun type as captured in the English tagset inventory.
  Although impoverished relative to some languages, and incapable of resolv- ing details such as grammatical gender, this Brown-corpus-based tagset granularity is sufficient for many applications.
  Furthermore, many finer-grained part-of-speech distinctions are resolved primar- ily by morphology, as handled in Section 7.
  Finally, if one desires to induce a finer-grained tagging capability for case, for example, one should project from a reference language such as Czech, where case is lexically marked.
