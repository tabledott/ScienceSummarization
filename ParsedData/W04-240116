sub LPR problems, min{cx : x &#8712; S&#8745;{xi = 0}} and min{cx : x &#8712; S&#8745;{xi = 1}}.
    Since any feasible solution provides an upper bound and any LPR solution generates a lower bound, the search tree can be effectively cut.
    Another strategy of dealing with non integer points, which is often combined with branch &amp; bound, is called cutting plane.
    When a non integer solution is given by LPR, it adds a new linear constraint that makes the non integer point infeasible, while still keeps the optimal integer solution in the feasible region.
    As a result, the feasible region is closer to the ideal polyhedron, which is the convex hull of feasible integer solutions.
    The most famous cutting plane algorithm is Gomory&#8217;s fractional cutting plane method (Wolsey, 1998), which can be shown that only finite number of additional constraints are needed.
    Moreover, researchers develop different cutting plane algorithms for different types of ILP problems.
    One example is (Wang and Reg
