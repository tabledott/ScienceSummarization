    First, there is reason to believe that better results can be obtained by using the probability distributions generated by the component systems, rather than just their best guesses (see, for example, Ting and Witten [19974.
    Second, in the present paper we have used disagreement between a fixed set of component classifiers.
    However, there exist a number of dimensions of disagreement (inductive bias, feature set, data partitions, and target category encoding) that might fruitfully be searched to yield large ensembles of modular components that are evolved to cooperate for optimal accuracy.
    Another open question is whether and, if so, when, combination is a worthwile technique in actual NLP applications.
    After all, the natural language text at hand has to be processed by each of the base systems, and then by the combiner.
    Now none of these is especially bothersome at run-time (most of the computational difficulties being experienced during training), but when combining N systems, the t
