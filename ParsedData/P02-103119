irst word of the argument.
    This heuristic matches the head word read from the parse tree 77% of the the time, as it correctly identifies the final word of simple noun phrases as the head, the preposition as the head of prepositional phrases, and the complementizer as the head of sentential complements.
    Using this process for determining head words, the system drops to 77.0% accuracy, indicating that identifying the relevant head word from semantic role prediction is in itself an important function of the parser.
    This chunker-based result is only slightly lower than the 79.2% obtained using automatic parses in the known boundary condition.
    These results for the known boundary condition are summarized in Table 4. gold parse auto parse gold parse chunks Table 4: Summary of results for known boundary condition We might expect the information provided by the parser to be more important in identifying the arguments in the sentence than in assigning them the correct role.
