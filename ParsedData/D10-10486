or named entity classification; Spitkovsky et al.
    (2010) used &#8220;baby steps&#8221; for unsupervised dependency parsing, etc.
    To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to apply this theory to coreference resolution.
  
  
    Intra-document coreference resolution clusters together textual mentions within a single document based on the underlying referent entity.
    Mentions are usually noun phrases (NPs) headed by nominal or pronominal terminals.
    To facilitate comparison with most of the recent previous work, we report results using gold mention boundaries.
    However, our approach does not make any assumptions about the underlying mentions, so it is trivial to adapt it to predicted mention boundaries (e.g., see Haghighi and Klein (2010) for a simple mention detection model).
    We used the following corpora for development and evaluation: We used the first corpus (ACE2004-ROTH-DEV) for development.
    The other corpora are reserved for testing.
    We parse all documents using the Sta
