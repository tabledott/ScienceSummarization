s of the form (q, pat) &#8594;w (q&#8242;, ()) are &#491;-rules, or epsilon rules, which substitute state q&#8242; for state q without producing output, and stay at the current input subtree.
    Multiple initial states are not needed: we can use a single start state Qi, and instead of each initial state q with starting weight w add the rule (Qi, TRUE) &#8594;w (q, ()) (where TRUE(t) &#8801; 1, &#8704;t).
    We define the binary relation &#8658;X for xR tranducer X on TE&#8746;o&#8746;Q&#215;(paths&#215;R)&#8727;, pairs of partially transformed (working) trees and derivation histories: That is, b is derived from a by application of a rule (q, pat) &#8594;w r to an unprocessed input subtree a &#8595; i which is in state q, replacing it by output given by r, with its nonterminals replaced by the instruction to transform descendant input subtrees at relative path i&#8242; in state q&#8242;.
    The sources of a rule r = (q, l, rhs, w) &#8712; R are the inputpath parts of the rhs nonterminals: If the sources of
