lowing, we examine, more specifically, efficient string-to-weight transducers: subsequential transducers.
    A transducer is said to be subsequential if its input is deterministic, that is if at any state there exists at most one outgoing transition labeled with a given element of the input alphabet E. Subsequential string-to-weight transducers are sometimes called weighted automata, or weighted acceptors, or probabilistic automata, or distance automata.
    Our terminology is meant to favor the functional view of these devices, which is the view that we consider here.
    Not all string-to-weight transducers are subsequential but we define an algorithm to determinize nonsubsequential transducers when possible.
    More formally a string-to-weight subsequential transducer T = (Q, i, F, E, (5, a, A, p) is an 8-tuple, with: A string w E E* is accepted by a subsequential transducer T if there exists f E F such that (5(i, w) = f .
    The output associated to w is then: A + cr(i, w) + p(f).
    We will use the f
