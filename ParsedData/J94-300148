 obligatory rules are anomalous in that they may produce no output at all.
    The following left-to-right rule is a case in point: &#8364; b/b If a string containing the symbol b is input to this rule, another b will be inserted immediately after it, and that one will serve to trigger the rule again.
    This process will never terminate, and no finite-length output is ever produced.
    Strange as they may seem, rules like this are useful as filters to eliminate undesired paths of derivation.
    In contrast to obligatory rules, optional rules typically produce many outputs.
    For example, if the rule above (a -4 b /ab ba) is marked as optional and left-to-right and is also applied to the string abababababa, the following, in addition to (1), would be among its outputs: The string (4) is similar to (1) except that only the leftmost application of the rule has been carried out.
    For (5) the application in the middle would not have been possible for the obligatory rule and is possible here only because t
