 were removed.
    Finally all remaining tokens were stemmed using Porter&#8217;s stemmer (Porter, 1980).
    In this paper, this manner of selecting terms is referred to as the n-gram approach.
    The implementation differs from Frank et al. (1999) in the following aspects: Only non-alphanumeric characters that were not present in any keyword in the training set were removed (keeping e.g., C++).
    Numbers were removed only if they stood separately (keeping e.g., 4YourSoul.com).
    Proper nouns were kept.
    The stemming and the stoplist applied were different.
    The stems were kept even if they appeared only once (which is true for 80.0% of the keywords present in the training set).
    NP-chunks That nouns are appropriate as content descriptors seems to be something that most agree upon.
    When inspecting manually assigned keywords, the vast majority turn out to be nouns or noun phrases with adjectives, and as discussed in Section 2, the research on term extraction focuses on noun patterns.
