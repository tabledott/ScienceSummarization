vious survey, it is obvious that it is very difficult to compare one set of results, and consequently one method, with another.
    The lack of comparability results from substantial differences in test conditions from study to study.
    For instance, different types of texts are involved, including both highly technical or domain-specific texts where sense use is limited and general texts where sense use may be more variable.
    It has been noted that in a commonly used corpus such as the Wall Street Journal, certain senses of typical test words such as line are absent entirely.'
    When different corpora containing different sense inventories and very different levels of frequency for a given word and/or sense are used, it becomes futile to attempt to compare results.
    Test words themselves differ from study to study, including not only words whose assignment to clearly distinguishable senses varies considerably or which exhibit very different degrees of ambiguity (e.g., bank vs. line), but also words
