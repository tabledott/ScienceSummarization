ng at word cooccurrence frequencies in bitexts (Gale &amp; Church, 1991; Kumano &amp; Hirakawa, 1994; Fung, 1995a; Melamed, 1995).
    A bitext comprises a pair of texts in two languages, where each text is a translation of the other.
    Word co-occurrence can be defined in various ways.
    The most common way is to divide each half of the bitext into an equal number of segments and to align the segments so that each pair of segments Si and Ti are translations of each other (Gale &amp; Church, 1991; Melamed, 1996a).
    Then, two word tokens (u, v) are said to co-occur in the
  
  
    Our translation model consists of the hidden parameters A+ and )c, and likelihood ratios L(u, v).
    The two hidden parameters are the probabilities of the model generating true and false positives in the data.
    L(u, v) represents the likelihood that u and v can be mutual translations.
    For each co-occurring pair of word types u and v, these likelihoods are initially set proportional to their co-occurrence frequency (&
