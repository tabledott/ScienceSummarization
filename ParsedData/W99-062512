phrase (in this case, a helicopter), while the other primitive must be a matching verb (in this case, &amp;quot;lost&amp;quot;.)
    The example shows a pair of textual units where this composite feature detects a valid match.
    An 011-58 helicopter, carrying a crew of two, was on a routine training (a) orientation when vas Li t about 11:30 am.
    Saturday (9:30 p.m. EST Friday).
    (b) &amp;quot;There were two people on board,&amp;quot; said Bacon.
    &amp;quot;W with the helicopter about 9:15 EST (0215 GMT).&amp;quot; Ordering. pairs of primitive elements are required to have the same relative order in both textual units (see Figure 2).
    Distance. pairs of primitive elements are required to occur within a certain distance in both textual units (see Figure 3).
    The maximum distance between the primitive elements can vary as an additional parameter.
    A distance of one matches rigid collocations whereas a distance of five captures related primitives within a region of the text unit [Smeaton 1992;
