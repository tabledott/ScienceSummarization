    Although there has been a fair amount of literature on sense-disambiguation, the literature does not offer much guidance in how we might establish the success or failure of a proposed solution such as the two described above.
    Most papers tend to avoid quantitative evaluations.
    Lesk (1986), an extremely innovative and commonly cited reference on the subject, provides a short discussion of evaluation, but fails to offer any very satisfying solutions that we might adopt to quantify the performance of our two disambiguation algorithms.3 Perhaps the most common evaluation technique is to select a small sample of words and compare the results of the machine with those of a human judge.
    This method has been used very effectively by Kelly and Stone (1975), Black (1988), Hearst (1991), and many others.
    Nevertheless, this technique is not without its problems, perhaps the worst of which is that the sample m
