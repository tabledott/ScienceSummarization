ermore, if there is a pronoun in the sentence for which the Focus List is built, the corresponding evoked discourse entity is shifted to the front of the list.
    The following elements of the Focus List are ordered by grammatical roles again.
    Hence, their approach still relies upon grammatical information for the ordering of the centering list, while we use only the functional information structure as the guiding principle.
    Given its embedding in a cognitive theory of inference loads imposed on the hearer and, even more importantly, its fundamental role in a more comprehensive theory of discourse understanding based on linguistic, attentional, and intentional layers, the centering model can be considered the first principled attempt to deal with preference orders for plausible antecedent selection for anaphors.
    Its predecessors were entirely heuristic approaches to anaphora resolution.
    These were concerned with various criteria&#8212;beyond strictly grammatical constraints such as agreement&
