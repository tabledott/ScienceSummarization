tion of monolingual paraphrase, interesting output can be produced without tackling the difficult problem of inter-phrase reordering.7 Therefore, along the lines of Tillmann et al. (1997), we rely on only monotone phrasal alignments, although we do allow intra-phrasal reordering.
    While this means certain common structural alternations (e.g., active/passive) cannot be generated, we are still able to express a broad range of phenomena: pings to be both unwieldy in practice and very often indicative of poor a word alignment.
    7 Even in the realm of MT, such an assumption can produce competitive results (Vogel et al. 2003).
    In addition, we were hesitant to incur the exponential increase in running time associated with those movement models in the tradition of Brown el al (1993), especially since these offset models fail to capture important linguistic generalizations (e.g., phrasal coherence, headedness).
    Our channel model, then, is determined solely by the phrasal replacements involved.
