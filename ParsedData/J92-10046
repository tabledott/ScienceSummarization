the parse tree, it becomes feasible to realize probabilistic semantic restrictions in an efficient manner.
    This also makes it straightforward to extract a semantic frame representation directly from an unannotated parse tree.
    The context-free rules are automatically converted to a shared network structure, and probability assignments are derived automatically from a set of parsed sentences.
    The probability assignment mechanism was deliberately designed to support an ability to predict a set of next-word candidates with associated word probabilities.
    Constraint mechanisms exist and are carried out through feature passing among nodes.
    A unique aspect of the grammar is that unification constraints are expressed one-dimensionally, being associated directly with categories rather than with rules.
    Syntactic and semantic fields are passed from node to node by default, thus making available by default the second argument to unification operations.
    This leads to a very efficient implementat
