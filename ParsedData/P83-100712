of D. The identity of this semantic interpretation is not something about which Donnellan is explicit.
    Distinct formal treatments of the semantics of definite descriptions in natural language would construe the appropriate interpretation differently.
    In semantic treatments based on possible worlds, the appropriate interpretation would be a (partial) function from possible worlds to objects; in the situation semantics expounded by Barwise and Perry, the appropriate interpretation is a (partial) function from resource to objects.
    As just described, the referential-attributive distinction appears to be exactly the distinction that Barwise and Perry formulate in terms of the value-loaded and valuefree interpretations of definite noun phrases.
    But this gloss omits an essential aspect of the referentialattributive distinction as elaborated by Donnellan.
    In view, a speaker may use referentially to refer to an object distinct from the semantic denotation of the description, and, moreover, to refer
