tation along with the argument labels for an example structure extracted from the PropBank corpus.Most of the experiments in this paper, unless speci fied otherwise, are performed on the July 2002 release of PropBank.
			A larger, cleaner, completely adjudicated version of PropBank was made available in Feb 2004.
			We will also report some final best performance numbers on this corpus.
			PropBank was constructed by assigning semantic arguments to constituents of the hand-corrected TreeBank parses.
			The data comprise several sections of the WSJ, and we follow the standard convention of using 1http://www.cis.upenn.edu/?ace/Section-23 data as the test set.
			Section-02 to Section 21 were used for training.
			In the July 2002 release, thetraining set comprises about 51,000 sentences, instantiat ing about 132,000 arguments, and the test set comprises 2,700 sentences instantiating about 7,000 arguments.
			TheFeb 2004 release training set comprises about 85,000 sen tences instantiating about 250,000 arguments
