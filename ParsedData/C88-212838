re) allows for the generation of strings from only a subset of the logical-form expressions that have natural-language re- lata, that is, LF1, LF2, and LF3 in the figure.
  We might call these the canonical ogical forms.
  Even if the grammar is reversible, the prob- lem remains, because logical equivalence is in general not computable.
  And even in restricted cases in which it is computable, for instance a logic with a confluence property under which all logically equivalent 61B expressions do have a canonical form, the problem is not solved unless the notion of canonical form implicit in the logic corresponds exactly to that of the natural-language grammar.
  It should be noted that this kind of problem is quite deep.
  Any,sys- tem that :represents meanings in some way (not necessarily with logical expressions) must face a correlate of this problem.
  Furthermore, al- though the issue impinges on syntax because it arises in the realm of grammar, it is primarily a semantic problem, as we will shortly see.
