es (i.e., parameter values which maximize 10) can not be found analytically, but the EM algorithm can be used to hill-climb to a local maximum of the likelihood function from some initial parameter settings.
    In our experiments we set the parameter values randomly, and then ran EM to convergence.
    Given parameter estimates, the label for a test example x is defined as We should note that the model in equation 9 is deficient, in that it assigns greater than zero probability to some feature combinations that are impossible.
    For example, the independence assumptions mean that the model fails to capture the dependence between specific and more general features (for example the fact that the feature full.-string=New_York is always seen with the features contains (New) and The baseline method tags all entities as the most frequent class type (organization). contains (York) and is never seen with a feature such as contains (Group) ).
    Unfortunately, modifying the model to account for these kind of depen
