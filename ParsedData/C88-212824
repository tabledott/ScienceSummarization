  This technique, a sort of indexing on meaning, replaces the indexing on string position that is more appropriate for parsing than generation.
  As a rule, filtering the items by making the priority function par- tial can lead to incompleteness of the parsing or generation process, n However, the subsumption filter described here for use in generation does not yield incompleteness of the generation algorithm under one assumption about the grammar, which we might call semant ic  mono- tonicity.
  A grammar is semantically monotonic if, for every phrase admitted by tim grammar, the semantic structure of each immediate subphrase subsumes some portion of the semantic structure of the en- tire phrase.
  Under this condition, items which do not subsume part of the goal meaning can be safely ignored, since any phrase built from them will also not subsume part of the goal meaning and thus will fail to s
