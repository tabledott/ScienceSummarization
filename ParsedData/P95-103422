ns 5 and 7.
    For evaluation, we compare English outputs from these three sources.
    We also look at lattice properties and execution speed.
    Space limitations prevent us from tracing the generation of many long sentences&#8212;we show instead a few short ones.
    Note that the sample sentences shown for the RANDOM extraction model are not of the quality that would normally be expected from a knowledge-based generator, because of the high degree of ambiguity (unspecified features) in our semantic input.
    This incompleteness can be in turn attributed in part to the lack of such information in Japanese source text and in part to our own desire to find out how much of the ambiguity can be automatically resolved with our statistical model.
    A final (abbreviated) example comes from interlingua expressions produced by the semantic analyzer of JAPANGLOSS, involving long sentences characteristic of newspaper text.
    Note that although the lattice is not much larger than in the previous examples, it no
