 from the first phase.
			Again, theSNoW learning architecture is used to train a multi class classifier to label each argument to one of the argument types, plus a special class?no argument(null).
			Training examples are created from the argu ment candidates supplied from the first phase using the following features: ? Predicate lemma &amp; POS tag, voice, position, clause Path, clause position, chunk pattern Same features as those in the first phase.?
			Word &amp; POS tag from the argument, includ ing the first,last,and head1 word and tag.?
			Named entity feature tells if the target argu ment is, embeds, overlaps, or is embedded in a named entity with its type.
			Chunk tells if the target argument is, embeds, overlaps, or is embedded in a chunk with its type.
			Lengths of the target argument, in the numbers of words and chunks separately.
			Verb class feature is the class of the active predicate described in PropBank Frames.
			Phrase type uses simple heuristics to identify the target argument as VP,
