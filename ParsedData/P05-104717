    This &#8220;sentence filtering&#8221; task is a more fine-grained evaluation and is likely to provide more information about how well a given set of patterns is likely to perform as part of an IE system.
    Soderland (1999) developed a version of the MUC-6 corpus in which events are marked at the sentence level.
    The set of patterns learned by the algorithm after each iteration can be compared against this corpus to determine how accurately they identify the relevant sentences for this extraction task.
    The evaluation corpus used for the experiments was compiled from the training and testing corpus used in MUC-6, where the task was to extract information about the movements of executives from newswire texts.
    A document is relevant if it has a filled template associated with it.
    590 documents from a version of the MUC-6 evaluation corpus described by Soderland (1999) were used.
    After the pre-processing stages described in Section 4, the MUC-6 corpus produced 15,407 patter
