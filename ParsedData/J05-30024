tion as input.
    In contrast, for this task we require text-to-text generation, the ability to produce a new text given a set of related texts as input.
    If language generation can be scaled to take fully formed text as input without semantic interpretation, selecting content and producing well-formed English sentences as output, then generation has a large potential payoff.
    In this article, we present the concept of sentence fusion, a novel text-to-text generation technique which, given a set of similar sentences, produces a new sentence containing the information common to most sentences in the set.
    The research challenges in developing such an algorithm lie in two areas: identification of the fragments conveying common information and combination of the fragments into a sentence.
    To identify common information, we have developed a method for aligning syntactic trees of input sentences, incorporating paraphrasing information.
    Our alignment problem poses unique challenges: We only want t
