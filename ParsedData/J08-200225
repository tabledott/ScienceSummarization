oposed and correct labelings.
    For example, the whole frame accuracy for ID&amp;CLS and ALL is 0, because the correct and guessed sets of labeled spans shown in Figure 2(c) do not match exactly.
    In the figures, &#8220;Acc.&#8221; is always an abbreviation for this whole frame accuracy.
    Even though this measure has not been used extensively in previous work, we find it useful to track.
    Most importantly, potential applications of role labeling may require correct labeling of all (or at least the core) arguments in a sentence in order to be effective, and partially correct labelings may not be very useful.
    Moreover, a joint model for semantic role labeling optimizes Whole Frame Accuracy more directly than a local model does.
    F-Measure (F1).
    Because there may be confusion about what we mean by F-Measure in this multi-class setting, we define it here.
    F-Measure is defined as the harmonic mean of precision and recall: f = 2&#215;p&#215;r&#8226; true positive r &#8211; true positive Th
