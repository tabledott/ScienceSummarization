    A very limited study by Gartin et al. (1994) gave a mean interlabeler standard deviation of 1.67 grade levels, but this study was limited to just 3 samples across 10 judges.
    Nevertheless, we believe that an objective element to readability assessment exists, and we state our main results in terms of correlation with difficulty level, so that at least a broad comparison with existing measures is possible.
    Our evaluation looked at four aspects of the model.
    First, we measured how well the model trained on our Web corpus generalized to other, previously unseen, test data.
    Second, we looked at the effect of passage length on accuracy.
    Third, we estimated the effect of additional training data on the accuracy of the model.
    Finally, we looked at how well the model could be extended to a language other than English &#8211; in this study, we give results for French.
    We used two methods for assessing how well our classifier generalizes beyond the Web training data.
    First,
