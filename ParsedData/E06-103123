we employed this method in our next experiment.
    An interesting topic in MT evaluation research is the question whether a linear combination of two MT evaluation measures can improve the correlation between automatic and human evaluation.
    Particularly, we expected the combination of CDER and PER to have a significantly higher correlation with human evaluation than the measures alone.
    CDER (as opposed to PER) has the ability to reward correct local ordering, whereas PER (as opposed to CDER) penalizes overly long candidate sentences.
    The two measures were combined with linear interpolation.
    In order to determine the weights, we performed data analysis on seven different corpora.
    The result was consistent across all different data collections and language pairs: a linear combination of about 60% CDER and 40% PER has a significantly higher correlation with human evaluation than each of the measures alone.
    For the two corpora studied here, the results of the combination can be found in T
