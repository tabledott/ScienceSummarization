) in the example implicitly requires generation of a coordinator tag/word pair through the P,, parameter.
    The generation of this tag/word pair is conditioned on the two words in the coordination dependency (man and dog in the example) and the label on their relationship (NP,NP,NP in the example, representing NP coordination).
    The coord flag is implicitly zero when normal nonterminals are generated; for example, the phrase S(bought) &#8594; NP(week) NP(IBM) VP(bought) now has probability This section describes our treatment of &#8220;punctuation&#8221; in the model, where &#8220;punctuation&#8221; is used to refer to words tagged as a comma or colon.
    Previous work&#8212;the generative models described in Collins (1996) and the earlier version of these models described in Collins (1997)&#8212;conditioned on punctuation as surface features of the string, treating it quite differently from lexical items.
    In particular, the model in Collins (1997) failed to generate punctuation, a deficiency of the
