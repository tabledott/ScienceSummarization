 z&#65533; = (z1,..., zn) where zi = 1 if fi E Fz otherwise zi = 0, i.e. the characteristic vector of the set Fz with respect to F. If we choose as a kernel function the scalar product we obtain the linear kernel KL(Fx, Fz) = x&#65533;&#183; z.
    Another function which is the current stateof-the-art of predicate argument classification is the polynomial kernel: Kp(Fx, Fz) = (c+x&#183;z-)d, where c is a constant and d is the degree of the polynom.
  
  
    We propose two different convolution kernels associated with two different predicate argument sub-structures: the first includes the target predicate with one of its arguments.
    We will show that it contains almost all the standard feature information.
    The second relates to the sub-categorization frame of verbs.
    In this case, the kernel function aims to cluster together verbal predicates which have the same syntactic realizations.
    This provides the classification algorithm with important clues about the possible set of arguments suited for
