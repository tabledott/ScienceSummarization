			The secondbaseline system is a sentence compression sys tem (Filippova and Strube, 2008a) whose demo system is available online.8 As the compressionsystem can only perform dropping, we further ex tend it to our third and fourth baseline systems, in order to make a reasonable comparison.
			In our third baseline system, we substitute the words in the output of the compression system with their simpler synonyms.
			This is done by looking up the synonyms in Wordnet and selecting the mostfrequent synonym for replacement.
			The word fre quency is counted using the articles from Simple Wikipedia.
			The fourth system performs sentence splitting on the output of the third system.
			This is simply done by splitting the sentences at ?and?,?or?, ?but?, ?which?, ?who?
			and ?that?, and dis carding the border words.
			In total, there are 5systems in our evaluation: Moses, the MT system; C, the compression system; CS, the compression+substitution system; CSS, the compres sion+substitution+split system; TSM, o
