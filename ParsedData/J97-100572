    Expanding the definition of infer also reduces the number of proposed boundaries: recall that the algorithm does not assign a boundary if there is an inferential link between an NP in the current utterance unit and the prior utterance unit.
    Three types of inference relations linking successive clauses (Ci_i, C1) were added (originally there were five types [Passonneau 1994]).
    Now, a pronoun (e.g., it, that, this) in C, referring to an action, event, or fact inferable from C,_i provides an inferential link.
    So does an implicit argument, as in Figure 13, where the missing argument of notice is inferred to be the event of the pears falling.
    The third case is where an NP in C, is described as part of an event that results directly from an event mentioned in C Misclassification of boundaries (&amp;quot;c&amp;quot; type errors; see Figure 8) often occurred where prosodic and cue features conflicted with NP features.
    The original NP algorithm assigned boundaries wherever the thr
