andidate and continues with the following step.
    Stage 4&#8212;Step 6: Determination of word ordering.
    Once a multiword translation has been selected, Champollion examines all the sentences containing the selected translation to determine whether the collocation is flexible (i.e., word order is not fixed) or rigid.
    Champollion looks at all the sentences containing the target language collocation and determines if the words involved are used consistently (i.e., in at least 60% of the cases) in the same order and at the same distance from one another.
    If the collocation is found to be rigid, the word order and the interword distances are also reported.
    Note that although this is a postprocessing stage, it does not require any sentence of the corpus to be reread, since the necessary information has already been precomputed.
    For the official languages example, Champollion determines that langues appears before officielles with no intervening words and produces the rigid collocation langues
