ng around 2.5KB/s on a PITT 450 with 256 MB RAM (independently of the size of the input file; the processing requirement is linear in relation to the text size).
    Scalability was tested by running the ANNIE modules over a randomly chosen part of the British National Corpus (10% of all documents), which contained documents of up to 17MB in size.
  
  
    Since many NLP algorithms require annotated corpora for training, GATE's development environment provides easy-to-use and extendable facilities for text annotation.
    In order to test their usability in practice, we used these facilities to build corpora of named entity annotated texts for the MUSE, ACE, and MUMIS applications.
    The annotation can be done manually by the user or semi-automatically by running some processing resources over the corpus and then correcting/adding new annotations manually.
    Depending on the information that needs to be annotated, some ANNIE modules can be used or adapted to bootstrap the corpus annotation task.
