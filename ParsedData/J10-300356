overage is very low primarily due to restrictions on the patterns that may be extracted in Step 2.
    In addition, if the average number of entities in sentences is low, the likelihood of creating incorrect paraphrases is confirmed to be higher.
    Let us now consider the altogether separate idea of deriving coarse-grained correspondences by leveraging the comparable nature of the corpora.
    Barzilay and Lee (2003) attempt to do so by generating compact sentence clusters in template form (stored as word lattices with slots) separately from each corpora and then pairing up templates from one corpus with those from the other.
    Once the templates are paired up, a new incoming sentence that matches one member of a template pair gets rendered as the other member, thereby generating a paraphrase.
    They use as input a pair of corpora: the first (C1) consisting of clusters of news articles published by Agence France Presse (AFP) and the second (C2) consisting of those published by Reuters.
    The two corpo
