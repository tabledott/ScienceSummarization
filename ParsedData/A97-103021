    Victoria and Albert Museum in London remains intact.
    Nominator's other heuristics resemble those discussed above in that they check for typographical patterns or for the presence of particular name types to the left or right of certain operators.
    Some heuristics weigh the relative scope strength in the substrings on either side of the operator.
    If the scope strength is similar, the string is split.
    We have observed that this type of heuristic works quite well.
    Thus, the string The Natural History Museum and The Board of Education is split at and because each of its substrings contains a strong-scope NP-head (as we define it) with modifiers within its scope.
    These two substrings are better balanced than the substrings of The Food and Drug Administration where the left substring does not contain a strong-scope NP-head while the right one does (Administration).
    Because of the principle that noisy data is preferable to loss of information, Nominator does not split names if relat
