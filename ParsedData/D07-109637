provide parsing decisions, which are added together for a combined score for each potential dependencyarc.
			The tree that maximizes the sum of these com bined scores is taken as the final output parse.
			This technique is used by Sagae and Tsujii (2007) and in the Nilsson system (Hall et al, 2007a).
			It is worthnoting that both these systems combine transition based base parsers with a graph-based method for parser combination, as first described by Sagae and Lavie (2006).
			Data-driven grammar-based parsers, such as Bick (2007), Schneider et al (2007), and Watson andBriscoe (2007), need pre- and post-processing in order to map the dependency graphs provided as train ing data to a format compatible with the grammar used, and vice versa.
			5.2 Transition-Based Parsers.
			Transition-based parsers build dependency graphs by performing sequences of actions, or transitions.
			Both learning and inference is conceptualized in 6They also flip the order of the labeler and the reranker.
