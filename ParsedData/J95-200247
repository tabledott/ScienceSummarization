ction is applied in generating the training corpus.
    After that, the Mstep consists of a simple normalization of these counts to yield the new production probabilities.
    In this section we examine the computation of production count expectations required for the E-step.
    The crucial notion introduced by Baker (1979) for this purpose is the &amp;quot;outer probability&amp;quot; of a nonterminal, or the joint probability that the nonterminal is generated with a given prefix and suffix of terminals.
    Essentially the same method can be used in the Earley framework, after extending the definition of outer probabilities to apply to arbitrary Earley states.
    Given a string x, Ix1 = I, the outer probability 0,(kX A./t) of an Earley state is the sum of the probabilities of all paths that Outer probabilities complement inner probabilities in that they refer precisely to those parts of complete paths generating x not covered by the corresponding inner probability -y,(kX &#8212;&gt; A.p).
    Therefore, th
