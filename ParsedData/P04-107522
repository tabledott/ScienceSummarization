   However these works just follow a single criterion.
    (McCallum and Nigam 1998; Tang et al. 2002) are the only two works considering the representativeness criterion in active learning.
    (Tang et al. 2002) use the density information to weight the selected examples while we use it to select examples.
    Moreover, the representativeness measure we use is relatively general and easy to adapt to other tasks, in which the example selected is a sequence of words, such as text chunking, POS tagging, etc.
    On the other hand, (Brinker 2003) first incorporate diversity in active learning for text classification.
    Their work is similar to our local consideration in Section 2.3.2.
    However, he didn&#8217;t further explore how to avoid selecting outliers to a batch.
    So far, we haven&#8217;t found any previous work integrating the informativeness, representativeness and diversity all together.
  
  
    In this paper, we study the active learning in a more complex NLP task, named entity recognition.
