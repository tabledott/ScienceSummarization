 and the distortion model simply assigns no penalty to a monotonic jump, and a fixed penalty to all other jumps, equal to the non-exact-match penalty in the similarity model.
    There have been other hypothesis alignment methods.
    Karakos, et al. (2008) proposed an ITGbased method for hypothesis alignment, Rosti et al.
    (2008) proposed an incremental alignment method, and a heuristic-based matching algorithm was proposed by Jayaraman and Lavie (2005).
  
  
    In this section, we evaluate our IHMM-based hypothesis alignment method on the Chinese-toEnglish (C2E) test in the constrained training track of the 2008 NIST Open MT Evaluation (NIST, 2008).
    We compare to the TER-based method used by Rosti et al. (2007).
    In the following experiments, the NIST BLEU score is used as the evaluation metric (Papineni et al., 2002), which is reported as a percentage in the following sections.
    In our implementation, the backbone is selected with MBR.
    Only the top hypothesis from each single system is c
