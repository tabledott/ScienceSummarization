	Tree Kernel-Based Relation Extraction with Context-Sensitive Structured Parse Tree Information
		This paper proposes a tree kernel with contextsensitive structured parse tree information for re lation extraction.
		It resolves two critical problems in previous tree kernels for relation extraction in two ways.
		First, it automatically determines a dynamic context-sensitive tree span for relation ex traction by extending the widely-used Shortest Path-enclosed Tree (SPT) to include necessary context information outside SPT.
		Second, it pro poses a context-sensitive convolution tree kernel, which enumerates both context-free and context sensitive sub-trees by considering their ancestor node paths as their contexts.
		Moreover, this paper evaluates the complementary nature between our tree kernel and a state-of-the-art linear kernel.
		Evaluation on the ACE RDC corpora shows that our dynamic context-sensitive tree span is much more suitable for relation extraction than SPT and our tree kernel outperforms the s
