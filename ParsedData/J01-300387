h 61% accuracy.
    Dorr also remarks that this result could be improved to 83% if missing LDOCE codes were added.
    While Dorr's work requires finding exact exemplars of the alternation, Oishi and Matsumoto (1997) present a method that, like ours, uses surface indicators to approximate underlying properties.
    From a dictionary of dependency relations, they extract case-marking particles as indicators of the grammatical function properties of the verbs (which they call thematic properties), such as subject and object.
    Adverbials indicate aspectual properties.
    The combination of these two orthogonal dimensions gives rise to a classification of Japanese verbs.
    Other work has sought to combine corpus-based extraction of verbal properties with statistical methods for classifying verbs.
    Siegel's work on automatic aspectual classification (1998, 1999) also reveals a close relationship between verb-related syntactic and semantic information.
    In this work, experiments to learn aspectual class
