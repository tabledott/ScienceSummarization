teristics are that the scope is very short (5 tokens average in clinical reports) and that it scopes to the right over a noun phrase.
    (4) No findings to account for symptoms.
    No signs of tuberculosis.
    The lower performance of the system on the papers subcorpus compared to the abstracts subcorpus is due to the high proportion of the negation signal not (53.22 %), which scores a low PCS (39.50), as shown in Table 7.
    Table 7 also shows that, except for can not, all negation signals score a lower PCS on the papers subcorpus.
    This difference can not be caused by the sentence length, since the average sentence length in the abstracts subcorpus (26.43 tokens) is similar to the average sentence length in the papers subcorpus (26.24).
    The difference may be related to the difference in the length of the scopes and their direction.
    For example, the average length of the scope of not is 8.85 in the abstracts subcorpus and 6.45 in the papers subcorpus.
    The scopes to the left for not amount
