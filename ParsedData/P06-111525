better than either versionof SILT and performs comparable to WASP.
			Although SCISSOR gives less precision at lower re call values, it gives much higher maximum recall.However, we note that SCISSOR requires more supervision for the training corpus in the form of se mantically annotated syntactic parse trees for thetraining sentences.
			CHILL could not be run beyond 160 training examples because its Prolog im plementation runs out of memory.
			For 160 trainingexamples it gave 49.2% precision with 12.67% re call.
			Figure 7 shows the results on the GEOQUERY corpus.
			KRISP achieves higher precisions than WASP on this corpus.
			Overall, the results show that KRISP performs better than deterministic rule-based semantic parsers like CHILL and SILTand performs comparable to other statistical se mantic parsers like WASP and SCISSOR.
