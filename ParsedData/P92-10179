rd formulas for the inside and outside probabilities and rule probability reestimation (Baker, 1979; Lan i and Young, 1990; Jelinek et al., 1990) to involve only constituents whose spans are compatible with string bracketings.
    For this purpose, for each bracketed string c = (w, B) we define the auxiliary function f 1 if (i, j) is valid for b E B The reestimation formulas for the extended algorithm are shown in Table 1.
    For each bracketed sentence c in the training corpus, the inside probabilities of longer spans of c are computed from those for shorter spans with the recurrence given by equations (1) and (2).
    Equation (2) calculates the expected relative frequency of derivations of iwk from Ap compatible with the bracketing B of c = (w,B).
    The multiplier e(i,k) is 1 just in case (i, k) is valid for B, that is, when Ap can derive iwk compatibly with B.
    Similarly, the outside probabilities for shorter spans of c can be computed from the inside probabilities and the outside probabilities for
