tion of Pr(alv, n) and Pr(pja,v,n) is problematic since our training data, i.e., the head words extracted from raw text, occur with either n or v, but never both n, v. This leads to make some heuristically motivated approximations.
    Let the random variable 0 range over {true, false), and let it denote the presence or absence of any preposition that is unambiguously attached to the noun or verb in question.
    Then p(cb = trueln) is the conditional probability that a particular noun n in free text has an unambiguous prepositional phrase attachment.
    (0 = true will be written simply as true.)
    We approximate Pr(alv, n) as follows: The rationale behind this approximation is that the tendency of a v, n pair towards a noun (verb) attachment is related to the tendency of the noun (verb) alone to occur with an unambiguous prepositional phrase.
    The Z(v, n) term exists only to make the approximation a well formed probability over a E IN, 171.
    We approximate Pr(pla,v,n) as follows: The rationale behin
