scores derived from the discourse trees built by each analyst.2 The Spearman correlation coefficient between the ranks assigned for each textual unit on the bases of the discourse trees built by the two analysts was very high: 0.798, at p &lt; 0.0001 level of significance.
    The differences between the two analysts came mainly from their interpretations of two of the texts: the discourse trees of one analyst mirrored the paragraph structure of the texts, while the discourse trees of the other mirrored a logical organization of the text, which that analyst believed to be important.
    The Spearman correlation coefficients with respect to the importance of textual units between the discourse trees built by our program and those built by each analyst were 0.480, p &lt; 0.0001 and 0.449, p &lt; 0.0001.
    These lower correlation values were due to the differences in the overall shape of the trees and to the fact that the granularity of the discourse trees built by the program was not as fine as that of the tr
