 Shieber 1983).
    More recently, however, it has been shown that accurate syntactic disambiguation for natural language can be achieved using a pseudo-deterministic approach, where treebank-induced classifiers are used to predict the optimal next derivation step when faced with a nondeterministic choice between several possible actions.
    Compared to the more traditional methods for natural language parsing, this can be seen as a severe form of pruning, where parse selection is performed incrementally so that only a single analysis is derived by the parser.
    This has the advantage of making the parsing process very simple and efficient but the potential disadvantage that overall accuracy suffers because of the early commitment enforced by the greedy search strategy.
    Somewhat surprisingly, though, research has shown that, with the right choice of parsing algorithm and classifier, this type of parser can achieve state-of-the-art accuracy, especially when used with dependency-based syntactic represent
