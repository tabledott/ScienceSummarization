cter level.
    To normalize this distance into a range from 0 (for identical words) to 1 (for completely different words), we divide the absolute distance by the length of the Levenshtein alignment path.
    Another character-based substitution cost function we studied is based on the common prefix length of both words.
    In English, different tenses of the same verb share the same prefix; which is usually the stem.
    The same holds for different cases, numbers and genders of most nouns and adjectives.
    However, it does not hold if verb prefixes are changed or removed.
    On the other hand, the common prefix length is sensitive to critical prefixes such as &#8220;mis-&#8221; for the same reason.
    Consequently, the common prefix length, normalized by the average length of both words, gives a reasonable measure for the similarity of two words.
    To transform the normalized common prefix length into costs, this fraction is then subtracted from 1.
    More sophisticated methods could be considered f
