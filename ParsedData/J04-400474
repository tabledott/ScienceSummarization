 sentence).
    Also, note that there is no coord flag, as coordinating conjunctions are generated in the same way as regular modifying nonterminals when they are dominated by NPB.
    Finally, we define M0 = H, that is, the head nonterminal label of the base NP that was generated using a PH parameter.
    The two parameter classes for generating punctuation and coordinating conjunctions, Ppunc and Pcoord, have the following back-off structures (Collins, personal communication, October 2001), where 2 type ttype The parameter classes for generating fully lexicalized root nonterminals given the hidden root +TOP+, PTOP and PTOPw, have the following back-off structures (identical to Table 3; n/a: not applicable).
    The parameter classes for generating prior probabilities on lexicalized nonterminals M(w, t), Ppriorw and PpriorNT, have the following back-off structures, where prior is a dummy variable to indicate that Ppriorwis not smoothed (although the Ppriorw parameters still have an associated smoothing weigh
