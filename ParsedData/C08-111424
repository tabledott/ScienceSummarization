			PairClass does not use the singular value decomposition (SVD) to smooth the feature vectors.
			It has been our experience that SVD is not necessary with SVMs.
			PairClass generates probability estimates,whereas Turney (2006) uses a cosine mea sure of similarity.
			Probability estimates canbe readily used in further downstream pro cessing, but cosines are less useful.?
			The automatically generated patterns in PairClass are slightly more general than the pat terns of Turney (2006).
			The morphological processing in PairClass (Minnen et al, 2001) is more sophisticated than in Turney (2006).
