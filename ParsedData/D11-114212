sing a pattern over POS tags.
    A deeper syntactic analysis of the input sentence would provide a much more general language for modeling relation phrases.
    For example, one could create a model of relations expressed in Figure 1: A simple part-of-speech-based regular expression reduces the number of incoherent extractions like was central torpedo and covers relations expressed via light verb constructions like gave a talk at.
    The syntactic constraint requires the relation phrase to match the POS tag pattern shown in Figure 1.
    The pattern limits relation phrases to be either a verb (e.g., invented), a verb followed immediately by a preposition (e.g., located in), or a verb followed by nouns, adjectives, or adverbs ending in a preposition (e.g., has atomic weight of).
    If there are multiple possible matches in a sentence for a single verb, the longest possible match is chosen.
    Finally, if the pattern matches multiple adjacent sequences, we merge them into a single relation phrase (e.g., wan
