the precision was not extremely bad (around 75-85%), recall was too low (lower than 50%)&#8212;i.e. every second person name or organization failed to be assigned.
    For document retrieval purposes low recall is not necessarily a major problem since it is often sufficient to recognize just one occurrence of each distinctive entity per document, and many of the unassigned person and organization names were just repetitions of their full variants.
    But for many other applications, and for the muc competition, higher recall and precision are necessary.
    The system we fielded for muc-7 makes extensive use of what McDonald (1996) calls internal (phrasal) and external (contextual) evidence in named entity recognition.
    The basic philosophy underlying our approach is as follows.
    A string of words like &amp;quot;Adam Kluver&amp;quot; has an internal (phrasal) structure which suggests that this is a person name; but we know that it can also be used as a shortcut for a name of organization (&amp;quot;Ada
