rent methods for combining classifier outputs.
    We suspect that the features we have chosen to use for combination are not the optimal set of features.
    We need to carefully study the different algorithms to find possible cues that can indicate where a particular tagger performs well.
    We hope that by following these general directions, we can further exploit differences in classifiers to improve accuracy in lexical disambiguation.
