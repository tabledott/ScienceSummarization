fsets &#8212;1 and &#8212;2, &#8212;1 and +1, and +1 and +2, and sorts them using a log-likelihood ratio to find the most reliable evidence for disambiguation.
    Yarowsky makes the observation that the optimal value of k varies with the kind of ambiguity: he suggests that local ambiguities need only a window of k = 3 or 4, while semantic or topic-based ambiguities require a larger window of 20-50 words (see Section 3.1.2).
    No single best measure is reported, suggesting that for different ambiguous words, different distance relations are more efficient.
    Furthermore, because Yarowsky also uses other information (such as part of speech), it is difficult to isolate the impact of window-size alone.
    Leacock, Chodorow, and Miller (this volume) use a local window of &#177;3 open-class words, arguing that this number showed best performance in previous tests.
    Collocation.
    The term &amp;quot;collocation&amp;quot; has been used variously in WSD work.
    The term was popularized by J. R. Firth in h
