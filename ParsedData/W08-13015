more directly, it owes a debt to both the sets of grammatical relations and the naming defined in two representations that follow an LFG style: the GR (Carroll et al., 1999) and PARC (King et al., 2003) schemes.
    These were used as a starting point for developing the Stanford dependencies (de Marneffe et al., 2006).
    But where the SD scheme deviates from GR, PARC, and its LFG roots is that it has been designed to be a practical model of sentence representation, particularly in the context of relation extraction tasks.
    SD makes available two options, suited to different use cases: in one, every word of the original sentence is present as a node with relations between it and other nodes, whereas in the latter, certain words are &#8220;collapsed&#8221; out of the representation, making such changes as turning prepositions into relations.
    The former is useful when a close parallelism to the source text words must be maintained, whereas the latter is intended to be more useful for relation extraction
