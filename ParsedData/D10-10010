  On Dual Decomposition and Linear Programming Relaxations for Natural Language Processing
  
    paper introduces decomposition a framework for deriving inference algorithms for NLP problems.
    The approach relies on standard dynamic-programming algorithms as oracle solvers for sub-problems, together with a simple method for forcing agreement between the different oracles.
    The approach provably solves a linear programming (LP) relaxation of the global inference problem.
    It to algorithms that are in that they existing decoding algorithms; in that they avoid exact algorithms for the full and often in that empirically they often recover the correct solution in spite of using an LP relaxation.
    We give experimental results on two problems: 1) the combination of two lexicalized parsing models; and 2) the combination of a lexicalized parsing model and a trigram part-of-speech tagger.
  
  
    Dynamic programming algorithms have been remarkably useful for inference in many NLP problems.
