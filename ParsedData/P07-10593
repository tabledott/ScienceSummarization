this system is to learn lexical correlations between words and phrases in questions and answers, for example by allowing for multiple unaligned words in automatic word alignment, and disregarding issues such as word order.
    The ability to translate phrases instead of words and the use of a large language model serve as rich context to make precise decisions in the case of ambiguous translations.
    Query expansion is performed by adding content words that have not been seen in the original query from the n-best translations of the query.
    Our second query expansion model is based on the use of SMT technology for full-sentence paraphrasing.
    A phrase table of paraphrases is extracted from bilingual phrase tables (Bannard and CallisonBurch, 2005), and paraphrasing quality is improved by additional discriminative training on manually created paraphrases.
    This approach utilizes large bilingual phrase tables as information source to extract a table of para-phrases.
