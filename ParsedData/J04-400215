 higher recall is preferred depends on the final application of the word alignment.
    For the purpose of statistical MT, it seems that a higher recall is more important.
    Therefore, we use the union or the refined combination method to obtain a symmetrized alignment matrix.
    The resulting symmetrized alignments are then used to train single-word-based translation lexica p(e  |f) by computing relative frequencies using the count N(e,f) of how many times e and f are aligned divided by the count N(f ) of how many times the word f occurs: In this section, we present a method for learning relationships between whole phrases of m source language words and n target language words.
    This algorithm, which will be called phrase-extract, takes as input a general word alignment matrix (Section 3.2).
    The output is a set of bilingual phrases.
    In the following, we describe the criterion that defines the set of phrases that is consistent with the word alignment matrix: Hence, the set of all bilingual phras
