			The problem persists even when w~rions techniques such as optimal ordering of princi- ples (Fong, 1991), and corontining (Dorr, 1991; Johnson, 1991) are used.
			This problem may also account for the fact that these parsers are experimental nd have limited coverage.
			This paper describes an efficient, broad- coverage, principle-based parser, called PRIN- CIPAR.
			The main innovation in PRINCIPAR is that it applies principles to descriptions o17 X- bar structures rather than the structures them- selves.
			X-bar structures of a sentence are only built when their descriptions have satisfied all the pri ncil)les.
