each of the four variables predicted the errors.
    The coefficients and their standard deviations are shown in Table 7.
    Apparently, the distance measure is the most useful predictor, as indicated by the last column.
    In fact, none of the other three factors was found to contribute significantly beyond the effect of the distance measure, indicating that the distance measure is already doing an excellent job, and we should not expect much improvement if we were to try to augment the measure to take these additional factors into account.
    The fact that the score is such a good predictor of performance can be used to extract a large subcorpus that has a much smaller error rate.
    By selecting the best scoring 80% of the alignments, the error rate can be reduced from 4% to 0.7%.
    In general, we can trade off the size of the subcorpus and the accuracy by setting a threshold, and rejecting alignments with a score above this threshold.
    Figure 4 examines this trade-off in more detail.
