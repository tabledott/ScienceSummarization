f the word race occurs more frequently as a verb than as a noun in the training corpus, the initial state annotator will mistag this word as a verb in the sentence: The race was very exciting.
    The above transformation will correct this tagging error.
    It was shown in [Brill, 1994] that the transformation-based tagger achieves a high rate of tagging accuracy.
    The transformation-based tagger captures its learned information in a set of simple rules, compared to the many thousands of opaque probabilities learned by Markov-model based taggers.6 Supervised training is feasible when one has access to a large manually tagged training corpus from the same domain as that to which the trained tagger will be applied.
    We next explore unsupervised and weakly supervised training as a practical alternative when the necessary resources are not available for supervised training.
    In supervised training, the corpus is used for scoring the outcome of applying transformations, in order to find the best transfor
