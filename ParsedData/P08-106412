    13: output the hypothesis with the highest score in h[1, J] as the final best translation The decoder is a span-based beam search together with a function for mapping the source derivations to the target ones.
    Algorithm 2 illustrates the decoding algorithm.
    It translates each span iteratively from small one to large one (lines 1-2).
    This strategy can guarantee that when translating the current span, all spans smaller than the current one have already been translated before if they are translatable (line 7).
    When translating a span, if the usable rule is an initial rule, then the tree sequence on the target side of the rule is a candidate translation (lines 4-5).
    Otherwise, we replace the nonterminal leaf nodes of the current abstract rule with their corresponding spans&#8217; translations that are already translated in previous steps (line 7).
