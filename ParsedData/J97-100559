    4.2.1 Pauses.
    Several studies have demonstrated various correlations between pauses and discourse segment boundaries (Grosz and Hirschberg 1992; Hirschberg and Statistically validated versus algorithmically derived boundaries.
    Nakatani 1996; Swerts 1995).
    For example, segment-initial phrases have been correlated with longer preceding pause durations.
    As shown in Figure 9, we used a simplification of these results to develop an algorithm for identifying boundaries in our corpus using pauses.'
    If a pause occurs at the beginning of the prosodic phrase after the potential boundary site, the potential boundary site is classified as boundary and the phrase is taken to be the beginning of a new segment.
    Figure 10 shows boundaries assigned by the pause algorithm (PAUSE) for the boundary slot codings from Figure 7, repeated at the top of the figure.
    For example, the pause algorithm assigns a boundary between prosodic phrases 22
