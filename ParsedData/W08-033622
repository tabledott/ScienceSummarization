tion can help the granularity of the Chinese lexicon match that of the English lexicon.
    In conclusion, for MT performance, it is helpful to have consistent segmentation, while still having a word segmentation matching the granularity of the segmented Chinese lexicon and the English lexicon.
  
  
    We have shown earlier that word-level segmentation vastly outperforms character based segmentation in MT evaluations.
    Since the word segmentation standard under consideration (Chinese Treebank (Xue et al., 2005)) was neither specifically designed nor optimized for MT, it seems reasonable to investigate whether any segmentation granularity in continuum between character-level and CTB-style segmentation is more effective for MT.
    In this section, we present a technique for directly optimizing a segmentation property&#8212;characters per token average&#8212; for translation quality, which yields significant improvements in MT performance.
    In order to calibrate the average word length produced by our C
