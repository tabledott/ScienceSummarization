 stems (which would tend to be dominated by function words) and (iii) a cutoff on the minimum frequency of a feature, all result in improved performance.
    They also report that filtering stopwords has a negative impact on the results.
    Given these findings, we expect that pairs of function words are informative features helpful in predicting discourse relation sense.
    In our work that we describe next, we use feature selection to investigate the word pairs in detail.
    For the analysis of word pair features, we use a large collection of automatically extracted explicit examples from the experiments in BlairGoldensohn et al. (2007).
    The data, from now on referred to as TextRels, has explicit contrast and causal relations which were extracted from the English Gigaword Corpus (Graff, 2003) which contains over four million newswire articles.
    The explicit cue phrase is removed from each example and the spans are treated as belonging to an implicit relation.
    Besides cause and contrast, the Te
