ea of research (Turney 2007; Kolda and Sun 2008) full tensor decomposition is nevertheless a realistic near future task.
    For the current pilot study, we replicated the AP concept clustering experiment described in Section 6.1.3.
    Because for efficiency reasons we must work with just a portion of the original tensor, we thought that the AP data set, consisting of a relatively large and balanced collection of nominal concepts, would offer a sensible starting point to extract the subset.
    Specifically, we extract from our best tensor TypeDM the values labeled by tuples (wAP, l, w2) where wAP is in the AP set, l is one of the 100 most common links occurring in tuples with a wAP, and w2 is one of the 1,000 most common words occurring in tuples with a wAP and a l. The resulting (sub-)tensor, APTypeDM, has dimensionality 402 x 100 x 1, 000 with 1,318,214 non-zero entries (density: 3%).
    The W1xLW2 matricization of APTypeDM results in a 402 x 1, 000, 000 matrix with 66,026 non-zero columns and the same n
