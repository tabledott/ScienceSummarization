ing algorithm.
    Specifically, we scaled the mutual information values such that the maximum value was one.
    Then, we used these values as weights for the corresponding words in the word vectors.
    For words in the movie review data set that did not appear in the snippet data set, we used a default weight of zero (i.e., we excluded them.
    We experimented with setting the default weight to one, but found this led to inferior performance.)
    We repeated the experiments described in sections 4.2 and 4.3 with the only difference being that we used the mutual-information weighted word vector similarity instead of PSP whenever a similarity measure was required.
    We repeated the tuning procedures described in the previous sections.
    Using this new similarity measure led to the optimal parameters c = 0.1, &#945; = 1.5, k' = 5, and Q = 10.0.
    The results are reported under &#8216;reg+WV&#8217; and &#8216;SSL+WV,&#8217; respectively.
    We tested the five algorithms for all four authors using each
