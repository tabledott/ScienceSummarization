lignment methods from SMT are known to be notoriously unreliable when used for aligning phrase pairs.
    The authors find via manual evaluation that the quality of the phrasal paraphrases obtained via manually constructed word alignments is significantly better than that of the paraphrases obtained from automatic alignments.
    It has been widely reported that the existing bilingual word alignment techniques are not ideal for use in translation and, furthermore, improving these techniques does not always lead to an improvement in translation performance.
    (Callison-Burch, Talbot, and Osborne 2004; Ayan and Dorr 2006; Lopez and Resnik 2006; Fraser and Marcu 2007).
    More details on the relationship between word alignment and SMT can be found in the comprehensive SMT survey recently published by Lopez (2008) (particularly Section 4.2).
    Paraphrasing done via bilingual corpora relies on the word alignments in the same way as a translation system would and, therefore, would be equally susceptible to the
