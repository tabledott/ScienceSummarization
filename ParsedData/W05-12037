asured between generic concepts (e.g. go and be).
    While the specificity of words is already measured to some extent by their depth in the semantic hierarchy, we are reinforcing this factor with a corpus-based measure of word specificity, based on distributional information learned from large corpora.
    Language models are frequently used in natural language processing applications to account for the distribution of words in language.
    While word frequency does not always constitute a good measure of word importance, the distribution of words across an entire collection can be a good indicator of the specificity of the words.
    Terms that occur in a few documents with high frequency contain a greater amount of discriminatory ability, while terms that occur in numerous documents across a collection with a high frequency have inherently less meaning to a document.
    We determine the specificity of a word using the inverse document frequency introduced in (Sparck-Jones, 1972), which is defined as the
