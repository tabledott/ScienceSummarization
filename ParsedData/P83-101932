ould come into play, and gradually the more syntactically integrated would be acquired.
    Contrast this self-correction system to an approach that handles non-fluencies by some general problem solving routines, for example Granger (1982), who proposes reasoning from what a speaker might be expected to say.
    Besides the obvious inefficiencies of general problem solving approaches, it is worth giving special emphasis to the problem with learnability.
    A general problem solving approach depends crucially on evaluating the likelihood of possible deviations from the norms.
    But a language learner has by definition only partial and possibly incorrect knowledge of the syntax, and is therefore unable to consistently identify deviations from the grammatical system.
    With the editing system I describe, the learner need not have the ability to recognize deviations from grammatical norms, but merely the non-linguistic ability to recognize copies of the same thing.
    Generation.
    Thus far, I have consid
