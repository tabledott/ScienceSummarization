    In Fig.
    2 an example of an alignment template is shown.
    An alignment template z -= (F, E, A) is applicable to a sequence of source words I if the alignment template classes and the classes of the source words are equal: .F( f) = F. The application of the alignment template z constrains the target words-6 to correspond to the target class sequence: e(e) = E. The application of an alignment template does not determine the target words, but only constrains them.
    For the selection of words from classes we use a statistical model for p(e-lz, f) based on the lexicon probabilities of a statistical lexicon p(f le).
    We assume a mixture alignment between the source and target language words constrained by the alignment matrix A: In order to describe the phrase level alignment in a formal way, we first decompose both the source sentence fiJ and the target sentence ef into a sequence of phrases (k = 1,. .
