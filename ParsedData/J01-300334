 between the two multisets was calculated.
    We define overlap as the largest multiset of elements belonging to both the 5 Readers might be concerned about the portability of this method to languages for which no large parsed corpus is available.
    It is possible that using a fully parsed corpus is not necessary.
    Our results were replicated in English without the need for a fully parsed corpus (Anoop Sarkar, p.c., citing a project report by Wootiporn Tripasai).
    Our method was applied to 23 million words of the WSJ that were automatically tagged with Ratnaparkhi's maximum entropy tagger (Ratnaparkhi 1996) and chunked with the partial parser CASS (Abney 1996).
    The results are very similar to ours (best accuracy 66.6%), suggesting that a more accurate tagger than the one used on our corpus might in fact be sufficient to overcome the fact that no full parse is available. subject and the object multisets; e.g., the overlap between {a, a, a, b} and {a} is {a, a, a}.
    The proportion is the ratio b
