nstance pairs.
    Approximately 930,000 of these are unique pairs, comprised of nearly 500,000 unique instances2, paired with over 450,000 unique concepts3 (e.g., &#8220;sultry screen actress&#8221;), which can be categorized based on nearly 100,000 unique complex concept heads (e.g., &#8220;screen actress&#8221;) and about 14,000 unique simple concept heads (e.g., &#8220;actress&#8221;).
    Table 3 shows examples of this output.
    A sample of 100 concept-instance pairs was randomly selected from the 2,000,000 extracted pairs and hand annotated.
    93% of these were judged legitimate concept-instance pairs.
  
  
    A large number of questions were collected over the period of a few months from www.askJeeves.com.
    100 questions of the form &#8220;Who is x&#8221; were randomly selected from this set.
    The questions queried concept-instance relations through both instance centered queries (e.g., &#8220;Who is Jennifer Capriati?&#8221;) and concept centered queries (e.g., &#8220;Who is the mayor of B
