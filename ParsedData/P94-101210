estimate the slope of this idealized diagonal c = E(r) = E(12 1 11) by averaging over the training corpus of hand-aligned L1 L2 pairs, weighting by the length of Li.
    In fact this plot displays substantially greater scatter than the English-French data of Gale &amp; Church (1991).4 The mean number of Chinese characters generated by each English character is c = 0.506, with a standard deviation o- = 0.166.
    We now assume that /2 &#8212; /1 c is normally distributed, following Gale &amp; Church (1991), and transform it into a new gaussian variable of standard form (i.e., with mean 0 and variance 1) by appropriate normalization: This is the quantity that we choose to define as 6(/1,12).
    Consequently, for any two pairs in a proposed alignment, Pr(611,1 L2) can be estimated according to the gaussian assumption.
    To check how accurate the gaussian assumption is, we can use equation (4) to transform the same training points from figure 1 and produce a histogram.
    The result is shown in figure 2.
