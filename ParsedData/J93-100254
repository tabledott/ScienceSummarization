racticable.
    To avoid asking the user about lexical ambiguity, we use the technique of preterminal delaying (Shieber 1983), in which the assignment of an atomic preterminal category to a lexical item is not made until the choice is forced by the use of a particular production in a later reduce action.
    After shifting an ambiguous lexical item, the parser enters a state corresponding to the union of states that would be entered on shifting the individual lexical categories.
    (Each union of states will in practice be small, since it being otherwise would imply that the current context was completely failing to constrain the following input).
    Since, in general, several unification grammar categories for a single word may be subsumed by a single atomic preterminal category, we extend Shieber's technique so that it deals with a grammar containing complex categories by associating a set of alternative analyses with each state (not just one), and letting the choice between them be forced by later reduce
