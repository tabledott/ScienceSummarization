ct the inherent bilingual syntactic structure using the lexicalized binary bracketing parse tree.
    In Figure 2, A(see/vois) echoes IP(see/vois) and B(see/vois) echoes VP(see/vois) so that it means IP(see/vois) is not inverted from English to French but its right child VP(see/vois) is inverted.
    However, for longer sentences with more than 5 levels of bracketing and the same lexicalized nonterminal repeatedly appearing at different levels, the correspondences would become less linguistically plausible.
    We think the limitations of the bracketing grammar are another reason for not being able to improve the AER of longer sentence pairs after lexicalization.
    The space of alignments that is to be considered by LITG is exactly the space considered by ITG since the structural rules shared by them define the alignment space.
    The lexicalized ITG is designed to be more sensitive to the lexical influence on the choices of inversions so that it can find better alignments.
    Wu (1997) demonstrated that
