    We have presented a novel method, called MaxMatch (M2), for evaluating grammatical error correction.
    Our method computes the sequence of phrase-level edits that achieves the highest overlap with the gold-standard annotation.
    Experiments on the HOO data show that our method overcomes deficiencies in the current evaluation method.
    The M2 scorer is available for download at http://nlp.comp.nus.edu.sg/software/.
