  Semantic Class Learning from the Web with Hyponym Pattern Linkage Graphs
  
    We present a novel approach to weakly supervised semantic class learning from the web, using a single powerful hyponym pattern combined with graph structures, which capture two properties associated with pattern-based Ina candidate is it was discovered many times by other instances in the pattern.
    A candidate is if it frequently leads to the discovery of other instances.
    Together, these two measures capture not only frequency of occurrence, but also cross-checking that the candidate occurs both near the class name and near other class members.
    We developed two algorithms that begin with just a class name and one seed instance and then automatically generate a ranked list of new class instances.
    We conducted experiments on four semantic classes and consistently achieved high accuracies.
  
  
    Knowing the semantic classes of words (e.g., &#8220;trout&#8221; is a kind of FISH) can be extremely valuable for many
