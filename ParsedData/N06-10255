rit to Ji et al. (2005), who explore the employment of the ACE 2004 relation ontology as a semantic filter.
  
  
    To establish a competitive coreference resolver, the system was initially prototyped using the MUC-6 and MUC-7 data sets (Chinchor &amp; Sundheim, 2003; Chinchor, 2001), using the standard partitioning of 30 texts for training and 20-30 texts for testing.
    Then, we moved on and developed and tested the system with the ACE 2003 Training Data corpus (Mitchell et al., 2003)1.
    Both the Newswire (NWIRE) and Broadcast News (BNEWS) sections where split into 60-20-20% document-based partitions for training, development, and testing, and later per-partition merged (MERGED) for system evaluation.
    The distribution of coreference chains and referring expressions is given in Table 1.
    For learning coreference decisions, we used a Maximum Entropy (Berger et al., 1996) model.
    This was implemented using the MALLET library (McCallum, 2002).
    To prevent the model from overfitting, we employ
