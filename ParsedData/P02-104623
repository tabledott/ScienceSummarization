 
    To sum up, we have refined previous work on the analysis of co-training, and given a new cotraining algorithm that is theoretically justified and has good empirical performance.
    We have also given a theoretical analysis of the Yarowsky algorithm for the first time, and shown that it can be justified by an independence assumption that is quite distinct from the independence assumption that co-training is based on.
