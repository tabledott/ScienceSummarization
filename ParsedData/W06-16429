 head of a syntactic tree3.
    However, this limitation reduces the recall of sentiment analysis to a very low level.
    In the example (7) above, utsukushii is the head of the tree, while those initial clauses in (9) to (11) below are not.
    In order to achieve higher recall while maintaining high precision, we apply two types of syntactic patterns, modality patterns and conjunctive patterns4, to the tree structures from the full-parsing.
    Modality patterns match some auxiliary verbs or corresponding sentence-final expressions, to allow for specific kinds of modality and negation.
    One of the typical patterns is [ v to omou] (`I think v ')5, which allows utsukushii in (9) to be a proposition.
    Also negation is handled with a modality pattern, such as [ v nai] (`not v ').
    In this case a neg feature is attached to the proposition to identify utsukushii in (10) as a negated proposition.
    On the other hand, no proposition is identified in (11) due to the deliberate absence of a pattern [ v to
