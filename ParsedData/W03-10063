se tags for each word and local semantic labels for each argument and adjunct.
    Argument labels are numbered and used consistently across syntactic alternations for the same verb meaning, as shown in Figure 1.
    Adjuncts are given special tags such as TMP (for temporal), or LOC (for locatives) derived from the original annotation of the Penn Treebank.
    In addition to the annotated corpus, PropBank provides a lexicon which lists, for each meaning of each annotated verb, its roleset, i.e., the possible arguments in the predicate and their labels.
    As an example, the entry for the verb kick, is given in Figure 2.
    The notion of &#8220;meaning&#8221; used is fairly coarse-grained, typically motivated from differing syntactic behavior.
    Since each verb meaning corresponds to exactly one roleset, these terms are often used interchangeably.
    The roleset also includes a &#8220;descriptor&#8221; field which is intended for use during annotation and as documentation, but which does not have any theo
