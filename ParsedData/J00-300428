    The search strategy we use is a variant of the stack algorithm for sequential decoding (Anderson and Mohan 1984).
    As new nodes are generated, an ordered list is maintained of the best paths generated so far.
    Only the best path is extended.
    The metric used to evaluate a path is the number of bits required for the segmentation sequence it represents, when compressed by the PPM model.
    It is necessary to delete paths from the list in order to make room for newly generated ones.
    We remove all paths that were more than m nodes shorter than the best path so far, where m is the order of the PPM model (5 in our experiments).
    We reasoned that it is extremely unlikely&#8212;at least for natural language sequences&#8212;that such a path would ever grow to outperform the current best path, because it already lags behind in code length despite the fact that m further letters must be encoded.
