arity classifier, we perform four experiments.
			In each experi ment, a different set of polarity features is excluded, and the polarity classifier is retrained and evaluated.
			Table 7 lists the features that are removed for each experiment.
			The only significant difference in performance in these experiments is neutral F-measure when the modification features (AB2) are removed.
			These ablation experiments show that the combination of features is needed to achieve significant results over baseline for polarity classification.
	
	
			Much work on sentiment analysis classifies documents by their overall sentiment, for example deter mining whether a review is positive or negative (e.g., (Turney, 2002; Dave et al, 2003; Pang and Lee,2004; Beineke et al, 2004)).
			In contrast, our ex periments classify individual words and phrases.
			A number of researchers have explored learning words and phrases with prior positive or negative polarity(another term is semantic orientation) (e.g., (Hatzi vassiloglou and
