    The steps of review translation and the cotraining algorithm are described in details in the next sections, respectively.
    In order to overcome the language gap, we must translate one language into another language.
    Fortunately, machine translation techniques have been well developed in the NLP field, though the translation performance is far from satisfactory.
    A few commercial machine translation services can be publicly accessed, e.g.
