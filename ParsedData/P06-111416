l as all matching instances from our training corpora described in Section 3.3.
    This method did not always extract true paraphrases of either texts.
    In order increase the likelihood that only true paraphrases were considered as phraselevel alternations for an example, extracted sentences were clustered using complete-link clustering using a technique proposed in (Barzilay and Lee, 2003).
    In order to obtain more training data for our TE system, we extracted more than 200,000 examples of textual entailment from large newswire corpora.
    Positive Examples.
    Following an idea proposed in (Burger and Ferro, 2005), we created a corpus of approximately 101,000 textual entailment examples by pairing the headline and first sentence from newswire documents.
    In order to increase the likelihood of including only positive examples, pairs were filtered that did not share an entity (or an NP) in common between the headline and the first sentence Negative Examples.
    Two approaches were used to gather
