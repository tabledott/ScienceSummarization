ding: it is not clear that the &amp;quot;exact match&amp;quot; criterion &#8212; that is, evaluating algorithms by the percentage of exact matches of sense selection against a human-judged baseline &#8212; is the right task.
    In particular, in many tasks it is at least as important to avoid inappropriate senses than to select exactly the right one.
    This would be the case in query expansion for information retrieval, for example, where indiscriminately adding inappropriate words to a query can degrade performance (Voorhees, 1994).
    The examples presented in Section 3 are encouraging in this regard: in addition to performing well at the task of assigning a high score to the best sense, it does a good job of assigning low scores to senses that are clearly inappropriate.
    Regardless of the criterion for success, the algorithm does need further evaluation.
    Immediate plans include a larger scale version of the experiment presented here, involving thesaurus classes, as well as a similarly designed e
