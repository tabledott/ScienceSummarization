mar G = ?N,T, P, S ? in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) and an input string w can be represented as a hypergraph of arity 2 as follows.Each item [X, i, j] is represented as a vertex v, corre sponding to the recognition of nonterminal X spanning w from positions i+1 through j. For each production rule X ? YZ in P and three free indices i &lt; j &lt; k, we have a hyperarc ?((Y, i, k), (Z, k, j)), (X, i, k), f ? corresponding tothe instantiation of the inference rule C???????
			in the de ductive system of (Shieber et al, 1995), and the weight function f is defined as f (a, b) = ab ?Pr(X ? YZ), whichis the same as in (Nederhof, 2003).
			In this sense, hypergraphs can be thought of as compiled or instantiated ver sions of weighted deductive systems.A parser does nothing more than traverse this hypergraph.
			In order that derivation values be computed cor rectly, however, we need to traverse the hypergraph in a particular order: Definition 8.
			The graph projection of a hypergraph H = ?V, E, t,R? is a directed graph
