locations that contain the target; all other hyponyms; hypernyms; and, finally, sisters.
    AutoTrain takes as broad a sampling as possible across the corpus and never takes more than one example from an article.
    The number of examples for each relative is based on the relative proportion of its occurrences in the corpus.
    Table 4 shows the monosemous relatives that were used to train five senses of the noun line&#8212;the monosemous relatives of the sixth sense in the original study, line as an abstract division, are not attested in the SIM corpus.
    The purpose of the experiment was to see how well TLC performed using unsupervised training and, when possible, to compare this with its performance when training on the manually tagged materials being produced at Princeton's Cognitive Science Laboratory.'
    When a sufficient number of examples for two or more senses were available, 100 examples of each sense were set aside to use in training.
    The remainder were used for testing.
