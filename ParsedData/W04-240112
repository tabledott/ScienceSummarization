 d2 to force the consistency of the second argument of a relation.
    Since we are seeking the most probable global assignment that satisfies the constraints, therefore, the overall cost function we optimize, for a global labeling f of all variables is:
  
  
    Unfortunately, it is not hard to see that the combinatorial problem (Eq.
    1) is computationally intractable even when placing assumptions on the cost function (Kleinberg and Tardos, 1999).
    The computational approach we adopt is to develop a linear programming (LP) formulation of the problem, and then solve the corresponding integer linear programming (ILP) problem.
    Our LP formulation is based on the method proposed by (Chekuri et al., 2001).
    Since the objective function (Eq.
    1) is not a linear function in terms of the labels, we introduce new binary variables to represent different possible assignments to each original variable; we then represent the objective function as a linear function of these binary variables.
