Ps), but no postmodifiers or arguments.
    This is why the PP chunk only contains the preposition, and not the argument NP, and the SBAR chunk consists of only the complementizer.
    There are several difficulties when converting trees into chunks.
    In the most simple case, a chunk is just a syntactic constituent without any further embedded constituents, like the NPs in our examples.
    In some cases, the chunk contains only what is left after other chunks have been removed from the constituent, cf.
    &amp;quot;(VP loves (NP Mary))&amp;quot; above, or ADJPs and PPs below.
    We will discuss some special cases during the following description of the individual chunk types.
    Our NP chunks are very similar to the ones of Ramshaw and Marcus (1995).
    Specifically, possessive NP constructions are split in front of the possessive marker (e.g.
    [NP Eastern Airlines] [NP creditors]) and the handling of coordinated NPs follows the Treebank annotators.
    However, as Ramshaw and Marcus do not describ
