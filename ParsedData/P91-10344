ed by Brown et al. [Brown et al., 1990] incorporates the concept of an alignment in which each word in E acts independently to produce some of the words in F. If we denote a typical alignment by A, then we can write the probability of F given E as a sum over all possible alignments: Although the number of possible alignments is a very rapidly growing function of the lengths of the French and English sentences, only a tiny fraction of the alignments contributes substantially to the sum, and of these few, one makes the greatest contribution.
    We call this most probable alignment the Viterbi alignment between E and F. The identity of the Viterbi alignment for a pair of sentences depends on the details of the translation model, but once the model is known, probable alignments can be discovered algorithmically [Brown et al., 1991].
    Brown et al. [Brown et al., 1990], show an example of such au automatically derived alignment in their Figure 3.
