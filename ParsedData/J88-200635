ollowing) the &amp;quot;promising&amp;quot; event Eb.
    As in the first case, TF moves to the event located at RT&#8212;i.e., to E. This is shown roughly in Figure 12.
    Notice that this involved two movements of TF&#8212;once in response to a perceived embedded segment and a second time, in response to interpreting /3 as B r-conseq&#8226; Now consider the following extension to (16): d. So he picked out three red roses, two white ones, and one pale pink.
    As before, Clauses 17b&#8211;c form an embedded narrative, but here the main narrative of John's visit to the florist shop, started at (17a), is continued at (17d).
    To handle this, I again assume that TF behaves much like Sidner's DF in response to the listener's recognition of the end of an embedded narrative: that is, the cached TF is resumed and processing continues.21 Under this assumption, Clauses 17a&#8211;c are interpreted as in the previous example (cf.
    Figure 12).
    Recognizing Clause 17d as resuming the embedding segment,22 the pr
