al compilation of lexical resources is labor intensive, error prone, and susceptible to arbitrary human decisions.
    Hence there is a need for automatic authoring that would be as unsupervised and languageindependent as possible.
    An important type of lexical resource is that given by grouping words into categories.
    In general, the notion of a category is a fundamental one in cognitive psychology (Matlin, 2005).
    A lexical category is a set of words that share a significant aspect of their meaning, e.g., sets of words denoting vehicles, types of food, tool names, etc.
    A word can obviously belong to more than a single category.
    We will use &#8216;category&#8217; instead of &#8216;lexical category&#8217; for brevity'.
    Grouping of words into categories is useful in itself (e.g., for the construction of thesauri), and can serve as the starting point in many applications, such as ontology construction and enhancement, discovery of verb subcategorization frames, etc.
