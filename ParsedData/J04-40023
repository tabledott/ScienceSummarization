    The number of relevant dependencies is much too large and those dependencies are too complex to take them all into account in a machine translation system.
    Given these boundary conditions, a machine translation system has to make decisions (produce translations) given incomplete knowledge.
    In such a case, a principled approach to solving that problem is to use the concepts of statistical decision theory to try to make optimal decisions given incomplete knowledge.
    This is the goal of statistical machine translation.
    The use of statistical techniques in machine translation has led to dramatic improvements in the quality of research systems in recent years.
    For example, the statistical approaches of the VERBMOBiL evaluations (Wahlster 2000) or the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)/TIDES MT evaluations 2001 through 20031 obtain the best results.
    In addition, the field of statistical machine translation is rapidly progressing, and the quality of systems is getti
