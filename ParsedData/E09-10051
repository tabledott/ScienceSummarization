Given the relatively small amount of training data available, current state-of-the-art systems only beat the simple most frequent sense (MFS) baseline1 by a small margin.
    As an alternative to supervised systems, knowledge-based WSD systems exploit the information present in a lexical knowledge base (LKB) to perform WSD, without using any further corpus evidence.
    Traditional knowledge-based WSD systems assign a sense to an ambiguous word by comparing each of its senses with those of the surrounding context.
    Typically, some semantic similarity metric is used for calculating the relatedness among senses (Lesk, 1986; McCarthy et al., 2004).
    One of the major drawbacks of these approaches stems from the fact that senses are compared in a pairwise fashion and thus the number of computations can grow exponentially with the number of words.
    Although alternatives like simulated annealing (Cowie et al., 1992) and conceptual density (Agirre and Rigau, 1996) were tried, most of past knowledge based WSD
