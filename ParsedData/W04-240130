 in the form of constraints that force the labels of the coreferred entities to be the same (but, of course, allowing the global solution to reject the suggestion of these classifiers).
    Consequently, this may enhance the performance of entity/relation recognition and, at the same time, correct possible coreference resolution errors.
    Another example is to use chunking information for better relation identification; suppose, for example, that we have available chunking information that identifies Subj+Verb and Verb+Object phrases.
    Given a sentence that has the verb &#8220;murder&#8221;, we may conclude that the subject and object of this verb are in a &#8220;kill&#8221; relation.
    Since the chunking information is used in the global inference procedure, this information will contribute to enhancing its performance and robustness, relying on having more constraints and overcoming possible mistakes by some of the classifiers.
    Moreover, in an interactive environment where a user can supply new c
