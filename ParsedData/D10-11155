 learning and evaluation benchmark.
    In Section 6, we show that our model outperforms other approaches at the task of approximating such vectors for unseen ANs.
    In Section 7, we discuss how adjectival meaning can be represented in our model and evaluate this representation in an adjective clustering task.
    Section 8 concludes by sketching directions for further work.
  
  
    The literature on compositionality in vector-based semantics encompasses various related topics, some of them not of direct interest here, such as how to encode word order information in context vectors (Jones and Mewhort, 2007; Sahlgren et al., 2008) or sophisticated composition methods based on tensor products, quantum logic, etc., that have not yet been empirically tested on large-scale corpus-based semantic space tasks (Clark and Pulman, 2007; Rudolph and Giesbrecht, 2010; Smolensky, 1990; Widdows, 2008).
    Closer to our current purposes is the general framework for vector composition proposed by Mitchell and Lapata (200
