s about the correct DA types directly at the level of the LM.
    We estimate the distribution of likely DA types for a given utterance using the entire conversation E as evidence, and then use a sentence-level mixture (Iyer, Ostendorf, and Rohlicek 1994) of DA-specific LMs in a single recognizer run.
    In other words, we replace P(Wi I Ui) in Equation 11 with EP(wilu)p(uilE), a weighted mixture of all DA-specific LMs.
    We call this the mixture-of-LMs approach.
    In practice, we would first estimate DA posteriors for each utterance, using the forward-backward algorithm and the models described in Section 5, and then rerecognize the conversation or rescore the recognizer output, using the new posteriorweighted mixture LM.
    Fortunately, as shown in the next section, the mixture-of-LMs approach seems to give results that are almost identical to (and as good as) the mixtureof-posteriors approach.
    It is instructive to compare the expanded scoring formulas for the two DA mixture modeling approaches fo
