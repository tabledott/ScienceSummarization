tent ordering of the mean entropy of the different types of sense distributions.
  Because of the very large num- ber of permutations considered, it is not possible to give a full breakdown of the differences, and such a breakdown does not appear to be terribly informative.
  The important observa- tion, however, is that the basic conclusions drawn from this paper hold for each of the sense definitions considered, and hence corroborate and strengthen the conclusions which can be drawn from any one.
  Performance Given Little Evidence One of the most striking conclusions to emerge from this study is that for the local collocations considered, decisions based on a single data point are highly reliable.
