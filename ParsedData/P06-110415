validation on the same subset of the 2004 data, but the 5 partitions may not be the same) for the ACE 2004 data.
    Both corpora are parsed using Charniak&#8217;s parser (Charniak, 2001).
    We iterate over all pairs of entity mentions occurring in the same sentence to generate potential relation instances.
    In this paper, we only measure the performance of relation extraction models on &#8220;true&#8221; mentions with &#8220;true&#8221; chaining of coreference (i.e. as annotated by LDC annotators).
    Implementation: We formalize relation extraction as a multi-class classification problem.
    SVM is selected as our classifier.
    We adopt the one vs. others strategy and select the one with the largest margin as the final answer.
    The training parameters are chosen using cross-validation (C=2.4 (SVM); &#955; =0.4(tree kernel)).
    In our implementation, we use the binary SVMLight (Joachims, 1998) and Tree Kernel Tools (Moschitti, 2004).
    Precision (P), Recall (R) and F-measure (F) are adopted t
