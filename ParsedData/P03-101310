S-OC (object clause), S-RC (relative clause), etc.
    Another idiosyncrasy of the Negra annotation is that conjoined categories have separate labels (S and CS, NP and CNP, etc.
    ), and that PPs do not contain an NP node.
    We tested a variant of the Carroll and Rooth (1998) model that takes this into account.
    Data Sets All experiments reported in this paper used the treebank format of Negra.
    This format, which is included in the Negra distribution, was derived from the native format by replacing crossing branches with traces.
    We split the corpus into three subsets.
    The first 18,602 sentences constituted the training set.
    Of the remaining 2,000 sentences, the first 1,000 served as the test set, and the last 1000 as the development set.
    To increase parsing efficiency, we removed all sentences with more than 40 words.
    This resulted in a test set of 968 sentences and a development set of 975 sentences.
    Early versions of the models were tested on the development set, and the t
