age-independent process.
    These abstract morphemes are induced automatically by the model from recurring bilingual patterns.
    For example, in the case above, the tuple (in, fy, b-, b-) would constitute one of three abstract morphemes in the phrase.
    When a morpheme occurs in one language without a direct counterpart in the other language, our model can explain away the stray morpheme as arising through a language-specific process.
    To achieve this effect in a probabilistic framework, we formulate a hierarchical Bayesian model with Dirichlet Process priors.
    This framework allows us to define priors over the infinite set of possible morphemes in each language.
    In addition, we define a prior over abstract morphemes.
    This prior can incorporate knowledge of the phonetic relationship between the two alphabets, giving potential cognates greater prior likelihood.
    The resulting posterior distributions concentrate their probability mass on a small group of recurring and stable patterns withi
