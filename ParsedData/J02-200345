grams, is better served by a more conservative test.
  
  
    We have presented a class-based estimation method that incorporates a procedure for finding a suitable level of generalization in WordNet.
    This method has been shown to provide superior performance on a pseudo-disambiguation task, compared with two alternative approaches.
    An analysis of the results has shown that the other approaches appear to be overgeneralizing, at least for this task.
    One of the features of the generalization procedure is the way that &#945;, the level of significance in the chi-square test, is treated as a parameter.
    This allows some control over the extent of generalization, which can be tailored to particular tasks.
    We have also shown that the task performance is at least as good when using the Pearson chi-square statistic as when using the log-likelihood chi-square statistic.
    There are a number of ways in which this work could be extended.
    One possibility would be to use all the classes dominated
