s the extraction patterns, achiev ing an F-measure of 66.3 using the OL measure, 65.0 using the HM measure, and 59.2 using theEM measure.
			Adding the IE pattern features fur ther increases performance, boosting recall by about3 points for all of the measures and slightly increas ing precision as well.
			CRF with feature induction.
			One limitation of log-linear function models like CRFs is that they cannot form a decision boundary from conjunctionsof existing features, unless conjunctions are explic itly given as part of the feature vector.
			For the task of identifying opinion sources, we observedthat the model could benefit from conjunctive fea tures.
			For instance, instead of using two separatefeatures, HUMAN and PARENT-CHUNK-INCLUDES OPINION-EXPRESSION, the conjunction of the two is more informative.For this reason, we applied the CRF feature in duction approach introduced by McCallum (2003).
			As shown in Table 1, where CRF-FI stands for theCRF model with feature induction, we see consistent impr
