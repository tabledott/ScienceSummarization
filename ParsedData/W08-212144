   Note that this experiment is relevant only for systems that implemented pipeline architectures, where the semantic components are in fact separated from the syntactic ones; this excludes the systems that blended syntax with SRL: henderson, sun, and lluis.
    Furthermore, systems that had significantly lower scores in syntax will receive an unreasonable boost in ranking according to this measure.
    Fortunately, there was only one such outlier in this evaluation (neumann), shown in gray in the table.
    Table 16 lists the labeled F1 scores for semantic dependencies for two different views of the testing data sets: for propositions centered around verbal predicates, i.e., from PropBank, and for propositions centered around nominal predicates, i.e., from NomBank. tic dependencies and LAS for syntactic dependencies.
    Systems are sorted in descending order of this ratio score on the WSJ+Brown corpus.
    We only show systems that participated in both the syntactic and semantic subtasks.
