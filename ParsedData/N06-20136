ight two issues related to preprocessing: First, ambiguity in Arabic words is an important issue to address.
    To determine whether a clitic or feature should be split off or abstracted off requires that we determine that said feature is indeed present in the word we are considering in context &#8211; not just that it is possible given an analyzer or, worse, because of regular expression matching.
    Secondly, once a specific analysis is determined, the process of splitting off or abstracting off a feature must be clear on what the form of the resulting word is to be.
    For example, the word ktbthm has two possible readings (among others) as their writers or I wrote them.
    Splitting off the pronominal clitic +hm without normalizing the t top in the nominal reading leads to the coexistence of two forms of the noun: ktbp and ktbt.
    This increased sparsity is only worsened by the fact that the second form is also the verbal form (thus increased ambiguity).
