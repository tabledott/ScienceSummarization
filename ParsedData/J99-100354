ment alignments and bitext maps are relations between token instances, rather than between token types.
    More important than GSA's current accuracy is GSA's potential accuracy.
    With a bigger development bitext, more effective backing-off heuristics can be developed.
    Better input can also make a difference: GSA's accuracy will improve in lockstep with SIMR's accuracy.
  
  
    The Smooth Injective Map Recognizer (SIMR) is based on innovative approaches to each of the three main components of a bitext mapping algorithm: signal generation, noise filtering, and search.
    The advances in signal generation stemmed from the use of word-based matching predicates.
    When word-pair coordinates are plotted in a Cartesian bitext space, the geometric heuristics of existing sentence alignment algorithms can be exploited just as easily and to a greater extent at the word level.
    The cognate heuristic of character-based bitext mapping algorithms also works better at the word level, because cognateness can
