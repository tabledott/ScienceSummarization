texts is an emerging research field with both theoretical and practical applications.
    Recently, a wide-coverage grammar and a large treebank have become available for English HPSG (Miyao et al., 2004).
    A large treebank can be used as training and test data for statistical models.
    Therefore, we now have the basis for the development and the evaluation of statistical disambiguation models for wide-coverage HPSG parsing.
    The aim of this paper is to report the development of log-linear models for the disambiguation in widecoverage HPSG parsing, and their empirical evaluation through the parsing of the Wall Street Journal of Penn Treebank II (Marcus et al., 1994).
    This is challenging because the estimation of log-linear models is computationally expensive, and we require solutions to make the model estimation tractable.
    We apply two techniques for reducing the training cost.
    One is the estimation on a packed representation of HPSG parse trees (Section 3).
    The other is the filtering
