   For the different reordering constraints we obtain the following results (the abbreviations MON, GE, EG, and S3 are taken from the Appendix): Number of processed arcs for the pseudotranslation task as a function of the input sentence length J (y-axis is given in log scale).
    The complexity for the four different reordering constraints MON, GE, EG, and S3 is given.
    The complexity of the S3 constraint is close to J4.
    To speed up the search, a beam search strategy is used.
    There is a direct analogy to the data-driven search organization used in continuous-speech recognition (Ney et al. 1992).
    The full DP search algorithm proceeds cardinality-synchronously over subsets of source sentence positions of increasing cardinality.
    Using the beam search concept, the search can be focused on the most likely hypotheses.
    The hypotheses Qe,(e, C,j) are distinguished according to the coverage set C, with two kinds of pruning based on this coverage set: After the pruning is carried out, we retain
