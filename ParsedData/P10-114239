ed Soon et al. (2001) system, which relies on a weak model (i.e., the mention-pair model) and a small set of linguistic features.
    As recent systems are becoming more sophisticated, we suggest that researchers make their systems publicly available in order to facilitate performance comparisons.
    Publicly available coreference systems currently include JavaRAP (Qiu et al., 2004), GuiTaR (Poesio and Kabadjov, 2004), BART (Versley et al., 2008b), CoRTex (Denis and Baldridge, 2008), the Illinois Coreference Package (Bengtson and Roth, 2008), CherryPicker (Rahman and Ng, 2009), Reconcile (Stoyanov et al., 2010), and Charniak and Elsner&#8217;s (2009) pronoun resolver.
    We conclude with a discussion of two questions regarding supervised coreference research.
    First, what is the state of the art?
    This is not an easy question, as researchers have been evaluating their resolvers on different corpora using different evaluation metrics and preprocessing tools.
    In particular, preprocessing tools can h
