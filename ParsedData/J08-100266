   Therefore, without assuming what feature forests represent, our algorithm can be applied to various tasks, including theirs.
    Another approach to the probabilistic modeling of complete structures is a method of approximation.
    The work on whole sentence maximum entropy models (Rosenfeld 1997; Chen and Rosenfeld 1999b) proposed an approximation algorithm to estimate parameters of maximum entropy models on whole sentence structures.
    However, the algorithm suffered from slow convergence, and the model was basically a sequence model.
    It could not produce a solution for complex structures as our model can.
    We should also mention Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) (Lafferty, McCallum, and Pereira 2001) for solving a similar problem in the context of maximum entropy Markov models.
    Their solution was an algorithm similar to the computation of forward/backward probabilities of hidden Markov models (HMMs).
    Their algorithm is a special case of our algorithm in which each conjunctive node has o
