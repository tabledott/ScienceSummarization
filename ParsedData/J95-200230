 are the sums of the probabilities of the potentially infinitely many prediction paths leading from a state kX -&#8250; ).Zp, to a predicted state ,Y .v, via any number of intermediate states.
    RL can be computed once for each grammar, and used for table-lookup in the following, modified prediction step.
    10 If a probabilistic relation R is replaced by its set-theoretic version R', i.e., (x, y) E R' iff R(x,y) 0, then the closure operations used here reduce to their traditional discrete counterparts; hence the choice of terminology. i: kX A.Zit [a, 7] i: iY .v for all productions Y v such that R(Z =L Y) is nonzero.
    Then The new R(Z 41, Y) factor in the updated forward probability accounts for the sum of all path probabilities linking Z to Y.
    For Z = Y this covers the case of a single step of prediction; R(Y ZL Y) &gt; 1 always, since RL is defined as a reflexive closure. may imply an infinite summation, and could lead to an infinite loop if computed naively.
    However, only unit productions&am
