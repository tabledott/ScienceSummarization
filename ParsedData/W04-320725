ct, as the amount of training data increases, the advantage of using a bilingual parser vanishes&#8212;there is no benefit from falling back on the English parser and word alignments to help disambiguate the Korean structure.
    Since we have not pruned our search space in these experiments, we can be confident that all variations are due to the influence of the translation and English syntax models.
    Our approach has this principal advantage: the various morphology, parsing, and alignment components can be improved or replaced easily without needing to retrain the other modules.
    The low dependency projection results (&#167;3.4), in conjunction with our modest overall gains, indicate that the alignment/translation model should receive the most attention.
    In all the bilingual experiments, there is a small positive correlation (0.3), for sentences at each length, between the proportion of Korean words aligned to English and measures ofparsing accuracy.
