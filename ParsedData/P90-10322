eneration, including open compounds of two or more words, predicative relations (e.g., subject-verb), and phrasal templates representing more idiomatic expressions.
    We then describe how Xtract automatically acquires the full range of collocations using a two stage statistical analysis of large domain specific corpora.
    Finally, we show how collocations can be efficiently represented in a flexible lexicon using a unification based formalism.
    This is a word based lexicon that has been macrocoded with collocational knowledge.
    Unlike a purely phrasal lexicon, we thus retain the flexibility of word based lexicons which allows for collocations to be combined and merged in syntactically acceptable ways with other words or phrases of the sentence.
    Unlike pure word based lexicons, we gain the ability to deal with a variety of phrasal entries.
    Furthermore, while there has been work on the automatic retrieval of lexical information from text [Garside 87], [Choueka, 88], [Klavans 88], [Amsler 89],
