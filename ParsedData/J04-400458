onstraint should effectively not be employed when pursuing theories of an NPB subtree.
    As it turns out, using the comma constraint also affects accuracy, as shown in Section 8.1.
    The final form of pruning employed is rather subtle: Within each cell of the chart that contains items covering some span of the sentence, Collins&#8217; parser uses buckets of items that share the same root nonterminal label for their respective derivations.
    Only 100 of the top-scoring items covering the same span with the same nonterminal label are kept in a particular bucket, meaning that if a new item is proposed and there are already 100 items covering the same span with the same label in the chart, then it will be compared to the lowest-scoring item in the bucket.
    If it has a higher score, it will be added to the bucket and the lowest-scoring item will be removed; otherwise, it will not be added.
    Apparently, this type of pruning has little effect, and so we have not duplicated it in our engine.32 When the pa
