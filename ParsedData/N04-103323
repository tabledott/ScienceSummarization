nt template system.
    This improvement is consistent among all evaluation criteria and it is statistically significant at the 99% level.
  
  
    In this section, we analyze the translation speed of the phrase-based translation system.
    All experiments were carried out on an AMD Athlon with 2.2GHz.
    Note that the systems were not optimized for speed.
    We used the best performing systems to measure the translation times.
    The translation speed of the monotone phrase-based system for all three tasks is shown in Table 9.
    For the Xerox task, the translation process takes less than 7 seconds for the whole 10K words test set.
    For the Verbmobil task, the system is even slightly faster.
    It takes about 1.6 seconds to translate the whole test set.
    For the Canadian Hansards task, the translation process is much slower, but the average time per sentence is still less than 1 second.
    We think that this slowdown can be attributed to the large training corpus.
    The system loads only phra
