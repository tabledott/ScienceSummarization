e seen as just one of many levels in a richer characterization of contextual structure.
  
  
    Given what I have said, let us examine the questions presented above in more detail.
    First, let us turn to the issue of methodology.
    How can we determine the soundness of our method?
    Are new techniques available now that have not been adequately explored?
    Very briefly, one can summarize the most essential techniques assumed by the field, in some way, as follows (see, for example Cruse [1986]): Such alternations reveal subtle distinctions in the semantic and syntactic behavior of such verbs.
    The lexical semantic representations of these verbs are distinguishable on the basis of such tests. is not dependent on the syntactic context (cf.
    Katz and Fodor 1963; Karttunen 1971, 1974; Seuren 1985).
    This is illustrated in Example 3, where a killing always entails a dying.
    Example 3 When the same lexical item may carry different entailments in different contexts, we say that the entailments
