d are thus optimal, by Theorem 1).
    The CertS and CertG columns in Table 1 give the results for the sibling and G+S models respectively.
    For all but one setting3 over 95% of the test sentences are decoded exactly, with 99% exactness in many cases.
    For comparison, we also ran both the singlecommodity flow and multiple-commodity flow LP relaxations of Martins et al. (2009) with our models and features.
    We measure how often these relaxations terminate with an exact solution.
    The results in Table 2 show that our method gives exact solutions more often than both of these relaxations.4 In computing the accuracy figures for Martins et al. only need to be computed once, thus saving computation.
    (2009), we project fractional solutions to a wellformed spanning tree, as described in that paper.
    Finally, to better compare the tightness of our LP relaxation to that of earlier work, we consider randomly-generated instances.
    Table 2 gives results for our model and the LP relaxations of Martins
