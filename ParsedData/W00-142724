ated with the gramma&amp;quot;.
    In DRAFTER-2 (Power et aL, 1998), an a/an feature can be associated with any lexical entry, and its value is propagated up to the NP level through leftmost rule daughters in the grammar (Power, personal communication).
    Both of these systems interleave orthographic processing with other processes in realisation.
    In addition. neither has a mechanism for stating exceptions for whole subclasses of words, for example those starting us followed by a vowel&#8212; such as use and usual&#8212;which must be preceded by a. KPML appears not to perform this type of processing at all.
    We are not aware of any literature describing (practical) NLG systems that generate contractions.
    However, interesting linguistic research in this direction is reported by PulInni and Zwicky (In preparation.
    This work investigates the underlying syntactic structure of sentences that block auxiliary reductions, for example those with VP ellipsis as in (5).
