sed to ldentzfy dmcourse struc- ture as well (connect,yes, paragraph markers, tense shifts) In thls paper, we investigate the use oflemcal chains as a model of the source text for the pur- pose of producing a summary Obviously, other pects of the source text need to be integrated m the text representation to produce quahty summaries, but we want to empmcally investigate how far one can go exploiting mainly lemcal chains In the rest of the paper we first present our algorithm for lex- zeal chain construct,on We then present empmcal results on the ldentlficatzon ofstrong chains among the posmble can&amp;dates produced by our algorithm Finally, we describe how lexlcal chains are used to identify mgmficant sentences mtlnn the source text and eventually produce a surQmary A lgor i thm for  Cha in  Comput ing One of the clnef advantages of lemcal cohesmn m that zt m an easdy reco~m~able relatmn, enabhng lexlcal chains computation The first computational model for lemcal chains was presented m(Morns and Hlrst, 1991)
