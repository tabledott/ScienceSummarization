chniques that use full parsers (Park et al., 2001; Yakushiji et al., 2001) and coreference to extract relations that span multiple sentences (Pustejovsky et al., 2002; Hahn et al., 2002) (For an overview, see (Hirschman et al., 2002)).
    In this work we describe an approach to two areas of biomedical information extraction, drug development and cancer genomics, that is based on developing a corpus that integrates different levels of semantic and syntactic annotation.
    This corpus will be a resource for training machine learning algorithms useful for information extraction and retrieval and other datamining applications.
    We are currently annotating only abstracts, although in the future we plan to expand this to full-text articles.
    We also plan to make publicly available the corpus and associated statistical taggers.
    We are collaborating with researchers in the Division of Oncology at The Children&#8217;s Hospital of Philadelphia, with the goal of automatically mining the corpus of cancer lite
