ition to the word unigram model.
    This makes it possible to generate words that are not already defined in the word unigram model but obey English patterns.
    The word unigram model can be trained on any list of words.
    When trained on a list of person names, the transliterations will be most accurate for person names.
    For the experiments reported in this paper, the unigram model was trained on the list of names (without their pronunciations) from the CMU dictionary.
    The letter trigram is also trained on the same list.
    The transliteration score according to this model is given by: For a given Arabic name a, the actual transliteration process is carried out by searching for the English word sequence that maximizes Ps (w la ) In our spelling-based model, a sequence of one or more English letters is mapped to a sequence of zero Dictionary presented by the category of each name.
    OVERALL is a weighted average of the three categories. or more Arabic letters.'
