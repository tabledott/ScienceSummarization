documents.
    Because the underlying assumptions in crossdocument coreference are so distinct, they require novel approaches.
  
  
    Figure 1 shows the architecture of the crossdocument system developed.
    The system is built upon the University of Pennsylvania's within document coreference system, CAMP, which participated in the Seventh Message Understanding Conference (MUC-7) within document coreference task (MUC7 1998).
    Our system takes as input the coreference processed documents output by CAMP.
    It then passes these documents through the SentenceExtractor module which extracts, for each document, all the sentences relevant to a particular entity of interest.
    The VSM-Disambiguate module then uses a vector space model algorithm to compute similarities between the sentences extracted for each pair of documents.
