nd to a span in the parse tree are given a default category 'X', and can still play a role in the decoding process.
    In work done after submission to the 2006 data track, we assign such phrases an extended category of the form C1 + C2, C1/C2, or C2\C1, indicating that the phrase pair&#8217;s target side spans two adjacent syntactic categories (e.g., she went: NP+V), a partial syntactic category C1 missing a C2 to the right (e.g., the great: NP/NN), or a partial C1 missing a C2 to the left (e.g., great wall: DT\NP), respectively.
    Generalization In order to mitigate the effects of sparse data when working with phrase and ngram models we would like to generate generalized phrases, which include non-terminal symbols that can be filled with other phrases.
    Therefore, after annotating the initial rules from the current training sentence pair, we adhere to (Chiang, 2005) to recursively generalize each existing rule; however, we abstract on a per-sentence basis.
