			The LFG approximations of (Cahill et al, 2002), however, are only ?half?
			grammars, i.e. like most of their probabilistic CFG cousins (Charniak, 1996; Johnson, 1999; Klein and Manning, 2003) they do not resolve LDDs but interpret linguistic material purely locally where it occurs in the tree.In this paper we show how finite approxima tions of long distance dependency resolution can be obtained automatically for wide-coverage, robust, probabilistic LFG resources automatically acquired from treebanks.
			We extract LFG subcategorisation frames and paths linking LDD reentrancies fromf-structures generated automatically for the PennII treebank trees and use them in an LDD resolu tion algorithm to parse new text.
			Unlike (Collins, 1999; Johnson, 2002), in our approach LDDs are resolved on the level of f-structure representation,rather than in terms of empty productions and coindexation on parse trees.
			Currently we achieve f structure/dependency f-scores of 80.24 and 80.97for parsing section 23 o
