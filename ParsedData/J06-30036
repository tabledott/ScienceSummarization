easuring relational similarity.
    They used a vector of frequencies of patterns in a corpus to represent the relation between a pair of words.
    Section 4 presents the VSM approach to measuring similarity.
    In Section 5, we present an algorithm for measuring relational similarity, which we call Latent Relational Analysis (LRA).
    The algorithm learns from a large corpus of unlabeled, unstructured text, without supervision.
    LRA extends the VSM approach of Turney and Littman (2005) in three ways: (1) The connecting patterns are derived automatically from the corpus, instead of using a fixed set of patterns.
    (2) Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) is used to smooth the frequency data.
    (3) Given a word pair such as traffic:street, LRA considers transformations of the word pair, generated by replacing one of the words by synonyms, such as traffic:road or traffic:highway.
    Section 6 presents our experimental evaluation of LRA with a collection of 374 multiple-choice word analogy questions fro
