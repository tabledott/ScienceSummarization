LEU score (among other metrics) of the model on 53the data.
			Similarly, Chiang (2005) uses the k-best pars ing algorithm described below in a CFG-based log-linear translation model in order to learn feature weights which maximize BLEU.
			For algorithms whose packed representations aregraphs, such as Hidden Markov Models and other finitestate methods, Ratnaparkhi?s MXPARSE parser (Ratnaparkhi, 1997), and many stack-based machine transla tion decoders (Brown et al, 1995; Och and Ney, 2004), the k-best paths problem is well-studied in both pure algorithmic context (see (Eppstein, 2001) and (Branderand Sinclair, 1995) for surveys) and NLP/Speech community (Mohri, 2002; Mohri and Riley, 2002).
			This pa per, however, aims at the k-best tree algorithms whose packed representations are hypergraphs (Gallo et al, 1993; Klein and Manning, 2001) (equivalently, and/or graphs or packed forests), which includes most parsersand parsing-based MT decoders.
			Any algorithm express ible as a weighted deductive system (Shie
