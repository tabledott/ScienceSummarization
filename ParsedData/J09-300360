lated to other polarity influencers?
    To answer this question, we train classifiers using all the polarity features except for word token.
    Table 18 gives the results for these classifiers; for comparison, the results for the all-feature polarity classifiers are also given.
    Interestingly, excluding the word token feature produces only small changes in the overall results.
    The results for BoosTexter and Ripper are slightly lower, and the results for SVM are practically unchanged.
    TiMBL actually shows a slight improvement, with the exception of the both class.
    This provides further evidence of the strength of the polarity features.
    Also, a classifier not tied to actual word tokens may potentially be a more domain-independent classifier.
    8.2.3 Classification Results: Condition 2.
    The experiments in Section 8.2.1 show that the polarity features perform well under the ideal condition of perfect recognition of polar instances.
    The next question to consider is how well the polar
