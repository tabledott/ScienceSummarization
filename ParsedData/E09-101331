ch have strong potential for improving the model&#8217;s performance.
    In addition, we could allow an infinite number of senses and use an infinite Dirichlet model (Teh et al., 2006) to automatically determine how many senses are optimal.
    This provides an elegant solution to the model-order problem, and eliminates the need for external cluster-validation methods.
