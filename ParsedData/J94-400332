i,n2) (or Ba when n1 and nz are understood from the context) is defined to be the right-hand side of Equation 2.
    The meaning of the inequality is that for every given pair n1, n2 we know with confidence 1 &#8212; a that If Equation 4 does not hold, the algorithm makes no decision.
    The meaning of this criterion is that only if we know with confidence of at least 1 &#8212; a that ln(pi /p2) &gt; 0, will we select the most frequent tuple T1 as the appropriate one.
    In terms of statistical decision theory, we say that our null hypothesis is that ln(pi /p2) &lt; 0, and we will make a decision only if we can reject this hypothesis with confidence at least 1 &#8212; a.
    Note that we cannot compute Ba when one of the counts is zero.
    In this case we have used the common correction method of adding 0.5 to each of the counts (Agresti 1990, p. 249).7 We shall now demonstrate the use of the decision criterion.
    In the experiment we conducted we chose the parameters a = 0.1, for which Za -= 1.282, and
