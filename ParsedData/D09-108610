uct of weights w with features f and g: &#65533; wjgj(t,t0,a,w,w0) + j The features f look only at target words and dependencies.
    In the conditional models of &#167;3 and &#167;6, these features are those of an edge-factored dependency parser (McDonald et al., 2005).
    In the generative models of &#167;5, f has the form of a dependency model with valence (Klein and Manning, 2004).
    All models, for instance, have a feature template that considers the parts of speech of a potential parent-child relation.
    In order to benefit from the source language, we also need to include bilingual features g. When scoring a candidate target dependency link from word x &#8594; y, these features consider the relationship of their corresponding source words x0 and y0.
    (The correspondences are determined by the alignment a.)
    For instance, the source tree t0 may contain the link x0 &#8594; y0, which would cause a feature for monotonic projection to fire for the x &#8594; y edge.
    If, on the other hand, y0 &
