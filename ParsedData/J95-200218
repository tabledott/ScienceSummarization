out probabilities of derivations, strings, and prefixes in terms of the actions performed by Earley's parser.
    From now on, we will use &amp;quot;derivation&amp;quot; to imply a left-most derivation.
    Lemma 1 deriving a prefix x0...,_1 of the input. b) There is a one-to-one mapping between partial derivations and Earley paths, such that each production X v applied in a derivation corresponds to a predicted Earley state X &#8212;&gt; .v.
    (a) is the invariant underlying the correctness and completeness of Earley's algorithm; it can be proved by induction on the length of a derivation (Aho and Ullman 1972, Theorem 4.9).
    The slightly stronger form (b) follows from (a) and the way possible prediction steps are defined.
    Since we have established that paths correspond to derivations, it is convenient to associate derivation probabilities directly with paths.
    The uniqueness condition (b) above, which is irrelevant to the correctness of a standard Earley parser, justifies (probabilistic) counting
