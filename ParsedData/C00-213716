  This test assumes independence b tween the /~, wdues.
  When we use a 22(I (=1048576) trial approximate rmldomization test (section 3.3), which makes no such assumptions, then we find that this latter test indicates that under the null hypothesis, there is less than a 4% chance of producing a difference in precision results as large as the one observed.
  So this latter test in- dicates that this nmch of an observed ifference in precision would be mmsual if no actual dif- ference ill the precision exists between the two methods.
  It should be mentioned that the manner of testing here is slightly different han the man- ner in the rest of this paper.
  The X 2 test looks at the square of the difference of two results, and rejects the mill hylmthesis (the compared techniques are the same) when this square is aVe do not use Yates adjustment to compensate lbr the numbers in the table being integers.
