t this is a supervised system and as such represents an upper-bound in performance one might expect when comparing an unsupervised model such as MAS.
    We chose this comparison to demonstrate that our model can find relevant text mentions with high accuracy relative to a supervised model.
    It is difficult to compare our model to other unsupervised systems such as MG-LDA or LDA.
    Again, this is because those systems have no mechanism for directly correlating topics or clusters to corresponding aspects, highlighting the benefit of MAS.
    The resulting precision-recall curves for the aspects service, location and rooms are presented in Figure 4.
    In Figure 4c, we varied the number of topics associated with the aspect rooms.10 The average precision we obtained (the standard measure proportional to the area under the curve) is 75.8%, 85.5% for aspects service and location, respectively.
    For the aspect rooms these scores are equal to 75.0%, 74.5%, 87.6%, 79.8% with 1&#8211;4 topics per aspect, resp
