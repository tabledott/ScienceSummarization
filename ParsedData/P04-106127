mbined model beats the CCM on English F1: 77.6 vs. 71.9.
    The figure also shows the combination model&#8217;s score when using word classes which were induced entirely automatically, using the simplest distributional clustering method of Sch&#168;utze (1995).
    These classes show some degradation, e.g.
    72.9 F1, but it 10The product, like the CCM itself, is mass-deficient. is worth noting that these totally unsupervised numbers are better than the performance of the CCM model of Klein and Manning (2002) running off of Penn treebank word classes.
    Again, if we modify the gold standard so as to make determiners the head of NPs, then this model with distributional tags scores 50.6% on directed and 64.8% on undirected dependency accuracy.
    On the German data, the combination again outperforms each factor alone, though while the combination was most helpful at boosting constituency quality for English, for German it provided a larger boost to the dependency structures.
    Finally, on the Chinese dat
