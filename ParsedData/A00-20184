p;quot;have&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;having&amp;quot;.
    For each expansion we distinguish one of the right-hand side labels as the &amp;quot;middle&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;head&amp;quot; symbol M(c).
    M(c) is the constituent from which the head lexical item h is obtained according to deterministic rules that pick the head of a constituent from among the heads of its children.
    To the left of M is a sequence of one or more left labels Li (c) including the special termination symbol A, which indicates that there are no more symbols to the left, and similarly for the labels to the right, Ri(c).
    Thus an expansion e(c) looks like: The expansion is generated by guessing first M, then in order L1 through L,&#8222;.+1 (= A), and similarly for RI through In a pure Markov PCFG we are given the left-hand side label 1 and then probabilistically generate the right-hand side conditioning on no information other than 1 and (possibly) previously generated pieces of the right-hand side itself.
