 classified by the syntactic heuristics.
    We call this list the 51 extractions.
    While examining the Si extractions, we found many similar NPs, for example &amp;quot;the Salvadoran Government,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;the Guatemalan Government,&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;the U.S. Government.&amp;quot; The similarities indicate that some head nouns, when premodified, represent existential entities.
    By using the Si extractions as input to a pattern generation algorithm, we built a set of Existential Head Patterns (EHPs) that identify such constructions.
    These patterns are of the form &amp;quot;the &lt;x+&gt;5 &lt;nounl ...nounN&gt;&amp;quot; such as &amp;quot;the &lt;x+&gt; government&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;the &lt;x+&gt; Salvadoran government.&amp;quot; Figure 3 shows the algorithm for creating EHPs.
    It also became clear that some existentials never appear in indefinite constructions.
    &amp;quot;The F.B.I.,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;the contrary,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;the National Guard&amp;quot; are defi
