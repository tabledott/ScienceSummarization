 in their training (test?) set, a total of 12%.
    One potential concern is that PR paraphrases usually involve simple substitutions of words and short phrases (a mean edit distance of 2.9 on the top ranked sentences), whereas MSA outputs more complex paraphrases (reflected in a mean edit distance of 25.8).
    This is reflected in Table 3, which provides a breakdown of four dimensions of interest, as provided by one of our independent evaluators.
    Some 47% of MSA paraphrases involve significant reordering, such as an active-passive alternation, whereas the monotone PR decoder precludes anything other than minor transpositions within phrasal replacements.
    Should these facts be interpreted to mean that MSA, with its more dramatic rewrites, is ultimately more ambitious than PR?
    We believe that the opposite is true.
    A close look at MSA suggests that it is similar in spirit to example-based machine translation techniques that rely on pairing entire sentences in source and target languages, with th
