  TextRank: Bringing Order Into Texts
  
    In this paper, we introduce TextRank &#8211; a graph-based ranking model for text processing, and show how this model can be successfully used in natural language applications.
    In particular, we propose two innovative unsupervised methods for keyword and sentence extraction, and show that the results obtained compare favorably with previously published results on established benchmarks.
  
  
    Graph-based ranking algorithms like Kleinberg&#8217;s HITS algorithm (Kleinberg, 1999) or Google&#8217;s PageRank (Brin and Page, 1998) have been successfully used in citation analysis, social networks, and the analysis of the link-structure of the World Wide Web.
    Arguably, these algorithms can be singled out as key elements of the paradigm-shift triggered in the field of Web search technology, by providing a Web page ranking mechanism that relies on the collective knowledge of Web architects rather than individual content analysis of Web pages.
    In short, a gr
