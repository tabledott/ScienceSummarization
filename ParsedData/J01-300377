    We can see here that different frequency groups yield different classification behavior.
    However, the relation is not simple, and it is clearly affected by the composition of the frequency group: the middle group contains mostly unaccusative and objectdrop verbs, which are the verbs with which our experts have the most difficulty.
    This confirms that the class of the verb is the predominant factor in their pattern of errors.
    Note also that the pattern of accuracy across frequency groupings is not the same as that of the program (see Section 4.3, which revealed the most errors by the program on the highest frequency verbs), again indicating qualitative differences in performance between the program and the experts.
    Finally, one possible shortcoming of the above analysis is that the forced-choice task, while maximally comparable to our computational experiments, may not be a natural one for human experts.
    To explore this issue, we asked two different experts in lexical semantics (one
