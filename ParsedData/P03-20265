    The word classes and root forms were acquired with &#8220;TreeTagger&#8221;.
    (Shmid 1994) Replacement-type errors were detected by estimating whether or not each word should be deleted or replaced with another word string.
    The error category was also estimated during this process.
    As we did in detecting omission-type errors, if more than one error category was given, we use two methods of detection.
    Method C was used to estimate whether or not the word should be replaced with another word for each error category, and if it was to be replaced, the model estimated whether the word was located at the beginning, middle or end of the erroneous part.
    As we can see from Fig.
    3, this can be considered the same as deciding which of the three labels (Eb: &#8220;The word is at the beginn
