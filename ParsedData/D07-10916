m for morphologically rich languages such as Arabic, German, Czech, etc. Thus, it may be preferably to model translation between morphologically rich languages on the levelof lemmas, and thus pooling the evidence for differ ent word forms that derive from a common lemma.
			In such a model, we would want to translate lemmaand morphological information separately, and com bine this information on the output side to ultimately generate the output surface words.
			Such a model can be defined straight-forward as a factored translation model.
			See Figure 2 for an illustration of this model in our framework.
			Note that while we illustrate the use of factored translation models on such a linguistically motivated 869 example, our framework also applies to models that incorporate statistically defined word classes, or any other annotation.
	
	
			The translation of factored representations of input words into the factored representations of out put words is broken up into a sequence of mapping steps that either t
