e as borderline if it has at least one private-state expression identified by at least one annotator, and all strength ratings of private-state expressions are low.
    On average, 11% of the corpus is borderline under this definition.
    When those sentences are removed, the average pairwise percentage agreement increases to 95% and the average pairwise r. value increases to 0.89.
    As expected, the majority of disagreement cases involve low-strength subjectivity.
    The annotators consistently agree about which are the clear cases of subjective sentences.
    This leads us to define the gold-standard that we use when evaluating our results.
    A sentence is subjective if it contains at least one private-state expression of medium or higher strength.
    The second class, which we call objective, consists of everything else.
    Our pool of unannotated texts consists of 302,163 individual sentences.
    The BP-Subj classifier initially labeled roughly 44,300 of these sentences as subjective, and the BP-
