 this approach quite helpful, since most useful compressions that mimic TAG adjoining operations are missed by the extraction procedure of K&amp;M.
    Since we found that exploiting sentence pairs containing insertions had adverse consequences in terms of compression accuracies, we only report experiments with sentence pairs containing no insertions.
    We gathered sentence pairs with up to six substitutions using minimum edit distance matching (we will refer to these sets as ZD-0 to ZD-6).
    With a limit of up to six substitutions (ZD-6), we were able to train our models on 16,787 sentences, which represents about 25% of the total number of summary sentences of the Ziff-Davis corpus.
  
  
    All experiments presented in this section are performed on the Ziff-Davis corpus.
    We note first that all probability estimates of our Markovized grammars are smoothed.
    Indeed, incorporating lexical dependencies within models trained on data sets as small as 16,000 sentence pairs would be quite futile withou
