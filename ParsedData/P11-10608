tions.
    The tree structure still enables us to compute denotations efficiently based on (1) and (2).
    The basic version of DCS described thus far handles a core subset of language.
    But consider Figure 4: (a) is headed by borders, but states needs to be extracted; in (b), the quantifier no is syntactically dominated by the head verb borders but needs to take wider scope.
    We now present the full version of DCS which handles this type of divergence between syntactic and semantic scope.
    The key idea that allows us to give semanticallyscoped denotations to syntactically-scoped trees is as follows: We mark a node low in the tree with a mark relation (one of E, Q, or C).
    Then higher up in the tree, we invoke it with an execute relation Xi to create the desired semantic scope.2 This mark-execute construct acts non-locally, so to maintain compositionality, we must augment the denotation d = JzKw to include any information about the marked nodes in z that can be accessed by an execute relation lat
