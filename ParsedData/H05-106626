is actuallytrue that non-projective parsing has a lower asymptotic complexity.
			Using this framework, we pre sented results showing that the non-projective modeloutperforms the projective model on the Prague De pendency Treebank, which contains a small number of non-projective edges.
			Our method requires a tree score that decomposes according to the edges of the dependency tree.
			One might hope that the method would generalize to 529include features of larger substructures.
			Unfortu nately, that would make the search for the best tree intractable (Ho?ffgen, 1993).
