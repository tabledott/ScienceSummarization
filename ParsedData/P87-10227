of U.
    By [GJW86] a shift occurs whenever successive Cb's are not the same.
    This definition of shifting does not consider whether the Cb of Un and the Cp of Un are equal.
    It seems that the status of the Cp of Un should be as important in this case as it is in determining the retaining/continuing distinction.
    Therefore, we propose the following extension which handles some additional cases containing multiple ambiguous pronouns: we have extended rule 2 so that there are two kinds of shifts.
    A transition for Un is ranked more highly if Cb(Un) = CP(U); this state we call shifting-1 and it represents a more coherent way to shift.
    The preferred ranking is continuing &gt;- retaining shifting-1 &gt;- shifting (see figure 3).
    This extension enables us to successfully bind the &amp;quot;she&amp;quot; in the final utterance of the example in figure 4 to &amp;quot;Friedman.&amp;quot; The appendix illustrates the application of the algorithm to figure 4.
