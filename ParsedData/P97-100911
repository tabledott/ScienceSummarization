y are called in the WordNet).
    The links represent IS-A relationships.
    The number attached to a node C is the probability P(C) that a randomly selected noun refers to an instance of C. The probabilities are estimated by the frequency of concepts in SemCor (Miller et al., 1994), a sense-tagged subset of the Brown corpus.
    If x is a Hill and y is a Coast, the commonality between x and p is that &amp;quot;x is a GeoForm and y is a GeoForm&amp;quot;.
    The information contained in this statement is &#8212;2 x logP(GeoF arm).
    The similarity between the concepts Hill and Coast is: where p(ni co is the probability of that an object belongs to all the maximally specific super classes (Cts) of both C and C'.
    We now provide the details of Step C in our algorithm.
    The input to this step consists of a polysemous word V110 and its selectors {WI, W2 WO.
    The word Wi has ni senses: {sii, &#8226; &#8226; &#8226; , sin.
