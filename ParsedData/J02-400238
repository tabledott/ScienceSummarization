ds with previous sentence extraction experiments.
    We take this as an indication that some types of rhetorical classification are easier for human minds to do than unqualified relevance decision.
    We also think that the positive results are partly due to the existence of the guidelines.
    The annotators were less consistent at determining BASIS (K = .49) and CONTRAST (K = .59).
    The same picture emerges if we look at precision and recall of single categories between two annotators (cf.
    Table 3).
    Precision and recall for AIM and TEXTUAL are high at 72%/56% and 79%/79%, whereas they are lower for CONTRAST (50%/55%) and BASIS (82%/34%).
    This contrast in agreement might have to do with the location of the rhetorical zones in the paper: AIM and TEXTUAL zones are usually found in fixed locations (beginning or end of the introduction section) and are explicitly marked with metadiscourse, whereas CONTRAST sentences, and even more so BASIS sentences, are usually interspersed within longer OWN zo
