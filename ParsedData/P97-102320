    As we noted earlier, the corpus data is eventually represented in our system as a graph, with the nodes corresponding to adjectives and the links to predictions about whether the two connected adjectives have the same or different orientation.
    Thus the parameter P in the simulation experiments measures how well we are able to predict each link independently of the others, and the parameter k measures the number of distinct adjectives each adjective appears with in conjunctions.
    P therefore directly represents the precision of the link classification algorithm, while k indirectly represents the corpus size.
    To measure the effect of P and k (which are reflected in the graph topology), we need to carry out a series of experiments where we systematically vary their values.
    For example, as k (or the amount of data) increases for a given level of precision P for individual links, we want to measure how this affects overall accuracy of the resulting groups of nodes.
    Thus, we nee
