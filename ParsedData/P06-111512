tring s[i..j] becomes smaller than the length t. According to the equation, a production pi ? G and a partition (p1, .., pt) ? partition(s[i..j], t) will be selected in constructing the most probable partial derivation.
			These will be the ones whichmaximize the product of the probability of pi covering the substring s[i..j] with the product of probabilities of all the recursively found most proba ble partial derivations consistent with the partition (p1, .., pt).
			A naive implementation of the above recursionis computationally expensive, but by suitably extending the well known Earley?s context-free parsing algorithm (Earley, 1970), it can be implemented efficiently.
			The above task has some re semblance to probabilistic context-free grammar (PCFG) parsing for which efficient algorithms are available (Stolcke, 1995), but we note that our task of finding the most probable semantic derivation differs from PCFG parsing in two important ways.First, the probability of a production is not independent of the s
