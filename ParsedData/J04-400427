ndent.15 These subcats may be thought of as lists of requirements on a particular side of a head.
    For example, in Figure 8, after the root node of the tree has been generated (see Section 6.10), the head child VP is generated, conditioning on both the parent label S and the headword of that parent, sat&#8211;VBD.
    Before any modifiers of the head-child are generated, both a left- and right-subcat frame are generated.
    In this case, the left subcat is {NP-A} and the right subcat is {}, meaning that there are no required elements to be generated on the right side of the head.
    Subcats do not specify the order of the required arguments.
    They are dynamically updated multisets: When a requirement has been generated, it is removed from the multiset, and subsequent modifiers are generated conditioning on the updated multiset.16 The implementation of subcats in Collins&#8217; parser is even more specific: Subcats are multisets containing various numbers of precisely six types of items: NP-A, S-A, SBA
