    We believe that BLEU will accelerate the MT R&amp;D cycle by allowing researchers to rapidly home in on effective modeling ideas.
    Our belief is reinforced by a recent statistical analysis of BLEU&#8217;s correlation with human judgment for translation into English from four quite different languages (Arabic, Chinese, French, Spanish) representing 3 different language families (Papineni et al., 2002)!

    Finally, since MT and summarization can both be viewed as natural language generation from a textual context, we believe BLEU could be adapted to evaluating summarization or similar NLG tasks.
