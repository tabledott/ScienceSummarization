and Cicchetti 1990; Di Eugenio and Glass 2004).
    Moreover, when the data are highly skewed in favor of one category, the high agreement also corresponds to high accuracy: If, say, 95% of the data fall under one category label, then random coding would cause two coders to jointly assign this category label to 90.25% of the items, and on average 95% of these labels would be correct, for an overall accuracy of at least 85.7%.
    This leads to the surprising result that when data are highly skewed, coders may agree on a high proportion of items while producing annotations that are indeed correct to a high degree, yet the reliability coefficients remain low.
    (For an illustration, see the discussion of agreement results on coding discourse segments in Section 4.3.1.)
    This surprising result is, however, justified.
    Reliability implies the ability to distinguish between categories, but when one category is very common, high accuracy and high agreement can also result from indiscriminate coding.
