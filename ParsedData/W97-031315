r nouns with relatively unambiguous semantics, so we do not believe that this process compromised the integrity of the experiment.
    Finally, we graphed the results from the human judges.
    We counted the number of words judged as 5's by either judge, the number of words judged as 5's or 4's by either judge, the number of words judged as 5's, 4's, or 3's by either judge, and the number of words judged as either 5's, 4's, 3's, or 2's.
    We plotted the results after each 20 words, stepping down the ranked list, to see whether the words near the top of the list were more highly associated with the category than words farther down.
    We also wanted to see whether the number of category words leveled off or whether it continued to grow.
    The results from this experiment are shown in Figures 4-8.
    With the exception of the Energy category, we were able to find 25-45 words that were judged as 4's or 5's for each category.
    This was our strictest test because only true category members (or subparts o
