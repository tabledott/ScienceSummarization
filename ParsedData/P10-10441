ppear in the second argument of the relation X is headquartered in Y and companies or organizations in the first.
    A large, high-quality database of preferences has the potential to improve the performance of a wide range of NLP tasks including semantic role labeling (Gildea and Jurafsky, 2002), pronoun resolution (Bergsma et al., 2008), textual inference (Pantel et al., 2007), word-sense disambiguation (Resnik, 1997), and many more.
    Therefore, much attention has been focused on automatically computing them based on a corpus of relation instances.
    Resnik (1996) presented the earliest work in this area, describing an information-theoretic approach that inferred selectional preferences based on the WordNet hypernym hierarchy.
    Recent work (Erk, 2007; Bergsma et al., 2008) has moved away from generalization to known classes, instead utilizing distributional similarity between nouns to generalize beyond observed relation-argument pairs.
    This avoids problems like WordNet&#8217;s poor coverage of
