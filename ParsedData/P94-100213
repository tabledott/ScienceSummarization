his moving window approach means that each tokensequence appears in k * 2 similarity computations.
    Similarity between blocks is calculated by a cosine measure: given two text blocks b1 and 62, each with k token-sequences, E, uh,b1wi,b2 VE, '4,bl Ent-1 '14,b2 where t ranges over all the terms that have been registered during the tokenization step, and wt,bi is the weight assigned to term t in block 61.
    In this version of the algorithm, the weights on the terms are simply their frequency within the block.4 Thus if the similarity score between two blocks is high, then the blocks have many terms in common.
    This formula yields a score between 0 and 1, inclusive.
    These scores can be plotted, token-sequence number against similarity score.
    However, since similarity is measured between blocks b1 and 62, where b1 spans token-sequences i k through i and 62 spans i + 1 to i + k +1, the measurement's x-axis coordinate falls between token-sequences i and i + 1.
    Rather than plotting a token-sequence
