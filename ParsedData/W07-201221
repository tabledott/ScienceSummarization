ctable, and a system that works well with the 5http://nlp.uned.es/wepsnames in our test bed may not be reliable in practi cal, open search situations.
			Partly because of that,our test-bed happened to be unintentionally challenging for systems, with a large difference be tween the average ambiguity in the training and test datasets.
			Secondly, it is probably necessary to think about specific evaluation measures beyond standard clustering metrics such as purity and inverse purity,which are not tailored to the task and do not be have well when multiple classification is allowed.We hope to address these problems in a forthcom ing edition of the WEPS task.
