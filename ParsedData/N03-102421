f sentence quality.
    Recall the example of &#8220;bad&#8221; path we gave in Section 1: the battle of last week&#8217;s fighting took at least 12 people lost their people died in the fighting last week&#8217;s fighting.
    Our 4-gram based language model will not find any fault with this sentence.
    Notice, however, that some words (such as &#8220;fighting&#8221; and &#8220;people&#8221;) appear at least twice in this path, although they are not repeated in any of the source sentences.
    These erroneous repetitions indicate mis-alignment.
    By measuring the frequency of words that are mistakenly repeated, we can now examine quantitatively whether a direct application of the MSA algorithm suffers from different constituent orderings as we expected.
    For each sentence group, we get a list of words that never appear more than once in any sentence in this group.
    Given a word from this list and the FSA built from this group, we count the total number of paths that contain this word (C) and the num
