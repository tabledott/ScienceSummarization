both accuracy in sentence extraction and downstream improvement in an SMT system are presented.
  
  
    For any statistical machine translation system, the size of the parallel corpus used for training is a major factor in its performance.
    For some language pairs, such as Chinese-English and Arabic-English, large amounts of parallel data are readily available, but for most language pairs this is not the case.
    The domain of the parallel corpus also strongly influences the quality of translations produced.
    Many parallel corpora are taken from the news domain, or from parliamentary proceedings.
    Translation quality suffers when a system is not trained on any data from the domain it is tested on.
    While parallel corpora may be scarce, comparable, or semi-parallel corpora are readily available in several domains and language pairs.
    These corpora consist of a set of documents in two languages containing similar information.
