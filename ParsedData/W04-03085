 more detailed discussion of dependency graphs and well-formedness conditions, the reader is referred to Nivre (2003).
  
  
    Having defined dependency graphs, we may now consider to what extent it is possible to construct these graphs incrementally.
    In the strictest sense, we take incrementality to mean that, at any point during the parsing process, there is a single connected structure representing the analysis of the input consumed so far.
    In terms of our dependency graphs, this would mean that the graph being built during parsing is connected at all times.
    We will try to make this more precise in a minute, but first we want to discuss the relation between incrementality and determinism.
    It seems that incrementality does not by itself imply determinism, at least not in the sense of never undoing previously made decisions.
    Thus, a parsing method that involves backtracking can be incremental, provided that the backtracking is implemented in such a way that we can always maintain a sing
