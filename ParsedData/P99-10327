lassifications in Table 1 can be found in the marginal totals, ni+ and n+j.
    We see that judge 1 has a relative preference, or bias, for objective, while judge 2 has a bias for subjective.
    Relative bias is one aspect of agreement among judges.
    A second is whether the judges' disagreements are systematic, that is, correlated.
    One pattern of systematic disagreement is symmetric disagreement.
    When disagreement is symmetric, the differences between the actual counts, and the counts expected if the judges' decisions were not correlated, are symmetric; that is, Snii for i j, where 5,i, is the difference from independence.
    Our goal is to correct correlated disagreements automatically.
    We are particularly interested in systematic disagreements resulting from relative bias.
    We test for evidence of such correlations by fitting probability models to the data.
    Specifically, we study bias using the model for marginal homogeneity, and symmetric disagreement using the model for quasisymmet
