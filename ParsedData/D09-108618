 F-score was 33.9% for Spanish and 26.3% for Chinese.
    Compare this to the Spanish attach-left baseline of 31.0% and the Chinese attach-right baselines of 35.9%.
    These discouragingly low numbers led them to write languagespecific transformation rules to fix up the projected trees.
    After these rules were applied to the projections of automatic English parses, F-score was 65.7% for English and 52.4% for Chinese.
    While these F-scores were low, it is useful to look at a subset of the alignment: dependencies projected across one-to-one alignments before the heuristic fix-ups had a much higher precision, if lower recall, than Hwa et al.&#8217;s final results.
    Using Hwa et al.&#8217;s data, we calculated that the precision of projection to Spanish and Chinese via these one-to-one links was &#8776; 65% (Table 2).
    There is clearly more information in these direct links than one would think from the F-scores.
    To exploit this information, however, we need to overcome the problems of (1) learni
