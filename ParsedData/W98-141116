terestingly, Marcu uses &amp;quot;right skew&amp;quot; to b disambiguate between alternative trees produced in rhetorical parsing.
    Here we are setting it as a much harder constraint.
    The only 21n fact, there is local left-branching for (non-nested) relations whose satellite is presented first.
    Such relations are often presented using embedded clauses in a way that signals the deviation from right-branching clearly to the reader. exception is &amp;quot;joint&amp;quot; relations, which can join together texts of any size, but since there is no real The first two assumptions above make fundamental use of the order in which facts will appear in the text.
    For simplicity, we assume that every relation has a fixed order of nucleus and satellite (though this assumption could be relaxed).
    The approach is controversial in that it takes into account realisation order in the criterion for a legal tree.
    It is likely that the above assumptions will not apply equally well to all types of text.
