ng with the number N&amp;quot;.
    A DCG rule is just &amp;quot;syntactic sugar&amp;quot; for a definite clause.
    The clause for the example above is In general, a DCG non-terminal with n arguments is translated into a predicate of n+2 arguments, the last two of which are the string points, as in the translation of context-free rules into definite clauses.
    The main idea of DCGs is then that grammar symbols can be general logic terms rather than just atomic symbols.
    This makes DCGs a general-purpose grammar formalism, capable of describing any type-0 language.
    The first grammar formalism with logic terms as grammar symbols was Colmerauer's metamorphosis grammars [2].
    Where a DCG is a CFG with logic terms for grammar symbols, a MG is a somewhat restricted type-0 grammar with logic terms for grammar symbols.
    However, the very simple translation of DCGs into definite clauses presented above does not carry over directly to MGs.
    Roughly speaking, left extraposition occurs in a natural la
