umber of correctly identified paraphrase pairs in the corpus using the text semantic similarity measure as the only indicator of paraphrasing.
    In addition, we also evaluate the measure using the PASCAL corpus (Dagan et al., 2005), consisting of 1,380 test&#8211;hypothesis pairs with a directional entailment (580 development pairs and 800 test pairs).
    For each of the two data sets, we conduct two evaluations, under two different settings: (1) An unsupervised setting, where the decision on what constitutes a paraphrase (entailment) is made using a constant similarity threshold of 0.5 across all experiments; and (2) A supervised setting, where the optimal threshold and weights associated with various similarity metrics are determined through learning on training data.
    In this case, we use a voted perceptron algorithm (Freund and Schapire, 1998)3.
    We evaluate the text similarity metric built on top of the various word-to-word metrics introduced in Section 2.1.
    For comparison, we also compute t
