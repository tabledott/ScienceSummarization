ent (the subserted structure) which are not substituted can be interspersed within the structure that is the site of the subsertion.
    Following earlier work (Becker et al., Vijay-Shanker, 1992), a mechanism involving the use of domination links (d-edges) that ensure that parts of the subserted structure that are not substituted dominate those parts that are.
    Furthermore, there is a need to constrain the way in which the non-substituted components can be interspersed'.
    This is done by either using appropriate feature constraints at nodes or by means of subsertion-insertion constraints (see Section 2).
    We end this section by briefly commenting on the of sister-adjunction.
    In TAG, modification is performed with adjunction of modifier trees that have a highly constrained form.
    In particular, the foot nodes of these trees are always daughters of the root and either the leftmost or rightmost frontier nodes.
    The effect of adjoining a these cases the foot node is an argument node of the lex
