s two new English words.
    The first has fertility zero, while the second is aligned to a single French word.
    Extend aligns an additional French word to the most recent English word, increasing its fertility.
    AddNull aligns a French word to the English NULL element.
    AddZfert is by far the most expensive operation, as we must consider inserting a zero-fertility English word before each translation of each unaligned French word.
    With an English vocabulary size of 40,000, AddZfert is 400,000 times more expensive than AddNull!
    We can reduce the cost of AddZfert in two ways.
    First, we can consider only certain English words as candidates for zero-fertility, namely words which both occur frequently and have a high probability of being assigned frequency zero.
    Second, we can only insert a zero-fertility word if it will increase the probability of a hypothesis.
    According to the definition of the decoding problem, a zero-fertility English word can only make a decoding more likely by i
