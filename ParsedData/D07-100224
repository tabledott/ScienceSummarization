n and an swer paths is computed using a simplified version of the similarity measure6 proposed in Shen and Klakow (2006).
			Our second baseline employs Shalmaneser (Erkand Pado?, 2006), a publicly available shallow se mantic parser7, for the role labeling task instead of the graph-based model presented in Section 4.
			Thesoftware is trained on the FrameNet annotated sen tences using a standard feature set (see Carreras and Ma`rquez (2005) for details).
			We use Shalmaneser to parse questions and answer sentences.
			The parser makes hard decisions about the presence or absence of a semantic role.
			Unfortunately, this prevents usfrom using our method for semantic structure match ing (see Section 5) which assumes a soft labeling.We therefore came up with a simple matching strat egy suitable for the parser?s output.
			For questionand answer sentences matching in their frame as signment, phrases bearing the same semantic role asthe EAP are considered answer candidates.
			The latter are ranked according to
