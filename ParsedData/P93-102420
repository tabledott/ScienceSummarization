r a noun n by where p(c1n) also depends on 0.
    As a first experiment, we used our method to classify the 64 nouns appearing most frequently as heads of direct objects of the verb &amp;quot;fire&amp;quot; in one year (1988) of Associated Press newswire.
    In this corpus, the chosen nouns appear as direct object heads of a total of 2147 distinct verbs, so each noun is represented by a density over the 2147 verbs.
    Figure 1 shows the four words most similar to each cluster centroid, and the corresponding wordcentroid KL distances, for the four clusters resulting from the first two cluster splits.
    It can be seen that first split separates the objects corresponding to the weaponry sense of &amp;quot;fire&amp;quot; (cluster 1) from the ones corresponding to the personnel action (cluster 2).
    The second split then further refines the weaponry sense into a projectile sense (cluster 3) and a gun sense (cluster 4).
    That split is somewhat less sharp, possibly because not enough distinguishing contexts
