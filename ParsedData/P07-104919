e ambiguous and require different linking in different contexts.
    To solve these problems, the weight of the link is taken from the values of In and Out on the best matching label between x and y.
    This label depends on both words and is usually a frequent word with reliable statistics.
    It serves as a prototype for the relation between x and y.
    A label l is a matching label between Ax i and AySign(&#8722;i) if Axi(l) &gt; Axi (Stop) and either l = (y, 1) or AySign(&#8722;i)(l&#8722;1) &gt; 0.
    The best matching label at Axi is the matching label l such that the match strength min(&#65533;Axi (l), &#65533;AySign(&#8722;i)(l&#8722;1)) is maximal (if l = (y, 1) then &#65533;AySign(&#8722;i)(l&#8722;1) is defined to be 1).
    In practice, as before, only the top 10 labels in Axi and AySign(&#8722;i) are considered.
    The best matching label from x to y is calculated between Axi and AySign(&#8722;i) such that Axi is on the same side of x as y and was either already used to create a link or is t
