ernel and the dynamic context sensitive tree span proposed in this paper.
			Then, we evaluate the complementary nature between our tree kernel and a state-of-the-art linear ker nel via a composite kernel.
			Generally different feature-based methods and tree kernel-based methods have their own merits.
			It is usually easy to build a system using a feature-based method and achieve the state-of-the-art performance, while tree kernel-based methods hold the potential for further performance improvement.
			Therefore, it is always a good idea to integrate them via a composite kernel.
			4 This can be done by first representing all entity men-.
			tions with their head words and then restoring all the entity mentions after parsing.
			Moreover, please note that the final performance of relation extraction may change much with different range of parsing errors.
			We will study this issue in the near future.
