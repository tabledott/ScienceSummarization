.
    All three coefficients therefore yield values of agreement between &#8722;Ae/1 &#8722; Ae (no observed agreement) and 1(observed agreement = 1), with the value 0 signifying chance agreement (observed agreement = expected agreement).
    Note also that whenever agreement is less than perfect (Ao &lt; 1), chance-corrected agreement will be strictly lower than observed agreement, because some amount of agreement is always expected by chance.
    Observed agreement Ao is easy to compute, and is the same for all three coefficients&#8212;the proportion of items on which the two coders agree.
    But the notion of chance agreement, or the probability that two coders will classify an arbitrary item as belonging to the same category by chance, requires a model of what would happen if coders&#8217; behavior was only by chance.
    All three coefficients assume independence of the two coders&#8212;that is, that the chance of c1 and c2 agreeing on any given category k is the product of the chance of each of them as
