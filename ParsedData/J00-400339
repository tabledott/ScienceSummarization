ssified as an anaphoric use. knowledge required to identify the relation is shared by the listener (Hawkins 1978; Clark and Marshall 1981; Prince 1981).
    This dependence on commonsense knowledge means that, in general, a system can only resolve bridging descriptions when supplied with an adequate knowledge base; for this reason, the typical way of implementing a system for resolving bridging descriptions has been to restrict the domain and feed the system with hand-coded world knowledge (see, for example, Sidner [1979] and especially Carter [1987]).
    A broader view of bridging phenomena (not only bridging descriptions) is presented in Hahn, Strube, and Markert (1996).
    They make use of a knowledge base from which they extract conceptual links to feed an adaptation of the centering model (Grosz, Joshi, and Weinstein 1995).
    The relation between bridging descriptions and their anchors may be arbitrarily complex (Clark 1977; Sidner 1979; Prince 1981; Strand 1996), and the same description may relate
