    The tagging process is usually done by trained lexicographers, and consequently is quite expensive, limiting the size of such corpora to a handful of tagged texts.
    This paper introduces Open Mind Word Expert, a Web-based system that aims at creating large sense tagged corpora with the help of Web users.

    We expect that the system will yield more training data of comparable quality and at a significantly lower cost than the traditional method of hiring lexicographers.
    Open Mind Word Expert is a newly born project that follows the Open Mind initiative (Stork, 1999).
    The basic idea behind Open Mind is to use the information and knowledge that may be collected from the existing millions of Web users, to the end of creating more intelligent software.
    This idea has been used in Open Mind Common Sense, which acquires commonsense kno
