ns between them are extremely complex and go beyond the scope of this paper.
    Given these complexities, it is not surprising that the annotation instructions for the MUC and ACE data sets reflect different interpretations and simplifications of the general coreference relation.
    We outline some of these differences below.
    Syntactic Types.
    To avoid ambiguity, we will use the term coreference element (CE) to refer to the set of linguistic expressions that participate in the coreference relation, as defined for each of the MUC and ACE tasks.1 At times, it will be important to distinguish between the CEs that are included in the gold standard &#8212; the annotated CEs &#8212; from those that are generated by the coreference resolution system &#8212; the extracted CEs.
    At a high level, both the MUC and ACE evaluations define CEs as nouns, pronouns, and noun phrases.
    However, the MUC definition excludes (1) &#8220;nested&#8221; named entities (NEs) (e.g.
    &#8220;America&#8221; in &#8220;Ban
