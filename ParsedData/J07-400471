each iteration the parallel sums are combined to give a master sum.
    Producing a master operation across a cluster using MPI is a reduce operation.
    In our case, every node needs to be holding a copy of the master sum, so we use an all reduce operation.
    The MPI library handles all aspects of the parallelization, including finding the optimal way of summing across the nodes of the Beowulf cluster (typically it is done using a tree algorithm).
    In fact, the parallelization only adds around twenty lines of code to the single-process implementation.
    Because of the simplicity of the parellel communication between the nodes, parallelizing the estimation code is an example of an embarrassingly parallel problem.
    One difficult aspect of the parallel implementation is that debugging can be much harder, in which case it is often easier to test a non-MPI version of the program first.
  
  
    For the normal-form model, the Viterbi algorithm is used to find the most probable derivation from a packed
