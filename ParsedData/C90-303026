been achieved using plain morphological information, i.e.
  information present in [he cohorts of neighbouring words.
  No syntactic functions have been used.
  No enorrnous amounts of disambiguation constraints will thus be needed, the finar order of magnitude might be some 500.
  We consider this number surprisingly small.
  It shows the descriptive power of low-level morphology-based constraints.
  The most successful achievements so far in the domain of large-scale morphological disambigua- tion of running text have been those for English reported by Garside, Leech, and Sampson (1987), on tagging the LOB corpus, and Church (1988), on assigning part-of-speech labels and parsing noun phrases.
  Success rates ranging between 95-99% are reported, depending on how success is defined.
  These approaches are probabilistic and based on transitional probabilities calculated from extensive pretagged corpora.
  As for morphological disambiguation, CGP has achieved almost the same success rate.
