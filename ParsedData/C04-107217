t sentence level, we apply the following smoothing technique: Add one count to the n-gram hit and total n gram count for n &gt; 1.
			Therefore, for candidate translations with less than n words, they can still get a positive smoothed BLEU score from shorter n-gram matches; however if nothing matches then they will get zero scores.
			We call the smoothed BLEU: BLEUS.
			For each candidate translation in the 1024-best list and each reference, we compute the following scores: 1.
			BLEUS1 to 9.
			2. NIST, PER, and WER.
			3.
			ROUGE-L.
			4.
			ROUGE-W with weight ranging from 1.1.
			to 2.0 with increment of 0.1
	
	
			ranging from 0 to 9 (ROUGE-S0 to S9) and without any skip distance limit (ROUGE-S*) We compute the average score of the references and then rank the candidate translations and the references according to these automatic scores.
			The ORANGE score for each metric is calculated as the average rank of the average reference (oracle) score over the whole corpus (872 sentences) divided by the leng
