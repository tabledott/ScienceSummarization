n one of two ways.
    Either there is a failure to distinguish between these two structures, because the network fails to keep track of the fact that John is subject in one and object in the other, or there is a failure to recognize that both structures involve the same participants, because John as a subject has a distinct representation from John as an object.
    In contrast, symbolic representations can naturally handle the binding of constituents to their roles, in a systematic manner that avoids both these problems.
    Smolensky (1990) proposed the use of tensor products as a means of binding one vector to another.
    The tensor product u &#174; v is a matrix whose components are all the possible products uivj of the components of vectors u and v. A major difficulty with tensor products is their dimensionality which is higher than the dimensionality of the original vectors (precisely, the tensor product has dimensionality m x n).
    To overcome this problem, other techniques have been proposed in wh
