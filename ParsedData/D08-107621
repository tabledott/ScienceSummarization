ecified as an interval Rm~r = [lm, rms], lm, rmP E lR, u {&#8212;oo, +oo} which defines the admissible region from which the feature function weight &#955;m can be chosen.
    If the line optimization is performed under the presence of weights restrictions, &#947; needs to be chosen such that the following constraint holds: itive or negative) boost &#969; on the objective function if the new weight is chosen such that it matches a certain target value A* A zero-weights prior (Am~0) provides a means of doing feature selection since the weight of a feature function which is not discriminative will be set to zero.
    An initial-weights prior (Am~&#955;m) can be used to confine changes in the parameter update with the consequence that the new parameter may be closer to the initial weights set.
    Initial weights priors are useful in cases where the starting weights already yield a decent baseline.
