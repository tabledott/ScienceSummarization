ion runs outperform the individual systems and that in most cases the differences are statistically significant.
    While this is to be expected, system combination is not guaranteed to improve performance as some of the lower ranked combination runs show, which are outperformed by individual systems.
    Also note that except for Czech-English translation the online systems ONLINEA and ONLINEB where not included for the system combination runs Understandability Our hope is that judging the acceptability of edited output as discussed in Section 3 gives some indication of how often a system&#8217;s output was understandable.

    This style of manual evaluation is experimental and should not be taken to be authoritative.
    Some caveats about this measure:
