2N possible subsets, and 22N possible sets of subsets, giving us a doubly exponential number of possible lattices.
    The particular lattice of Figure 7 was chosen to represent some expected interaction between features.
    For example, we expect position and voice to interact, and they are always used together.
    We expect the head word h and the phrase type pt to be relatively independent predictors of the semantic role and therefore include them separately as roots of the backoff structure.
    Although we will not explore all the possibilities for our lattice, some of the feature interactions are examined more closely in Section 4.3.
    The final system performed at 80.4% accuracy, which can be compared to the 40.9% achieved by always choosing the most probable role for each target word, essentially chance performance on this task.
    Results for this system on test data, held out during development of the system, are shown in Table 6.
    Surprisingly, the EM-based interpolation performed better th
