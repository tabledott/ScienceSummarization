used for all examples in the data set, ensuring that the transducer fragments recorded for the entire data set will form a complete collection of head transducer transition networks.
    Figure 7 shows a decomposition in which w has a dependent to either side, v has both dependents to the right, and the alignment is &amp;quot;swapping&amp;quot; (f(wi) is to the right of f (wr)).
    The construction for this decomposition case is illustrated in Figure 8 as part of a finite-state transition diagram, and described in more detail below.
    (The other transition arrows shown in the diagram will arise from other bitext alignments containing (w, f (w)) pairings.)
    Other cases covered by our algorithm (e.g., a single left source dependent but no right source dependent, or target dependents on either side of the target head) are simple variants.
    The detailed construction is as follows: If instead the alignment had been as in Figure 9, in which the source dependents are mapped to target dependents in a paralle
