Our goal is to find the decoder that has the best performance over all translations.
    This is measured through Bayes-Risk : The expectation is taken under the true distribution that describes translations of human quality.
    Given a loss function and a distribution, it is well known that the decision rule that minimizes the BayesRisk is given by (Bickel and Doksum, 1977; Goel and Byrne, 2000): We shall refer to the decoder given by this equation as the Minimum Bayes-Risk (MBR) decoder.
    The MBR decoder can be thought of as selecting a consensus translation: For each sentence, Equation 3 selects the translation that is closest on an average to all the likely translations and alignments.
    The closeness is measured under the loss function of interest.
    This optimal decoder has the difficulties of search (minimization) and computing the expectation under the true distribution.
    In practice, we will consider the space of translations to be an -best list of translation alternatives generated under
