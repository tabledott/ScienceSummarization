redicate and modal operator in these axioms, and throughout the paper, should be indexed by a state or time.
    The resulting logic would be, accordingly, more complex.
    The issue is raised again in sect.
    6.
    A plan to transform a world W[0] (represented by a formula) into a world W[n] is a sequence of actions Al, ..., An such that the preconditions of Ai are true in W[i-1], and Ai transforms world W[i-1] into W[i].
    An agent can achieve a goal by constructing and then executing a plan which transforms the current state of the world into one in which the goal obtains.
    This can be done by finding an operator which, if executed in some world, would achieve the goal.
    If its preconditions are satisfied in the initial world, the plan is complete.
    Otherwise, the planning process attempts to achieve the preconditions.
    This simple view of plan construction as a &amp;quot;backward chaining&amp;quot; process can be refined by assuming different levels of &amp;quot;detail&amp;quot; in the r
