onsists of the first partial entity [1] (i.e., node (a) in Figure 1).
    Next, mention 2 becomes active (marked by &#8220;*&#8221; in node (a)) and can either link with the partial entity [1] and result in anew node (b1), or start anew entity and create another node (b2).
    The partial entity which the active mention considers linking with is said to be in-focus.
    In-focus entities are highlighted on the solid arrows in Figure 1.
    Similarly, mention 3 will be active in the next stage and can take five possible actions, which create five possible coreference results shown in node (c1) through (c5).
    Under the derivation illustrated in Figure 1, each leaf node in the Bell tree corresponds to a possible coreference outcome, and there is no other way to form entities.
    The Bell tree clearly represents the search space of the coreference resolution problem.
    The coreference resolution can therefore be cast equivalently as finding the &#8220;best&#8221; leaf node.
    Since the search space is lar
