xtraction through an approach more closely tied to text.
    These goals were pursued in the first event, BioNLP-ST 2009 (Kim et al., 2009), through high quality benchmark data provided for system development and detailed evaluation performed to identify remaining problems hindering extraction performance.
    Also, as the complexity of the task was high and system development time limited, we encouraged focus on fine-grained IE by providing gold annotation for named entities as well as various supporting resources.
    BioNLP-ST 2009 attracted wide attention, with 24 teams submitting final results.
    The task setup and data since have served as the basis for numerous studies (Miwa et al., 2010b; Poon and Vanderwende, 2010; Vlachos, 2010; Miwa et al., 2010a; Bj&#168;orne et al., 2010).
    As the second event of the series, BioNLP-ST 2011 preserves the general design and goals of the previous event, but adds a new focus on variability to address a limitation of BioNLP-ST 2009: the benchmark data sets were b
