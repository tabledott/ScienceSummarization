proaches (e.g., Dorr 1994; Watanabe 1995) to posing the translation problem, i.e., the approach in which translation problems are seen in terms of bridging the gap between the most natural monolingual representations underlying the sentences of each language.
    The training method has four stages: (i) Compute co-occurrence statistics from the training data.
    (ii) Search for an optimal synchronized hierarchical alignment for each bitext.
    (iii) Construct a set of head transducers that can generate these alignments with transition weights derived from maximum likelihood estimation.
    For each source word w in the data set, assign a cost, the translation pairing cost c(w, v) for all possible translations v into the target language.
    These translations of the source word may be zero, one, or several target language words (see Section 4.4 for discussion of the multiword case).
    The assignment of translation pairing costs (effectively a statistical bilingual dictionary) may be done using various sta
