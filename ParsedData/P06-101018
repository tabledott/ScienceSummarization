ce of the frequency correlation method is in general much worse, which is not surprising, given the fact that terms may be correlated merely because they are topically related.
    Since the two methods exploit complementary resources, it is natural to see if we can improve performance by combining the two methods.
    Indeed, intuitively the best candidate is the one that has a good pronunciation alignment as well as a correlated frequency distribution with the English name.
    We evaluated two strategies for combining the two methods.
    The first strategy is to use the phonetic model to filter out (clearly impossible) candidates and then use the frequency correlation method to rank the candidates.
    The second is to combine the scores of these two methods.
    Since the correlation coefficient has a maximum value of 1, we normalize the phonetic correspondence score by dividing all scores by the maximum score so that the maximum normalized value is also 1.
    We then take the average of the two scores
