pertain to syntactic alternations in how arguments are realized, they overlap with the function of the FEG prior.
    Adding unnecessary features to the system can reduce performance by fragmenting the training data.
    In the experiments reported in previous sections, we have used the parse tree returned by a statistical parser as input to the role-labeling system.
    In this section, we explore the interaction between semantic roles and syntactic parsing by integrating the parser with the semantic-role probability model.
    This allows the semantic-role assignment to affect the syntactic attachment decisions made by the parser, with the hope of improving the accuracy of the complete system.
    Although most statistical parsing work measures performance in terms of syntactic trees without semantic information, an assignment of role fillers has been incorporated into a statistical parsing model by Miller et al. (2000) for the domain-specific templates of the Message Understanding Conference (Defense Advan
