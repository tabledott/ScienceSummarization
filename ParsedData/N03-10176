 Since the future cost estimate is not perfect, this leads to search errors.
    Our future cost estimate takes into account the estimated phrase translation cost, but not the expected distortion cost.
    We compute this estimate as follows: For each possible phrase translation anywhere in the sentence (we call it a translation option), we multiply its phrase translation probability with the language model probability for the generated English phrase.
    As language model probability we use the unigram probability for the first word, the bigram probability for the second, and the trigram probability for all following words.
    Given the costs for the translation options, we can compute the estimated future cost for any sequence of consecutive foreign words by dynamic programming.
    Note that this is only possible, since we ignore distortion costs.
    Since there are only such sequences for a foreign input sentence of length , we can pre-compute these cost estimates beforehand and store them in a table.
