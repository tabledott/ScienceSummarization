results, and parses a test sentence in linear observed time, with respect to the sentence length.
    It uses simple and concisely specified predicates which can added or modified quickly with little human effort under the maximum entropy framework.
    Lastly, this paper clearly demonstrates that schemes for reranking the top 20 parses deserve research effort since they could yield vastly better accuracy results.
