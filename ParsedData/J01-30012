le competition designed to bring some conformity to the field of WSD, although it has yet to achieve that aim completely.
    The main sources of divergence are the choice of computational paradigm, the proportion of text words disambiguated, the granularity of the meanings assigned to them, and the knowledge sources used.
    We will discuss each in turn.
    Resnik and Yarowsky (1997) noted that, for the most part, part-of-speech tagging is tackled using the noisy channel model, although transformation rules and grammaticostatistical methods have also had some success.
    There has been far less consensus as to the best approach to WSD.
    Currently, machine learning methods (Yarowsky 1995; Rigau, Atserias, and Agirre 1997) and combinations of classifiers (McRoy 1992) have been popular.
    This paper reports a WSD system employing elements of both approaches.
    Another source of difference in approach is the proportion of the vocabulary disambiguated.
    Some researchers have concentrated on producing
