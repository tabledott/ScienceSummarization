a (in cell ci,i) represents the numbei of potential boundaries identified by both the algorithm and the subjects, b the number identified by the algorithm but not the subjects, c the number identified by the subjects but not the algorithm, and d the number neither the algorithm nor the subjects identified.
    Table 2 also shows the definition of the four evaluation metrics in terms of these values.
    Recall errors represent the false rejection of a boundary, while precision errors represent the false acceptance of a boundary.
    An algorithm with perfect performance segments a discourse by placing a boundary at all and only those locations with a subject boundary.
    Such an algorithm has 100% recall and precision, and 0% fallout and error.
    For each narrative, our human segmentation data provides us with a set of boundaries classified by 7 levels of subject strength: (1 &lt; Ti &lt; 7).
    That is, boundaries of strength 7 are the set of possible boundaries identified by all 7 subjects.
