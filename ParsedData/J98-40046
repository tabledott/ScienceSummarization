implicit in the PCFG model weaker.
    The effect of adding a particularly simple kind of contextual information&#8212;the category of the node's parent&#8212;is also studied in this paper.
    Whether either of these two PCFG models outperforms a PCFG induced from the original treebank is a separate question.
    We face a classical &amp;quot;bias versus variance&amp;quot; dilemma here (Geman, Bienenstock, and Doursat 1992): as the independence assumptions implicit in the PCFG model are weakened, the number of parameters that must be estimated (i.e., the number of productions) increases.
    Thus while moving to a class of models with weaker independence assumptions permits us to more accurately describe a wider class of distributions (i.e., it reduces the bias implicit in the estimator), in general our estimate of these parameters will be less accurate simply because there are more of them to estimate from the same data (i.e., the variance in the estimator increases).
