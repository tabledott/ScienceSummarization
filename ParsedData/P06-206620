    (Both cases are annotation errors.) degree 2.)
    Regarding the binary constraints, we find that planarity accounts for slightly more than the projective structures (86.41% of the data is planar), while almost all structures in DDT (99.89%) meet the well-nestedness constraint.
    The difference between the two constraints becomes clearer when we base the figures on the set of non-projective structures only: out of these, less than 10% are planar, while more than 99% are well-nested.
    For PDT, both the number of non-projective structures (around 23%) and the minimal degrees of non-projectivity required to cover the full data (gap degree 4 and edge degree 6) are higher than in DDT.
    The proportion of planar analyses is smaller than in DDT if we base it on the set of all structures (82.16%), but significantly larger when base
