ness.
			Other measures have been proposed that utilize the text in WordNet?s definitional glosses, such as Extended Lesk(Banerjee and Pedersen, 2003) and later the Gloss Vectors (Patwardhan and Pedersen, 2006) method.
			These ap proaches are primarily based on comparing the ?bag of words?
			of two synsets?
			gloss text concatenated with the text of neighboring words?
			glosses in the taxonomy.
			As a result, these gloss-based methods measure relatedness.
			Our model captures some of this relatedness information by including weighted links based on gloss text.
			A variety of other measures of semantic relatedness have been proposed, including distributional similarity measures based on co-occurrence in a body of text?see (Weeds and Weir, 2005) for a survey.
			Other measures make use of alternative structured information resources than WordNet, such as Roget?s thesaurus (Jar masz and Szpakowicz, 2003).
			More recently, measures incorporating information from Wikipedia (Gabrilovich and Markovitch, 2007
