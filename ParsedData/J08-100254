meter estimation algorithm.
    &#8220;No. of feature occurrences&#8221; denotes the total number of occurrences of features in the training data, and &#8220;Data size&#8221; gives the sizes of the compressed files of training data.
    We can conclude that feature forest models are estimated at a tractable computational cost and a reasonable data size, even when a model includes semantic features including nonlocal dependencies.
    The results reveal that feature forest models essentially solve the problem of the estimation of probabilistic models of sentence structures.
    Table 9 compares the estimation methods introduced in Section 4.4.
    In all of the following experiments, we show the accuracy for the test set (&lt;40 words) only.
    Table 9 reveals that our method achieves significantly lower accuracy when it is used only for filtering in the training phrase.
    One reason is that the feature forest model prefers lexical entries that are filtered out in the training phase, because they are always
