nd without distance measures), rule instantiation features (with and without a lexical head), lexical category features, and root category features.
    Dependency features are the 5-tuples defined in Section 1.
    There are also three additional dependency feature types which have an extra distance field (and only include the head of the lexical category, and not the head of the argument); these count the number of words (0, 1, 2 or more), punctuation marks (0, 1, 2 or more), and verbs (0, 1 or more) between head and dependent.
    Lexical category features are word&#8211;category pairs at the leaf nodes, and root features are headword&#8211;category pairs at the root nodes.
    Rule instantiation features simply encode the combining categories together with the result category.
    There is an additional rule feature type which also encodes the lexical head of the resulting category.
    Additional generalised features for each feature type are formed by replacing words with their POS tags.
