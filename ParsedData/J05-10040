  We discuss the criteria used to define the sets of semantic roles used in the annotation process and to analyze the frequency of syntactic/semantic alternations in the corpus.
  We describe an automatic system for semantic role tagging trained on the corpus and discuss the effect on its performance of various types of information, including a comparison of full syntactic parsing with a flat representation and the contribution of the empty ??trace??

  Introduction Robust syntactic parsers, made possible by new statistical techniques (Ratnaparkhi 1997; Collins 1999, 2000; Bangalore and Joshi 1999; Charniak 2000) and by the availability of large, hand-annotated training corpora (Marcus, Santori
