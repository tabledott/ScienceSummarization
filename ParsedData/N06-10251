 linguistic form.
    However, the literature emphasizes since the very beginning the relevance of world knowledge and inference for coreference resolution (Charniak, 1973).
    This paper explores whether coreference resolution can benefit from semantic knowledge sources.
    More specifically, whether a machine learning based approach to coreference resolution can be improved and which phenomena are affected by such information.
    We investigate the use of the WordNet and Wikipedia taxonomies for extracting semantic similarity and relatedness measures, as well as semantic parsing information in terms of semantic role labeling (Gildea &amp; Jurafsky, 2002, SRL henceforth).
    We believe that the lack of semantics in the current systems leads to a performance bottleneck.
    In order to correctly identify the discourse entities which are referred to in a text, it seems essential to reason over the lexical semantic relations, as well as the event representations embedded in the text.
    As an example, cons
