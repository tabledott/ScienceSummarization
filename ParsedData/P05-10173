and &#8220;simplistic but well-received&#8221;, where the former pair of words tend to have the same semantic orientation, and the latter tend to have the opposite orientation.
    They first classify each conjunctive expression into the same-orientation class or the different-orientation class.
    They then use the classified expressions to cluster words into the positive class and the negative class.
    The experiments were conducted with the dataset that they created on their own.
    Evaluation was limited to adjectives.
    Kobayashi et al. (2001) proposed a method for extracting semantic orientations of words with bootstrapping.
    The semantic orientation of a word is determined on the basis of its gloss, if any of their 52 hand-crafted rules is applicable to the sentence.
    Rules are applied iteratively in the bootstrapping framework.
    Although Kobayashi et al.&#8217;s work provided an accurate investigation on this task and inspired our work, it has drawbacks: low recall and language dependen
