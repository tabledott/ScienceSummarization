ata tradeoff for each data size.
    In addition, the development test data is used to optimize typically very few parameters, so in practice small held-out sets are generally adequate, and perhaps can be avoided altogether with techniques such as deleted estimation.
    In this section, we discuss the details of our implementations of various smoothing techniques.
    Due to space limitations, these descriptions are not comprehensive; a more complete discussion .is presented in Chen (1996).
    The titles of the following sections include the mnemonic we use to refer to the implementations in later sections.
    Unless otherwise specified, for those smoothing models defined recursively in terms of lower-order models, we end the recursion by taking the n = 0 distribution to be the uniform distribution Pu(w) = VIVI.
    For each method, we highlight the parameters (e.g., An and 6 below) that can be tuned to optimize performance.
    Parameter values are determined through training on held-out data.
    For our
