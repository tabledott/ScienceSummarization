dition to extending into new languages, MTurk also allows for the creation of evaluation sets in new genres and domains, which was the focus of two papers in this workshop (Fininet al, 2010; Yetisgen-Yildiz et al, 2010).
			We ex pect to see new research emphasis on low resource languages and new domains and genres.
			Another factor is the change of data type and itsimpact on machine learning algorithms.
			With pro fessional annotators, great time and care are paid to annotation guidelines and annotator training.
			These are difficult tasks with MTurk, which favors simple intuitive annotations and little training.
			Many papersapplied creative methods of using simpler annota tion tasks to create more complex data sets.
			This process can impact machine learning in a numberof ways.
			Rather than a single gold standard, annotations are now available for many users.
			Learning across multiple annotations may improve sys tems (Dredze et al, 2009).
			Additionally, even withefforts to clean up MTurk annotat
