e tree, S(y) = x, and a target tree, T (y), 4and r is a gram mar rule.
			The ? function scores the derivation and 4 Equation 1 optimises over derivations rather than target trees to allow tractable inference.
			139 is defined in (2) as a linear function over the rules used.
			Each rule?s score is an inner product between its feature vector, ?(r,y S), and the model parame ters, ?.
			The feature functions are set by hand, while the model parameters are learned in training.
			The maximisation problem in (1) can be solved efficiently using a dynamic program.
			Derivations will have common sub-structures whenever they transduce the same source sub-tree into a target sub-tree.
			This is captured in a chart, leading to an efficient bottom-up algorithm.
			The asymptotic time complexity of this search is O(SR) where S is the number of source nodes andR is the number of rules matching a given node.
			Training The model is trained using SVM struct , a large margin method for structured output problems (Joachims
