    The problem of segmenting Chinese text has been studied by researchers for many years; see Wu and Tseng (1993) for a detailed survey.
    Several different algorithms have been proposed, which, generally speaking, can be classified into dictionary-based and statistical-based methods, although other techniques that involve more linguistic information, such as syntactic and semantic knowledge, have been reported in the natural language processing literature.
    Cheng, Young, and Wong (1999) describe a dictionary-based method.
    Given a dictionary of frequently used Chinese words, an input string is compared with words in the dictionary to find the one that matches the greatest number of characters of the input.
    This is called the maximum forward match heuristic.
    An alternative is to work backwards through the text, resulting in the maximum backward match heuristic.
    It is easy to find situations where these fail.
    To use an English example, forward matching fail
