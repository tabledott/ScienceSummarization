    This example not only illustrates anaphora resolution using the basic algorithm from Table 3 but also incorporates the application of Rule 1 of the centering model.
    (2d) contains the pronoun him, which is the Cb of this utterance.
    In (2e), the Cb is also realized as a pronoun while SENTRY is realized by the definite noun phrase the man, which is allowed by Rule 1.
    The centering algorithm described by Brennan, Friedman, and Pollard (1987, henceforth BFP algorithm) interprets the centering model in a certain way and applies it to the resolution of pronouns.
    The most obvious difference between Grosz, Joshi, and Transition types according to BFP.
    Weinstein (1983, 1995) and Brennan, Friedman, and Pollard (1987) is that the latter use two SHIFT transitions instead of only one: SMOOTH-SHIFT8 requires the Cb(U) to equal Cp(U,), while ROUGH-SHIFT requires inequality (Table 5).
    Brennan, Friedman, and Pollard (1987) also allow the Cb(Liz_i) to remain undefined.
