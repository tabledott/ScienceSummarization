nings of words are amorphous objects of the domain: no distinction is made between words that have the same type.
    Such models consist of a pairing of syntactic interpretation rules (in the form of a grammar) with semantic interpretation rules, as exemplified by the simple model presented in Figure 1.
    The parse of a sentence such as &#8220;cats like milk&#8221; typically produces its semantic interpretation by substituting semantic representation for their grammatical constituents and applying &#946;-reduction where needed.
    Such a derivation is shown in Figure 2.
    This methodology is used to translate sentences of natural language into logical formulae, then use computer-aided automation tools to reason about them (Alshawi, 1992).
    One major drawback is that the result of such analysis can only deal with truth or falsity as the meaning of a sentence, and says nothing about the closeness in meaning or topic of expressions beyond their truth-conditions and what models satisfy them, hence do not
