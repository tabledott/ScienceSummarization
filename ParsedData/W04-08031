erably to making the complex FrameNet dataset more accessible.
    They have amply demonstrated that FrameNet is a substantial lexical resource that will permit extensive further research and exploitation in NLP applications in the future.
  
  
    Word-sense disambiguation has frequently been criticized as a task in search of a reason.
    Since a considerable portion of a sense inventory has only a single sense, the question has been raised whether the amount of effort required by disambiguation is worthwhile.
    Heretofore, the focus of disambiguation has been on the sense inventory and has not examined the major reason why we would have lexical knowledge bases: how the meanings would be represented and thus, available for use in natural language processing applications.
    At the present time, a major paradigm for representing meaning has emerged in frame semantics, specifically in the FrameNet project.
    A worthy objective for the Senseval community is the development of a wide range of methods for
