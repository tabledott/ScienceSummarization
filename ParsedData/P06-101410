exical chains (Morris and Hirst, 1991).
    SSI performs disambiguation in an iterative fashion, by maintaining a set C of senses as a semantic context.
    Initially, C = V (the entire set of senses of words in C).
    At each step, for each sense S in C, the algorithm calculates a score of the degree of connectivity between S and the other senses in C: where IC(S, S') is the set of interconnections between senses S and S'.
    The contribution of a single interconnection is given by the reciprocal of its length, calculated as the number of edges connecting its ends.
    The overall degree of connectivity is then normalized by the number of contributing interconnections.
    The highest ranking sense S of word w is chosen and the senses of w are removed from the semantic context C. The algorithm terminates when either C = &#8709; or there is no sense such that its score exceeds a fixed threshold.
    Given a word w, semantic matching is performed in two steps.
