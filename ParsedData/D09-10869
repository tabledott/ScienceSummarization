 across languages.
    As a result, we might learn that parses are &#8220;mostly synchronous,&#8221; but that there are some systematic cross-linguistic 1Non-projective parsing would also be possible. divergences and some instances of sloppy (nonparallel or inexact) translation.
    Our model is thus a form of quasi-synchronous grammar (QG) (Smith and Eisner, 2006a).
    In that paper, QG was applied to word alignment and has since found applications in question answering (Wang et al., 2007), paraphrase detection (Das and Smith, 2009), and machine translation (Gimpel and Smith, 2009).
    All the models in this paper are conditioned on the source tree t0.
    Conditionally-trained models of adaptation and projection also condition on the target string w and its alignment a to w0 and thus have the form p(t  |w, w0, t0, a); the unsupervised, generative projection models in &#167;5 have the form p(w, t, a  |w0, t0).
    The score s of a given tuple of trees, words, and alignment can thus be written as a dot prod
