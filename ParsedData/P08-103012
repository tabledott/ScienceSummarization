from English TDT5 corpus which in total consists of 278,108 texts (from April to September of 2003).
    We select the thresholds (Sk with k=1~13) for various confidence metrics by optimizing the Fmeasure score of each rule on the development set, as shown in Figure 2 and 3 as follows.
    Each curve in Figure 2 and 3 shows the effect on precision and recall of varying the threshold for an individual rule.
    The labeled point on each curve shows the best F-measure that can be obtained on the development set by adjusting the threshold for that rule.
    The gain obtained by applying successive rules can be seen in the progression of successive points towards higher recall and, for argument labeling, precision4.
    Table 5 shows the overall Precision (P), Recall (R) and F-Measure (F) scores for the blind test set.
    In addition, we also measured the performance of two human annotators who prepared the ACE 2005 training data on 28 newswire texts (a subset of the blind test set).
    The final key was produc
