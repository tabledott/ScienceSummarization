atic features include the information on existence of brackets, question marks and punctuation marks etc.
    Besides, there are features that show the relative relation of two chunks, such as distance, and existence of brackets, quotation marks and punctuation marks between them.
    For dynamic features, we selected functional words or inflection forms of the rightmost predicates in the chunks that appear between two chunks and depend on the modifiee.
    Considering data sparseness problem, we apply a simple filtering based on the part-ofspeech of functional words: We use the lexical form if the word's POS is particle, adverb, adnominal or conjunction.
    We use the inflection form if the word has inflection.
    We use the POS tags for others.
    Table 2 shows the result of passing accuracy under the condition k = 5 (beam width), and d = 3 (dimension of the polynomial functions used for the kernel function).
    This table shows two types of dependency accuracy, A and B.
