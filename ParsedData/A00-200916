sian classifier achieved 71% accuracy, the content vector 72%, and the neural network 76%.
    The line data was studied again by (Mooney, 1996), where seven different machine learning methodologies are compared.
    All learning algorithms represent the context of an ambiguous word using the bag-of-words with a two sentence window of context.
    In these experiments words from a stoplist are removed, capitalization is ignored, and words are stemmed.
    The two most accurate methods in this study proved to be a Naive Bayesian classifier (72%) and a perceptron (71%).
    The line data was recently revisited by both (Towell and Voorhees, 1998) and (Leacock et al., 1998).
    The former take an ensemble approach where the output from two neural networks is combined; one network is based on a representation of local context while the other represents topical context.
    The latter utilize a Naive Bayesian classifier.
    In both cases context is represented by a set of topical and local features.
