ble of capturing phrasal units of translational equivalence.
    Our novel Gibbs sampler over synchronous derivation trees can efficiently draw samples from the posterior, overcoming the limitations of previous models when dealing with long sentences.
    This avoids explicitly representing the full derivation forest required by dynamic programming approaches, and thus we are able to perform inference without resorting to heuristic restrictions on the model.
    Initial experiments suggest that this model performs well on languages for which the monotone bias of existing alignment and heuristic phrase extraction approaches fail.
    These results open the way for the development of more sophisticated models employing grammars capable of capturing a wide range of translation phenomena.
    In future we envision it will be possible to use the techniques developed here to directly induce grammars which match state-of-the-art decoders, such as Hiero grammars or tree substitution grammars of the form used by Galle
