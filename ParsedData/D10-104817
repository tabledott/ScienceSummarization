 mentions in the text below belong to different clusters: The pilot had confirmed ... he had turned onto [the correct runway] but pilots behind him say he turned onto [the wrong runway].
    Compatible modifiers only &#8211; the mention&#8217;s modifiers are all included in the modifiers of the antecedent candidate.
    This feature models the same discourse property as the previous feature, but it focuses on the two individual mentions to be linked, rather than their entire clusters.
    For this feature we only use modifiers that are nouns or adjectives.
    Not i-within-i &#8211; the two mentions are not in an iwithin-i construct, i.e., one cannot be a child NP in the other&#8217;s NP constituent (Haghighi and Klein, 2009).
    This pass continues to maintain high precision (91% pairwise) while improving recall significantly (over 6 points pairwise and almost 8 points MUC).
    Passes 4 and 5 are different relaxations of the feature conjunction introduced in Pass 3, i.e., Pass 4 removes the compatible modi
