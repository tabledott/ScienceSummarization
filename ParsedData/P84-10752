    It has been the goal of the PATR group at SRI2 to utilize a relevant portion of this knowledge in implementing tools to facilitate communication of linguistic information to computers.
    The PATR-II formalism is our current computer language for encoding linguistic information.
    This paper, a brief overview of that formalism, attempts to explicate our design decisions in terms of a set of properties that effective computer languages should incorporate, namely: simplicity, power, mathematical well-foundedness, implementability, modularity, and declarativeness.
    More extensive discussions of various aspects of the PATR-II formalism and systems can be found in papers by Shieber tt. al., [831, Pereira and Shieber [841 and Karttunen [841.
    The notion of designing specialized computer languages and systems to encode linguistic information is not new; P
