orollary 2 There exists an algorithm to determine if two subsequential transducers are equivalent.
    The algorithm of theorem 15 associates a unique minimal transducer to each subsequential transducer T. More precisely, this minimal transducer is unique up to a renumbering of the states.
    The identity of two subsequential transducers with different numbering of states can be tested in the same way as that of two deterministic automata; for instance, by testing the equivalence of the automata and the equality of their number of states.
    An efficient algorithm for testing the equivalence of two deterministic automata is given in Aho, Hoperoft, and Ullman (1974).14 Since the minimization of subsequential transducers was also shown to be efficient, this proves the corollary and also the efficiency of the test of equivalence.
    0 Schiitzenberger (1961) gave an algorithm for minimizing the representation of power series, but this algorithm can only be used when the semiring considered is a field.
