omain entirely.
    When evaluating her algorithm with only domain-independent semantics, Byron achieved 51% success rate.
    What is problematic with her approach is that she assumes the input to her algorithm to be only referential pronouns.
    This simplifies the task considerably.
  
  
    We presented a machine learning approach to pronoun resolution in spoken dialogue.
    We built upon a system we used for anaphora resolution in written text and extended it with a set of features designed for spoken dialogue.
    We refined distance features and used metrics from information retrieval for determining non-NP-antecedents.
    Inspired by the more linguistically oriented work by Eckert &amp; Strube (2000) and Byron (2002) we also evaluated the contribution of features which used the predicative context of the pronoun to be resolved.
    However, these features did not show up in the final models since they did not lead to an improvement.
    Instead, rather simple distance metrics were preferred.
