 space.
    This effectively removes the (sub)rules that they mark from the grammar.
    So, for example, in the Core grammar there is no topicalization rule, and sentences with topics will receive a FRAGMENT parse.
    This single-pass Core grammar is smaller than the Complete grammar and hence is faster.
    The XLE parser also allows the user to adjust performance parameters bounding the amount of work that is done in parsing for efficient but accurate operation.
    XLE&#8217;s ambiguity management technology takes advantage of the fact that relatively few f-structure constraints apply to constituents that are far apart in the c-structure, so that sentences are typically parsed in polynomial time even though LFG parsing is known to be an NP-complete problem.
    But the worst-case exponential behavior does begin to appear for some constructions in some sentences, and the computational effort is limited by a SKIMMING mode whose onset is controlled by a user-specified parameter.
    When skimming, XLE will
