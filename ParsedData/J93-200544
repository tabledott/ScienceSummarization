o conventional lexical semantic relations, it is also possible to acquire information concerning lexical presuppositions and preferences from corpora, when analyzed with the appropriate semantic tools.
    In particular, we will discuss a phenomenon we call discourse polarity, and how corpus-based experiments provide clues toward the representation of this phenomenon, as well as information on preference relations.
    As we have seen, providing a representational system for lexical semantic relations is a nontrivial task.
    Representing presuppositional information, however, is even more daunting.
    Nevertheless, there are some systematic semantic generalizations associated with such subtle lexical inferences.
