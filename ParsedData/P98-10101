, subject-verb and verb-object patterns in English.
    Since the learning approach enables easy porting to new domains, we plan to apply it to syntactic patterns in other languages and to sub-language patterns for information extraction.
  
  
    Identifying local patterns of syntactic sequences and relationships is a fundamental task in natural language processing (NLP).
    Such patterns may correspond to syntactic phrases, like noun phrases, or to pairs of words that participate in a syntactic relationship, like the heads of a verb-object relation.
    Such patterns have been found useful in various application areas, including information extraction, text summarization, and bilingual alignment.
    Syntactic patterns are useful also for many basic computational linguistic tasks, such as statistical word similarity and various disambiguation problems.
    One approach for detecting syntactic patterns is to obtain a full parse of a sentence and then extract the required patterns.
    However, obtaining a
