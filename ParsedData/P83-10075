n 5.)
    The subject NP is the center in one context, the object NP in the other. when the NP used to realize Cb(S) syntactically determined, the Cb(S) itself is not yet fully determined, for Cb(S) is typically not a linguistic entity (i.e., it is not a particular linguistic expression).
    Rosa, not 'Rosa' is the Cb(2b).
    Consider. the discourse: (3a) How is Rosa?
    (3b) Did anyone see her yesterday? saw her.
    Here, Cb(3c) is Rosa, but clearly would not be in other contexts where the expression 'her' still realized the backward-looking center of 'Max saw her.'
    This is seen most simply by considering the discourse that would result if &amp;quot;How is Joan?' replaced (3a).

    Centering and Realization The interactions of semantic and pragmatic factors with centering and their effects on referring expressions are more complex than the preceding discussion suggests.
    In the examples given above, the NPs tha
