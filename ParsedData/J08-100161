listic discourse factors.
    The results presented so far suggest that adapting the proposed model to a new domain would involve some effort in collecting representative texts with associated coherence ratings.
    Thankfully, the entity grids are constructed in a fully automatic fashion, without requiring manual annotation.
    This contrasts with traditional implementations of Centering Theory that operate over linguistically richer representations that are typically hand-coded.
  
  
    We further test the ability of our method to assess coherence by comparing model induced rankings against rankings elicited by human judges.
    Admittedly, the synthetic data used in the ordering task only partially approximates coherence violations that human readers encounter in machine generated texts.
    A representative example of such texts are automatically generated summaries which often contain sentences taken out of context and thus display problems with respect to local coherence (e.g., dangling anaphors, the
