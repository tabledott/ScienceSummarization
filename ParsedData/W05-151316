-21 were used for training, section 22 was used for development and tuning of parameters and features, and section 23 was used for testing.
    Every experiment reported here was performed on a Pentium IV 1.8GHz with 1GB of RAM.
    Each tree in the training set had empty-node and function tag information removed, and the trees were lexicalized using similar head-table rules as those mentioned in (Collins, 1996).
    The trees were then converted into trees containing only unary and binary branching, using the binarization transform described in section 2.
    Classifier training instances of features paired with classes (parser actions) were extracted from the trees in the training set, as described in section 2.3.
    The total number of training instances was about 1.5 million.
    The classifier in the SVM-based parser (denoted by SVMpar) uses the polynomial kernel with degree 2, following the work of Yamada and Matsumoto (2003) on SVM-based deterministic dependency parsing, and a one-against-all scheme f
