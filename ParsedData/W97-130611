omen The algorithm would resolve they to The city council.
    This is incorrect on one choice of verb, but the algorithm does not integrate the verb information into the salience ranking.
    In comparison, none of the six rules of CogNIAC would resolve the pronoun.
    Rules have been tried that resolved a subject pronoun of a nested clause with the subject of the dominating clause, but no configuration has been found that yielded sufficient precision2.
    Consequently, they is not resolved'.
    The naive algorithm has some interesting properties.
    First it models relative salience as relative depth in a search space.
    For two candidate antecedents a and b, if a is encountered before b in the search space, then a is more salient than b.
    Second, the relative saliency of all candidate antecedents is totally ordered, that is, for any two candidate antecedents a and b , a is more salient than b xor b is more salient than a.
    2 In experiment 2, discussed below, the rule 'subject same clause' would
