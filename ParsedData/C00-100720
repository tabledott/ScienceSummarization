  As 47 such, we can use it to handle morphological ef- fects such as agreement, which cannot in gen- eral be clone by an n-gram model and which are, at; the same time, descriptively straightforward and which are handled by all non-stochastic generation modules.
  6 Conclus ion and Out look We have presented empirical evidence that us- ing a tree model in addition to a language model can improve stochastic NLG.
  FERGUS aS presented in this paper is not ready to be used as a module in applications.
  Specifically, we will add a morphological compo- nent, a component that handles flmction words (auxiliaries, determiners), and a component that handles imnctuation.
  In all three cases, we will provid
