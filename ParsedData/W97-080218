iguation of the CELEX complementation codes for GermaNet.
    Syntactic information in GerrnaNet differs from that given in WordNet in several ways.
    It marks expletive subjects and reflexives explicitly, encodes case information, which is especially important in German, distinguishes between different realizations of prepositional and adverbial phrases and marks to-infinitival as well as pure infinitival complements explicitly.
    Particles pose a particular problem in German.
    They are very productive, which would lead to an explosion of entries if each particle verb was explicitly encoded.
    Some particles establish a regular semantic pattern which can not be accounted for by a simple enumeration approach, whereas others are very irregular and ambiguous.
    We therefore propose a mixed approach, treating irregular particle verbs by enumeration and regular particle verbs in a compositional manner.
    Composition can be thought of as a default which can be overwritten by explicit entries in the da
