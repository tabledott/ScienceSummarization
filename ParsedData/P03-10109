icles to be searched. n is the number of articles containing T. Kis k1((1 &#8722; b) + b dl avdl ). k1, b and k3 are parameters set to 1, 1, and 1000, respectively. dl is the document length of J and avdl is the average document length in words. tf is the frequency of occurrence of T in J. qtf is the frequency of T in E. To summarize, we first translate each of the Japanese articles into a set of English words.
    We then use each of the English articles as a query and search for the most similar Japanese article in terms of BM25 and assume that it corresponds to the English article.
    The sentences5 in the aligned Japanese and English articles are aligned by a method based on DP matching (Gale and Church, 1993; Utsuro et al., 1994).
    We allow 1-to-n or n-to-1 (1 &lt; n &lt; 6) alignments when aligning the sentences.
    Readers are referred to Utsuro et al. (1994) for a concise description of the algorithm.
    Here, we only discuss the similarities between Japanese and English sentences for alignment.
