t of centering that this paper aims to explain.
    Section 3 provides the basic definitions of centers and related definitions needed to present the theoretical claims of the paper.
    In Section 4, we state the main properties of the centering framework and the major claims of centering theory.
    In Section 5, we discuss several factors that affect centering constraints and govern the centering rules given in Section 6.
    In Section 7, we discuss applications of the rules and their ability to explain several discourse coherence phenomena.
    In Section 8, we briefly outline the properties of an underlying semantic framework that are required by centering.
    Finally, in Section 9 we conclude with a brief comparison of centering with the research that preceded it and a summary of research that expands on Grosz, Joshi, and Weinstein (1986).
    In particular, Section 9 provides references to subsequent investigations of additional factors that control centering and examinations of its cross-linguistic
