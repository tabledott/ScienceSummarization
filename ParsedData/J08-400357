otation G[i], for arbitrary lists or stacks, to denote the ith element of G, with G[0] for the first element (top element of a stack) and G[n] for the last element.
    Nodes defined relative to the partially-built dependency graph make use of the operators hd, ld, and rd, which return, respectively, the head, the leftmost dependent, and the rightmost dependent of a node in the dependency graph Gc defined by the current configuration c, if such a node exists, and a null value otherwise.
    The columns in Table 2 represent attributes of nodes (tokens) in the input (word form, lemma, coarse part-of-speech, fine part-of-speech, morphosyntactic features) or in the partially-built dependency graph (dependency label), which can be used to define features.
    Each cell in the table thus represents a feature fij = aj(ni), defined by selecting the attribute aj in the jth column from the node ni characterized in the ith row.
    For example, the feature f11 is the word form of the first input node (token) in the buff
