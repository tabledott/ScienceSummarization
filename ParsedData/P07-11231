available for English, which in many cases took years of work to complete.
    Specifically, through experiments with cross-lingual projection of subjectivity, we seek answers to the following questions.
    First, can we derive a subjectivity lexicon for a new language using an existing English subjectivity lexicon and a bilingual dictionary?
    Second, can we derive subjectivity-annotated corpora in a new language using existing subjectivity analysis tools for English and a parallel corpus?
    Finally, third, can we build tools for subjectivity analysis for a new target language by relying on these automatically generated resources?
    We focus our experiments on Romanian, selected as a representative of the large number of languages that have only limited text processing resources developed to date.
    Note that, although we work with Romanian, the methods described are applicable to any other language, as in these experiments we (purposely) do not use any language-specific knowledge of the target lang
