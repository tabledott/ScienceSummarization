is 20 tokens/sec on an Alpha 21164A 500 MHz processor.
			It is difficult to use such slow systems in practical applications.
			In this paper, we present a method that makes the NE system substantially faster.
			This method can also be applied to other tasks in natural languageprocessing such as chunking and POS tagging.
			Another problem with SVMs is its incomprehensibil ity.
			It is not clear which features are important or how they work.
			The above method is also useful for finding useless features.
			We also mention a method to reduce training time.
			1.1 Support Vector Machines.
			Suppose we have a set of training data for a two class problem:     , where   ffflfi is a feature vector of the ffi -th sample in the training data and   !$#%# is the label forthe sample.
			The goal is to find a decision func tion that accurately predicts for unseen  . A non-linear SVM classifier gives a decision function ( ) * sign ,+-) for an input vector  where +-) .* / 0 21)3 546879: !6; Here, () *=!$# means  is a
