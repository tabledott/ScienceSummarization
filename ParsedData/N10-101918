ecause they do not match an annotated error, some may in fact be innocuous or even helpful for a real user.
    Such a situation can arise for a variety of reasons: In some cases, there are legitimate alternative ways to correct an error.
    In other cases, the classifier has identified the location of an error although that error is of a different kind (which can be beneficial because it causes the user to make a correction - see Leacock et al., 2009).
    Gamon et al. (2009), for example manually evaluate preposition suggestions as belonging to one of three categories: (a) properly correcting an existing error, (b) offering a suggestion that neither improves nor degrades the user sentence, (c) offering a suggestion that would degrade the user input.
    Obviously, (c) is a more serious error than (b).
    Similarly, Tetrault and Chodorow (2008) annotate their test set with preposition choices that are valid alternatives.
    We do not have similar information in the CLC data, but we can perform a manual an
