oehn et al, 2003).
			The non-terminal em bedded phrases are learned from a bilingual corpuswithout a linguistically motivated syntactic struc ture.
			Based on hierarchical phrase-based modeling, we adopted the left-to-right target generation method (Watanabe et al, 2006b).
			This method is able to generate translations efficiently, first, by simplifyingthe grammar so that the target side takes a phrase prefixed form, namely a target normalized form.
			Second, a translation is generated in a left-to-right manner, similar to the phrase-based approach using Earley-style top-down parsing on the source side.
			Coupled with the target normalized form, n-gram language models are efficiently integrated during the search even with a higher order of n. 2.2 Target Normalized Form.
			In Chiang (2005), each production rule is restrictedto a rank-2 or binarized form in which each rule contains at most two non-terminals.
			The target normal ized form (Watanabe et al, 2006b) further imposes a constraint whereby the ta
