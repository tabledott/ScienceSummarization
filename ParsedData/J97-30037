it a particular Pos-tag.
    Although the learning process in these systems is fully automated and the accuracy of obtained guessing rules reaches current state-of-the-art levels, for estimation of their parameters they require significant amounts of specially prepared training data&#8212;a large training corpus (usually pretagged), training examples, and so on.
    In this paper, we describe a novel, fully automatic technique for the induction of POS-class-guessing rules for unknown words.
    This technique has been partially outlined in (Mikheev 1996a, 1996b) and, along with a level of accuracy for the induced rules that is higher than any previously quoted, it has an advantage in terms of quantity and simplicity of annotation of data for training.
    Unlike many other approaches, which implicitly or explicitly assume that the surface manifestations of morpho-syntactic features of unknown words are different from those of general language, we argue that within the same language unknown words obey general
