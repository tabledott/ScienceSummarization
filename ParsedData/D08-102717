    The results of this task are presented in Figure 4.
    We achieve high agreement for this task, at a rate of 0.94 with simple voting over 10 annotators (4620 total annotations).
    While an expert ITA of 0.77 was reported for the more general task involving all fourteen labels on both noun and verb events, no expert ITA numbers have been reported for this simplified temporal ordering task.
    In this task we consider a simple problem on which machine learning algorithms have been shown to produce extremely good results; here we annotate part of the SemEval Word Sense Disambiguation Lexical Sample task (Pradhan et al., 2007); specifically, we present the labeler with a paragraph of text containing the word &#8220;president&#8221; (e.g., a paragraph containing &#8220;Robert E.
