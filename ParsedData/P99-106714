tly better results than the conditional probability measure.
    Results based on mutual information or co-occurrence counts were significantly worse.
    For efficient computation of the log-likelihood ratio we used the following formula:2 where with parameters kJ expressed in terms of corpus frequencies: kli = frequency of common occurrence of word A and word B k22 = size of corpus (no. of tokens) &#8212; corpus frequency of A &#8212; corpus frequency of B All co-occurrence vectors were transformed using this formula.
    Thereafter, they were normalized in such a way that for each vector the sum of its entries adds up to one.
    In the rest of the paper, we refer to the transformed and normalized vectors as association vectors.
    To determine the English translation of an unknown German word, the association vector of the German word is computed and compared to all association vectors in the English association matrix.
    For comparison, the correspondences between the vector positions and the columns
