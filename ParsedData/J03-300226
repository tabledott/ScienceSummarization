vely low (but perhaps unreliable) difference percentage (dp).
    That branch handled around 10% of the document set and was prone to overtraining.
    (The documents handled by this branch were mostly marked &#8220;bad&#8221; by the judges but appear to have been difficult to classify based on the structural features.)
    Note that the learned classifiers were substantially different from the heuristic threshold used earlier.
    Without tuning, the manually set parameters result in good document pairs&#8217; being discarded 31% of the time.
    Our cross-validation results indicate that tuning the parameters cuts that figure in half: Only 16% of the good pairs will be discarded, at a cost of admitting 4 false positives from every 100 candidate pairs.
    This approach is quite general and uses only a minimum of language-dependent knowledge.
    The features we are using are the same for any language pair.
    The tuning process needs to be done only once per language pair and requires only a few hours of a
