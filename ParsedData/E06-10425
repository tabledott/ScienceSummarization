220;which [exploit] the similarity between examples of conventional metonymy&#8221; ((Nissim &amp; Markert, 2003), p. 56).
    They see metonymy resolution as a classification problem between the literal use of a word and a number of pre-defined metonymy types.
    They use similarities between possibly metonymic words (PMWs) and known metonymies as well as context similarities to classify the PMWs.
    The main difference between the Nissim &amp; Markert algorithm and the TroFi algorithm &#8211; besides the fact that Nissim &amp; Markert deal with specific types of metonymy and not a generalized category of nonliteral language &#8211; is that Nissim &amp; Markert use a supervised machine learning algorithm, as opposed to the primarily unsupervised algorithm used by TroFi.
