he problem of how to assign such roles has been attacked by many computational systems.
    Traditional parsing and understanding systems, including implementations of unification-based grammars such as Head-Driven Phrase Structure Grammar (HPSG) (Pollard and Sag 1994), rely on hand-developed grammars that must anticipate each way in which semantic roles may be realized syntactically.
    Writing such grammars is time consuming, and typically such systems have limited coverage.
    Data-driven techniques have recently been applied to template-based semantic interpretation in limited domains by &#8220;shallow&#8221; systems that avoid complex feature structures and often perform only shallow syntactic analysis.
    For example, in the context of the Air Traveler Information System (ATIS) for spoken dialogue, Miller et al. (1996) computed the probability that a constituent such as Atlanta filled a semantic slot such as DESTINATION in a semantic frame for air travel.
