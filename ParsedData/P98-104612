s that are triple-listed in the split/push/carry intersective class (which have force exertion as a semantic component) that can take the conative.
    The carry verbs that are not in the intersective class (carry, drag, haul, heft, hoist, lug, tote, tow) are more &amp;quot;pure&amp;quot; examples of the carry class and always imply the achievement of causation of motion.
    Thus they cannot take the conative alternation.
    Even though the Levin verb classes are defined by their syntactic behavior, many reflect semantic distinctions made by WordNet, a classification hierarchy defined in terms of purely semantic word relations (synonyms, hypernyms, etc.).
    When examining in detail the intersective classes just described, which emphasize not only the individual classes, but also their relation to other classes, we see a rich semantic lattice much like WordNet.
    This is exemplified by the Levin cut verbs and the intersective class formed by the cut verbs and split verbs.
    The original intersective cl
