    Furthermore, by using an entropy-based method we determine the best partition of corefering expressions chains. rules are learned by applying a bootstrapping methodology that uncovers additional semantic consistency data.

    CogNIAC: high precision coreference with limited knowledge and linguistic resources.
  
  
    Reference resolution is an important task for discourse or dialogue processing systems since identity relations between anaphoric textual entities and their antecedents is a prerequisite to the understanding of text or conversation.
    Traditionally, coreference resolution has been performed by combining linguistic and cognitive knowledge of language.
    Linguistic information is provided mostly by syntactic and semantic modeling of language whereas cognitive information is incorporated in computational models of discourse.
    Computational methods based on linguistic and congitive information were presented in (H
