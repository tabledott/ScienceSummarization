r of matches, out of all items in the gold standard&#8217;s parse.
    F-score balances precision and recall as (2 &#215; precision &#215; recall)/(precision + recall).
    For the sentence condensation system presented above, the structural items to be matched consist of relation(predicate, argument) triples.
    For example, the goldstandard f-structure of Fig.
    2 corresponds to 23 dependency relations, the first 14 of which are shared with the reduced f-structure chosen by the stochastic disambiguation system: Matching these f-structures against each other corresponds to a precision of 1, recall of .61, and F-score of .76.
    The fact that our method does not rely on a comparison of the characteristics of surface strings is a clear advantage.
    Such comparisons are bad at handling examples which are similar in meaning but differ in word order or vary structurally, such as in passivization or nominalization.
    Our method handles such examples straightforwardly.
