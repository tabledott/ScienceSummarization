F0=1 rates of 90.30 for English (14% error reduction compared with the best system) and 74.17 for German (6% error reduction).
  
  
    We have described the CoNLL-2003 shared task: language-independent named entity recognition.
    Sixteen systems have processed English and German named entity data.
    The best performance for both languages has been obtained by a combined learning system that used Maximum Entropy Models, transformation-based learning, Hidden Markov Models as well as robust risk minimization (Florian et al., 2003).
    Apart from the training data, this system also employed gazetteers and the output of two externally trained named entity recognizers.
    The performance of the system of Chieu et al. (2003) was not significantly different from the best performance for English and the method of Klein et al.
    (2003) and the approach of Zhang and Johnson (2003) were not significantly worse than the best result for German.
    Eleven teams have incorporated information other than the trainin
