bject (S), object (O), other (X) (for example, part of a prepositional phrase), or not present (N).
    The probability of each transition type is computed.
    For example, an S-O transition occurs when an entity is the subject in one sentence then an object in the next; X-N transition occurs when an entity appears in non-subject or object position in one sentence and not present in the next, etc.7 The entity coherence features are the probability of each of these pairs of transitions, for a total of 16 features (F17_32; see complete results in Table 5).
    None of the entity grid features are significantly correlated with the readability ratings.
    One very interesting result is that the proportion of S-S transitions in which the same entity was mentioned in subject position in two adjacent sentences, is negatively correlated with readability.
    In centering theory, this is considered the most coherent type of transition, keeping the same center of attention.
    Moreover, the feature most strongly cor
