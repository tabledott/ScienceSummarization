mp;quot; the most likely sense for each word as the more frequent sense in the test set.
    Consequently, the performance of the baseline cannot fall below chance (100/k% for a particular word with k senses).9 In addition, the baseline system assumes that Type I (false rejection) errors are just as bad as Type II (false acceptance) errors.
    If one desires extremely high recall and is willing to sacrifice precision in order to obtain this level of recall, then it might be sensible to tune a system to produce behavior which might appear to fall below the baseline.
    We have run into such situations when we have attempted to help lexicographers find extremely unusual events.
    In such a case, a lexicographer might be quite happy receiving a long list of potential candidates, only a small fraction of which are actually the case of interest.
    One can come up with quite a number of other scenarios where the baseline performance could be somewhat misleading, especially when there is an unusual trade-off b
