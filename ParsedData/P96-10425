  The class c, to which a sentence is assigned is a sequence of the parts of speech (tags) for the words in the sentence.
    The score function is typically the joint (or conditional) probability of the sentence and the tag sequence'.
    The tagger then assigns the sentence to the tag sequence which is most probable according to the HMM.
    The probabilistic model M, and thus the score function Fm, are defined by a set of parameters, {a}.
    During training, the values of the parameters are estimated from a set of statistics, S, extracted from a training set of annotated examples.
    We denote a particular model by M = {ai}, where each ai is a specific value for the corresponding ai.
    In bigram part-of-speech tagging the HMM model M contains three types of parameters: transition probabilities P(ti&#8212;t) giving the probability of tag tj occuring after tag ti, lexical probabilities P(t1w) giving the probability of tag t labeling word w, and tag probabilities P(t) giving the marginal probability of a
