5) considers stochastic lexicalized PCFGs, with specific reference to EM methods for unsupervised training.
    Seneff (1992) describes the use of Markov models for rule generation, which is closely related to the Markov-style rules in the models in the current article.
    Finally, note that not all machine-learning methods for parsing are probabilistic.
    See Brill (1993) and Hermjakob and Mooney (1997) for rule-based learning systems.
    In recent work, Chiang (2000) has shown that the models in the current article can be implemented almost unchanged in a stochastic tree-adjoining grammar.
    Bikel (2000) has developed generative statistical models that integrate word sense information into the parsing process.
    Eisner (2002) develops a sophisticated generative model for lexicalized context-free rules, making use of a probabilistic model of lexicalized transformations between rules.
    Blaheta and Charniak (2000) describe methods for the recovery of the semantic tags in the Penn Treebank annotation
