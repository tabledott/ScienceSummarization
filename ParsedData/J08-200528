  In addition, as defined in the CoNLL-2004 and 2005 shared tasks, the legitimate output of an SRL system must satisfy this constraint.
  No duplicate argument classes for core arguments, such as A0?A5 and AA.
  The only exception is when there is a conjunction in the sentence.
  For example, [A0 I] [V left ] [A1 my pearls] [A2 to my daughter] and [A1 my gold] [A2 to my son].
  Despite this exception, we treat it as a hard constraint because it almost always holds.
  If there is an R-arg argument, then there has to be an arg argument.
  That is, if an argument is a reference to some other argument arg, then this referenced argument must exist in the sentence.
  This constraint is directly derived from the definition of R-arg arguments.
  If there is a C-arg argument, then there has to be an arg argument; in addition, the C-arg argument must occur after arg.
  This is stricter than the previous rule because the order of appearance also needs to be considered.
  Similarly, this constraint is directly deriv
