ges E. Define (Laplacian) matrix Q as a (n + 1)x(n + 1) matrix indexed from 0 to n. For all i and j, define: If the ith row and column are removed from Q to produce the matrix Qi, then the sum of the weights of all directed spanning trees rooted at node i is equal to |Qi |(the determinant of Qi).
    Thus, if we construct Q for a graph Gx, then the determinant of the matrix Qc is equivalent to Zx.
    The determinant of an nxn matrix can be calculated in numerous ways, most of which take O(n3) (Cormen et al., 1990).
    The most efficient algorithms for calculating the determinant of a matrix use the fact that the problem is no harder than matrix multiplication (Cormen et al., 1990).
    Matrix multiplication currently has known O(n2.38) implementations and it has been widely conjectured that it can be solved in O(n2) (Robinson, 2005).
    However, most algorithms with sub-O(n3) running times require constants that are large enough to negate any asymptotic advantage for the case of dependency parsing.
