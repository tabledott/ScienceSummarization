regate probability is substantial.
    As n increases, the accuracy of an n-gram model increases, but the reliability of our parameter estimates, drawn as they must be from a limited training text, decreases.
    Jelinek and Mercer (1980) describe a technique called interpolated estimation that combines the estimates of several language models so as to use the estimates of the more accurate models where they are reliable and, where they are unreliable, to fall back on the more reliable estimates of less accurate models.
    If Pri (w I &amp;I.-1) is the conditional probability as determined by the jth language model, then the interpolated estimate, Pr(wi I w'i-1), is given by Given values for Pr(i) 0, the A1(w) are chosen, with the help of the EM algorithm, so as to maximize the probability of some additional sample of text called the held-out data (Baum 1972; Dempster, Laird, and Rubin 1977; Jelinek and Mercer 1980).
    When we use interpolated estimation to combine the estimates from 1-, 2-, and 3-gram mod
