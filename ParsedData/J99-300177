alker and Prince (1996) propose a &amp;quot;working hypothesis&amp;quot; based on the surface order.
    Strube (1998) provides a complete specification for dealing with complex sentences, but this approach departs significantly from the centering model.

    It seems that there exist only a few fully operational implementations of centering-based algorithms, since the interaction of the algorithm with global and local ambiguities generated by a sentence parser has not received much attention until now.
    A first proposal for how to deal with center ambiguity in an incremental text parser has been made by Hahn and Strube (1996).
    3.
    The centering model covers the standard cases of anaphora, i.e., pronominal and nominal anaphora and even functional anaphora based on the proposal we have developed in this article.
    It does not, however, take into account several &amp;quot;hard&amp;quot; issues such as plural anaphora, generic definite noun phrases, propositional anaphora, and deictic forms (bu
