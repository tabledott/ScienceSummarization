ad information from ccommanding constituents.
    The exception is the function at level 5 along the left branch of the tree in Figure 4.
    Suppose that the node being expanded is being conjoined with another node, which we can tell by the presence or absence of a CC node.
    In that case, we want to condition the expansion on how the conjoining constituent expanded.
    In other words, this attempts to capture a certain amount of parallelism between the expansions of conjoined categories.
    In presenting the parsing results, we will systematically vary the amount of conditioning information, so as to get an idea of the behavior of the parser.
    We will refer to the amount of conditioning by specifying the deepest level from which a value is returned for each branching path in the decision tree, from left to right in Figure 4: the first number is for left contexts where the left branch of the decision tree is always followed (non-POS nonterminals on the left-hand side); the second number is for a left
