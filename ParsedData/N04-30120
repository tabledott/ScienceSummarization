  WordNet::Similarity - Measuring The Relatedness Of Concepts
  
    WordNet::Similarity is a freely available software package that makes it possible to measure the semantic similarity and relatedness between a pair of concepts (or synsets).
    It provides six measures of similarity, and three measures of relatedness, all of which are based on the lexical database WordNet.
    These measures are implemented as Perl modules which take as input two concepts, and return a numeric value that represents the degree to which they are similar or related.
  
  
    WordNet::Similarity implements measures of similarity and relatedness that are all in some way based on the structure and content of WordNet.
    Measures of similarity use information found in an is&#8211; a hierarchy of concepts (or synsets), and quantify how much concept A is like (or is similar to) concept B.
    For example, such a measure might show that an automobile is more like a boat than it is a tree, due to the fact that automobile and boat s
