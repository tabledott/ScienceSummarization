 matrix in a little over two hours whereas Ravichandran et al. (2005) compute an approximation in 570 hours.
    On average they only find 73% 5 To avoid biasing our Wikipedia corpus with the test sets, Wikipedia &#8220;List of&#8221; pages were omitted from our statistics as were any page linked to gold standard list members from &#8220;List of&#8221; pages. of the top-1000 similar terms of a random term whereas we find all of them.
    For set expansion, experiments have been run on corpora as large as Web004 and Wikipedia (Sarmento et al. 2007), a corpora 300 times smaller than our Web crawl.
    Below, we compare the expansion accuracy of Sarmento et al. (2007) on Wikipedia and our Web crawls.
    Figure 2 illustrates the precision and recall tradeoff for our four corpora, with 95% confidence intervals computed over all 20,220 trials described in Section 4.2.
    Table 3 lists the resulting Rprecision along with the system precisions at ranks 25, 50, and 100 (see Figure 2 for detailed precision analysis).
