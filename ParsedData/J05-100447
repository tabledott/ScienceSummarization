 sense for which a frame has been defined.
  It is interesting to note that the semantic frames are a helpful way of generalizing between predicates; words in the same frame have been found frequently to share the same syntactic argument structure (Gildea and Jurafsky 2002).
  A more complete description of the FrameNet project can be found in Baker, Fillmore, and Lowe (1998) and Johnson et al.
  (2002), and the ramifications for automatic classification are discussed more thoroughly in Gildea and Jurafsky (2002).
  In contrast with FrameNet, PropBank is aimed at providing data for training statistical systems and has to provide an annotation for every clause in the Penn Treebank, no matter how complex or unexpected.
  Similarly to FrameNet, PropBank also attempts to label semantically related verbs consistently, relying primarily on VerbNet classes for determining semantic relatedness.
  However, there is much less emphasis on the definition of the semantics of the class that the verbs are associated with, a
