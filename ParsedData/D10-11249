181;k, with uniform diagonal covariance U2k; for region j, we can draw the regionallycorrupted topic from the normal distribution, &#951;jk &#8764; N(&#181;k, U2kI).
    Because &#951; is normally-distributed, it lies not in the simplex but in ][8W.
    We deterministically compute multinomial parameters &#946; by exponentiating and normalizing: &#946;jk = exp(&#951;jk)/ Ei exp(&#65533;(i) jk ).
    This normalization could introduce identifiability problems, as there are multiple settings for &#951; that maximize P(w|&#951;) (Blei and Lafferty, 2006a).
    However, this difficulty is obviated by the priors: given &#181; and U2, there is only a single &#951; that maximizes P(w|&#951;)P(&#951;|&#181;, U2); similarly, only a single &#181; maximizes P(&#951;|&#181;)P(&#181;|a, b2).
    The observed latitude and longitude, denoted y, are normally distributed and conditioned on the region, with mean &#957;r and precision matrix Ar indexed by the region r. The region index r is itself drawn from a single shared mul
