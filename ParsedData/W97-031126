or NCCs in the target language by estimating &amp;quot;fertility&amp;quot; distributions for words in the source language.
    A source word s with fertility n could generate a sequence of 71 target words, if each word in the sequence was also in the translational distribution of s and the target language model assigned a sufficiently high probability to the sequence.
    However, Brown et al. 's models do not account for NCCs in the source language.
    Recognition of source-language NCCs would certainly improve the performance of their models, but Brown et al. warn that ... one must be discriminating in choosing multi-word cepts.
    The caution that we have displayed thus far in limiting ourselves to cepts with fewer than two words was motivated primarily by our respect for the featureless desert that multi-word cepts offer a priori.
    (Brown et al., 1993) The heuristics in Section 6 are designed specifically to find the interesting features in that featureless desert.
    Furthermore, translational equi
