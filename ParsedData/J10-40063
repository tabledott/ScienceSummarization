  The last two decades have seen a rising wave of interest among computational linguists and cognitive scientists in corpus-based models of semantic representation (Grefenstette 1994; Lund and Burgess 1996; Landauer and Dumais 1997; Sch&#168;utze 1997; Sahlgren 2006; Bullinaria and Levy 2007; Griffiths, Steyvers, and Tenenbaum 2007; Pad&#180;o and Lapata 2007; Lenci 2008; Turney and Pantel 2010).
    These models, variously known as vector spaces, semantic spaces, word spaces, corpus-based semantic models, or, using the term we will adopt, distributional semantic models (DSMs), all rely on some version of the distributional hypothesis (Harris 1954; Miller and Charles 1991), stating that the degree of semantic similarity between two words (or other linguistic units) can be modeled as a function of the degree of overlap among their linguistic contexts.
    Conversely, the format of distributional representations greatly varies depending on the specific aspects of meaning they are designed to model.
