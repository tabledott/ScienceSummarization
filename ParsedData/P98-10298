plementarity is additive.
    In Figure 4, the first row shows the additive error rate an oracle could achieve on the test set if the oracle could pick between the different outputs of the taggers.
    For example, when the oracle can examine the output of the Maximum Entropy, Transformation-Based and Trigram taggers, it could achieve an error rate of 1.62%.
    The second row shows the additive error rate reduction the oracle could achieve.
    If the oracle is allowed to choose between all four taggers, a 55.5% error rate reduction is obtained over the Maximum Entropy tagger error rate.
    If the unigram output is discarded, the oracle improvement drops down to 48.8% over Maximum Entropy tagger error rate.
    From these results, we can conclude that there is at least hope that improvments can be gained by combining the output of different taggers.
    We can also conclude that the improvements we expect are somewhat additive, meaning the more taggers we combine, the better results we should expect.
