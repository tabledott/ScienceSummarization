ic wordlevel bigram features.
    These features aim to capture all the possible combinations of word and POS bigrams.
    Templates TB0-TB6 are the types of characters for bigrams.
    For example, (TE(w&#8722;1), TB(w0)) captures the change of character types from the end character in the previous word to the beginning character in the current word.
    Note that if one of the adjacent nodes is a character-level node, we use the template CB0 that represents POS bigrams.
    In our preliminary experiments, we found that if we add more features to non-word-level bigrams, the number of features grows rapidly due to the dense connections between non-word-level nodes.
    However, these features only slightly improve performance over using simple POS bigrams.
    For Seg, a token is considered to be a correct one if the word boundary is correctly identified.
    For Seg &amp; Tag, both the word boundary and its POS tag have to be correctly identified to be counted as a correct token.
