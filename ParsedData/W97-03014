t any possible complete parse tree T for the input sentence corresponds to exactly one sequence of actions; call this sequence the derivation of T. Each procedure, when given a derivation d = {al an}, predicts some action an&#177;i to create a new derivation d' = {al an+i }.
    Typically, the procedures postulate many different values for a+1, which cause the parser to explore many different derivations when parsing an input sentence.
    But for demonstration purposes, figures 1-7 trace one possible derivation for the sentence &amp;quot;I saw the man with the telescope&amp;quot;, using the part-of-speech (POS) tag set and constituent label set of the Penn treebank.
    The first pass takes an input sentence, shown in figure 1, and uses TAG to assign each word a POS tag.
    The result of applying TAG to each word is shown in figure 2.
    The second pass takes the output of the first pass and uses CHUNK to determine the &amp;quot;flat&amp;quot; phrase chunks of the sentence, where a phrase is &amp;quot;flat
