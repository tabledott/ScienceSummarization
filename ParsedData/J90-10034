 possible to test and apply informal assertions of this kind in a more rigorous way, and to see what company our words do keep.
  
  
    The proposed statistical description has a large number of potentially important applications, including: (a) constraining the language model both for speech recognition and optical character recognition (OCR), (b) providing disambiguation cues for parsing highly ambiguous syntactic structures such as noun compounds, conjunctions, and prepositiona 1 phrases, (c) retrieving texts from large databases (e.g. newspapers, patents), (d) enhancing the productivity of computational linguists in compiling lexicons of lexicosyntactic facts, and (e) enhancing the productivity of lexicographers in identifying normal and conventional usage.
    Consider the optical character recognizer (OCR) application.
    Suppose that we have an OCR device as in Kahan et al. (1987), and it has assigned about equal probability to having recognized farm and form, where the context is either: (1) federa
