 confident local classifications tend to be overridden by the dominant tag, because of the overwhelming strength of the one-sense-perdiscourse tendency.
    The use of this property after each iteration is similar to the final post-hoc application, but helps prevent initially mistagged collocates from gaining a foothold.
    The major difference is that in discourses where there is substantial disagreement concerning which is the dominant sense, all instances in the discourse are returned to the residual rather than merely leaving their current tags unchanged.
    This helps improve the purity of the training data.
    The fundamental limitation of this property is coverage.
    As noted in Section 2, half of the examples occur in a discourse where there are no other instances of the same word to provide corroborating evidence for a sense or to protect against misclassification.
    There is additional hope for these cases, however, as such isolated tokens tend to strongly favor a particular sense (the less &
