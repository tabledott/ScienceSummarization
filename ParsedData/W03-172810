bed here, we use the Transformation-Based Learning (Brill, 1995) to combine the results of two MEMM taggers.
    The feature set used in the TBL algorithm is similar to those used in the NP Chunking task in (Ngai and Florian, 2001).

    We conducted closed track experiments on three data sources: the Academia Sinica (AS) corpus, the Beijing University (PKU) corpus and the Hong Kong City University (CityU) corpus.
    We first split the training data from each of the three sources into two portions. of the official training data is used to train the MEMM taggers, and the other is held out as the development test data (the development set).
    The development set is used to estimate the optimal number of iterations in the MEMM training.
    Figure (1), (2) and (3) show the curves of F-scores on the development set with respect to the number of iterations in MEMM training. iteration dataset of the Academia Sinica corpus.
    X-axis stands for the number of iteration in training.
