icant. networks and four different sets of seed words.
    In the parentheses, the predicted value of Q is written.
    For cv, no value is written for Q, since 10 different values are obtained. accuracy, seed words are eliminated from these 3596 words.
    We conducted experiments with different values of 0 from 0.1 to 2.0, with the interval 0.1, and predicted the best value as explained in Section 4.3.
    The threshold of the magnetization for hyper-parameter estimation is set to 1.0 x 10&#8722;5.
    That is, the predicted optimal value of Q is the largest Q whose corresponding magnetization does not exceeds the threshold value.
    We performed 10-fold cross validation as well as experiments with fixed seed words.
    The fixed seed words are the ones used by Turney and Littman: 14 seed words {good, nice, excellent, positive, fortunate, correct, superior, bad, nasty, poor, negative, unfortunate, wrong, inferior}; 4 seed words {good, superior, bad, inferior}; 2 seed words {good, bad}.
