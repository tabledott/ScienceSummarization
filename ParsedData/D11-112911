ample of a compound type is that of a verb nrsnl.
    The superscripted types express that the verb is a relation with two arguments of type n, (2010) use the abstract setting of category theory to turn the grammatical structure of a sentence into a morphism compatible with the higher level logical structure of vector spaces.
    One pragmatic consequence of this abstract idea is as follows.
    In distributional models, there is a &#8722;&#8594; &#8722;&#8594; meaning vector for each word, e.g. cats, like, and which have to occur to the right and to the left of it, and that it outputs an argument of the type s. A transitive sentence has types as shown in Figure 3.
    Each type n cancels out with its right adjoint nr from the right and its left adjoint nl from the left; mathematically speaking these mean3 nln &lt; 1 and nnr &lt; 1 Here 1 is the unit of concatenation: 1n = n1 = n. The corresponding grammatical reduction of a transitive sentence is nnrsnl &lt; 1s1 = s. Each such reduction can be depicted as a
