nstraints is basically to discard as many alternatives as possible, the optimum being a fully disambiguated sentence with one syntactic reading only.
  The second central idea is to treat morphological disambiguation and syntactic labelling by the same mechanism of discarding improper alternatives.
  168 A good parsing formalism should satisfy many re- quirements: the constraints should be declarative rather than procedural, they should be able to cope with any real-world text-sentence (i.e.
  with running text, not just with linguists laboratory sentences), they should be clearly separated from the program code by which they are executed, the formalism should be language-independent, it should be rea~ sonably easy to implement (optimally as finite-state automata), and it should also be efficient to run.
  The CG formalism adheres to these desiderata.
  Breaking up the problem of parsing The problem of parsing running text may be broken up into six subproblems or modules: ?
  preprocessing, ?
