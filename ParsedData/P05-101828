tity grid representation of discourse which we argue captures important patterns of sentence transitions.
    We re-conceptualize coherence assessment as a ranking task and show that our entity-based representation is well suited for learning an appropriate ranking function; we achieve good performance on text ordering and summary coherence evaluation.
    On the linguistic side, our results yield empirical support to some of Centering Theory&#8217;s main claims.
    We show that coherent texts are characterized by transitions with particular properties which do not hold for all discourses.
    Our work, however, not only validates these findings, but also quantitatively measures the predictive power of various linguistic features for the task of coherence assessment.
    An important future direction lies in augmenting our entity-based model with lexico-semantic knowledge.
    One way to achieve this goal is to cluster entities based on their semantic relatedness, thereby creating a grid representation over
