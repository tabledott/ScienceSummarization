ses.5 However, we focus here on two conceptual issues underlying his use of source language syntactic constituents.
    First, the constituency feature treats all syntactic constituent types equally, making no distinction among them.
    For any given language pair, however, there might be some source constituents that tend to map naturally to the target language as units, and others that do not (Fox, 2002; Eisner, 2003).
    Moreover, a parser may tend to be more accurate for some constituents than for others.
    Second, the Chiang (2005) constituency feature gives a rule additional credit when the rule&#8217;s source side overlaps exactly with a source-side syntactic constituent.
    Logically, however, it might make sense not just to give a rule X &#8212;* (e, f) extra credit when f matches a constituent, but to incur a cost when f violates a constituent boundary.
    Using the example in Figure 1, we might want to penalize hypotheses containing rules where f is the minister gave a (and other cases, such
