    Not surprisingly, other researchers attempted to duplicate these results, but due to a lack of details of the parsing algorithm in his publications, these other researchers were not able to confirm the results (Magerman, Lafferty, personal communication).
    Even Bod's thesis (Bod, 1995a) does not contain enough information to replicate his results.
    Parsing using the DOP model is especially difficult.
    The model can be summarized as a special kind of Stochastic Tree Substitution Grammar (STSG): given a bracketed, labelled training corpus, let every subtree of that corpus be an elementary tree, with a probability proportional to the number of occurrences of that subtree in the training corpus.
    Unfortunately, the number of trees is in general exponential in the size of the training corpus trees, producing an unwieldy grammar.
    In this paper, we introduce a reduction of the DOP model to an exactly equivalent Probabilistic Context Free Grammar (PCFG) that is linear in the number of nodes i
