 aij is the number of data points that are members of class ci and elements of cluster kj .To discuss cluster evaluation measures we introduce two criteria for a clustering solution: homogeneity and completeness.
			A clustering result sat isfies homogeneity if all of its clusters contain only data points which are members of a single class.
			A clustering result satisfies completeness if all the data points that are members of a given class are elementsof the same cluster.
			The homogenity and completeness of a clustering solution run roughly in opposition: Increasing the homogeneity of a clustering so lution often results in decreasing its completeness.
			Consider, two degenerate clustering solutions.
			In one, assigning every datapoint into a single cluster, guarantees perfect completeness ? all of the datapoints that are members of the same class are triv ially elements of the same cluster.
			However, this cluster is as unhomogeneous as possible, since allclasses are included in this single cluster.
