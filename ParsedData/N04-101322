viously developed for machine translation to rewrite the relevant f-structure attributes as dependencies (see King et al. (2003)).
    The rewritings involved some deletions of irrelevant features, some systematic manipulations of the analyses, and some trivial respellings.
    The deletions involved features produced by the grammar but not included in the PARC 700 such as negative values of PASS, PERF, and PROG and the feature MEASURE used to mark measure phrases.
    The manipulations are more interesting and are necessary to map systematic differences between the analyses in the grammar and those in the dependency bank.
    For example, coordination is treated as a set by the LFG grammar but as a single COORD dependency with several CONJ relations in the dependency bank.
    Finally, the trivial rewritings were used to, for example, change STMT-TYPE decl in the grammar to STMT-TYPE declarative in the dependency bank.
    For the Reduced version of the PARC 700 substantially more features were deleted.
