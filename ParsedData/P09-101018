hallenging and engaging enough to warrant posting textual tutorials.8 A sample puzzle and tutorial are shown in Figure 3.
    The environment is defined by the state of the grid.
    The only command is clear, which takes a parameter specifying the orientation (row or column) and grid location of the line segment to be removed.
    The challenge in this domain is to segment the text into the phrases describing each action, and then correctly identify the line segments from references such as &#8220;the bottom four from the second column from the left.&#8221; For this domain, we use two sets of binary features on state-action pairs (s, a).
    First, for each vocabulary word w, we define a feature that is one if w is the last word of a&#8217;s consumed words W'.
    These features help identify the proper text segmentation points between actions.
    Second, we introduce features for pairs of vocabulary word w and attributes of action a, e.g., the line orientation and grid locations of the squares that a would
