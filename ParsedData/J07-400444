 combinatory rules, or the type-changing rules or punctuation rules.
    This is because some of the phrase structure subtrees in the Penn Treebank are difficult to convert to CCG combinatory rules, and because of noise introduced by the Treebank conversion process.
    Dependency structures perform two roles in this article.
    First, they are used for parser evaluation: The accuracy of a parsing model is measured using precision and recall over CCG predicate&#8211;argument dependencies.
    Second, dependency structures form the core of the dependency model: Probabilities are defined over dependency structures, and the parsing algorithm for this model returns the highest scoring dependency structure.
    We define a CCG dependency structure as a set of CCG predicate&#8211;argument dependencies.
    They are defined as sets, rather than multisets, because the lexical items in a dependency are considered to be indexed by sentence position; this is important for evaluation purposes and, for the dependency mod
