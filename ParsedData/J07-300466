    7.7.1 Heavy NP Shift.
    In English, noun phrase arguments can be shifted to the end of the sentence if they become too &#8220;heavy.&#8221; This construction was studied extensively by Ross (1967).
    The CCG analysis (Steedman 1996) uses backward crossed composition to provide an analysis where brings has its canonical lexical category (VP/PP)/NP: Because the Penn Treebank does not indicate heavy NP shift, the corresponding CCGbank derivation does not conform to the desired analysis, and requires additional lexical categories which may lead to incorrect overgeneralizations:24 This will also be a problem in using the Penn Treebank or CCGbank for any theory of grammar that treats heavy NP shift as extraction or movement.

    Coverage, Size, and Evaluation Here we first examine briefly the coverage of the translation algorithm on the entire Penn Treebank.
    Then we examine the CCG grammar and lexicon that are obtained from
