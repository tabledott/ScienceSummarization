r also trained on generic, balanced data, can perform competitively with systems which have been (almost) entirely developed and trained using PTB, whether or not these systems deploy hand-crafted grammars or ones derived automatically from treebanks.
  
  
    DepBank was constructed by parsing the selected section 23 WSJ sentences with the XLE system and outputting syntactic features and bilexical relations from the F-structure found by the parser.
    These features and relations were subsequently checked, corrected and extended interactively with the aid of software tools (King et al., 2003).
    The choice of relations and features is based quite closely on LFG and, in fact, overlaps substantially with the GR output of our parser.
    Figure 1 illustrates some DepBank annotations used in the experiment reported by Kaplan et al. and our hand-corrected GR output for the example Ten of the nation&#8217;s governors meanwhile called on the justices to reject efforts to limit abortions.
    We have kept the GR
