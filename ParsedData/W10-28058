diction model (v1 + v2) and a simplified pointwise multiplicative prediction model (v1 x v2) for each candidate pair.
    We also fitted a PLSR model using v1 and v2 as predictors and the corresponding observed pair v3 as dependent variable.
    The data were divided into a training set (1,000 A-N pairs) and a testing set (the remaining 380 A-N pairs).
    The model&#8217;s parameters were estimated by performing 10-fold cross-validation during the training phase.
    In what follows we briefly evaluate the three resulting models of compositionality.
  
  
    In order to evaluate the three models of compositionality that were built, we devised two different procedures based on the Euclidean measure of geometric distance.
    The first method draws a direct comparison of the different predicted vectors for each candidate A-N pair by computing the Euclidean distance between the observed vector and the modelled predictions.
    We also inspect a general distance matrix for the whole compositionality subspace, i
