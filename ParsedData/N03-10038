tence.
    While this is appropriate for other applications, deciding whether to use a given template to generate a paraphrase requires information about the surrounding context provided by the entire sentence.
  
  
    Overview We first sketch the algorithm&#8217;s broad outlines.
    The subsequent subsections provide more detailed descriptions of the individual steps.
    The major goals of our algorithm are to learn: recurring patterns in the data, such as X (injured/wounded) Y people, Z seriously, where the capital letters represent variables; pairings between such patterns that represent paraphrases, for example, between the pattern X (injured/wounded) Y people, Z of them seriously and the pattern Y were (wounded/hurt) by X, among them Z were in serious condition.
    Figure 1 illustrates the main stages of our approach.
    During training, pattern induction is first applied independently to the two datasets making up a pair of comparable corpora.
    Individual patterns are learned by applying name s
