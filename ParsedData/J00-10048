    The cost of a derivation of an input string to an output string by a weighted head transducer is the sum of the costs of transitions taken in the derivation.
    We can now define the string-to-string transduction function for a head transducer to be the function that maps an input string to the output string produced by the lowest-cost valid derivation taken over all initial states and initial symbols.
    (Formally, the function is partial in that it is not defined on an input when there are no derivations or when there are multiple outputs with the same minimal cost.)
    In the transducers produced by the training method described in this paper, the source and target positions are in the set {-1, 0,1}, though we have also used handcoded transducers (Alshawi and Xia 1997) and automatically trained transducers (Alshawi and Douglas 2000) with a larger range of positions.
    The operation of a traditional left-to-right transducer can be simulated by a head transducer by
