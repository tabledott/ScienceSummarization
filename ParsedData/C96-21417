s that typicMly we have a strong localization effect in aligning the words in parallel texts (for language pairs fi:om \]ndoeuropean lan- guages): the words are not distrilmted arbitrarily over the senteuce \])ositions, but tend to form clus- ters.
			Fig.
			1 illustrates this effect for the language pair German- 15'nglish.
			Each word of the German sentence is assigned to a word of the English sentence.
			The alignments have a strong tendency to preserve the local neigh- borhood when going from the one langnage to the other language.
			In mm,y cases, although not al~ ways, there is an even stronger restriction: the differeuce in the position index is smMler than 3.
