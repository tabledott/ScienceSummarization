 than either alone, in some cases running 40% faster than global thresholding alone, while achieving the same performance level.
    The combination generally runs twice as fast as beam thresholding alone, although up to a factor of three.
    Multiple-pass parsing improves even further on our experiments combining beam and global thresholding.
    Note that we used both beam and global thresholding for both the first and second pass in these experiments.
    The first pass grammar was the very simple terminal-prime grammar, and the second pass grammar was the usual 6-gram grammar.
    We evaluated multiple-pass parsing slightly differently from the other thresholding techniques.
    In the experiments conducted here, our first and second pass grammars were very different from each other.
    For a given parse to be returned, it must be in the intersection of both grammars, and reasonably likely according to both.
    Since the first and second pass grammars capture different information, parses which are lik
