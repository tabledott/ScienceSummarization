 their right) were excluded from these statistics. components of the distance measure allow the model to learn a preference for rightbranching structures.
    First, consider the adjacency condition.
    Figure 14 shows some examples in which right-branching structures are more frequent.
    Using the statistics from Tables 8 and 9, the probability of the alternative structures can be calculated.
    The results are given below.
    The right-branching structures get higher probability (although this is before the lexical-dependency probabilities are multiplied in, so this &#8220;prior&#8221; preference for right-branching structures can be overruled by lexical preferences).
    If the distance variables were not conditioned on, the product of terms for the two alternatives would be identical, and the model would have no preference for one structure over another.
