orm &#8220;Model 2, no-G,&#8221; a third-order sibling parser with no grandchild-based features.
  
  
    We have presented new parsing algorithms that are capable of efficiently parsing third-order factorizations, including both grandchild and sibling interactions.
    Due to space restrictions, we have been necessarily brief at some points in this paper; some additional details can be found in Koo (2010). on validation data.
    The term no-3rd indicates a parser that was trained and tested with the thirdorder feature mappings fgsib and ftsib deactivated, though lower-order features were retained; note that &#8220;Model 2, no-3rd&#8221; is not identical to the Carreras (2007) parser as it defines grandchild parts for the pair of grandchildren.
    The term no-G indicates a parser that was trained and tested with the grandchild-based feature mappings fgch and fgsib deactivated; note that &#8220;Model 2, no-G&#8221; emulates the third-order sibling parser proposed by McDonald and Pereira (2006).
