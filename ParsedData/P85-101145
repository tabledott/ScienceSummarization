to extend our claim to take into --count all derived trees (i.e., including the sentential trees).
  This can be done in a manner similar to our treatment of derived trees belonging to D(~) for some ~dl inry tree ~ as above.
  Of course, we have to consider only the cue where the finite state automaton start8 from the ini?i~d sta~ q0, and rez~bes ome final state qr ou the input which is the frontier o( some esnten*ial tree in G. This, then allowu us to conclude that L~ rl L R C L(G1).
  Hence, L(Gt) - -  L T ~l Lit.
  HEAD G ~ S  AND TAGs In this section, we attempt o show that Head Grmmmmm (HG) are remarkably similar to Tree Adjoining Grammars.
  It appesn that the basic intuition behind the two systems is more or less the same.
  Head Grammars were introduced in (Pollard,1084], but we follow the notations used in [Roach,10841.
  It has been observed that TAGs and HGs share a lot of common formal properties uch as almost identical closure results, similar pummping lemma.
  Consider the basic operation in Hea
