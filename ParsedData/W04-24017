n them (e.g. work for, located in, live in).
    We consider a set V which consists of two types of variables V = E U R. The first set of variables E = {E1, E2, &#183; &#183; &#183; , En} ranges G&#163;.
    The value (called &#8220;label&#8221;) assigned to Ei &#8712; E is denoted fE, &#8712; G&#163;.
    The second set of variables R = {Rij}{1&#8804;i,j&#8804;n;i0j} is viewed as binary relations over E. Specifically, for each pair of entities Ei and Ej, i =&#65533; j, we use Rij and Rji to denote the (binary) relations (Ei, Ej) and (Ej, Ei) respectively.
    The set of labels of relations is GR and the label assigned to relation Rij &#8712; R is fR&#8222; &#8712; GR.
    Apparently, there exists some constraints on the labels of corresponding relation and entity variables.
    For instance, if the relation is live in, then the first entity should be a person, and the second entity should be a location.
    The correspondence between the relation and entity variables can be represented by a bipartite graph.
