1996).
    Since we need knowledge-poor induction, we cannot use human-suggested filtering rules as in Section 2.2.
    Yet we can filter by pruning n-grams whose beginning or ending word is among the top N most frequent words.
    This unfortunately eliminates acronyms like &#8220;U.
    S.&#8221; and phrasal verbs like &#8220;throw up.&#8221; However, discarding some words may be worthwhile if the final list of n-grams is richer in terms of MRD headwords.
    We therefore evaluate with such an automatic filter, arbitrarily (and without optimization) choosing N=75.
  
  
    A natural scoring standard is to select a language and evaluate against headwords from existing dictionaries in that language.
    Others have used similar standards (Daille, 1996), but to our knowledge, none to the extent described here.
    We evaluate thousands of hypothesized units from an unconstrained corpus.
    Furthermore, we use two separate evaluation gold standards: (1) WordNet (Miller, et al, 1990) and (2) a collection of In
