tive expressions, its gold class is negative; if it is in a mixture of positive and neutral subjective expressions, its gold class is positive.
    Finally, if a clue instance appears in at least one positive and one negative subjective expression (or in a subjective expression marked as both), then its gold class is both.
    A clue instance can appear in more than one subjective expression because in the MPQA annotation scheme, it is possible for direct subjective frames and expressive subjective elements frames to overlap.
  
  
    Before delving into the task of recognizing contextual polarity, an important question to address is how useful prior polarity alone is for identifying contextual polarity.
    To answer this question, we create a classifier that simply assumes the contextual polarity of a clue instance is the same as the clue&#8217;s prior polarity.
    We explore this classifier&#8217;s performance on a small amount of development data, which is not part of the data used in the subsequent exp
