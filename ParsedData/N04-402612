that have actually been swapped.
    The training data is unsegmented, as can be seen from the first two blocks.
    The block in the first line has been seen times more often with left than with right orientation.
    Blocks for which the ratio is bigger than are likely candidates for swapping in our Arabic-English experiments.
    The ratio itself is not currently used in the orientation model.
    The orientation model mostly effects blocks where the Arabic and English words are verbs or nouns.
    As shown in Fig.
    1, the orientation model uses the orientation probability for the noun block , and only the default model for the adjective block .
    Although the noun block might occur by itself without adjective, the swapping is not controlled by the occurrence of the adjective block (which does not have adjacent predecessors).
    We rather model the fact that a noun block is typically preceded by some block .
    This situation seems typical for the block swapping that occurs on the evaluation test se
