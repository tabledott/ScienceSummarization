focused problem can be formalized as a general problem, called the tree classification problem.
    The tree classification problem is to induce a mapping f(x) : X &#8594; {&#177;1}, from given training examples T = {hxi, yii}Li=1, where xi &#8712; X is a labeled ordered tree and yi &#8712; {&#177;1} is a class label associated with each training data (we focus here on the problem of binary classification.).
    The important characteristic is that the input example xi is represented not as a numerical feature vector (bagof-words) but a labeled ordered tree.
    Let us introduce a labeled ordered tree (or simply tree), its definition and notations, first.
    We denote the number of nodes in t as |t|.
    Figure 1 shows an example of a labeled ordered tree and its subtree and non-subtree.
    Decision stumps are simple classifiers, where the final decision is made by only a single hypothesis or feature.
