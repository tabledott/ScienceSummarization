n-punctuation words.
    10Parser combination in Zhang and Clark (2008) achieves a higher word accuracy of 85.77%, but again, it is not directly comparable to our work. that it is not restricted to LR (a special case of shift-reduce), and thus does not require building an LR table, which is impractical for modern grammars with a large number of rules or features.
    In contrast, we employ the ideas behind GSS more flexibly to merge states based on features values, which can be viewed as constructing an implicit LR table on-the-fly.
    Second, unlike previous theoretical results about cubic-time complexity, we achieved linear-time performance by smart beam search with prefix cost inspired by Stolcke (1995), allowing for state-of-the-art data-driven parsing.
    To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first linear-time incremental parser that performs dynamic programming.
    The parser of Roark and Hollingshead (2009) is also almost linear time, but they achieved this by discarding parts of the CKY cha
