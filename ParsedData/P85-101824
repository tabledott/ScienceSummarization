 that the whole left-hand-side subdag unifies with the subphrase being predicted from.
    Formally, we have Predictor step: For each item ending at i of the form [h. i. X0 D1 and each rule of the form (X0 E). add an edge of the form 11,1, Xe &#8212; Eu (Xo D(X1)11 if the unification succeeds and this edge is not subsumed by another edge.
    This step predicts top-down all rides whose left-hand side matches the dag of some constituent being looked for.
    Completer step: As before.
    Scanner step: As before.
    However, this extension does not preserve termination.
    Consider a &amp;quot;counting' grammar that records in the dag the number of terminals in the string.&#176; A -- a. and so forth ad infinitum.
    What is needed is a way of 'forgetting' some of the structure we are using for top-down prediction.
    But this is just what restriction gives us, since a restricted dag always subsumes the original, i.e., it has strictly less information.
    Taking advantage of this property. we can change th
