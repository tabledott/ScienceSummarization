ding to the Penn II annota tion guidelines (Bies et al, 1995); we call this set G.The second set consists of the ordinary bracket la bels (S, NP, VP, etc.), combined with function tags for grammatical roles, giving composite labels such as NP-SBJ; we call this set B. We assign labels to arcs by letting each (non-root) word that heads aphrase P in the original phrase structure have its in coming edge labeled with the label of P (modulo the set of labels used).
			In both sets, we also includea default label DEP for arcs that would not other wise get a label.
			This gives a total of 7 labels in the G set and 50 labels in the B set.
			Figure 1 shows a converted dependency tree using the B labels; in the corresponding tree with G labels NP-SBJ would be replaced by SBJ, ADVP and VP by DEP.
			We use the following metrics for evaluation: 1.
			Unlabeled attachment score (UAS): The pro-.
			portion of words that are assigned the correct head (or no head if the word is a root) (Eisner, 1996; Collins et al, 1999).
