  As explained before, the suflix tree is walked during a lookup along the l)ath, where the nodes are anno- tated with the letters of the word snflix in reversed or- der.
  If at some node on the path, no matching subnode can be found, and there is a default subitode, then the default node is followed.
  If a leaf is reached at the end of the path, the corresponding tag probability vector is returned.
  Otherwise, the search fails and the default entry is returned.
  The defaull entry is constructed by subtracting the tag frequencies at all leaves of the pruned suffix tree from the tag frequencies of the root node and nor-
