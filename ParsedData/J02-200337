t at an internal node.
    McCarthy also does not transform WordNet into a tree, which is strictly required for Li and Abe&#8217;s application of MDL.
    This did create a problem with overgeneralization: Many of the cuts returned by MDL were overgeneralizing at the (entity) node.
    The reason is that (person), which is close to (entity) and dominated by (entity), has two parents: (life form) and (causal agent).
    This DAG-like property was responsible for the overgeneralization, and so we removed the link between (person) and (causal agent).
    This appeared to solve the problem, and the results presented later for the average degree of generalization do not show an overgeneralization compared with those given in Li and Abe (1998).
  
  
    The task we used to compare the class-based estimation techniques is a decision task previously used by Pereira, Tishby, and Lee (1993) and Rooth et al. (1999).
    The task is to decide which of two verbs, v and v', is more likely to take a given noun, n, as an ob
