precision/recall, as indicated in Figure 2 on the line labeled &amp;quot;MaxEnt-Inspired'.
    Note that we also tried including this information using a standard deleted-interpolation model.
    The results here are shown in the line &amp;quot;Standard Interpolation&amp;quot;.
    Including this information within a standard deleted-interpolation model causes a 0.6% decrease from the results using the less conventional model.
    Indeed, the resulting performance is worse than not using this information at all.
    Up to this point all the models considered in this section are tree-bank grammar models.
    That is, the PCFG grammar rules are read directly off the training corpus.
    As already noted, our best model uses a Markov-grammar approach.
    As one can see in Figure 2, a firstorder Markov grammar (with all the aforementioned improvements) performs slightly worse than the equivalent tree-bank-grammar parser.
    However, a second-order grammar does slightly better and a third-order grammar does sign
