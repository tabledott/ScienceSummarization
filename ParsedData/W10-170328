ng only the data from the volunteers (which we will now refer to as the &#8220;expert&#8221; data).
    To that end, we prepared 600 ranking sets for each of the eight language pairs, with each set containing five MT outputs to be ranked, using the same interface used by the volunteers.
    We posted the data to MTurk and requested, for each one, five redundant assignments, from different workers.
    Had all the 5 x 8 x 600 = 24,000 assignments been completed, we would have obtained 24,000 x 5 = 120,000 additional rank labels, compared to the 37,884 labels we collected from the volunteers (Table 3).
    In actuality, we collected closer to 55,000 rank labels, as we discuss shortly.
    To minimize the amount of data that is of poor quality, we placed two requirements that must be satisfied by any worker before completing any of our tasks.
    First, we required that a worker have an existing approval rating of at least 85%.
    Second, we required a worker to reside in a country where the target language of
