ethods of negation detection, two regular expression-based methods and two classification-based methods trained on 1745 discharge reports.
    They show that the regular expression-based methods show better agreement with humans and better accuracy than the classification methods.
    Like in most of the work mentioned, the task consists in determining whether a medical term is negated.
    Rokach et al. (2008) present a new pattern-based algorithm for identifying context in free-text medical narratives.The originality of the algorithm lies in that it automatically learns patterns similar to the manually written patterns for negation detection.
    We are not aware of any research that has focused on learning the full scope of negation signals outside biomedical natural language processing.
  
  
    The system has been developed using the BioScope corpus (Szarvas et al., 2008; Vincze et al., 2008)1, a freely available resource that consists of medical and biological texts.
    In the corpus, every sentence i
