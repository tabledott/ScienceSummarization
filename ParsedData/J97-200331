e subsequential, in particular, acyclic transducers represent subsequential power series.
    Mohri Transducers in Language and Speech We introduce a theorem giving an intrinsic characterization of subsequential power series irrespective of the transducer realizing them.
    We then present an algorithm that allows one to determinize some string-to-weight transducers.
    We give a general presentation of the algorithm since it can be used with many other semirings, in particular, with string-to-string transducers and with transducers whose output labels are pairs of strings and weights.
    We then use the twins property to define a set of transducers to which the determinization algorithm applies.
    We give a characterization of unambiguous transducers admitting determinization, and then use this characterization to define an algorithm to test if a given transducer can be determinized.
    We also present a very efficient minimization algorithm that applies to subsequential string-to-weight transducers.
