    However only 89.29% of these solutions are produced with a certificate of optimality (y(k) = z(k)).
    We ran experiments measuring the quality of z&#8727; = argmaxz&#8712;Z f(z), where f(z) is given by the perceptron-trained bigram-sibling model.
    Because z&#8727; may not be a well-formed tree with n dependencies, we report precision and recall rather than conventional dependency accuracy.
    Results on the PTB validation set were 91.11%/88.95% precision/recall, which is accurate considering the unconstrained nature of the predictions.
    Thus the z&#8727; approximation is clearly a good one; we suspect that this is one reason for the good convergence results for the method.
    It is simple to adapt the dual-decomposition algorithms in figures 1 and 2 to give projective dependency structures: the set Y is redefined to be the set of all projective structures, with the arg max over Y being calculated using a projective first-order parser (Eisner, 2000).
    Table 3 shows results for projective
