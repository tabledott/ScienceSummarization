   We describe a new system capable of distinguishing 160 verbal subcategorization classes&#8212;a superset of those found in the ANLT and COMLEX Syntax dictionaries.
    The classes also incorporate information about control of predicative arguments and alternations such as particle movement and extraposition.
    We report an initial experiment which demonstrates that this system is capable of acquiring the subcategorization classes of verbs and the relative frequencies of these classes with comparable accuracy to the less ambitious extant systems.
    We achieve this performance by exploiting a more sophisticated robust statistical parser which yields complete though 'shallow' parses, a more comprehensive subcategorization class classifier, and a priori estimates of the probability of membership of these classes.
    We also describe a small-scale experiment which demonstrates that subcategorization class frequency information for individual verbs can be used to improve parsing accuracy.
