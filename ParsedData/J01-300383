n holds from argument structure to subcategorization (change of possession implies dative shift), the converse also holds.
    It comes as no surprise that verbs that do not have any change-of-possession component in their meaning may also show dative shift syntactically.
    Secondly, as Boguraev and Briscoe themselves note, Levin's statement should be interpreted as a statistical trend, and as such, Boguraev and Briscoe's results also confirm it.
    They claim however, that in adopting a statistical point of view, predictive power is lost.
    Our work shows that this conclusion is not appropriate either: the correlation is strong enough to be useful to predict semantic classification, at least for the argument structures that have been investigated.
    Given the manifestation of argument structure in statistical distributions, we view corpora, especially if annotated with currently available tools, as repositories of implicit grammars, which can be exploited in automatic verb-classification tasks.
