odels that account for non-local information, in particular arity and neighbouring parse decisions.
    For systems that model arity constraints we give a reduction from the Hamiltonian graph problem suggesting that the parsing problem is intractable in this case.
    For neighbouring parse decisions, we extend the work of McDonald and Pereira (2006) and show that modeling vertical neighbourhoods makes parsing intractable in addition to modeling horizontal neighbourhoods.
    A consequence of these results is that it is unlikely that exact non-projective dependency parsing is tractable for any model assumptions weaker than those made by the edge-factored models.
  
  
    There has been extensive work on data-driven dependency parsing for both projective parsing (Eisner, 1996; Paskin, 2001; Yamada and Matsumoto, 2003; Nivre and Scholz, 2004; McDonald et al., 2005a) and non-projective parsing systems (Nivre and Nilsson, 2005; Hall and N&#180;ov&#180;ak, 2005; McDonald et al., 2005b).
    These approaches can o
