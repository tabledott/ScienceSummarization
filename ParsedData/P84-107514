r&gt; = singular &lt;agr person&gt; = third The lexical entry for &amp;quot;knights' would then be knights: Verb ThirdSing Templates can themselves refer to other templates, enabling definition of abstract linguistic concepts hierarchically.
    For instance, a modal verb template may use an auxiliary verb template, which in term may be defined using the verb template above.
    In fact, templates are currently employed for abstracting notions of subcategorization, verb form, semantic type, and a host of other concepts.
    More complex relationships among lexical items can be encoded by means of lexical rules.
    These rules, such as passive and &amp;quot;there&amp;quot; insertion, are user-definable operations on the lexical items, enabling one variant of a word to be built from the specification of another variant.
    A lexical rule is specified as a set of selective unifications relating an input DAG and an output DAG.
    Thus, unification is the primitive used in this device as well.
