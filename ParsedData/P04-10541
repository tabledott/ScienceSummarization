ates Senator.&#8221; Only a structured representation of the data can effectively provide such a list.
    The goal of Information Extraction (IE) is to discover relevant segments of information in a data stream that will be useful for structuring the data.
    In the case of text, this usually amounts to finding mentions of interesting entities and the relations that join them, transforming a large corpus of unstructured text into a relational database with entries such as those in Table 1.
    IE is commonly viewed as a three stage process: first, an entity tagger detects all mentions of interest; second, coreference resolution resolves disparate mentions of the same entity; third, a relation extractor finds relations between these entities.
    Entity tagging has been thoroughly addressed by many statistical machine learning techniques, obtaining greater than 90% F1 on many datasets (Tjong Kim Sang and De Meulder, 2003).
    Coreference resolution is an active area of research not investigated here (Pasula
