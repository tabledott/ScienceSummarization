ree T is given by where Cr (A --&gt; a) is the number of times the production A a is used in the derivation T. The PCFG that assigns maximum likelihood to the sequence i= of trees in a treebank corpus is given by the relative frequency estimator.
    Here C,-- (A a) is the number of times the production A a is used in derivations of the trees in f. This estimation procedure can be used in a broad-coverage parsing procedure as follows: A PCFG G is estimated from a treebank corpus :1- of training data.
    In the work presented here the actual lexical items (words) are ignored, and the terminals of the trees are taken to be the part-of-speech (POS) tags assigned to the lexical items.
    Given a sequence of POS tags to be analyzed, a dynamic programming method based on the CKY algorithm (Aho and Ullman 1972) is used to search for a maximum-likelihood parse using this PCFG.
  
  
    For something so apparently fundamental to syntactic research, there is considerable disagreement among linguists as to just what
