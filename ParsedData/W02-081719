ollected data helps on the Senseval-2 task.
    As shown in Section 3.3, redundant tags will be collected for each item, and overall quality will be assessed.
    Moreover, starting with the initial set of examples labeled for each word, we will create confusion matrices that will indicate the similarity between word senses, and help us create the sense mappings for the coarse grained evaluations.
    One of the next steps we plan to take is to replace the &#8221;two tags per item&#8221; scheme with the &#8221;tag until at least two tags agree&#8221; scheme proposed and used during the SENSEVAL-2 tagging (Kilgarriff, 2002).
    Additionally, the set of meanings that constitute the possible choices for a certain ambiguous example will be enriched with groups of similar meanings, which will be determined either based on some apriori provided sense mappings (if any available) or based on the confusion matrices mentioned above.
    For each word with sense tagged data created with Open Mind Word Expert, a test co
