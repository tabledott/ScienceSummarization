 and semantic, involving analysis (e.g., disambiguation) and generation (e.g., selection among competing outputs).
    Also, it remains to be shown that the web-based approach scales up to larger n-grams (e.g., trigrams), and to combinations of different parts of speech (Keller and Lapata 2003 only tested bigrams involving nouns, verbs, and adjectives).
    Another important question is whether web-based methods, which are by definition unsupervised, can be competitive alternatives to supervised approaches used for most tasks in the literature.
    This paper aims to address these questions.
    We start by using web counts for two generation tasks for which the use of large data sets has shown promising results: (a) target language candidate selection for machine translation (Grefenstette, 1998) and (b) context sensitive spelling correction (Banko and Brill, 2001a,b).
    Then we investigate the generality of the web-based approach by applying it to a range of analysis and generations tasks, involving both s
