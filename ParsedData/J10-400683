    The latter was trained on about half of the data we used, however (moreover, the confidence intervals of these models largely overlap, suggesting that their difference is not significant).
    6.1.4 Selectional Preferences.
    Our last pair of data sets for the W1xLW2 space illustrate how the space can be used not only to measure similarity among words, but also to work with more abstract notions, such as that of a typical filler of an argument slot of a verb (such as the typical killer and the typical killee).
    We think that these are especially important experiments, because they show how the same matrix that has been used for tasks that were entirely bound to lexical items can also be used to generalize to structures that go beyond what is directly observed in the corpus.
    In particular, we model here selectional preferences (how plausible a noun is as subject/object of a verb), but our method is generalizable to many other semantic tasks that pertain to composition constraints; that is, the
