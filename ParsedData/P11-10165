rating syntactic features generated using words syntactically connected with the given target in the tweet to decide whether or not the sentiment is about the given target.
    For instance, in the second example, using syntactic parsing, we know that &#8220;Windows 7&#8221; is connected to &#8220;better&#8221; by a copula, while &#8220;Vista&#8221; is connected to &#8220;better&#8221; by a preposition.
    By learning from training data, we can probably predict that &#8220;Windows 7&#8221; should get a positive sentiment and &#8220;Vista&#8221; should get a negative sentiment.
    In addition, we also propose to incorporate the contexts of tweets into classification, which we call a context-aware approach.
    By considering the sentiment labels of the related tweets, we can further boost the performance of the sentiment classification, especially for very short and ambiguous tweets.
    For example, in the third example we mentioned above, if we find that the previous and following tweets published by the s
