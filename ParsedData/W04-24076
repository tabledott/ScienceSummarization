			The transitions Left-Arc and Right-Arc are subject to conditions that ensure that the graph conditions Uniquelabel and Single head are satisfied.
			By contrast, the Re duce transition can only be applied if the token on top of the stack already has a head.
			For Shift, the only condition is that the input list is non-empty.As it stands, this transition system is nondeterminis tic, since several transitions can often be applied to the same configuration.
			Thus, in order to get a deterministic parser, we need to introduce a mechanism for resolving transition conflicts.
