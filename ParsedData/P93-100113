    The implementation of dotplots are discussed in more detail in section 7.
    The dotplots in Figures 8 and 9 look very similar, with diagonal lines superimposed over squares, though the features are somewhat sharper in Figure 8 because the input is much larger.
    Figure 8 shows a dotplot of 3 years of Canadian Hansards (37 million words) in English and French, tokenized by words.
    Figure 9 shows a dotplot of a short article (25 kbytes) that appeared in a Christian Science magazine in both English and German, tokenized into 4&#8212;grams of characters.
    The diagonals and squares are commonly found in dotplots of parallel text.
    The squares have a very simple explanation.
    The upper&#8212;left quadrant and the lower&#8212;right quadrant are darker than the other two quadrants because the source text and the target text are more themselves than either is like the other.
    This fact, of course, is not very surprising, and is not particularly useful for our purposes here.
