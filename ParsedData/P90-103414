    Is list most like field because neither one has much meaning by itself?
  
  
    Using a similarity metric derived from the distribution of subjects, verbs and objects in a corpus of English text, we have shown the plausibility of deriving semantic relatedness from the distribution of syntactic forms.
    This demonstration has depended on: 1) the availability of relatively large text corpora; 2) the existence of parsing technology that, despite a large error rate, allows us to find the relevant syntactic relations in unrestricted text; and 3) (most important) the fact that the lexical relations involved in the distribution of words in syntactic structures are an extremely strong linguistic constraint.
    A number of issues will have to be confronted to further exploit these structurallymediated lexical constraints, including: Potysemy.
    The analysis presented here does not distinguish among related senses of the (orthographically) same wor
