quires a distinct &lt; marker for each application of the rule.
    The &lt; that sanctions the deletion of the leftmost a in the string is therefore not available to delete the next one.
    However, the Leftcon text operator as defined disallows two left-context brackets in a row.
    Our solution is to insert an explicit character 0 to represent the deleted material.
    If Leftcon text ignores this character in A, 0 will always be followed by another left bracket and thus another rule application is possible.
    The auxiliary symbol 0 is not in E or in the set of context brackets.
    It will substitute for the empty strings that might appear in the center of rules (in 0 or zp), but it is a genuine symbol in an expanded alphabet which, unlike the normal 6, actually appears as a distinct element in character strings.
    The Prologue relation is extended to freely introduce 0 as well as the brackets in m: We then construct alternative versions of 0 and lp in which this special symbol replaces the true emp
