riational posterior and the true model posterior.
    The &#948;r, &#948;s, and &#948;d factors place point estimates on a single value, just as in hard EM.
    Updating these factors involves finding the value which maximizes the model (expected) loglikelihood under the other factors.
    For instance, the &#948;s factor is a point estimate of the type parameters, and is updated with:3 where Q_63 denotes all factors of the variational approximation except for the factor being updated.
    The ri (pronoun antecedents) and qk (type indicator) factors maintain a soft approximation and so are slightly more complex.
    For example, the ri factor update takes the standard mean field form: ri(Api ) a exp{EQ_r, lnP(E, Z, M, -r, 7r)} (2) We briefly describe the update for each additional factor, omitting details for space.
    Updating type parameters &#948;s(-r): The type parameters -r consist of several multinomial distributions which can be updated by normalizing expected counts as in the EM algorithm.
