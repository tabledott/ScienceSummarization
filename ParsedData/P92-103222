this time they were given access to the dictionary definitions.
    Jorgensen reported performance in terms of the &amp;quot;Agreement-Disagreement&amp;quot; (A-D) ratio (Shipstone, 1960) for each subject and each of the twelve test words.
    We have found it convenient to transform the A-D ratio into a quantity which we call the percent agreement, the number of observed agreements over the total number of possible agreements.
    The grand mean percent agreement over all subjects and words is only 68%.
    In other words, at least under these conditions, there is considerable variation across judgements, perhaps so much so that it would be hard to show that a proposed system was outperforming the baseline system (75%, averaged over ambiguous types).
    Moreover, if we accept Bar-Hillel's argument that 75% is not-goodenough, then it would be hard to show that a system was doing well-enough.
  
  
    For evaluation purposes, it is important to find a task that is somewhat easier for the judges.
