 Champollion does not translate closed-class words such as prepositions and articles.
    Their frequency is so high in comparison to openclass words that including them in the candidate translations causes problems with the correlation metric.
    Evaluators generally counted a translation as incorrect if it did not contain a preposition or article when it should have.
    There is one exception to this general rule: When the translation should have included one closed-class word, it was obvious what that word should be, it occurred in one empty slot in the phrase, and Champollion produced a rigid collocation with an empty slot at that position; and with the correct open-class words, they judged the translation correct.
    It is exactly in these cases that the closed-class word could easily be filled in when examining samples in the corpus to determine word ordering.
    Since the collocation is rigid, the same preposition or article occurs in most cases, so it could be extracted from the samples along with
