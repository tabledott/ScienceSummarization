antecedents and then rank the remaining ones using salience factors.
    As a result, their cluster-ranking model employs only factors that capture the salience of a cluster, and can therefore be viewed as a simple model of attentional state (see Grosz and Sidner (1986)) realized by coreference clusters.
    By contrast, our resolution strategy is learned without applying hand-coded constraints in a separate filtering step.
    In particular, we attempt to determine the compatibility between a cluster and an active mention, using factors that determine not only salience (e.g., the distance between the cluster and the mention) but also lexical and grammatical compatibility, for instance.
    Entity-mention coreference models.
    Luo et al. (2004) represent one of the earliest attempts to investigate learning-based entity-mention models.
    They use the ANY predicate to generate clusterlevel features as follows: given a binary-valued feature X defined over a pair of mentions, they introduce an ANY-X cluster-l
