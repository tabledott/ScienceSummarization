sed as the only criterion for selecting an antecedent, the statistical selection procedure disagrees with RAP in 151 out of 338 instances.
    RAP is correct in 120 (79%) of these cases and the statistical decision in 31 (21%) of the cases.
    When salience is factored into RAPSTAT's decision procedure, the rate of disagreement between RAP and RAPSTAT declines sharply, and RAPSTAT's performance slightly surpasses that of RAP, yielding the results that we obtained in the blind test.
    In general, RAPSTAT is a conservative statistical extension of RAP.
    It permits statistically measured lexical preference to overturn salience-based decisions only in cases in which the difference between the salience values of two candidates is small and the statistical preference for the less salient candidate is comparatively large.'
    The comparative blind test indicates that incorporating statistical information on lexical preference patterns into a salience-based anaphora resolution procedure can yield a modest impr
