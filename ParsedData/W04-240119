active.
    In addition, this evaluation exhibits the ability of our approach to incorporate task specific constraints at decision time.
    Our experiments are based on the TREC data set (which consists of articles from WSJ, AP, etc.) that we annotated for named entities and relations.
    In order to effectively observe the interaction between relations and entities, we picked 1437 sentences that have at least one active relation.
    Among those sentences, there are 5336 entities, and 19048 pairs of entities (binary relations).
    Entity labels include 1685 persons, 1968 locations, 978 organizations and 705 others.
    Relation labels include 406 located in, 394 work for, 451 orgBased in, 521 live in, 268 kill, and 17007 none.
    Note that most pairs of entities have no active relations at all.
    Therefore, relation none significantly outnumbers others.
    Examples of each relation label and the constraints between a relation variable and its two entity arguments are shown as follows.
