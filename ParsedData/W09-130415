de input to the metalearner were trained using the following machine learning methods: &#8226; Conditional random fileds (CRFs) as implemented in CRF++-0.51 (Lafferty et al., 2001).
    CRFs define a conditional probability distribution over label sequences given a particular observation sequence rather than a joint distribution over label and observation sequences, and are reported to avoid the label bias problem of HMMs and other learning approaches.
    The memory-based learning algorithm was parameterised in this case by using overlap as the similarity metric, gain ratio for feature weighting, using 7 k-nearest neighbors, and weighting the class vote of neighbors as a function of their inverse linear distance.
    The SVM was parameterised in the learning phase for classification, cost factor of 1 and biased hyperplane, and it used a linear kernel function.
    The CRFs classifier used regularization algorithm L2 for training, the hyper-parameter and the cut-off threshold of features were set to 1.
