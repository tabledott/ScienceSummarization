nces, a sentence generation capability, and a design framework that easily accomodates parallel implementations.
    It is a two-step procedure to acquire a grammar from a specific set of sentences.
    The rule set is first built up gradually, by parsing the sentences one-by-one, adding rules and/or constraints as needed.
    Once a full set of sentences has been parsed in this fashion, the parse trees from the sentences are automatically converted to the sequence of rules used to parse each sentence.
    The training of both the rule set and the probability assignments is then established directly in a second pass from the provided set of parsed sentences; i.e., the parsed sentences are the grammar.
    Generation mode uses the same routines as those used by the parser, but chooses a small subset of the permissible paths based on the outcome of a random-number generator, rather than exploring all paths and relying on an input word stream to resolve the correct one.
    Since all of the arcs have assigned pr
