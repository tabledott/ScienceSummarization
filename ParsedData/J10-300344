 forest.
    Note that for clarity, not all constituents are expanded fully.
    Leaf nodes with two entries represent paraphrases.
    (b) The word lattice generated by linearizing the forest in (a). sentences in the group.
    Once the forest is created, it is linearized to create the word lattice by traversing the nodes in the forest top-down and producing an alternative path in the lattice for each merged node.
    Figure 5(b) shows the word lattice generated for the simple two-tree forest.
    The lattices also require some post-processing to remove redundant edges and nodes that may have arisen due to parsing errors or limitations in the merging algorithm.
    The final output of the paraphrasing algorithm is a set of word lattices, one for each sentence group.
    These lattices can be used as sources of lexical as well as phrasal paraphrases.
    All alternative paths between any pair of nodes can be considered to be paraphrases of each other.
    For example, besides the obvious lexical paraphrases,
