			The parsing methodology investigated here haspreviously been applied to Swedish, where promis ing results were obtained with a relatively smalltreebank (approximately 5000 sentences for train ing), resulting in an attachment score of 84.7% and a labeled accuracy of 80.6% (Nivre et al, 2004).1 However, since there are no comparable resultsavailable for Swedish, it is difficult to assess the significance of these findings, which is one of the reasons why we want to apply the method to a bench mark corpus such as the the Penn Treebank, even though the annotation in this corpus is not ideal for labeled dependency parsing.The paper is structured as follows.
