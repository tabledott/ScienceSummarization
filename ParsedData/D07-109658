			For this task, the results are rather surprising.
			A lookat the LAS and UAS for the chemical research ab stracts shows that there are four closed systems that outperform the best scoring open system.
			The best system (Sagae and Tsujii, 2007) reaches an LAS of 81.06 (in comparison to their LAS of 89.01 for theEnglish data set in the multilingual track).
			Consider ing that approximately one third of the words of the chemical test set are new, the results are noteworthy.
