tence that are aligned to each word in the translation .
    We wish to compare this automatic translation with a reference translation with word-to-word alignment relative to.
    We will now present a three-tier hierarchy of translation loss functions of the form that measure against .
    These loss functions will make use of different levels of information from word strings, MT alignments and syntactic structure from parse-trees of both the source and target strings as illustrated in the following table.
    We start with an example of two competing English translations for a Chinese sentence (in Pinyin without tones), with their word-to-word alignments in Figure 1.
    The reference translation for the Chinese sentence with its word-to-word alignment is shown in Figure 2.
    In this section, we will show the computation of different loss functions for this example.
    The first class of loss functions uses no information about word alignments or parse-trees, so that can be reduced to .
    We consider
