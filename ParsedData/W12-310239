 resulting quantiles have at least 2 entries (no singleton quantiles).
    The DeltaAvg metric has some important properties that are desired for a ranking metric (see Section 6.4 for the results of the shared-task that substantiate these claims): DeltaAvgV [n] = En&#65533;1 V (S) (14) &#8226; it measures the quality of a hypothesis rankk=1 V (S1,k) ing from an extrinsic perspective (as offered by n &#8722; 1 function V ) When the valuation function V is clear from the context, we write DeltaAvg[n] for DeltaAvgV [n].
    The parameter n represents the number of quantiles we want to split the set S into.
    For instance, n = 2 gives DeltaAvg[2] = V (S1) &#8722; V (S), hence it measures the difference between the quality of the top In the rest of this paper, we present results for DeltaAvg using as valuation function V the PostEditing effort scores, as defined in Section 6.1.
    We also report the results of the ranking task using the more-traditional Spearman correlation.
    For the scoring task, we use two
