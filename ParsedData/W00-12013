s rules of the form where P, L, Ri and H are all lexicalized nonterminals, and P inherits its lexical head from its distinguished head child, H. In this generative model, first P is generated, then its head-child H, then each of the left- and right-modifying nonterminals are generated from the head outward.
    The modifying nonterminals Li and Ri are generated conditioning on P and H, as well as a distance metric (based on what material intervenes between the currently-generated modifying nonterminal and H) and an incremental subcat frame feature (a multiset containing the complements of H that have yet to be generated on the side of H in which the currentlygenerated nonterminal falls).
    Note that if the modifying nonterminals were generated completely independently, the model would be very impoverished, but in actuality, by including the distance and subcat frame features, the model captures a crucial bit of linguistic reality, viz., that words often have welldefined sets of complements and adjuncts, dis
