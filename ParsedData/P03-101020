egard about 47,000 article alignments to be sufficiently large to be useful as a resource for NLP such as bilingual lexicon acquisition and for language education.
    In summary, AVSIM is more reliable than BM25 and corresponds well with human judgment.
    By using thresholds, we can extract about 47,000 article alignments which are estimated to be A or B evaluations.
    Sentence alignments in article alignments have many errors even if they have been obtained from correct article alignments due to free translation as discussed in Section 2.
    To extract only correct alignments, we sorted whole sentence alignments in whole article alignments in decreasing order of SntScore and selected only the higher ranked sentence alignments so that the selected alignments would be sufficiently precise to be useful as NLP resources.
    The number of whole sentence alignments was about 1,300,000.
    The most important category for sentence alignment is one-to-one.
    Thus, we want to discard as many errors in this c
