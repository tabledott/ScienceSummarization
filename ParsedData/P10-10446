his retains the class-based flavor of the problem, without the knowledge limitations of the explicit classbased approaches.
    Probably the closest to our work is a model proposed by Rooth et al. (1999), in which each class corresponds to a multinomial over relations and arguments and EM is used to learn the parameters of the model.
    In contrast, we use a LinkLDA framework in which each relation is associated with a corresponding multinomial distribution over classes, and each argument is drawn from a class-specific distribution over words; LinkLDA captures co-occurrence of classes in the two arguments.
    Additionally we perform full Bayesian inference using collapsed Gibbs sampling, in which parameters are integrated out (Griffiths and Steyvers, 2004).
    Recently, Bergsma et. al.
    (2008) proposed the first discriminative approach to selectional preferences.
    Their insight that pseudo-negative examples could be used as training data allows the application of an SVM classifier, which makes use of
