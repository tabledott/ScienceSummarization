    We have presented a novel statistical approach to semantic parsing in which a word-based alignment model is used for lexical learning, and the parsing model itself can be seen as a syntax-based translation model.
    Our method is like many phrasebased translation models, which require a simpler, word-based alignment model for the acquisition of a phrasal lexicon (Och and Ney, 2003).
    It is also similar to the hierarchical phrase-based model of Chiang (2005), in which hierarchical phrase pairs, essentially SCFG rules, are learned through the use of a simpler, phrase-based alignment model.
    Our work shows that ideas from compiler theory (SCFG) and machine translation (word alignment models) can be successfully applied to semantic parsing, a closelyrelated task whose goal is to translate a natural language into a formal language.
    Lexical learning requires word alignments that are phrasally coherent.
