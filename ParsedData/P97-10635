 u, because each token of u can co-occur with several differentv's.
    2We could just as easily use other symmetric &amp;quot;association&amp;quot; measures, such as 02 (Gale &amp; Church, 1991) or the Dice coefficient (Smadja, 1992). co-occur is called a direct association.
    Now, suppose that uk and uk&#177;i often co-occur within their language.
    Then vk and uk+i will also co-occur more often than expected by chance.
    The arrow connecting vk and uk&#177;i in Figure 1 represents an indirect association, since the association between vk and uk&#177;i arises only by virtue of the association between each of them and uk .
    Models of translational equivalence that are ignorant of indirect associations have &amp;quot;a tendency ... to be confused by collocates&amp;quot; (Dagan et al., 1993).
    Fortunately, indirect associations are usually not difficult to identify, because they tend to be weaker than the direct associations on which they are based (Melamed, 1996c).
    The majority of indirect ass
