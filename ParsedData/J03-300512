hat are neither preceded nor succeeded by another noun.
    Lauer&#8217;s heuristic (see (1)) effectively avoids identifying as two-word compounds noun sequences that are part of a larger compound.
    Here, w1 w2 w3 w4 denotes the occurrence of a sequence of four words and N is the set of words tagged as nouns in the corpus.
    C is the set of compounds identified by Lauer&#8217;s (1995) heuristic.
    Verb-object bigrams for the 30 preselected verbs were obtained from the BNC using Cass (Abney 1996), a robust chunk parser designed for the shallow analysis of noisy text.
    The parser recognizes chunks and simplex clauses (i.e., sequences of nonrecursive clauses) using a regular expression grammar and a part-of-speech-tagged corpus, without attempting to resolve attachment ambiguities.
    It comes with a largescale grammar for English and a built-in tool that extracts predicate-argument tuples out of the parse trees that Cass produces.
    The parser&#8217;s output was postprocessed to remove bracketing e
