malisms can impose between paths.
    These two properties of the tree sets are not only linguistically relevant, but also have computational importance.
    By considering derivation trees, and thus abstracting away from the details of the composition operation and the structures being manipulated, we are able to state the similarities and differences between the 'This work was partially supported by NSF grants MCS42-19116-CER, MCS82-07294 and DCR-84-10413, ARO grant DAA 29-84-9-0027, and DARPA grant N00014-85-K0018.

    It is striking that from this point of view many formalisms can be grouped together as having identically structured derivation tree sets.
    This suggests that by generalizing the notion of context-freeness in CFG's, we can define a class of grammatical formalisms that manipulate more complex structures.
    In this paper, we outline how such family of formalisms ca
