of cases.
    In addition, the effects are significantly influenced by two decisions that we have already discussed: (i) the information associated with each letter, and (ii) the decision as to whether to model suffix frequency based solely on signature-internal frequences, or based on frequency across the entire morphology.
    The greater the information associated with each letter, the more worthwhile morphology is (because maintaining multiple copies of nearly similar stems becomes increasingly costly and burdensome).
    When suffix frequencies (which are used to compute the compressed length of any analyzed word) are based on the frequency of the suffixes in the entire lexicon, rather than conditionally within the signature in question, the loss of a signature entails a hit on the compression of all other words in the lexicon that employed that suffix; hence triage is less dramatic under that modeling assumption.
    Consider the effect of this computation on the signatures produced from a 500,000word c
