r&#8221; to &#8220;sedan&#8221;), and word re-ordering of the hypothesis.
    Then in Fig.
    1 (d), a confusion network is constructed based on the aligned hypotheses, which consists of a sequence of sets in which each word is aligned to a list of alternative words (including null) in the same set.
    Then, a set of global and local features are used to decode the confusion network.
  
  
    In confusion-network-based system combination for SMT, a major difficulty is aligning hypotheses to the backbone.
    One possible statistical model for word alignment is the HMM, which has been widely used for bilingual word alignment (Vogel et al., 1996, Och and Ney, 2003).
    In this paper, we propose an indirect-HMM method for monolingual hypothesis alignment.
    Let denote the backbone, &#65533;' _ ( ,...,dj) a hypothesis to be aligned to e; , and the alignment that specifies the position of the backbone word aligned to each hypothesis word.
    We treat each word in the backbone as an HMM state and the words i
