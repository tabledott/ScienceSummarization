ide the query language: the useful premises will standardly all be statements, whilst the interesting theorems will standardly all be statements (though the language itself also allows the former to be derived as theorems and the latter to be used as premises).
    In view of this distinction, we shall sometimes refer to `=--' sentences as definitional and 4=' sentences as extensional.
    Throughout the examples in this paper, we shall use bold for nodes and roman for atoms.
    Bold italic and italic will be used for corresponding meta-notational variables.
    Variables such as N, P, L,G and V will be assumed to be typed (as nodes, paths, lvalues, gvalues and values respectively).
    We shall sometimes refer to atoms occurring in paths as attributes.
    The right-hand sides of extensional sentences are values, that is, simple atoms or lists of atoms/nested lists enclosed in (...).
    Lists are provided to allow the components of complex values to be specified independently (inherited from different plac
