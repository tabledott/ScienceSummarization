 over the edge labels by using only the edges that existed in the training corpus for a distinct head and child part-of-speech tag combination.The transition based parsers have a lower com plexity.
			Nevertheless, the reported run times inthe last shared tasks were similar to the maxi mum spanning tree parsers.
			For a transition based parser, Gesmundo et al (2009) reported run times between 2.2 days for English and 4.7 days forCzech for the joint training of syntactic and se mantic dependencies.
			The parsing times were about one word per second, which speeds upquickly with a smaller beam-size, although the ac curacy of the parser degrades a bit.
			Johansson and Nugues (2008) reported training times of 2.4 days for English with the high-order parsing algorithm of Carreras (2007).
	
	
			We built a baseline parser to measure the time usage.
			The baseline parser resembles the architec ture of McDonald and Pereira (2006).
			It consists of the second order parsing algorithm of Carreras(2007), the non-proj
