ting point for new applications.
    The modules are described in more detail in Section 4.
    Applications developed within GATE can be deployed outside its Graphical User Interface (GUI), using programmatic access via the GATE API (see http: //gat e . ac .uk).
    In addition, the reusable modules, the document and annotation model, and the visualisation components can all be used independently of the development environment.
    GATE components may be implemented by a variety of programming languages and databases, but in each case they are represented to the system as a Java class.
    This class may simply call the underlying program or provide an access layer to a database; alternatively it may implement the whole component.
    In the rest of this section, we show how the GATE infrastructure takes care of the resource discovery, loading, and execution, and briefly discuss data storage and visualisation.
    The title expresses succinctly the distinction made in GATE between data, algorithms, and ways
