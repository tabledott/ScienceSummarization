    The alignment in Figure 3 contains the three cepts The, poor, and don't have any money.
    When one or more of the French words is connected to no English words, we say that the ceptual scheme includes the empty cept and that each of these words has been generated by this empty cept.
    Formally, a cept is a subset of the positions in the English string together with the words occupying those positions.
    When we write the words that make up a cept, we sometimes affix a subscript to each one showing its position.
    The alignment in Figure 2 includes the cepts thei and 016 the7, but not the cepts of6 thei or the7.
    In (J'applaudis a la decision I 1(1) applaud(2) the(4) decision(5)), a is generated by the empty cept.
    Although the empty cept has no position, we place it by convention in position zero, and write it as eo.
    Thus, we may also write the previous alignment as (J'applaudis a la decision e0(3) 1(1) applaud(2) the(4) decision(5)).
    We denote the set of alignments of (fl e) by .,
