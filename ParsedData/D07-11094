ed by psychologistsand lexicographers to mimic the semantic organiza tion in the human mind, links ?synsets?
			(short forsynonym sets) with myriad connections.
			The spe cific relation we?re interested in, hyponomy, points from general concepts to more specific ones and is sometimes called the ?is-a?
			relationship.
			As first described by Abney and Light (1999), we imagine an agent who starts at synset [entity], which points to every noun in WORDNET 2.1 by some sequence of hyponomy relations, and then chooses the next node in its random walk from the hyponyms of its current position.
			The agent repeatsthis process until it reaches a leaf node, which corre sponds to a single word (each of the synset?s words are unique leaves of a synset in our construction).For an example of all the paths that might generate the word ?colt?
			see Figure 1.
			The WORDNET WALK is parameterized by a set of distributions over children for each synset s in WORDNET, ?s. Symbol Meaning K number of topics ?k,s multinomial pro
