			One source of constraint which our model stilldoes not explicitly capture is the first-order de pendency between alignment positions, as in theHMM model (Vogel et al, 1996) and IBM models 4+.
			The the-le error in Figure 1(c) is symp tomatic of this lack.
			In particular, it is a slightly better pair according to the Dice value than the correct the-les.
			However, the latter alignment has the advantage that major-grands follows it.
			To use this information source, we included a feature which gives the Dice value of the wordsfollowing the pair.4 We also added a word frequency feature whose value is the absolutedifference in log rank of the words, discourag ing very common words from translating to very rare ones.
			Finally, we threw in bilexical features of the pairs of top 5 non-punctuation words ineach language.5 This helped by removing spe cific common errors like the residual tendency for French de to mistakenly align to English the (the two most common wo
