meters.
    Its power lies in the ability to define a rich set of features over parsing decisions, as well as surface level features relative to these decisions.
    For instance, the system of McDonald et al. (2005a) incorporates features over the part of speech of words occurring between and around a possible head-dependent relation.
    These features are highly important to overall accuracy since they eliminate unlikely scenarios such as a preposition modifying a noun not directly to its left, or a noun modifying a verb with another verb occurring between them.
    We augmented this model to incorporate morphological features derived from each token.
    Consider a proposed dependency of a dependent xj on the head xi, each with morphological features Mj and Mi respectively.
    We then add to the representation of the edge: Mi as head features, Mj as dependent features, and also each conjunction of a feature from both sets.
    These features play the obvious role of explicitly modeling consistencies and
