the task can be performed quite quickly.
    For the original bracketing of the Treebank, annotators performed at 375&#8211;475 words per hour after a few weeks, and increased to about 1000 words per hour after gaining more experience (Marcus et al., 1993).
    For our annotation process, counting each word in every NP shown, our speed was around 800 words per hour.
    This figure is not unexpected, as the task was not large enough to get more than a month&#8217;s experience, and there is less structure to annotate.
  
  
    The annotation was performed by the first author.
    A second Computational Linguistics PhD student also annotated Section 23, allowing inter-annotator agreement, and the reliability of the annotations, to be measured.
    This also maximised the quality of the section used for parser testing.
    We measured the proportion of matching brackets and dependencies between annotators, shown in Table 1, both before and after they discussed cases of disagreement and revised their annotations
