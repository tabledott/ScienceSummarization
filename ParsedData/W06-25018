000 dimensions, once low frequency and stop words are removed.
    We chose the WordNet glosses as a corpus because we felt the glosses were likely to contain content rich terms that would distinguish between the various concepts more distinctly than would text drawn from a more generic corpus.
    However, in our future work we will experiment with other corpora as the source of first order context vectors, and other dictionaries as the source of glosses.
    The first order context vectors as well as the Gloss Vectors usually have a very large number of dimensions (usually tens of thousands) and it is not easy to visualize this space.
    Figure 2 attempts to illustrate these vectors in two dimensions.
    The words tennis and food are the dimensions of this 2dimensional space.
    We see that the first order context vector for serve is approximately halfway between tennis and food, since the word serve could mean to &#8220;serve the ball&#8221; in the context of tennis or could mean &#8220;to serve food&#8
