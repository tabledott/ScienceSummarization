elated with the relevant training texts.
    The patterns are ranked so that those most strongly associated with the domain appear at the top.
    Figure 1 shows the top 20 extraction patterns produced by AutoSlog-TS for the MUC-4 terrorism domain (MUC-4 Proceedings, 1992).
    The ranked list is then presented to a human to decide which patterns should be kept.
    For example, the pattern &amp;quot;&lt;subject&gt; exploded&amp;quot; should be retained because it is likely to extract relevant information about bombings.
    However, the pattern &amp;quot;&lt;subject&gt; said&amp;quot; should be discarded because it is not likely to extract information about terrorism and will probably extract a lot of irrelevant information.
    The human reviewer assigns a conceptual role to each accepted pattern to characterize its extractions.
    For example, the pattern &amp;quot;&lt;subject&gt; was murdered&amp;quot; would be assigned The extraction patterns learned by AutoSlog-TS (and AutoSlog) have two serious limita
