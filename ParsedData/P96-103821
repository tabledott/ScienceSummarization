d, while SCONT and SF appear to share prominence features in Table 5, Table 6 reveals differences between SCONT and SF in amount of f0 and db change.
    Thus, in addition to lending themselves to on-line processing, local measures may also capture valuable prominence cues to distinguish between segment-medial and segmentfinal phrases.
  
  
    Although this paper reports results from only a single speaker, the findings are promising.
    We have demonstrated that a theory-based method for discourse analysis can provide reliable segmentations of spontaneous as well as read speech.
    In addition, the availability of speech in the text-and-speech labeling method led to significantly higher reliability scores.
    The stronger correlations found for intonational features of the text-and-speech labelings suggest not only that discourse labelers make use of prosody in their analyses, but also that obtaining such data can lead to more robust modeling of the relationship between intonation and discourse structure
