  Measuring The Semantic Similarity Of Texts
  
    This paper presents a knowledge-based method for measuring the semanticsimilarity of texts.
    While there is a large body of previous work focused on finding the semantic similarity of concepts and words, the application of these wordoriented methods to text similarity has not been yet explored.
    In this paper, we introduce a method that combines wordto-word similarity metrics into a text-totext metric, and we show that this method outperforms the traditional text similarity metrics based on lexical matching.
  
  
    Measures of text similarity have been used for a long time in applications in natural language processing and related areas.
    One of the earliest applications of text similarity is perhaps the vectorial model in information retrieval, where the document most relevant to an input query is determined by ranking documents in a collection in reversed order of their similarity to the given query (Salton and Lesk, 1971).
