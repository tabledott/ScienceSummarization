enomenon is important because it helps break &amp;quot;the document boundary&amp;quot; by allowing a user to examine information about a particular entity from multiple text sources at the same time.
    In particular, resolving cross-document coreferences allows a user to identify trends and dependencies across documents.
    Cross-document coreference can also be used as the central tool for producing summaries from multiple documents, and for information fusion, both of which have been identified as advanced areas of research by the TIPSTER Phase III program.
    Cross-document coreference was also identified as one of the potential tasks for the Sixth Message Understanding Conference (MUC-6) but was not included as a formal task because it was considered too ambitious (Grishman 94).
    In this paper we describe a highly successful crossdocument coreference resolution algorithm which uses the Vector Space Model to resolve ambiguities between people having the same name.
    In addition, we also describe a
