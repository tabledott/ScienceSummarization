assigns a boundary under relatively narrow criteria.
    However, CA and PA rely on cues that are relevant at the local as well as the global level, and consequently assign boundaries more often.
    This leads to a preponderance of cases where PA and CA propose a boundary but where a majority of humans did not, category b from Table 2.
    High blowers precision, reflected in the low precision for CA and PA. We are optimistic that all three algorithms can be improved, for example, by discriminating among types of pauses, types of cue words, and features of referential NPs.
    We have enhanced RA with certain grammatical role features following (Passonneau, 1993b).
    In a preliminary experiment using boundaries from our first set of subjects (4 per narrative instead of 7), this increased both recall and precision by ^, 10%.
    The statistical results validate boundaries agreed on by a majority of subjects, but do not thereby invalidate boundaries proposed by only 1-3 subjects.
    We evaluate how performa
