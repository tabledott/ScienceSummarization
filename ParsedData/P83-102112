 unifier (Robinson, 1965) of the two literals concerned.
    The selected literal is said to instantiate C to or].
    For a reduction step, there is some clause C in the current state whose selected literal unifies with a unit clause from either the program or the current state.
    In this case, the derived clause is a(C1, where a is a most general unifier of the two literals concerned, and C' is C' minus its selected literal.
    Thus, the deriyed clause is just the resolvent of C with the unit clause and the latter is said to reduce C to a(C.I.
    Before a derived clause is added to the state, a check is made to see whether the derived clause is subsumed by any clause already in the state.
    If the derived clause is subsumed, it is not added to the state, and that inference step is said to be blocked.
    In the examples that follow, we assume that the selected literal in a derived clause is always the leftmost literal in the body.
    This choice is not optimal (Kowalski, 1980), but it is sufficient f
