our features, namely, SEMCLASS, PROPER_NAME, DEF_NP, and DEM_NP, are not used in the MUC-6 tree shown in Figure 2.
    Figure 7 shows the distribution of the test cases over the five positive leaf nodes of the MUC-6 tree.
    For example, about 66.3% of all Distribution of test examples from the 30 MUC-6 test documents for positive leaf nodes of the MUC-6 tree. the test examples that are classified positive go to the &amp;quot;If STR_MATCH&amp;quot; branch of the tree.
    Other baseline systems that are used are ONE_CHAIN, ONE_WRD, and HD_WRD (Cardie and Wagstaff 1999).
    For ONE_CHAIN, all markables formed one chain.
    In ONE_WRD, markables corefer if there is at least one common word.
    In HD_WRD, markables corefer if their head words are the same.
    The purpose of ONE-CHAIN is to determine the maximum recall our system is capable of.
    The recall level here indirectly measures how effective the noun phrase identification module is.
    Both ONE_WRD and HD_WRD are less stringent variations of STR
