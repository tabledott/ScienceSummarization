requency.
    In an extreme case, the function word the appears most frequently in English texts and would have the highest TF in the context of any W. In our HKStandard/Mingpao corpus, Hong Kong is the most frequent content word which appears everywhere.
    So in the flu example, we would like to reduce the significance of Hong Kong's TF while keeping that of virus.
    A common way to account for this difference is by using the inverse document frequency(IDF).
    Among the variants of IDF, we choose the following representation from (Jones, 1979):
  
  
    Next, a ranking algorithm is needed to match the unknown word vectors to their counterparts in the other language.
    A ranking algorithm selects the best target language candidate for a source language word according to direct comparison of some similarity measures (Frakes and Baeza-Yates, 1992).
    We modify the similarity measure proposed by (Salton and Buckley, 1988) into the following SO: where maxn = ni the maximum frequency of any word in the
