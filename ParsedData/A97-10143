tantial differences between existing models of constituent structure, the question arises of how the theory independencf requirement, can be satisfied.
    At, this point the importance of the underlying argument structure is emphasised (cf.
    (Lehmann et al., 1996), (Marcus et al., 1994), (Sampson, 1995)).
    Treebanks of the format, described in the above section have been designed for English.
    Therefore, the solutions they offer are not always optimal for other language types.
    As for free word order languages, the following features may cause problems: sition between the two poles.
    In light of these facts, serious difficulties can be expected arising from the structural component of the existing formalisms.
    Due to the frequency of discontinuous constituents in non-configurational languages, the filler-trace mechanism would be used very often, yielding syntactic trees fairly different from the underlying predicate-argument structures.
