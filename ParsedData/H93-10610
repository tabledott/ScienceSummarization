  Thus it can be viewed either as a corpus in which words have been tagged syntactically and semanti- cally, or as a lexicon in which example sentences can be found for many definitions.
  A semantic oncordance is being constructed to use  in studies of sense resolution in context (semantic disambigua- tion).
  The Brown Corpus is the text and WordNet is the lexicon.
  Semantic tags (pointers to WordNet synsets) are inserted in the text manually using an interface, ConText, that was designed to facili- tate the task.
  Another interface supports earches of the tagged text.
  Some practical uses for semantic oncordances are proposed.
