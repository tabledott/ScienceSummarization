 is gasolinel and is matched against the noun sense drink1, the object preference of the source drink1 (the verb sense).
    A semantic vector is produced.
    The relevant cell found in the noun sense drinkl is [animall, drinkl, drink1].
    Its match against [vehicle1, use2, gasolinel], a cell from gasolinel, is shown in the vector statement in Figure 18.
    The match is a sister match, indicating a relevant analogy.
    Now this is peculiar because &amp;quot;drinking gasoline&amp;quot; is anomalous, yet a relevant analogy has been found and this paper has argued that relevant analogies are special to metaphorical relations.
    One possible explanation is that differences exist between the recognition of metaphorical relations that concern agents and metaphorical relations that concern objects and other case roles.
    It may be that metaphorical relations are indicated by a relevant analogy, but only in selected circumstances.
    This needs further investigation.
