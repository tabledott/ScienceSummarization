he effectiveness of the proposed statistical model for SMS normalization and the impact of SMS normalization on MT.
    A set of 5000 parallel SMS messages, which consists of raw (un-normalized) SMS messages and reference messages manually prepared by two project members with inter-normalization agreement checked, was prepared for training and testing.
    For evaluation, we use IBM&#8217;s BLEU score (Papineni et al., 2002) to measure the performance of the SMS normalization.
    BLEU score measures the similarity between two sentences using n-gram statistics with a penalty for too short sentences, which is already widely-used in MT evaluation.
    The baseline experiment is to moderate the texts using a lingo dictionary comprises 142 normalization pairs, which is also used in bootstrapping the phrase alignment learning process.
    Table 5 compares the performance of the different setups of the baseline experiments.
    We first measure the complexity of the SMS normalization task by directly computing the
