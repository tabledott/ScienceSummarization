?i(w), ?j(w ?)) (8) where p(c, w, i) is the likelihood that word w is inits cluster i given context c, ?i(w) is the vector rep resenting the i-th cluster centroid of w, and d(v, v?)is a function computing similarity between two vectors, which can be any of the distance functions pre sented by Curran (2004).
			The similarity measure canbe computed in absence of context by assuming uni form p(c, w, i) over i.
	
	
			In this section, we first present a qualitative analysiscomparing the nearest neighbors of our model?s embeddings with those of others, showing our embed dings better capture the semantics of words, with the use of global context.
			Our model also improves thecorrelation with human judgments on a word simi larity task.
			Because word interpretation in context is important, we introduce a new dataset with humanjudgments on similarity of pairs of words in sentential context.
			Finally, we show that our model outper forms other methods on this dataset and also that themulti-prototype approach impro
