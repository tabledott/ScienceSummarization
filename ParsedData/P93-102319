o not occur in carefully written English (as is our test corpus of Associated Press news reports).
    In fact, during the analysis of the corpus for our test set of adjectives we found no erroneously identified pairs of adjectives; however, if the system is used with a less well written, or even spoken, corpus, the complete confidence in the adjective-adjective module may need to be reduced.
    This can be accomplished by taking into account the frequency of an adjective-adjective pair, and making our confidence an increasing function of this frequency.
    When new similarity modules, such as the ones discussed in Section 6, are added to the system, the above algorithm will be inadequate for combining their suggestions.
    We plan to extend the algorithm to compute an extended weighted average of the similarities and/or dissimilarities produced by these modules, and add a separate training component which will determine the appropriate value for the weight of each module.
    In stage four we form groups
