s in English: unergative, unaccusative, and object-drop verbs.
    (For the unergative/unaccusative distinction, see Perlmutter [1978]; Burzio [1986]; Levin and Rappaport Hovav [19951).
    Table 1 shows an example of a verb from each class in its transitive and intransitive usages.
    These three classes are motivated by theoretical linguistic properties (see discussion and references below, and in Stevenson and Merlo [1997b]; Merlo and Stevenson [2000b]).
    Furthermore, it appears that the classes capture typological distinctions that are useful for machine translation (for example, causative unergatives are ungrammatical in many languages), as well as processing distinctions that are useful for generating naturally occurring language (for example, reduced relatives with unergative verbs are awkward, but they are acceptable, and in fact often preferred to full relatives for unaccusative and object-drop verbs) (Stevenson and Merlo 1997b; Merlo and Stevenson 1998).
    The question then is what underlies t
