hed probability density function for each metric from the resulting histograms; the results obtained are shown in Figure 5 for F-measure and fallout using 9 clusters.
    We observed that the system's performance (indicated by a square in the diagrams) was significantly better than what we would expect under the null hypothesis of random performance; the probability of getting a better partition than the system's is extremely small for all metrics (no occurrence in 20,000 trials) except for fallout, for which a random system may be better 4.9% of the time.
    The estimated density functions also show that the metrics are severely constrained by the structure imposed by the clustering as they tend to peak at some point and then fall rapidly.
    Finally, we performed another study to quantify the impact of using negative knowledge obtained from adjective-adjective pairs.
    We ran our system in a mode where the suggestions of the adjectiveadjective module were ignored (i.e. stage three simply passed to the o
