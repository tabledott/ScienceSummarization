for each pair is taken as an estimate of the perceived similarity between the two words (e.g., car&#8211;automobile: 3.9, cord&#8211;smile: 0.0).
    Following the earlier literature, we use Pearson&#8217;s r to evaluate how well the cosines in the W1&#215;LW2 space between the nouns in each pair correlate with the ratings.
    The results (expressed in terms of percentage correlations) are presented in Table 4, which also reports state-of-the-art performance levels of corpus-based systems from the literature (the correlation of all systems with the ratings is very significantly above chance, according to a two-tailed t-test for Pearson correlation coefficients; df = 63, p &lt; 0.0001 for all systems).
    One of the DM models, namely TypeDM, does very well on this task, outperformed only by DoubleCheck, an unstructured system that relies on Web queries (and thus on a much larger corpus) and for which we report the best result across parameter settings.
    We also report the best results from a range of expe
