 model is nearer to our system (around 57-58%).
    The noisy-channel model typically returned longer compressions.
    Results are shown in Table 1.
    We present the average score over all judges as well as the standard deviation.
    The evaluation for the decision tree system of Knight and Marcu is strikingly similar to the original evaluation in their work.
    This provides strong evidence that the evaluation criteria in both cases were very similar.
    Table 1 shows that all models had similar compressions rates, with humans preferring to compress a little more aggressively.
    Not surprisingly, the human compressions are practically all grammatical.
    A quick scan of the evaluations shows that the few ungrammatical human compressions were for sentences that were not really grammatical in the first place.
    Of greater interest is that the compressions of our system are typically more grammatical than the decision tree model of Knight and Marcu.
    When looking at importance, we see that our sys
