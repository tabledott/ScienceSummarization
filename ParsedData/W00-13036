    C is the parameter that defines the balance of two quantities.
    If we make C larger, the more classification errors are neglected.
    Though we omit the details here, minimization of (7) is reduced to the problem to minimize the objective function (5) under the following constraints.
    Usually, the value of C is estimated experimentally.
    In general classification problems, there are cases in which it is unable to separate the training data linearly.
    In such cases, the training data could be separated linearly by expanding all combinations of features as new ones, and projecting them onto a higherdimensional space.
    However, such a naive approach requires enormous computational overhead.
    Let us consider the case where we project the training data x onto a higher-dimensional space by using projection function cio 1.
    As we pay attention to the objective function (5) and the decision function (6), these functions depend only on the dot products of the inp
