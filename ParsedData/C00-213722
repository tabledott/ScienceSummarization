n fbr precision and F -score A class of technique that ean handke all ldnds of flmetions of random variables without the above problenls is the computationally-intellsive ran- domization tests (Noreen, 1989, Ch.
  2) (Cohen, 1995, Sec.
  These tests have previously used on such flmctions during the "message un- derstanding" (MUC) evaluations (Chinchor et al., 1993).
  The randomization test we use is like a randomization version of the paired sample (matched-1)air) t test (Cohen, 1995, Sec.
  This is a type of stratified shuffling (Noreen, 198!
  When eomt)aring two tech- niques, we gather-u I) all the responses (whether actually of interest or not) produced by one of the two techniques when examining the test data, but not both techniques.
  Under the 111111 hyl)othesis , the two techniques are not really different, so any resl)onse produced by one of the teehniques eonld have just as likely come flom the other.
  So we shuffle these responses, reassign each response to one of the two tech- niques (equally l
