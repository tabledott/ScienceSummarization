 is used in the generalization procedure.
    For Table 1, the value of G2 is 3.8, and the value of X2 is 2.5.
    Assuming a level of significance of &#945; = 0.05, the critical value is 12.6 (for six degrees of freedom).
    Thus, for this &#945; value, the null hypothesis would not be rejected for either statistic, and the conclusion would be that there is no reason to suppose that p(run  |(canine), subj) is not a reasonable approximation of p(run  |(dog), subj).
    As a further example, Table 2 gives counts for the children of (liquid) in the object position of drink.
    Again, the counts have been obtained from a subset of the BNC using the system of Briscoe and Carroll.
    Not all the sets dominated by the children of (liquid) are shown, as some, such as (sheep dip), never appear in the object position of a verb in the data.
    This example is designed to show a case in which the null hypothesis is rejected.
    The value of G2 for this table is 29.0, and the value of X2 is 21.2.
    So for G2, even
