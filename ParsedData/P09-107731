results from the previous section show that classification of implicits benefits from information about nearby relations, and so we expected improvements using a sequence model, rather than classifying each relation independently.
    We trained a CRF classifier (Lafferty et al., 2001) over the sequence of implicit examples from all documents in sections 02 to 20.
    The test set is the same as used for the 2-way classifiers.
    We compare against a 6-way4 Naive Bayes classifier.
    Only word pairs were used as features for both.
    Overall 6-way prediction accuracy is 43.27% for the Naive Bayes model and 44.58% for the CRF model.
  
  
    We have presented the first study that predicts implicit discourse relations in a realistic setting (distinguishing a relation of interest from all others, where the relations occur in their natural distributions).
    Also unlike prior work, we separate the task from the easier task of explicit discourse prediction.
    Our experiments demonstrate that features develo
