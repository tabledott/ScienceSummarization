gorized into fields (e.g., Possessional, Identificational, Temporal, Locational, etc.).
  4 Example 1 The LCS representation f John went happily to school is [Event GOLoc ([Thing JOHN], [Path TOLoc ([Position ATLoc ([Thing JOHN], [Location SCHOOL])])] [M .
  HAPPILY])] This corresponds to the tree-like representation shown in Figure 3, in which (1) the logical head is GOLoc (of type Event); (2) the logical subject is JOHN (of type Thing); (3) the logical argument is TOcoc (of type Path); and (4) the logical modifier is HAPPILY (of type Manner).
  Note that the logical argument is itself a LCS that contains a logical argument, SCHOOL (of type Location), i.e., LCSs are recursively defined.
  The LCS representation is used both in the lexicon and in the interlingual repre- sentation.
  The former is identified as a root LCS (RLCS) and the latter is identified as a composed LCS (CLCS): Definition 2 A RLCS (i.e., a root LCS) is an uninstantiated LCS that is associated with a word definition in the lexicon (i.e., a
