the demonstration, in response to questions from the class.
    Since these graphical tools are included with the toolkit, they can also be used by students.
    This allows students to experiment at home with the algorithms that they have seen presented in class.
    The chart parsing tool is an example of a graphical tool provided by NLTK.
    This tool can be used to explain the basic concepts behind chart parsing, and to show how the algorithm works.
    Chart parsing is a flexible parsing algorithm that uses a data structure called a chart to record hypotheses about syntactic constituents.
    Each hypothesis is represented by a single edge on the chart.
    A set of rules determine when new edges can be added to the chart.
    This set of rules controls the overall behavior of the parser (e.g., whether it parses top-down or bottom-up).
    The chart parsing tool demonstrates the process of parsing a single sentence, with a given grammar and lexicon.
    Its display is divided into three sections: the bo
