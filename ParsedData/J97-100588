 Passonneau and Litman (1996).
    Finally, differences in segmentation may reflect different interpretations of the discourse, as we pointed out in Passonneau and Litman (1996), based on observations of our subjects' segment descriptions.
    The second part of our study (Section 4) concerned the algorithmic identification of segment boundaries based on various combinations of three types of linguistic input: referential noun phrases, cue phrases, and pauses.
    We first evaluated an initial set of three algorithms, each based on a single type of linguistic input, and their additive combinations.
    Our results showed that the algorithms performed quite differently from one another on boundaries identified by at least four subjects on a test set of 10 narratives from our corpus.
    In particular, the NP algorithm (which used three features) outperformed both the cue phrase and pause algorithms (each of which used only a single feature).
    While none of the algorithms approached human performance, the fa
