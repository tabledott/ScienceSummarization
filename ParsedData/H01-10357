trates six scenarios encountered when projecting POS tags from English to a language such as French.
  The first two show straightforward 1-to-1 projections, which are encoun- tered in roughly two-thirds of English words.
  Phrasal (1-to-N) alignments offer greater challenges, as typically only a subset of the aligned words accept the English tag.
