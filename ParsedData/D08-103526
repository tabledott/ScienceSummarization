00 iterations to a temperature of zero.
    The use of annealing to obtain a maximum a posteriori (MAP) configuration from sampling-based inference is common (e.g., Finkel 2005; Goldwater 2007).
    The total running time of our system is on the order of three minutes per document.
    Due to memory constraints, we divide the textbook dataset into ten parts, and perform inference in each part separately.
    We may achieve better results by performing inference over the entire dataset simultaneously, due to pooling counts for cue phrases across all documents.
    Baselines We compare against three competitive alternative systems from the literature: U&amp;I (Utiyama and Isahara, 2001); LCSEG (Galley et al., 2003); MCS (Malioutov and Barzilay, 2006).
    All three systems are described in the related work (Section 2).
    In all cases, we use the publicly available executables provided by the authors.
    Parameter settings For LCSEG, we use the parameter values specified in the paper (Galley et al., 2003).
