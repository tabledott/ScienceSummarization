  Dependency Treelet Translation: Syntactically Informed Phrasal SMT
  
    We describe a novel approach to statistical machine translation that combines syntactic information in the source language with recent advances in phrasal translation.
    This method requires a source-language dependency parser, target language word segmentation and an unsupervised word alignment component.
    We align a parallel corpus, project the source dependency parse onto the target sentence, extract dependency treelet translation pairs, and train a tree-based ordering model.
    We describe an efficient decoder and show that using these treebased models in combination with conventional SMT models provides a promising approach that incorporates the power of phrasal SMT with the linguistic generality available in a parser.
  
  
    Over the past decade, we have witnessed a revolution in the field of machine translation (MT) toward statistical or corpus-based methods.
    Yet despite this success, statistical machine translati
