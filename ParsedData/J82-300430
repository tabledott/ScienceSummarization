tructions, and we combine them in every possible way (convolution), the result is an &amp;quot;every way ambiguous&amp;quot; (Catalan) construction.
    With this observation, equation (24) reduces to: Hence the number of parses in the auxiliary-inverted case is the Catalan of one more than in the noninverted cases.
    As predicted, EQSP found the following inverted sentences to be more ambiguous than their non-inverted counterparts (previously discussed on page 142) by one Catalan number.
    11 Earley's algorithm and most other context-free parsing algorithms actually work this way.
    12 The proof immediately follows from the z-transform of the Catalan series (Knuth 1975, p. 388): zB(z) = B(z) &#8212; 1. of products.
    14 It was the number of products of products of products of products.
    How could this result be incorporated into the table lookup pseudo-parser?
    Recall that the pseudo-parser implements Catalan grammars by returning an index into the Catalan table.
    For example, if there were
