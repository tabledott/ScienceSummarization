atural language disambiguation.
    In particular, we study the problem of selection among confusable words, using orders of magnitude more training data than has ever been applied to this problem.
    First we show learning curves for four different machine learning algorithms.
    Next, we consider the efficacy of voting, sample selection and partially unsupervised learning with large training corpora, in hopes of being able to obtain the benefits that come from significantly larger training corpora without incurring too large a cost.
  
  
    Confusion set disambiguation is the problem of choosing the correct use of a word, given a set of words with which it is commonly confused.
    Example confusion sets include: {principle , principal}, {then, than}, {to,two,too}, and {weather,whether}.
    Numerous methods have been presented for confusable disambiguation.
    The more recent set of techniques includes multiplicative weightupdate algorithms (Golding and Roth, 1998), latent semantic analysis (Jones and
