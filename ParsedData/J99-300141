    Though inferables are often marked by definiteness, it is possible that they are indefinite, like an uncle in example (7b).
    With respect to inferables, there exist only a few computational treatments, all of which are limited in scope.
    We here restrict inferables to the particular subset defined by Hahn, Markert, and Strube (1996), which we call functional anaphora (FA).
    In the following, we will limit our discussion of inferables to those which figure as functional anaphors.
    In Table 10, we define the sets needed for the specification of the extended Cf ranking criteria in Table 11.
    We distinguish between three different sets of discourse entities; hearer-old discourse entities (OLD), mediated discourse entities (MED), and hearer-new discourse entities (NEW).
    Note that the antecedent of a functional anaphor (the inferred discourse entity) is included in the set of hearer-old discourse entities.
