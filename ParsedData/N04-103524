    In this section, we present some syntactic transformation rules that our system learns.
    Fox (2002) identified three major causes of crossings between English and French: the &#8220;ne ... pas&#8221; construct, modals and adverbs, which a child-reordering model doesn&#8217;t account for.
    In section 2, we have already explained how we learn syntactic rules involving &#8220;ne ... pas&#8221;.
    Here we describe the other two problematic cases.
    Figure 11 presents a frequent cause of crossings between English and French: adverbs in French often appear after the verb, which is less common in English.
    Parsers generally create nested verb phrases when adverbs are present, thus no child reordering can allow a verb and an adverb to be permuted.
    Multi-level reodering as the rule in the figure can prevent crossings.
    Fox&#8217;s solution to the problem of crossings is to flatten verb phrases.
    This is a solution for this sentence pair, since this accounts for adverb-verb re
