    Finding the answer to a question by returning a small fragment of a text, where the answer actually lies, is profoundly different from the task of information retrieval (IR) or information extraction (IE).
    Current IR systems allow us to locate full documents that might contain pertinent information, leaving it to the user to extract the answer from a ranked list of texts.
    In contrast, IE systems extract the information of interest, provided it has been presented in a predefined, target representation, known as template.
    The immediate solution of combining IR and IE techniques for question/answering (Q/A) is impractical since IE systems are known to be highly dependent on domain knowledge, and furthermore, the template generation is not performed automatically.
    Our methodology of
