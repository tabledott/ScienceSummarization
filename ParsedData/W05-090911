 based on surface forms was too &amp;quot;costly&amp;quot; in terms of the total number of crosses)* Note that METEOR is flexible in terms of the number of stages, the actual external mapping module used for each stage, and the order in which the stages are run* By default the first stage uses the &amp;quot;exact&amp;quot; mapping module, the second the &amp;quot;porter stem&amp;quot; module and the third the &amp;quot;WN synonymy&amp;quot; mo dule* In section 4 we evaluate each of these configurations of METEOR* Once all the stages have been run and a final alignment has been produced between the system translation and the reference translation, the METEOR score for this pair of translations is computed as follows* First unigram precision (P) is computed as the ratio of the number of unigrams in the system translation that are mapped (to unigrams in the reference translation) to the total number of unigrams in the system translation* Similarly, unigram recall (R) is computed as the ratio of the number of uni
