86 lexical category types in sections 02&#8211;21.
    Figure 4 examines the growth of the number of lexical category types as a function of the amount of data translated into CCG.
    The log&#8211;log plot The growth of lexical category types and rule instantiations (sections 02&#8211;21).
    A log&#8211;log plot of the rank order and frequency of the lexical category types (left) and instantiations of combinatory rules (right) in CCGbank. of the rank order and frequency of the lexical categories in Figure 5 indicates that the underlying distribution is roughly Zipfian, with a small number of very frequent categories and a long tail of rare categories.
    We note 439 categories that occur only once, and only 556 categories occur five times or more.
    Inspection suggests that although some of the category types that occur only once are due to noise or annotation errors, most are correct and are in fact required for certain constructions.
    Typical examples of rare but correct and necessary categories a
