is chosen as an argument (for example, deal from the &#8220;made a deal with&#8221; sentence).
    Because of the feature sets utilized in previous work, the learned extractors ignore both &#8220;holistic&#8221; aspects of the relation phrase (e.g., is it contiguous?) as well as lexical aspects (e.g., how many instances of this relation are there?).
    Thus, as we show in Section 5, systems such as TEXTRUNNER are unable to learn the constraints embedded in REVERB.
    Of course, a learning system, utilizing a different hypothesis space, and an appropriate set of training examples, could potentially learn and refine the constraints in REVERB.
    This is a topic for future work, which we consider in Section 6.
    The first Open IE system was TEXTRUNNER (Banko et al., 2007), which used a Naive Bayes model with unlexicalized POS and NP-chunk features, trained using examples heuristically generated from the Penn Treebank.
    Subsequent work showed that utilizing a linear-chain CRF (Banko and Etzioni, 2008) or
