enforcing the non-overlapping constraint.
    When labeling parse tree nodes, previous work has either used greedy algorithms to find a non-overlapping assignment, or the general-purpose ILP approach of Punyakanok et al. (2004).
    For labeling chunks an exact algorithm based on shortest paths was proposed in Punyakanok and Roth (2001).
    Its complexity is quadratic in the length of the sentence.
    Here we describe a faster exact dynamic programming algorithm to find the most likely non-overlapping (consistent) labeling of all nodes in the parse tree, according to a product of probabilities from local models, as in Equation (2).
    For simplicity, we describe the dynamic program for the case where only two classes are possible: ARG and NONE.
    The generalization to more classes is straightforward.
    Intuitively, the algorithm is similar to the Viterbi algorithm for context-free grammars, because we can describe the non-overlapping constraint by a &#8220;grammar&#8221; that disallows ARG nodes having
