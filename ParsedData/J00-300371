e n-gram).
    Further research within this framework can be characterized by which of these simplifications are addressed.
    Dialogue grammars for conversational speech need to be made more aware of the temporal properties of utterances.
    For example, we are currently not modeling the fact that utterances by the conversants may actually overlap (e.g., backchannels interrupting an ongoing utterance).
    In addition, we should model more of the nonlocal aspects of discourse structure, despite our negative results so far.
    For example, a context-free discourse grammar could potentially account for the nested structures proposed in Grosz and Sidner (1986).'
    The standard n-gram models for DA discrimination with lexical cues are probably suboptimal for this task, simply because they are trained in the maximum likelihood framework, without explicitly optimizing discrimination between DA types.
    This may be overcome by using discriminative training procedures (Warnke et al. 1999; Ohler, Harbeck, and
