    First, a discourse relation recognizer would enable the development of improved discourse parsers and, consequently, of high performance single document summarizers (Marcu, 2000).
    In multidocument summarization (DUC, 2002), it would enable the development of summarization programs capable of identifying contradictory statements both within and across documents and of producing summaries that reflect not only the similarities between various documents, but also their differences.
    In question-answering, it would enable the development of systems capable of answering sophisticated, non-factoid queries, such as &#8220;what were the causes ofX?&#8221; or &#8220;what contradicts Y?&#8221;, which are beyond the state of the art of current systems (TREC, 2001).
    In this paper, we describe experiments aimed at building robust discourse-relation classification systems.
    To build such systems, we train a family of Naive Bayes classifiers on a large set of examples that are generated automatica
