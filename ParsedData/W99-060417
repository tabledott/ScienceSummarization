thereby obtaining slightly improved alignments.
    2.
    For each translation direction we calculate the Viterbi-alignment of the translation models determined in the previous step.
    Thus we get two alignment vectors crj1. and bf for each sentence.
    We increase the quality of the alignments by combining the two alignment vectors into one alignment matrix using the following method.
    A1 = {(aj , j)lj = 1 .
    .
    .
    J} and A2 = {(i,bi)li = 1 ... /} denote the set of links in the two Viterbi-alignments.
    In a first step the intersection A = A1 n A2 is determined.
    The elements within A are justified by both Viterbi-alignments and are therefore very reliable.
    We now extend the alignment A iteratively by adding links (i, j) occurring only in A1 or in A2 if they have a neighbouring link already in A or if neither the word fi nor the word ei are aligned in A.
    The alignment (i, j) has the neighbouring links (i &#8212; 1,j), (i, j &#8212; 1), (i + 1,j), and (i, j + 1).
