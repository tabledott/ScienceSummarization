e TypeDM is below the other models (Q = 0.19, df = 0.67, p = 0.50).
    On the Pad&#180;o data set, on the other hand, where TypeDM outperforms the other DM models, the same difference is highly significant (Q = 12.70, df = 1.00, p &lt; 0.001).
    As a final remark on the W1&#215;LW2 space, we can notice that DM models perform very well in tasks involving attributional similarity.
    The performance of unstructured DSMs (including Win, our own implementation of this type of model) is also high, sometimes even better than that of structured DSMs.
    However, our best DM model also achieves brilliant results in capturing selectional preferences, a task that is not directly addressable by unstructured DSMs.
    This fact suggests that the real advantage provided by structured DSMs&#8212;particularly when linguistic structure is suitably exploited, as with the DM third-order tensor&#8212;actually resides in their versatility in addressing a much larger and various range of semantic tasks.
