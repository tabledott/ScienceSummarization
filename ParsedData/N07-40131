lations and objects using large sets of extractions.
    We have built a fast user interface for querying the results.
  
  
    The bulk of previous information extraction work uses hand-labeled data or hand-crafted patterns to enable relation-specific extraction (e.g., (Culotta et al., 2006)).
    OIE seeks to avoid these requirements for human input.
    Shinyama and Sekine (Shinyama and Sekine, 2006) describe an approach to &#8220;unrestricted relation discovery&#8221; that does away with many of the requirements for human input.
    However, it requires clustering of the documents used for extraction, and thus scales in quadratic time in the number of documents.
    It does not scale to the size of the Web.
    For a full discussion of previous work, please see (Banko et al., 2007), or see (Yates and Etzioni, 2007) for work relating to synonym resolution.
  
  
    OIE presents significant new challenges for information extraction systems, including Automation of relation extraction, which in traditional
