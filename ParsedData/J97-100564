al NP with an NP in the preceding FICU (from phrase 23.2).
    Table 4 shows the average performance of the referring expression algorithm (row labeled NP) on the four measures we use here.
    Recall is .50 (a = .17; max = .71; min = .18), precision is .31 (a = .097; max = .50; min = .20), fallout is .15 (a = .06; max -= .27; min = .07) and error rate is 0.19 (a = .06; max -= .31; min = .12).
    Recall is worse than PAUSE, CUE and human performance, and precision is better than PAUSE and CUE but worse than human performance.
    Note that the error rate and fallout, which in a sense are more robust measures of inaccuracy than precision, are both much better than CUE and PAUSE.
    4.2.4 Additive Algorithms.
    We report here evaluation of a simple additive method for combining the three algorithms described above.
    That is, a boundary is proposed if some combination of the algorithms proposed a boundary.
    We tested all pairwise combinations, and the combination of all three algorithms, as shown in Ta
