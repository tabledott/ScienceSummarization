;quot;supertagging&amp;quot; (Clark, 2002) and chunking (Koeling, 2000).
    Generalised Iterative Scaling (GIS) is a very simple algorithm for estimating the parameters of a ME model.
    The original formulation of GIS (Darroch and Ratcliff, 1972) required the sum of the feature values for each event to be constant.
    Since this is not the case for many applications, the standard method is to add a &amp;quot;correction&amp;quot;, or &amp;quot;slack&amp;quot;, feature to each event Improved Iterative Scaling (us) (Berger et al., 1996; Della Pietra et al., 1997) eliminated the correction feature to improve the convergence rate of the algorithm.
    However, the extra book keeping required for us means that GIS is often faster in practice (Malouf, 2002).
    This paper shows, by a simple adaptation of Berger's proof for the convergence of HS (Berger, 1997), that GIS does not require a correction feature.
    We also investigate how the use of a correction feature affects the performance of ME taggers.
