  Learning Dependency-Based Compositional Semantics
  
    Compositional question answering begins by mapping questions to logical forms, but training a semantic parser to perform this mapping typically requires the costly annotation of the target logical forms.
    In this paper, we learn to map questions to answers via latent logical forms, which are induced automatically from question-answer pairs.
    In tackling this challenging learning problem, we introduce a new semantic representation which highlights a parallel between dependency syntax and efficient evaluation of logical forms.
    On two stansemantic parsing benchmarks our system obtains the highest published accuracies, despite requiring no annotated logical forms.

    Answering these types of complex questions compositionally involves first mapping the questions into logical forms (semantic parsing).
