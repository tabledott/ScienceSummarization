has +govern attribute, then non-head sources of the item and their sources are governed by the head of the item if there are paths between them and the item satisfying the conditions: Movement :3 Movement is a major source of complexity in principle-based parsing.
    Directly modeling Move-a would obviously generate a large number of invalid movements.
    Fortunately, movements must also satisfy: c-command condition: A moved element must ccommand its trace (Radford, 1988, p.564), where A c-command B if A does not dominate B but the parent of A dominates B.
    The c-command condition implies that a movement consists of a sequence of moves in the reverse direction of dominance links, except the last one.
    Therefore, we can model a movement with a set of attribute values.
    If an item contains these attribute values, it means that there is a movement out of the structure represented by the item.
    For example, in Figure 2.b, item i10 contains movement attributes: nppg , npbarrier and np-atts.
