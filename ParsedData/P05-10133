 that it rules out perfect accuracy even as an asymptotic goal.
    There exist a few robust broad-coverage parsers that produce non-projective dependency structures, notably Tapanainen and J&#168;arvinen (1997) and Wang and Harper (2004) for English, Foth et al. (2004) for German, and Holan (2004) for Czech.
    In addition, there are several approaches to non-projective dependency parsing that are still to be evaluated in the large (Covington, 1990; Kahane et al., 1998; Duchier and Debusmann, 2001; Holan et al., 2001; Hellwig, 2003).
    Finally, since non-projective constructions often involve long-distance dependencies, the problem is closely related to the recovery of empty categories and non-local dependencies in constituency-based parsing (Johnson, 2002; Dienes and Dubey, 2003; Jijkoun and de Rijke, 2004; Cahill et al., 2004; Levy and Manning, 2004; Campbell, 2004).
    In this paper, we show how non-projective dependency parsing can be achieved by combining a datadriven projective parser with special
