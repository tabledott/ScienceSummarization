ble sense distinctions.
			The aim of this task was to explicitly tackle the granularity issue and study the performance of WSD systems on an all-words basis when a coarser set of senses is provided for the target words.
			Given the need of the NLP community to work on freelyavailable resources, the solution of adopting a dif ferent computational lexicon is not viable.
			On the other hand, the production of a coarse-grained sense inventory is not a simple task.
			The main issue is certainly the subjectivity of sense clusters.
			To overcome this problem, different strategies can be adopted.
			For instance, in the OntoNotes project (Hovy et al, 2006) senses are grouped until a 90% inter-annotator agreement is achieved.
			In contrast, as we describe in this paper, our approach is based on a mapping to a previously existing inventory which encodes sense distinctions at different levelsof granularity, thus allowing to induce a sense clus tering for the mapped senses.We would like to mention that another SemE
