 the following extraction algorithm: We check whether a candidate relation phrase r&#8222; satisfies the syntactic constraint by matching it against the regular expression in Figure 1.
    To determine whether r&#8222; satisfies the lexical constraint, we use a large dictionary D of relation phrases that are known to take many distinct arguments.
    In an offline step, we construct D by finding all matches of the POS pattern in a corpus of 500 million Web sentences.
    For each matching relation phrase, we heuristically identify its arguments (as in Step 2 above).
    We set D to be the set of all relation phrases that take at least k distinct argument pairs in the set of extractions.
    In order to allow for minor variations in relation phrases, we normalize each relation phrase by removing inflection, auxiliary verbs, adjectives, and adverbs.
    Based on experiments on a held-out set of sentences, we found that a value of k = 20 works well for filtering out overspecified relations.
    This results in a
