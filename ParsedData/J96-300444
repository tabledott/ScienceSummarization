 names than others: in our corpora, many names are picked from the GRASS class but very few from the SICKNESS class.
    Other good classes include JADE and GOLD; other bad classes are DEATH and RAT.
    We can better predict the probability of an unseen hanzi occurring in a name by computing a within-class Good-Turing estimate for each radical class.
    Assuming unseen objects within each class are equiprobable, their probabilities are given by the Good-Turing theorem as: where Kis is the probability of one unseen hanzi in class cls, E(nVs) is the expected number of hanzi in cls seen once, N is the total number of hanzi, and E(N1) is the expected number of unseen hanzi in class cls.
    The use of the Good-Turing equation presumes suitable estimates of the unknown expectations it requires.
    In the denomi11 We have two such lists, one containing about 17,000 full names, and another containing frequencies of hanzi in the various name positions, derived from a million names.
