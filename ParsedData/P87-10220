  A Centering Approach To Pronouns
  
    In this paper we present a formalization of the centering approach to modeling attentional structure in discourse and use it as the basis for an algorithm to track discourse context and bind pronouns.
    As described in [GJW86], the process of centering attention on entities in the discourse gives rise to the intersentential states of, retaining shiftpropose an extension to these states which handles some additional cases of multiple ambiguous pronouns.
    The algorithm has been implemented in an HPSG natural language system which serves as the interface to a database query application.
  
  
    In the approach to discourse structure developed in [Sid83] and [GJW86], a discourse exhibits both global and local coherence.
    On this view, a key element of local coherence is centering, a system of rules and constraints that govern the relationship between what the discourse is about and some of the linguistic choices made by the discourse participants, e.g. choice o
