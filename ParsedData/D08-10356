ised cohesion-based approaches can be characterized in terms of the metric used to quantify cohesion and the search technique.
    Galley et al. (2003) characterize cohesion in terms of lexical chains &#8211; repetitions of a given lexical item over some fixed-length window of sentences.
    In their unsupervised model, inference is performed by selecting segmentation points at the local maxima of the cohesion function.
    Malioutov and Barzilay (2006) optimize a normalized minimum-cut criteria based on a variation of the cosine similarity between sentences.
    Most similar to our work is the approach of Utiyama and Isahara (2001), who search for segmentations with compact language models; as shown in Section 3.1.1, this can be viewed as a special case of our model.
    Both of these last two systems use dynamic programming to search the space of segmentations.
    An alternative Bayesian approach to segmentation was proposed by Purver et al. (2006).
    They assume a set of documents that is characterized
