 non-relevant patterns which will degrade its precision.
    Scenarios may be represented with different density within the corpus, and may be learned at different rates.
    To account for this, we introduce a parameter, : rather than acquiring a single pattern on each iteration, each learner may acquire up to patterns (3 in this paper), as long as their scores are near (within 5% of) the top-scoring pattern.
  
  
    We tested the algorithm on documents from the Wall Street Journal (WSJ).
    The training corpus consisted of 15,000 articles from 3 months between 1992 and We used the scenarios shown in Table 1 to compete with each other in different combinations.
    The seed patterns for the scenarios, and the number of documents initially picked up by the seeds are shown in the table.2 The seeds were kept small, and they yielded high precision; it is evident that these scenarios are represented to a varying degree within the corpus.
    We also introduced an additional &#8220;negative&#8221; scenario (the
