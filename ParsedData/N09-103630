t sampling adaptor hyperparameters is feasible, and demonstrated that this improves word segmentation accuracy of the collocation-syllable adaptor grammar by almost 10%, corresponding to an error reduction of over 35% compared to the best results presented in Johnson (2008).
    We also described and investigated table label resampling, which dramatically improves the effectiveness of Gibbs sampling estimators for complex adaptor grammars, and makes it possible to work with adaptor grammars with complex hierarchical structure.
  
  
    We thank Erik Sudderth for suggesting sampling the Pitman-Yor hyperparameters and the ACL reviewers for their insightful comments.
