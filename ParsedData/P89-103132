uccessful operation of discourse modules.
    The percent of successes that both algorithms get indicates that syntax has a strong influence, and that at the very least we can reduce the amount of inference required.
    In 59% to 82% of the cases both algorithms get the correct result.
    This probably means that in a large number of cases there was no potential conflict of co-specifiers.
    In addition, this analysis has shown, that at least for task-oriented dialogues global focus is a significant factor, and in general discourse structure is more important in the task dialogues.
    However simple devices such as cue words may go a long way toward determining this structure.
    Finally, we should note that doing evaluations such as this allows us to determine the GENERALITY of our approaches.
    Since the performance of both Hobbs and BFP varies according to the type of the text, and in fact was significantly worse on the task dialogues than on the texts, we might question how their performance would
