r a simple context restriction rule are then modeled by the following relation: Restrict ( r, A, p) = IPS-then-P(7* A, 7-71*) n 'PP-then-S(7*r, pe) The first component ensures that 7- is always preceded by A, and the second guarantees that it is always followed by p. A compound context restriction rule of the form is satisfied if all instances of T are surrounded by substrings meeting the conditions of at least one of the context pairs independently.
    A candidate model for this disjunctive interpretation is the relation This is incorrect, however, because the scope of the union is too wide.
    It specifies that there must be some k such that every occurrence of T will be surrounded by Ak-pk, whereas the desired interpretation is that each 7 must be surrounded by Ak-pk, but a different k might be chosen for each occurrence.
    A better approximation is the relation Because of the outer Kleene * iteration, different instances of the rule can apply at different string-pair positions.
    But this also has a
