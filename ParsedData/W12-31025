As in past years we provided parallel corpora to train translation models, monolingual corpora to train language models, and development sets to tune system parameters.
    Some statistics about the training materials are given in Figure 1.
    We received submissions from 34 groups across 18 institutions.
    The participants are listed in Table 1.
    We also included two commercial off-the-shelf MT systems, three online statistical MT systems, and three online rule-based MT systems.
    Not all systems supported all language pairs.
    We note that the eight companies that developed these systems did not submit entries themselves, but were instead gathered by translating the test data via their interfaces (web or PC).4 They are therefore anonymized in this paper.
    The data used to construct these systems is not subject to the same constraints as the shared task participants.
    It is possible that part of the reference translations that were taken from online news sites could have been included in the
