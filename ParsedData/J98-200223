 its calculation can be performed independently for each subtree.
    As for the parameter description length for a subtree, it depends only on the number of classes in the tree cut within that subtree, and hence can be computed independently as well.
    The formal proof proceeds by mathematical induction, which verifies that the optimal model in any (sub)tree is either the model consisting of the root of the tree or the model obtained by appending the optimal submodels for its child subtrees.7 When a discrete model (a partition F of the set of nouns AT in our present context) is fixed, and the estimation problem involves only the estimation of probability parameters, the classic maximum-likelihood estimation (MLE) is known to be satisfactory.
    In particular, the estimation of a word-based model is one such problem, since the partition is fixed and the size of the partition equals 1./V-1.
    Furthermore, for a fixed discrete model, it is known that MLE coincides with MDL: Given data S {x1 : i = 1,. .
