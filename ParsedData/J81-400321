marker', at the node marked (*) in the figure.
    One can say that the left extraposition has been &amp;quot;reversed&amp;quot; in the derivation by the use of this rule, which may be looked at as repositioning 'trace' to the right, thus &amp;quot;reversing&amp;quot; the extraposition of the original sentence.
    In the rest of this paper, I often refer to a constituent being repositioned into a bracketed string (or into a fragment of derivation graph), to mean that a rule having that constituent as a non-leading symbol in the left-hand side has been applied, and the symbol matches some symbol in the string (or corresponds to some edge in the fragment).
    For example, in Figure 8.2 the trace T is repositioned into the subgraph with root In the example of Figure 8.2, there is only one application of a non-DCG rule, at the place marked (*).
    However, we have seen that when a derivation contains several applications of such rules, the applications must obey the bracketing constraint.
