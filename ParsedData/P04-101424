inst Hockenmaier&#8217;s gives an F-score of over 97%, showing the test sets to be very similar.
    The results show that our parser is performing significantly better than that of Clark et al., demonstrating the benefit of derivation features and the use of a sound statistical model.
    The results given so far have all used gold standard POS tags from CCGbank.
    Table 3 also gives the results if automatically assigned POS tags are used in the training and testing phases, using the C&amp;C POS tagger (Curran and Clark, 2003).
    The performance reduction is expected given that the supertagger relies heavily on POS tags as features.
    More investigation is needed to properly compare our parser and Hockenmaier&#8217;s, since there are a number of differences in addition to the models used: Hockenmaier effectively reads a lexicalised PCFG off CCGbank, and is able to use all of the available training data; Hockenmaier does not use a supertagger, but does use a beam search.
