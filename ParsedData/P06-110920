 an average f-score of 64.7%.
    The difference in accuracy between UMLDOP and ML-PCFG was statistically significant according to paired t-testing (p&#8804;0.05).
    To the best of our knowledge this means that we have shown for the first time that an unsupervised parsing model (UML-DOP) outperforms a widely used supervised parsing model (a treebank PCFG) on the WSJ40.
    We should keep in mind that (1) a treebank PCFG is not state-of-the-art: its performance is mediocre compared to e.g.
    Bod (2003) or McClosky et al. (2006), and (2) that our treebank PCFG is binarized as in Klein and Manning (2005) to make results comparable.
    To be sure, the unbinarized version of the treebank PCFG obtains 89.0% average f-score on WSJ10 and 72.3% average f-score on WSJ40.
    Remember that the Penn Treebank annotations are often exceedingly flat, and many branches have arity larger than two.
    It would be interesting to see how UML-DOP performs if we also accept ternary (and wider) branches -- though the total nu
