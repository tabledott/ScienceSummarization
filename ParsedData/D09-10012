same logical form, etc.).
    This in turn allows it to correctly answer many more questions than systems based on TextRunner (Banko et al., 2007) and DIRT (Lin and Pantel, 2001).
    We begin by reviewing the necessary background on semantic parsing and Markov logic.
    We then describe our Markov logic network for unsupervised semantic parsing, and the learning and inference algorithms we used.
    Finally, we present our experiments and results.
  
  
    The standard language for formal meaning representation is first-order logic.
    A term is any expression representing an object in the domain.
    An atomic formula or atom is a predicate symbol applied to a tuple of terms.
    Formulas are recursively constructed from atomic formulas using logical connectives and quantifiers.
    A lexical entry defines the logical form for a lexical item (e.g., a word).
    The semantic parse of a sentence is derived by starting with logical forms in the lexical entries and recursively composing the meaning of larger
