proper nouns and is shown to improve performance.
    These methods, however, no longer produce the generalized class for an argument.
    In this paper we describe a novel approach to computing selectional preferences by making use of unsupervised topic models.
    Our approach is able to combine benefits of both kinds of methods: it retains the generalization and humaninterpretability of class-based approaches and is also competitive with the direct methods on predictive tasks.
    Unsupervised topic models, such as latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) (Blei et al., 2003) and its variants are characterized by a set of hidden topics, which represent the underlying semantic structure of a document collection.
    For our problem these topics offer an intuitive interpretation &#8211; they represent the (latent) set of classes that store the preferences for the different relations.
    Thus, topic models are a natural fit for modeling our relation data.
    In particular, our system, called LDA-SP, uses LinkLDA (E
