s in the lattice.
    In the final step, the consensus translation is extracted as the best path from the union of confusion networks.
    Note that the extracted consensus translation can be different from the original M translations.
    Alternatively, the N-best hypotheses can be extracted for rescoring by additional models.
    We performed experiments with both approaches.
    Since M confusion networks are used, the lattice may contain two best paths with the same probability, the same words, but different word order.
    We extended the algorithm to favor more well-formed word sequences.
    We assign a higher probability to each arc of the primary (unreordered) translation in each of the M confusion networks.
    Experimentally, this extension improved translation fluency on some tasks.
  
  
    The alignment and voting algorithm was evaluated on both small and large vocabulary tasks.
    Initial experiments were performed on the IWSLT 2004 Chinese-English and Japanese-English tasks (Akiba et al., 20
