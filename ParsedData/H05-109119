ser also outputs a list of dependen cies, with each dependency represented as a 4-tuple ?f, a, wf , wa?, where f is the syntactic category of the functor, a is the argument number, wf is the head word of the functor, and wa is the head word of theargument.
			For example, the three functional appli cations from Table 3 result in the functor-argument dependencies enumerated below in Table 4.

			Because predicates (e.g. ?seized?)
			and adjuncts(e.g. ?several?)
			are always represented as functors, while complements (e.g. ?protesters?
			and ?sta tions?)
			are always represented as arguments, it isstraightforward to transform a functor-argument de pendency into a head-modifier dependency.
			The head-modifier dependencies corresponding to the three functor-argument dependencies in Table 4 are:?protesters ?
