ng 28,449 word tokens.
    The test set is extracted from 20001115_AFP_ARB.0060.xml.txt through 20001115_AFP_ARB.0236.xml.txt of the LDC Arabic Treebank: Part 1 v 2.0 Corpus.
    Impact of the core algorithm and the unsupervised stem acquisition has been measured on segmenters developed from 4 different sizes of manually segmented seed corpora: 10K, 20K, 40K, and 110K words.
    The experimental results are shown in Table 5.
    The baseline performances are obtained by assigning each token the most frequently occurring segmentation in the manually segmented training corpus.
    The column headed by '3-gram LM' indicates the impact of the segmenter using only trigram language model probabilities for decoding.
    Regardless of the manually segmented training corpus size, use of trigram language model probabilities reduces the word error rate of the corresponding baseline by approximately 50%.
    The column headed by '3-gram LM + PS Filter' indicates the impact of the core algorithm plus Prefix-Suffix Filter
