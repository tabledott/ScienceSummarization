    For example, Landauer and Dumais (1997) apply SVD to a matrix of 30,473 columns by 60,768 rows, but our matrix here is 8,000 columns by 17,232 rows.
    We are currently gathering more SAT questions to test this hypothesis.
    Without synonyms (compare column 1 to 3 in Table 17), recall drops significantly (from 56.1% to 49.5%), but the drop in precision is not significant.
    When the synonym component is dropped, the number of skipped questions rises from 4 to 22, which demonstrates the value of the synonym component of LRA for compensating for sparse data.
    When both SVD and synonyms are dropped (compare column 1 to 4 in Table 17), the decrease in recall is significant, but the decrease in precision is not significant.
    Again, we believe that a larger sample size would show that the drop in precision is significant.
    If we eliminate both synonyms and SVD from LRA, all that distinguishes LRA from VSM-WMTS is the patterns (step 4).
    The VSM approach uses a fixed list of 64 patterns t
