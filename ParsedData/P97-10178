 would look a bit different.
    It would prefer exactly those strings which are actually grist for Japanese transliterators.
    For example, people rarely transliterate auxiliary verbs, but surnames are often transliterated.
    We have approximated such a model by removing high-frequency words like has, an, are, am, were, them, and does, plus unlikely words corresponding to Japanese sound bites, like coup and oh.
    We also built a separate word sequence model containing only English first and last names.
    If we know (from context) that the transliterated phrase is a personal name, this model is more precise.
    The next WFST converts English word sequences into English sound sequences.
    We use the English phoneme inventory from the online CMU Pronunciation Dictionary,3 minus the stress marks.
    This gives a total of 40 sounds, including 14 vowel sounds (e.g., AA, AE, UW), 25 consonant sounds (e.g., K, MB, P.), plus our special symbol (PAUSE).
    The dictionary has pronunciations for 110,000 wor
