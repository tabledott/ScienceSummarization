er of sentences in the bag X that contain the word w. Let P(wjX) = C(X, w)/C(X).
    &#8226; Let P(wjX.a1 V X.a2) be the probability that the word w appears in a sentence due only to the presence of X.a1 or X.a2, assuming X.a1 and X.a2 are independent causes for w. The word weights are computed as follows: C(X, w) &#8722; P(wjX.a1 V X.a2) &#8226; C(X) 580 need: &#8220;return all documents containing a1 and a2 in itive bags in the person-birthplace dataset are sigthe same sentence&#8221;. nificantly sparser in real positive instances than the &#9632; The returned documents (limited by Google to positive bags in the corporate acquisition dataset. the first 1000) are downloaded, and then the text The subsequence kernel described in Section 4 is extracted using the HTML parser from the Java was used as a custom kernel for the LibSVM2 Java Swing package.
