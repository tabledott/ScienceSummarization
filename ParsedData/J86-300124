 DSP2.
    When this is the case, we will say that DSP1 contributes to DSP2; conversely, we will say that DSP2 dominates DSP1 (or DSP2 DOM DSP1).
    The dominance relation invokes a partial ordering on DSPs that we will refer to as the dominance hierarchy.
    For some discourses, including task-oriented ones, the order in which the DSPs are satisfied may be significant, as well as being intended to be recognized.
    We will say that DSP1 satisfaction-precedes DSP2 (or, DSP1 SP DSP2) whenever DSP1 must be satisfied before DSP2.4 Any of the intentions on the preceding list could be either a DP or a DSP.
    Furthermore, a given instance of any one of them could contribute to another, or to a different, instance of the same type.
    For example, the intention that someone intend to identify some object might dominate several intentions that she or he know some property of that object; likewise, the intention to get someone to believe some fact might dominate a number of contributing intentions that that pers
