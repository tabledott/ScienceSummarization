ogether with their links or referents (unfamiliar) This was done because of Fraurud's observation that distinguishing the two classes is generally difficult (Fraurud 1990).
    Third, we did not include a class for immediate situation uses, since we assumed they would be rare in written text.'
    We also introduced a separate class of idioms including indirect references, idiomatic expressions and metaphorical uses, and we allowed our subjects to mark definite descriptions as doubts.
    To summarize, the classes used in this experiment were as follows: Caspar, Wyo., to drill the Bilbrey well, a 15,000-foot, $1-million-plus 10 This was indeed the case, but we did observe a few instances of an interesting kind of immediate situation use.
    In these cases, the text is describing the immediate situation in which the writer is, and the writer apparently expects the reader to reconstruct this situation: natural gas well.
    The rig was built around 1980, but has drilled only two wells, the last in 1982.
