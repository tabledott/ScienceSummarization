ed form and the lexicon formalisms available did not handle the variability of collocational knowledge.
    In contrast, we use Xtract to produce the collocations and we use Functional Unification Grammars (FUGs) (Kay 1979) as a representation formalism and a unification engine.
    We show how the use of FUGs allows us to properly handle the interactions of collocational and various other constraints.
    We have implemented Cook, a surface sentence generator that uses a flexible lexicon for expressing collocational constraints in the stock market domain.
    Using Ana (Kukich 1983) as a deep generator, Cook is implemented in FUF (Elhadad 1990), an extended implementation of FUG, and uniformly represents the lexicon and syntax as originally suggested by Halliday (1966).
    For a more detailed description of Cook the reader is referred to Smadja (1991).
    According to Benson, Benson, and Ilson (1986a), collocations fall into two major groups: lexical collocations and grammatical collocations.
