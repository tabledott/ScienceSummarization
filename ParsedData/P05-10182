    The algorithm introduced in the paper automatically abstracts a text into a set of entity transition sequences, a representation that reflects distributional, syntactic, and referential information about discourse entities.
    We argue that this representation of discourse allows the system to learn the properties of locally coherent texts opportunistically from a given corpus, without recourse to manual annotation or a predefined knowledge base.
    We view coherence assessment as a ranking problem and present an efficiently learnable model that orders alternative renderings of the same information based on their degree of local coherence.
    Such a mechanism is particularly appropriate for generation and summarization systems as they can produce multiple text realizations of the same underlying content, either by varying parameter values, or by relaxing constraints that control the generation process.
    A system equipped with a ranking mechanism, could compare the quality of the candidate outp
