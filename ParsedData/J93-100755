y 8,000 were repeated more than 50 times.
    This means that for a target Overlap of the manual and automatic evaluations lexicon of size N = 8,000, one should expect at least as many collocations to be added, and Xtract can help retrieve most of them.
    The third stage of Xtract can thus be considered as a retrieval system that retrieves valid collocations from a set of candidates.
    This section describes an evaluation experiment of the third stage of Xtract as a retrieval system as well as an evaluation of the overall output of Xtract.
    Evaluation of retrieval systems is usually done with the help of two parameters: precision and recall (Salton 1989).
    Precision of a retrieval system is defined as the ratio of retrieved valid elements divided by the total number of retrieved elements (Salton 1989).
    It measures the quality of the retrieved material.
    Recall is defined as the ratio of retrieved valid elements divided by the total number of valid elements.
    It measures the effectiveness o
