igns 0% value for a system which produces no output and 100% value for a system that extracts all the relations and produces no false alarms.
    We count the misses; the true relations not extracted by the system, and the false alarms; the spurious relations extracted by the system, and obtain the ACE value by subtracting from 1.0, the normalized weighted cost of the misses and false alarms.
    The ACE value counts each relation only once, even if it was expressed many times in a document in different ways.
    The reader is referred to the ACE web site (ACE, 2004) for more details.
    We built several models to compare the relative utility of the feature streams described in the previous section.
    Table 2 shows the results we obtained when running on &#8220;truth&#8221; for the development set and Table 3 shows the results we obtained when running on the output of mention detection and mention chaining modules.
    Note that a model trained with only words as features obtains a very high precision and
