trees cor- responding to the same token ({711,"  ,7i j})  cannot be used later on.
  Of course, all competitive paths are taken in parallel as in the usual Earley parser.
  The way that F is modified by the Left Predictor is illustrated in the following figure: A addedtoSi r=((~ ,...a } ..... {~ ..... ~ ), ..., (v ..... v 1} r=({~ ,...,~ } ........ (~ ..... r }1 n lr il is ml mt 11 lr ml rat Figure 4: Update of F in the Left Predictor The tree 71u is predicted and therefore the trees corre- sponding to the token ai ({ Y / l , -  " ,  "/is}) are removed from 1 a" The scanner must also be slightly modified since the head of the structure is differentiated not only by its lexical value but al,~o by its position in the string.
  6 Conclusion In this paper we presented a general parsing strategy based on lexicalized grammar.
  We defined the notion of lexi- calization of a grammar.
  We showed how a CFG can be lexicalized by using only substitution.
  But the use of adjunction permits lexicalization with linguisti
