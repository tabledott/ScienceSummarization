edicate and all of its arguments, such as a ternary relation among a subject, a verb, and a complement (e.g., the relation among I, want, and dispute1 in Figure 21), and a generalized relation among semantic classes of a predicate and its arguments.
    This is because a predicate and all of its arguments are included in a conjunctive node, and feature functions can represent any relations expressed within a conjunctive node.
    When we define more global features, such as co-occurrences of structures at distant places in a sentence, conjunctive nodes must be expanded so that they include all structures that are necessary to define these features.
    However, this obviously increases the number of conjunctive nodes, and consequently, the cost of parameter estimation increases.
    In an extreme case, for example, if we define features on any co-occurrences of partial parse trees, the full unpacking of parse forests would be necessary, and parameter estimation would be intractable.
    This indicates that th
