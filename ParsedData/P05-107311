 between 2 and 5), and 20 is the approximate number of possible labels if considering both core and modifying arguments.
    Training a model which has such huge number of classes is infeasible if the model does not factorize due to strong independence assumptions.
    Therefore, in order to be able to incorporate long-range dependencies in our models, we chose to adopt a re-ranking approach (Collins, 2000), which selects from likely assignments generated by a model which makes stronger independence assumptions.
    We utilize the top N assignments of our local semantic role labeling model PSRL to generate likely assignments.
    As can be seen from Table 3, for relatively small values of N, our re-ranking approach does not present a serious bottleneck to performance.
    We used a value of N = 20 for training.
    In Table 3 we can see that if we could pick, using an oracle, the best assignment out for the top 20 assignments according to the local model, we would achieve an F-Measure of 98.8 on all arguments
