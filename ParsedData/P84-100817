 simple solution is person agreement in coordinate noun phrases.
    The conjunction of a 1st person pronoun with either 2nd or 3rd person pronoun invariably yields 1st person agreement.
    &amp;quot;I and you&amp;quot; is equivalent to &amp;quot;we,&amp;quot; as far as agreement is concerned.
    When a second person pronoun is conjoined with a third person NP, the resulting conjunction has the agreement properties of a second person pronoun.
    Schematically: Assuming that generalization with negative constraints works as indicated above, i.e. negative constraints are always inherited, it immediately follows that the generalization of 1st person with any other person is compatible with only 1st person and that 2nd person wins over 3rd when they are combined.
    The results are as follows.
    Sag, Gazdar, Wasow, and Weisler [84] propose a solution which is based on the idea of deriving the person feature for a coordinate noun phrase by generalization (intersection) from the person features of its heads.
