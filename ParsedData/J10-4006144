re complex tasks may be tackled by combining different views of DM, and/or resorting to different (sub)spaces within the same view, as in our approach to selectional preferences.
    One might even foresee an algorithmic way to mix and match the spaces as most appropriate to a certain task.
    We propose a similar split for the role of supervision in DSMs.
    Construction of the DM tensor from the corpus is most naturally framed as an unsupervised task, because the model will serve many different purposes.
    On the other hand, supervision can be of great help in tuning the DM data to specific tasks (as we did, in a rather naive way, with the nearest centroid approach to most non-attributional tasks).
    A crucial challenge for DSMs is whether and how corpus-derived vectors can also be used in the construction of meaning for constituents larger than words.
    These are the traditional domains of formal semantics, which is most interested in how the logical representation of a sentence or a discourse is b
