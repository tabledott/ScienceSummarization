  201 Computational Linguistics Volume 20, Number 2 2.3 The Distinction between Smooth-Shift and Rough-Shift In example 4, we illustrate the difference between the transition states of ROUGH- SHIFT and SMOOTH-SHIFT.
  Remember that ROUGH-SHIFT is claimed to be less coherent than SMOOTH-SHIFT (Brennan, Friedman, and Pollard 1987).
  In both cases the speaker has shifted the center to a different discourse ntity.
  However, in the SMOOTH-SHIFT transition state, the speaker has indicated an intention to continue talking about the recently shifted-to entity by realizing that entity in a highly ranked Cf position such as subject, whereas no such indication is available with the ROUGH-SHIFT transition.
  The numbers hown to the right of an interpretation correspond to how many native speakers preferred that interpretation.
