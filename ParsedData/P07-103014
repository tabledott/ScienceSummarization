nt S-patterns for the missing values of S. (In our case the corpus is the web, so we perform additional clarifying queries.)
    Finally, we delete all relations in which all concept words are related to most target words and all relations in which the concept words and the target words are identical.
    Such relations can certainly be of interest (see Section 7), but are not our focus in this paper.
    In our implementation we use the Google search engine.
    Google restricts individual users to 1,000 queries per day and 1,000 pages per query.
    In each stage we conducted queries iteratively, each time downloading all 1,000 documents for the query.
    In the first stage our goal was to discover symmetric relationships from the web and consequently discover additional concept words.
    For queries in this stage of our algorithm we invoked two requirements.
    First, the query should contain at least two concept words.
    This proved very effective in reducing ambiguity.
    Thus of 1,000 documents fo
