onstruct a corresponding valid sentence of L2 (target).
    Accordingly, we can seek to probabilistically identify the optimal correct target sentence(s) T* of an ESL input sentence S by applying the familiar SMT formula: In the context of this model, editorial assistance becomes a matter of identifying those segments of the optimal target sentence or sentences that differ from the writer&#8217;s original input and displaying them to the user.
    In practice, the patterns of errors produced by ESL writers of specific L1 backgrounds can be captured in the channel model as an emergent property of training data consisting ESL sentences aligned with their corrected edited counterparts.
    The highest frequency errors and infelicities should emerge as targets for replacement, while lesser frequency or idiosyncratic problems will in general not surface as false flags.
    In this paper, we explore the use of a large-scale production statistical machine translation system to correct a class of ESL errors.
