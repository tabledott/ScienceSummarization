ained as described in Section 6.1.3.
    In general, the results confirm that smoothing by rank reduction is beneficial to semantic performance, although not spectacularly so, with an improvement of about 4% for the best reduced model with respect to the raw APTypeDM tensor (consider however also the relatively wide confidence intervals).
    As a general trend, tensor-based smoothing (Tucker) does better than matrix-based smoothing (SVD).
    As we said, for Tucker we only report results from a small region of the tridimensional parameter space, whereas the SVD rank parameter range is explored coarsely but exhaustively.
    Thus, although other parameter combinations might lead to dramatic changes in Tucker performance, the best SVD performance in the table is probably close to the SVD performance upper bound.
    The present pilot study suggests an attitude of cautious optimism towards tensor decomposition as a smoothing technique.
    At least in the AP task, it helps as compared to no smoothing at all.
