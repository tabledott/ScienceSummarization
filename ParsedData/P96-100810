 the augmented parse tree, while the slot filling instructions are attached to nodes lower down in the tree.
    Except for the topmost node, all parse nodes are required to have some slot filling operation.
    For nodes that do not directly trigger any slot fill operation, the special operation null is attached.
    The probability P(Ms, 7) is then: Obviously, the prior probabilities P(FT) can be obtained directly from the training data.
    To compute P(T I FT), each of the state transitions from the previous parsing model are simply rescored conditioned on the frame type.
    The new state transition probabilities are: To compute P(S I FT, 7) , we make the independence assumption that slot filling operations depend only on the frame type, the slot operations already performed, and on the local parse structure around the operation.
    This local neighborhood consists of the parse node itself, its two left siblings, its two right siblings, and its four immediate ancestors.
    Further, the syntactic and se
