    7.2.2 Clustering Occurrences of an Ambiguous Word.
    Schiitze (1992,1993) proposes a method that can be viewed as an efficient way of manual tagging.
    Instead of presenting all occurrences of an ambiguous word to a human, these occurrences are first clustered using automatic clustering algorithms.'
    Then a human is asked to assign one of the senses of the word to each cluster, by observing several members of the cluster.
    Each sense is thus represented by one or more clusters.
    At the disambiguation phase, a new occurrence of an ambiguous word is matched against the contexts that were recorded for these clusters, selecting the sense of that cluster which provides the best match.
    It is interesting to note that the number of occurrences that had to be observed by a human in the experiments of Schutze is of the same order as in the bootstrapping approach: 10-20 members of a cluster were observed, with an average of 2.8 clusters per sense.
    As both appro
