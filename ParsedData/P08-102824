n to 100% verb.
    For the best performing model the weight for the verb was 80% and for the noun 20%.
    Secondly, we optimized the weightings in the combined model (11) with a similar grid search over its three parameters.
    This yielded a weighted sum consisting of 95% verb, 0% noun and 5% of their multiplicative combination.
    Finally, Kintsch&#8217;s (2001) additive model has two extra parameters.
    The m neighbors most similar to the predicate, and the k of m neighbors closest to its argument.
    In our experiments we selected parameters that Kintsch reports as optimal.
    Specifically, m was set to 20 and m to 1.
    Evaluation Methodology We evaluated the proposed composition models in two ways.
    First, we used the models to estimate the cosine similarity between the reference sentence and its landmarks.
    We expect better models to yield a pattern of similarity scores like those observed in the human ratings (see Figure 2).
    A more scrupulous evaluation requires directly correlating
