tics: First, the total system weight mass 1.0 is evenly divided among the three groups of single systems: {Sys-1~8}, {Sys-9~12}, and {Sys13~15}.
    Each group receives a total system weight mass of 1/3.
    Then the weight mass is further divided in each group: in the first group, the original weights of systems 1~8 are multiplied by 1/3; in the second and third groups, the weight mass is evenly distributed within the group, i.e., 1/12 for each system in group 2, and 1/9 for each system in group 35.
    Length adaptation is applied to control the final output length, where the same expected length ratio of the previous 8-way system combination is adopted.
    The results of the 15-way system combination are presented in Table 3.
    It shows that the IHMMbased method is still about 1 BLEU point better than the TER-based method.
    Moreover, combining 15 single systems gives an output that has a NIST BLEU score of 34.82%, which is 3.9 points better than the best submission to the NIST MT08 constrained traini
