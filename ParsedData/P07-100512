ciated context-dependent probabilities, which are the probabilities of a Chinese word (phrase) translating into each English phrase, depending on the context of the Chinese word (phrase).
    After WSD, the ith word ci in every Chinese sentence may have up to 3 sets of associated translations provided by the WSD system: a set of translations for ci as a single word, a second set of translations for ci_1ci considered as a single unit, and a third set of translations for cici+1 considered as a single unit.
  
  
    The following tasks are done for each rule that is considered during decoding: The WSD system is able to predict translations only for a subset of Chinese words or phrases.
    Hence, we must first identify which parts of the Chinese side of the rule have suggested translations available.
    Here, we consider substrings of length up to two, and we give priority to longer substrings.
    Next, we want to know, for each Chinese substring considered, whether the WSD system supports the Chinese-English
