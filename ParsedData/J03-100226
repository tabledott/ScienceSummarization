    Although there exist simple polynomial algorithms for the baseline Models 1 and 2, we are unaware of any efficient algorithm for computing the Viterbi alignment for the fertility-based alignment models.
    For Model 2 (also for Model 1 as a special case), we obtain Hence, the maximization over the (I+1)J different alignments decomposes into J maximizations of (I + 1) lexicon probabilities.
    Similarly, the Viterbi alignment for Model 2 can be computed with a complexity of O(I &#183; J).
    Finding the optimal alignment for the HMM is more complicated than for Model 1 or Model 2.
    Using a dynamic programming approach, it is possible to obtain the Viterbi alignment for the HMM with a complexity of O(I2 &#183;J) (Vogel, Ney, and Tillmann 1996).
