s list is intended to reflect the salience of discourse entities.
    The BFP algorithm orders this list by grammatical relation of the complements of the main verb, i.e. first the subject, then object, then indirect object, then other subcategorized-for complements, then noun phrases found in adjunct clauses.
    This captures the intuition that subjects are more salient than other discourse entities.
    The BFP algorithm added linguistic constraints on CONTRA-INDEXING to the centering framework.
    These constraints are exemplified by the fact that, in the sentence he likes him, the entity cospecified by he cannot be the same as that cospecified by him.
    We say that he and him are CONTRA-INDEXED.
    The BFP algorithm depends on semantic processing to precompute these constraints, since they are derived from the syntactic structure, and depend on some notion of c-command[Rei76].
    The other assumption that is dependent on syntax is that the the representations of discourse entities can be marked with
