    O-CRF first applies a phrase chunker to each document, and treats the identified noun phrases as candidate entities for extraction.
    Each pair of entities appearing no more than a maximum number of words apart and their surrounding context are considered as possible evidence for RE.
    The entity pair serves to anchor each end of a linear-chain CRF, and both entities in the pair are assigned a fixed label of ENT.
    Tokens in the surrounding context are treated as possible textual cues that indicate a relation, and can be assigned one of the following labels: B-REL, indicating the start
