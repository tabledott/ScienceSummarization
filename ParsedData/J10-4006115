d a well-known classification of verbs based on their range of syntactic alternations.
    Recognizing the alternations licensed by a verb is extremely important in capturing its argument structure properties, and consequently in describing its semantic behavior.
    We focus here on a particular class of alternations, namely transitivity alternations, whose verbs allow both for a transitive NP V NP variant and for an intransitive NP V (PP) variant (Levin 1993).
    We use the W1LxW2 space to carry out the automatic classification of verbs that participate in different types of transitivity alternations.
    In the causative/inchoative alternation, the object argument (e.g., John broke the vase) can also be realized as an intransitive subject (e.g., The vase broke).
    In a first experiment, we use the W1LxW2 space to discriminate between transitive verbs undergoing the causative/inchoative alternation (C/I) (e.g., break) and non-alternating ones (e.g., mince; cf.
    John minced the meat vs. *The meat mince
