f training examples.
    We performed all of our experiments on the Europarl V2 French-English parallel corpus.3 The training data was created by filtering the full corpus for all the French sentences between five and fifteen words in length, resulting in 170K sentence pairs.
    These limits were chosen as a compromise between experiment turnaround time and leaving a large enough corpus to obtain indicative results.
    The development and test data was taken from the 2006 NAACL and 2007 ACL workshops on machine translation, also filtered for sentence length.4 Tuning of the regularisation parameter and MERT training of the benchmark models was performed on dev2006, while the test set was the concatenation of devtest2006, test2006 and test2007, amounting to 315 development and 1164 test sentences.
    Here we focus on evaluating our model&#8217;s basic ability to learn a conditional distribution from simple binary features, directly comparable to those currently employed in frequency count models.
