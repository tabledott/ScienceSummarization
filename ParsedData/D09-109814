 and each part of B is processed M times.
    M is determined by the amount of memory dedicated for the inverted index, and N should be determined by trading off the fact that as N increases, more parallelism can be obtained at the increased cost of building the same inverse index N times.
    The similarity algorithm from Figure 1 is run in each task of the Map step of a MapReduce job.
    The Reduce step is used to group the output by bi.
  
  
    Creating lists of named entities is a critical problem at commercial engines such as Yahoo! and Google.
    The types of entities to be expanded are often not known a priori, leaving supervised classifiers undesirable.
    Additionally, list creators typically need the ability to expand sets of varying granularity.
    Semi-supervised approaches are predominantly adopted since they allow targeted expansions while requiring only small sets of seed entities.
    State-of-the-art techniques first compute term-term similarities for all available terms and then select
