lation (Ding and Palmer, 2005).
    Although less informative than lexicalised phrase structures, dependency structures still capture most of the predicate-argument information needed for applications.
    It has the advantage of being more efficient to learn and parse.
    McDonald et al. (2005a) introduce a dependency parsing framework which treats the task as searching for the projective tree that maximises the sum of local dependency scores.

    The verb &#8220;krijg&#8221; is incorrectly coordinated with the preposition &#8220;om&#8221;. work is efficient and has also been extended to non-projective trees (McDonald et al., 2005b).
    It provides a discriminative online learning algorithm which when combined with a rich feature set reaches state-of-the-art performance across multiple languages.
    However, within this framework one can only define features over single attachment decisions.
    This leads to cases where basic linguistic constr
