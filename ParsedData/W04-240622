s a one to one mapping between them.
    When the number of clusters is greater than the number of actual senses, then some clusters will be left unassigned.
    And when the number of senses is greater than the number of clusters, some senses will not be assigned to any cluster.
    The reason for not assigning a single sense to multiple clusters or multiple senses to one cluster is that, we are assuming one sense per instance and one sense per cluster.
    We measure the precision and recall based on this maximally accurate assignment of sense tags to clusters.
    Precision is defined as the number of instances that are clustered correctly divided by the number of instances clustered, while recall is the number of instances clustered correctly over the total number of instances.
    From that we compute the F&#8211;measure, which is two times the precision and recall, divided by the sum of precision and recall.
