) to dependency trees derived from full parse trees (Culotta and Sorensen, 2004).
			Eventhough exhaustive experiments comparing the per formance of a relation extraction system based on these four levels of syntactic information are yet tobe conducted, a reasonable assumption is that the extraction accuracy increases with the amount of syn tactic information used.
			The performance howeverdepends not only on the amount of syntactic infor mation, but also on the details of the exact modelsusing this information.
			Training a machine learn ing system in a setting where the information usedfor representing the examples is only partially rele vant to the actual task often leads to overfitting.
			It is therefore important to design the IE system so that the input data is stripped of unnecessary features as much as possible.
			In the case of the tree kernels from (Zelenko et al, 2003; Culotta and Sorensen, 2004), the authors reduce each relation example to the smallest subtree in the parse or dependency tree t
