 an augmented parser and extracts syntactic paths from mentions to potential antecedents.
    Some of these paths can be ruled in or out by deterministic but conservative syntactic constraints.
    Importantly, the bulk of the work in the syntactic module is in making sure the parses are correctly constructed and used, and this module&#8217;s most important training data is a treebank.
    Second, a self-contained semantic module evaluates the semantic compatibility of headwords and individual names.
    These decisions are made from compatibility lists extracted from unlabeled data sources such as newswire and web data.
    Finally, of the antecedents which remain after rich syntactic and semantic filtering, reference is chosen to minimize tree distance.
    This procedure is trivial where most systems are rich, and so does not need any supervised coreference data.
    However, it is rich in important ways which we argue are marginalized in recent coreference work.
    Interestingly, error analysis from our
