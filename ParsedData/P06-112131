 of BLEU of contextually richer rules.
	
	
			Similarly to (Poutsma, 2000; Wu, 1997; Yamadaand Knight, 2001; Chiang, 2005), the rules dis cussed in this paper are equivalent to productions of synchronous tree substitution grammars.
			We believe that our tree-to-string model has several advantages over tree-to-tree transformations such as the ones acquired by Poutsma (2000).
			While tree-to-tree grammars are richer formalisms thatprovide the potential benefit of rules that are lin guistically better motivated, modeling the syntax of both languages comes as an extra cost, and itis admittedly more helpful to focus our syntac tic modeling effort on the target language (e.g., English) in cases where it has syntactic resources (parsers and treebanks) that are considerably moreavailable than for the source language.
			Further more, we think there is, overall, less benefit in modeling the syntax of the source language, since the input sentence is fixed during decoding and is generally already grammatical.
