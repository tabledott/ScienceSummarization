by Gildea and Jurafsky (2002) and others, either using arguments as delimited in the FrameNet corpus, or having to automatically locate argument boundaries.4 Furthermore, we report results over individual slot classes (subject, object, indirect object, and PP object), as well as over all slots.
    We report results after the &#8220;unambiguous&#8221; data is assigned, and at the end of the algorithm, when no more slots can be labelled.
    At either of these steps it is possible for some slots to have been assigned and some to remain unassigned.
    Rather than performing a simple precision/recall analysis, we report a finer grained elaboration that gives a more precise picture of the results.
    For the assigned slots, we report percent correct (of total, not of assigned) and percent incorrect.
    For the unassigned slots, we report percent &#8220;possible&#8221; (i.e., slots whose candidate list contains the correct role) and percent &#8220;impossible&#8221; (i.e., slots whose candidate list does not con
