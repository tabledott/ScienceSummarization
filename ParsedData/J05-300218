constituents of one sentence to those of another and select the most similar ones.
    Of course, how this comparison is performed depends on the particular sentence representation used.
    A good sentence representation will emphasize sentence features that are relevant for comparison, such as dependencies between sentence constituents, while ignoring irrelevant features, such as constituent ordering.
    A representation which fits these requirements is a dependency-based representation (Melcuk 1988).
    We first detail how this representation is computed, then describe a method for aligning dependency subtrees.
    3.1.1 Sentence Representation.
    Our sentence representation is based on a dependency tree, which describes the sentence structure in terms of dependencies between words.
    The similarity of the dependency tree to a predicate&#8211;argument structure makes it a natural representation for our comparison.3 This representation can be constructed from the output of a traditional parser.
