he head and mention type are given as part of the mention annotation.
    For the MUC data, the head was crudely chosen to be the rightmost mention token, and the mention type was automatically detected.
    We will not assume any other information to be present in the data beyond the text itself.
    In particular, unlike much related work, we do not assume gold named entity recognition (NER) labels; indeed we do not assume observed NER labels or POS tags at all.
    Our primary performance metric will be the MUC F1 measure (Vilain et al., 1995), commonly used to evaluate coreference systems on a within-document basis.
    Since our system relies on sampling, all results are averaged over five random runs.
  
  
    In this section, we present a sequence of generative coreference resolution models for document corpora.
    All are essentially mixture models, where the mixture components correspond to entities.
    As far as notation, we assume a collection of I documents, each with Ji mentions.
    We use ra
