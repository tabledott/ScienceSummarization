its conditioning information (nodes circled in the figure) clearly show that it is part of an NP, and hence probably modifies the preceding NN.
    Indeed, the statistics give the probability of an ADV tag in this conditioning environment as vanishingly small.
    However, this was not the conditioning information that the tagger received.
    The parser had instead decided on the (incorrect) parse in figure 6.
    As such, the tagger's decision makes much more sense, since an SBAR under two VPs whose heads are VB and MD is rather likely to be an ADV.
    (For instance, the 'although' clause of the sentence 'he can help, although he doesn't want to.' has exactly the conditioning environment given in figure 6, except that its predecessor is a comma; and this SBAR would be correctly tagged ADV.)
    The SBAR itself is correctly bracketed and labelled, so it still gets counted in the statistics.
    Happily, this sort of case seems to be relatively rare.
    Another thing that lowers the overall performance some
