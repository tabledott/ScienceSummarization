jedna is the syntactic head of Z, while je is its linear head in the projectivized representation.
    Unlike Kahane et al. (1998), we do not regard a projectivized representation as the final target of the parsing process.
    Instead, we want to apply an inverse transformation to recover the underlying (nonprojective) dependency graph.
    In order to facilitate this task, we extend the set of arc labels to encode information about lifting operations.
    In principle, it would be possible to encode the exact position of the syntactic head in the label of the arc from the linear head, but this would give a potentially infinite set of arc labels and would make the training of the parser very hard.
    In practice, we can therefore expect a trade-off such that increasing the amount of information encoded in arc labels will cause an increase in the accuracy of the inverse transformation but a decrease in the accuracy with which the parser can construct the labeled representations.
    To explore this tradeoff,
