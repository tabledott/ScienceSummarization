 each value of e, the method was run for 100,000 rounds on the training data.
    The implementation was such that the feature updates for all 100,000 rounds for each training run were recorded in a file.
    This made it simple to test the model on development data for all values of N between 0 and 100,000.
    The different values of &amp; and N were compared on development data through the following criterion: where Score is as defined above, and zi is the output of the model on the ith development set example.
    The &amp;, N values which maximized this quantity were used to define the final model applied to the test data (section 23 of the treebank).
    The optimal values were &amp; = 0.0025 and N = 90,386, at which point 11,673 features had nonzero values (note that the feature selection techniques may result in a given feature being updated more than once).
    The computation took roughly 3&#8211;4 hours on a machine with a 1.6 GHz pentium processor and around 2 GB of memory.
