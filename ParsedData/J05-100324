 labeled ExpLoss is a plot of f (z) = e&#8212;z for z = [&#8212;1.5...1.5]; LogLoss shows a similar plot for f (z) = log(1 + e&#8212;z); Error is a plot of f (z) = Qz &lt; 01. a&#175; are zero).
    Roughly speaking, the motivation for using a small number of features is the hope that this will prevent overfitting in the models.
    Feature selection methods have been proposed in the maximum-entropy literature by several authors (Ratnaparkhi, Roukos, and Ward 1994; Berger, Della Pietra, and Della Pietra 1996; Della Pietra, Della Pietra, and Lafferty 1997; Papineni, Roukos, and Ward 1997, 1998; McCallum 2003; Zhou et al. 2003; Riezler and Vasserman 2004).
    The most basic approach&#8212;for example see Ratnaparkhi, Roukos, and Ward (1994) and Berger, Della Pietra, and Della Pietra (1996)&#8212;involves selection of a single feature at each iteration, followed by an update to the entire model, as follows: Step 3: Update the parameter for the feature chosen at Step 2 in such a way as to minimize ExpLoss(&#175;
