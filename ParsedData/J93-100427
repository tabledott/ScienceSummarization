Both of the additional judges were also fluent in English, having spent the last few years living and working in the United States, though they were both more comfortable with their native language than with English.
    The materials were prepared in order to make the task somewhat less tedious for the judges.
    Each paragraph was printed in three columns, one for each of the three languages: English, French, and German.
    Blank lines were inserted between sentences.
    The judges were asked to draw lines between matching sentences.
    The judges were also permitted to draw a line between a sentence and &amp;quot;null&amp;quot; if they thought that the sentence was not translated.
    For the purposes of this evaluation, two sentences were defined to &amp;quot;match&amp;quot; if they shared a common clause.
    (In a few cases, a pair of sentences shared only a phrase or a word, rather than a clause; these sentences did not count as a &amp;quot;match&amp;quot; for the purposes of this experiment.)
