 chain size k, 6 &lt; k &lt; 11.
    The exact value of k is optimized together with the other parameters, as described in Section 5.
    Fixing the chain size at k reduces the number of candidate chains to (n) = n!
    For typical values of n and k, (Z) can still reach into the millions.
    The Low Variance of Slope property suggests another constraint: SIMR should consider only chains that are roughly parallel to the main diagonal.
    Two lines are parallel if the perpendicular displacement between them is constant.
    So, chains that are roughly parallel to the main diagonal will consist of points that all have roughly the same displacement from the main diagonal.'
    Points with similar displacement can be grouped together by sorting, as illustrated in Figure 6.
    Then, chains that are most parallel to the main diagonal will be contiguous subsequences of the sorted point sequence.
    In a region of the bitext space containing n points, there will be only n &#8212; k + 1 such subsequences of length
