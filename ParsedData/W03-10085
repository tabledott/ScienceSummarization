 an ordinary sentence, a relative clause and a right-node-raising construction.
    In all three sentences, the predicateargument relations between London and denied and plans and denied are the same, which in CCG is expressed by the fact that London fills the first (ie. subject) argument slot of the lexical category of denied, (S[dcl]\NP1)/NP2, and plans fills the second (object) slot.
    The relations extracted from the CCG derivation for the sentence &#8220;London denied plans on Monday&#8221; are shown in Table 1.
    The CCG parser returns the local and long-range word-word dependencies that express the predicateargument structure corresponding to the derivation.
    These relations are recovered with an accuracy of around 83% (labeled recovery) or 91% (unlabeled recovery) (Hockenmaier, 2003).
    By contrast, standard Treebank parsers such as (Collins, 1999) only return phrase-structure trees, from which non-local dependencies are difficult to recover.
    The CCG parser has been trained and tested on
