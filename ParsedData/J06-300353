 the 374 questions; 160 questions were answered incorrectly and 4 questions were skipped, because the stem pair and its alternates were represented by zero vectors.
    The performance of LRA is significantly better than the lexicon-based approach of Veale (2004) (see Section 3.1) and the best performance using attributional similarity (see Section 2.3), with 95% confidence, according to the Fisher Exact Test (Agresti 1990).
    As another point of reference, consider the simple strategy of always guessing the choice with the highest co-occurrence frequency.
    The idea here is that the words in the solution pair may occur together frequently, because there is presumably a clear and meaningful relation between the solution words, whereas the distractors may only occur together rarely because they have no meaningful relation.
    This strategy is signifcantly worse than random guessing.
    The opposite strategy, always guessing the choice pair with the lowest co-occurrence frequency, is also worse than rando
