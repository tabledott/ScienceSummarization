d above, varying the size of the none training relations.
    Each pair of events in a gigaword document that share a coreferring argument is treated as a separate ordering classification task.
    We count the resulting number of labeled before relations between each verb/dependency pair.
    Processing the entire corpus produces a database of event pair counts where confidence of two generic events A and B can be measured by comparing how many before labels have been seen versus their inverted order B and A5.
    We want to evaluate temporal order at the narrative level, across all events within a chain.
    We envision narrative chains being used for tasks of coherence, among other things, and so it is desired to evaluate temporal decisions within a coherence framework.
    Along these lines, our test set uses actual narrative chains from documents, hand labeled for a partial ordering.
    We evaluate coherence of these true chains against a random ordering.
    The task is thus deciding which of the two c
