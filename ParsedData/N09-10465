le, the path f&#175; from a designated start start to a designated goal state in the lattice G: If the transduction formalism used is a synchronous probabilistic context free grammar or weighted finite Figure 1 shows two lattices that encode the most linguistically plausible ways of segmenting two prototypical German compounds with compositional meanings.
    However, while these words are structurally quite similar, translating them into English would seem to require different amounts of segmentation.
    For example, the dictionary fragment shown in Table 1 illustrates that tonbandaufnahme can be rendered into English by following 3 different paths in the lattice, ton/audio band/tape aufnahme/recording, tonband/tape aufnahme/recording, and tonbandaufnahme/tape recording.
    In contrast, wiederaufnahme can only be translated correctly using the unsegmented form, even though in German the meaning of the full form is a composition of the meaning of the individual morphemes.1 It should be noted that phrase-bas
