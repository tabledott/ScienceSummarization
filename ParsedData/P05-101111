d) for smoothing.
    Table 2 shows a full set of templates of combined features used in the experiments.
    Each row represents a template of a feature function.
    A check means the atomic feature is incorporated while a hyphen means the feature is ignored.
    Restricting the domain of feature functions to (cm, Cl, Cr) seems to limit the flexibility of feature design.
    Although it is true to some extent, this does not necessarily mean the impossibility of incorporating features on nonlocal dependencies into the model.
    This is because a feature forest model does not assume probabilistic independence of conjunctive nodes.
    This means that we can unpack a part of the forest without changing the model.
    Actually, in our previous study (Miyao et al., 2003), we successfully developed a probabilistic model including features on nonlocal predicate-argument dependencies.
    However, since we could not observe significant improvements by incorporating nonlocal features, this paper investigates only t
