r-annotator agreement for the BNC data.
			Reasons why our agreement is relatively low include the fact that almost all of the sentences are annotated by three people, and also the high degree of polysemy of this set of words.
			Problematic cases The unlisted category was used as a miscellaneous category.
			In some cases a sense was truly missing from the inventory (e.g. the word ?tie?
			has a ?game?
			sense in British English which is not included in WN 1.7.1).
			In other cases we had not recognised thatthe word was really part of a multiword (e.g. a num ber of sentences for the word ?chip?
			contained themultiword ?blue chip?).
			Finally there were a num ber of cases where the word had been assigned the wrong part of speech tag (e.g. the verb ?will?
			had often been mistagged as a noun).
			We identified and removed all these systematic problem cases from theunlisted senses.
			After removing the problematic un listed cases, we had between 0.9% (FINANCE) and 4.5% (SPORTS) unlisted instances left.
