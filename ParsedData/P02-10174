y aggregating over only valid, complete parses of each sentence, they naturally incorporate the constraint that constituents cannot cross &#8211; the bracketing decisions made by the grammar must be coherent.
    The Carroll and Charniak experiments had two primary causes for failure.
    First, random initialization is not always good, or necessary.
    The parameter space is riddled with local likelihood maxima, and starting with a very specific, but random, grammar should not be expected to work well.
    We duplicated their experiments, but used a uniform parameter initialization where all productions were equally likely.
    This allowed the interaction between the grammar and data to break the initial symmetry, and resulted in an induced grammar of higher quality than Carroll and Charniak reported.
    This grammar, which we refer to as DEP-PCFG will be evaluated in more detail in section 4.
    The second way in which their experiment was guaranteed to be somewhat unencouraging is that a delexicalized
