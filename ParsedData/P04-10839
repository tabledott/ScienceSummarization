    The class of synchronous parsers includes some algorithms for word alignment.
    A translation lexicon (weighted or not) can be viewed as a degenerate MTG (not in GCNF) where every production has a link of terminals on the RHS.
    Under such an MTG, the logic of word alignment is the one in Melamed (2003)&#8217;s Parser A, but without Compose inferences.
    The only other difference is that, instead of a single item, the Goal of word alignment is any set of items that covers all dimensions of the input.
    This logic can be used with the expectation semiring (Eisner, 2002) to find the maximum likelihood estimates of the parameters of a word-to-word translation model.
    An important application of Parser C is parameter estimation for probabilistic MTGs (PMTGs).
    Eisner (2002) has claimed that parsing under an expectation semiring is equivalent to the Inside-Outside algorithm for PCFGs.
    If so, then there is a straightforward generalization for PMTGs.
    Parameter estimation is beyond t
