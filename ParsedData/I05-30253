 for ?0?).
  Besides these basic features, we also made use of character normalization.
  We note that char- acters like punctuation symbols and Arabic dig- its have different character codes in the ASCII, GB, and BIG5 encoding standard, although they mean the same thing.
  For example, comma ?,?
  is represented as the hexadecimal value 0x2c in ASCII, but as the hexadecimal value 0xa3ac in GB.
  In our segmenter, these different character codes are normalized and replaced by the corre- sponding character code in ASCII.
  Also, all Ara- bic digits are replaced by the ASCII digit ?0?
  to denote any digit.
  Incorporating character normal- ization enables our segmenter to be more robust against the use of different encodings to represent the same character.
  For all the experiments that we conducted, training was done with a feature cutoff of 2 and 100 iterations, except for the AS corpus which had a feature cutoff of 3.
  A major difficulty faced by a Chinese word segmenter is the presence of out-of-vocabula
