bute to this performance gain.
    The first is simply that if we first guess the pre-terminal, when we go to guess the head the first thing we can condition upon is the pre-terminal, i.e., we compute p(h I t).
    This quantity is a relatively intuitive one (as, for example, it is the quantity used in a PCFG to relate words to their pre-terminals) and it seems particularly good to condition upon here since we use it, in effect, as the unsmoothed probability upon which all smoothing of p(h) is based.
    This one &amp;quot;fix&amp;quot; makes slightly over a percent difference in the results.
    The second major reason why first guessing the pre-terminal makes so much difference is that it can be used when backing off the lexical head in computing the probability of the rule expansion.
    For example, when we first guess the lexical head we can move from computing p(r I 1,1p, h) to p(r I /, t, /p, h).
    So, e.g., even if the word &amp;quot;conflating&amp;quot; does not appear in the training corpus (and i
