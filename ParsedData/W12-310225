    How many judgments do we need?
    We may extrapolate this number from the number of judgments we have.
    Figure 2 provides some hints.
    The outlier is Czech&#8211;English, for which only 6 systems were submitted and we can separate them almost completely even at p-level 0.01.
    For all the other language pairs, we can only draw for around 40% of the pairwise comparisons conclusions with that level of statistical significance.
    Since the plots also contains the ratio of significant conclusions when sub-sampling the number of judgments, we obtain curves with a clear upward slope.
    For English&#8211;Czech, for which we were able to collect much more judgments, we can draw over 60% significant conclusions.
    The curve for this language pair does not look much different than the other languages, suggesting that doubling the number of judgments should allow similar levels for them as well.
  
  
    In addition to allowing us to analyze the translation quality of different systems, the d
