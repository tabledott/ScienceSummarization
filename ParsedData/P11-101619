wnloaded 400 English tweets10 containing the query using the Twitter API.
    We manually classify each tweet as positive, negative or neutral towards the query with which it is downloaded.
    After removing duplicate tweets, we finally obtain 459 positive, 268 negative and 1,212 neutral tweets.
    Among the tweets, 100 are labeled by two human annotators for inter-annotator study.
    The results show that for 86% of them, both annotators gave identical labels.
    Among the 14 tweets which the two annotators disagree on, only 1 case is a positive-negative disagreement (one annotator considers it positive while the other negative), and the other 13 are all neutral-subjective disagreement.
    This probably indicates that it is harder for humans to decide if a tweet is neutral or subjective than to decide if it is positive or negative.
    We first analyze the output of Twitter Sentiment (TS) using the five test queries.
    For each query, we randomly select 20 tweets labeled as positive or negative by TS.
