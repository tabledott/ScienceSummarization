ciated with the above kernels for the SVMbased multiclassifier.
    We note that (a) SSTs have a higher accuracy than STs, (b) bow does not improve either ST or SST kernels and (c) in the final part of the plot SST shows a higher gradient than ST, Linear and Poly.
    This latter produces the best accuracy 90.5% in line with the literature findings using standard features and polynomial SVMs, e.g.
    87.1%6 in (Pradhan et al., 2004).
    Second, in tables 2 and 3, we report the results using all available training data, on PropBank and FrameNet test sets, respectively.
    Each row of the two tables shows the F1 measure of the individual classifiers using different kernels whereas the last column illustrates the global accuracy of the multiclassifier.
    We note that, the F1 of the single arguments across the different kernels follows the same behavior of the global multiclassifier accuracy.
    On FrameNet, the bow impact on the ST and SST accuracy is higher than on PropBank as it produces an improvement o
