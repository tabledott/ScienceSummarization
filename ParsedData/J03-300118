    Table 3 provides estimates for the number of words that were available in 30 different Latin-script languages through AltaVista in March 2001.
    English led the pack with 76 billion words, and seven additional languages already had over a billion.
    From the table, we see that even &#8220;smaller&#8221; languages such as Slovenian, Croatian, Malay, and Turkish have more than one hundred million words on the Web.
    Much of the research that has been undertaken on the BNC simply exploits its scale and could be transferred directly to these languages.
    The numbers presented in Table 3 are lower bounds, for a number of reasons: Repeating the procedure after an interval, the second author and Nioche showed that the proportion of non-English
