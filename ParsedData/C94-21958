rom v to nl ," W (W1, W2, etc.) can be any word, and the ellipsis indicates that the complete set of transformations permits matching on any combination of values for v, n l , p, and n2, with the exception of patterns that specify vahms for all four.
			For example, one allowable transformation would be Change the attachment location from nl to v if p is "until".
			Learning proceeds as follows.
			First, the train- ing set is processed according to the start state annotator, in this case attaching all prepositional phrases low (attached to nl) . Then, in essence, each possible transtbrmation is scored by apply- ing it to the corpus and cornputing the reduction (or increase) in error rate.
			in reality, the search is data driven, and so the vast majority of al- lowable transformations are not examined.
			The best-scoring transformation then becomes the first transformation i the learned list.
			It is applied to the training corpus, and learning continues on the modified corpus.
			This process is iterated
