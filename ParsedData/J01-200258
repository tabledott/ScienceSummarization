    When taking the words leading to errors in our 1% test set and examining them in the training data, we see a near even split for practically every word.
    The most frequent ones are Securities (146 NNP vs. 160 NNPS) and Airlines (72 NNP vs. 83 NNPS).
    There are only two very unbalanced cases: Times (78 NNP vs. 6 NNPS) and Savings (76 NNP vs. 21 NNPS).
    A similar situation occurs, although less frequently, for common nouns, for example, headquarters gets 67 NN and 21 NNS tags.
