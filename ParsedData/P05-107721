on a much smaller data set.
    We use the same 6GB corpus that was used for training by Pantel and Lin (2002) so that the results are comparable.
    We randomly choose 100 nouns and calculate the top N elements closest to each noun in the similarity lists using the randomized algorithm described in Section 3.
    We then compare this output to the one provided by the system of Pantel and Lin (2002).
    For every noun in the top N list generated by our system we calculate the percentage overlap with the gold standard list.
    Results are reported in Table 5.
    The results shows that we are able to retrieve roughly 70% of the gold standard similarity list.
    In Table 6, we list the top 10 most similar words for some nouns, as examples, from the web corpus.
  
  
    NLP researchers have just begun leveraging the vast amount of knowledge available on the web.
    By searching IR engines for simple surface patterns, many applications ranging from word sense disambiguation, question answering, and mining s
