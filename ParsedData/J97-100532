ndaries), but insensitive to the statistical likelihood that agreements will occur.
    We have already discussed how variable the subjects' responses are, both in number and placement of segment boundaries, so we know that our subjects are not replicating the same behavior.
    However, all 20 narratives show the same pattern of responses as illustrated in Figure 3: certain boundaries are identified by large numbers of subjects.
    For any one narrative, we should expect a new set of seven subjects to yield roughly the same set of segment boundaries.
    In other words, our method for abstracting a single set of boundaries from the responses of multiple subjects should be reproducible.
    In Section 3.2.3, we evaluate our method by using Krippendorff's ct to evaluate the reliability of boundaries derived from one set of subjects compared with those derived from another set of subjects on the same narrative.
    Finally, for purposes of comparison with other studies of segmentation, we report percent agreem
