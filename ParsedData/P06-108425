sk, the improvement brought by the morpheme model over the word model is less significant, but still consists of a 5% error reduction.
    Unknown words account for a significant chunk of the errors.
    Table 5 shows the distribution of errors contributed by unknown words (words that cannot be analyzed by the morphological analyzer).
    7.5% of the words in the test corpus are unknown: 4% are not recognized at all by the morphological analyzer (marked as [None] in the table), and for 3.5%, the set of analyses proposed by the analyzer does not contain the correct analysis [Missing].
    We extended the lexicon to include missing and none lexemes of the closed sets.
    In addition, we modified the analyzer to extract all possible segmentations of unknown words, with all the possible tags for the segmented affixes, where the remaining unknown baseforms are tagged as UK.
    The model was trained over this set.
    In the next phase, the corpus was automatically tagged, according to the trained model, in order
