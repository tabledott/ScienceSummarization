on of T.&#65533; to t.Vi U t.E, that is, t.&#65533; = T.&#65533; n ((t.V i U t.E) x L).
    Let t.V be the set of nodes mentioned in t.E, or put t.V = {c} if t.Vi = t.E = 0.
    Finally, choose t.q freely from Q, and choose s : t.Vf &#8594; Q to associate states with the frontier nodes of t; the free choice is because the nodes of the derived tree T do not specify the states used during the derivation.
    How many elementary trees can we find that fit c?
    Let us impose an upper bound k on |t.V i |and hence on |U|.
    Then in an m-ary tree T, the above procedure considers at most mk&#65533;1 m&#65533;1 connected subgraphs U of order &lt; k rooted at c. For dependency grammars, limiting to m &lt; 6 and k = 3 is quite reasonable, leaving at most 43 subgraphs U rooted at each node c, of which the biggest contain only c, a child c' of c, and a child or sibling of c'.
    These will constitute the internal nodes of t, and their remaining children will be t&#8217;s frontier nodes.
    However, for each of these
