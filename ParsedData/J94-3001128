 all its string-pairs are epenthetic or none of them are, but we must do further analysis to guarantee that this is the case.
    In the formalism we are considering, T is permitted to be an arbitrary samelength relation, not just the single unit-length pair that two-level systems typically provide for.
    If T contains more than one string-pair, the single rule is interpreted as imposing the constraints that would be imposed by a conjunction of rules formed by substituting for T each of its member string-pairs in turn.
    Without further specification and even if 7- contains infinitely many pairs, this is the interpretation modeled by the Coerce relation, provided that T is homogeneous.
    To deal with heterogeneous T relations, we separate the epenthetic and nonepenthetic pairs into two distinct and homogeneous subrelations.
    We partition an arbitrary T into the subrelations r&#176; and T&#176; defined as We then recast a rule of the form T 4= A p as the conjunction of the two rules These rules taken
