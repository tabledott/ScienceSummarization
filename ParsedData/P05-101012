    The outside probability,&#10050;out, is calculated using&#10050;in and PCFG-LA parameters along the packed structure, like the outside probabilities for PCFGs.
    Once we have computed and , the parse tree that maximizes is found using a Viterbi algorithm, as in PCFG parsing.
    Several parsing algorithms that also use insideoutside calculation on packed chart have been proposed (Goodman, 1996b; Sima&#180;an, 2003; Clark and Curran, 2004).
    Those algorithms optimize some evaluation metric of parse trees other than the posterior probability , e.g., (expected) labeled constituent recall or (expected) recall rate of dependency relations contained in a parse.
    It is in contrast with our approach where (approximated) posterior probability is optimized.
  
  
    We conducted four sets of experiments.
    In the first set of experiments, the degree of dependency of trained models on initialization was examined because EM-style algorithms yield different results with different initial
