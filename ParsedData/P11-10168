of-speech tagging and dependency parsing are first performed on the context.
    Then predefined rules are matched in the context to determine the sentiment about the target.
    In (Hu and Liu, 2004), opinions are extracted from product reviews, where the features of the product are considered opinion targets.
    The sentiment about each target in each sentence of the review is determined based on the dominant orientation of the opinion words appearing in the sentence.
    As mentioned in Section 1, target-dependent sentiment classification of review sentences is quite different from that of tweets.
    In reviews, if any sentiment is expressed in a sentence containing a feature, it is very likely that the sentiment is about the feature.
    However, the assumption does not hold in tweets.
    As Twitter becomes more popular, sentiment analysis on Twitter data becomes more attractive.
