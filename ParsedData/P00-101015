t&#8221; in the same sentence Some: presence of &#8220;some&#8221; in the same sentence Year: presence of &#8220;year&#8221; in the same sentence CCYY: presence of a four-digit year in the same sentence DOW: presence of a day of the week expression (&#8220;Monday&#8221; thru &#8220;Sunday&#8221;) in the same sentence FW: &#8220;today&#8221; is the first word of the sentence POST: part-of-speech of the word before &#8220;today&#8221; POS2: part-of-speech of the word after &#8220;today&#8221; Label: specific or non-specific (class label) Table 3 shows the performance of different classifiers in classifying occurrences of &#8220;today&#8221; as generic versus specific.
    The results are for 377 training vectors and 191 test vectors, measured in terms of Predictive Accuracy (percentage test vectors correctly classified).
    We incorporated some of the rules learnt by C4.5 Rules (the only classifier which directly output rules) into the current version of the program.
    These rules included classifying &#8220
