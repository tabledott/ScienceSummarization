nts for rejecting the ATN model of discourse structure.
    We have indicated before, however, that accommodating this phenomenon is at worst a matter of minor technical extensions of the ATNformalism (Polanyi and Scha, 1983b); in the present paper, we shall from now on ignore it.
    III DISCOURSE CONSTITUENT UNITS A.
    Introduction.
    This section reviews some important ways in which clauses (being our elementary discourse constituent units) can be combined to form complex discourse constituent units (which, in most cases, may be further combined to form larger dcu' s, by recursive application of the same mechanisms).
    For the moment, we are thus focussing on the basic discourse syntactic patterns which make it possible to construct complex discourses, and on the semantic interpretation of these patterns.
    Sections IV and V will then discuss the higher level structures, where the interactional perspective on discourse comes more to the fore.
    To be able to focus on discourse level phenomena, we
