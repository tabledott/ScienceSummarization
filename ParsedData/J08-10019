se utterances, distinguishing between salient entities and the rest.
    The intuition here is that texts about the same discourse entity are perceived to be more coherent than texts fraught with abrupt switches from one topic to the next.
    The patterned distribution of discourse entities is a natural consequence of topic continuity observed in a coherent text.
    Centering Theory formalizes fluctuations in topic continuity in terms of transitions between adjacent utterances.
    The transitions are ranked, that is, texts demonstrating certain types of transitions are deemed more coherent than texts where such transitions are absent or infrequent.
    For example, CONTINUE transitions require that two utterances have at least one entity in common and are preferred over transitions that repeatedly SHIFT from one entity to the other.
    Givon&#8217;s (1987) and Hoey&#8217;s (1991) accounts of discourse continuity complement local measurements by considering global characteristics of entity distribution, su
