o extend the pattern vocabulary (when developing the system, we have noticed that different registers and verb types require different patterns).
    Another possibility would be to use more relaxed patterns when the part of speech confusion is not likely (e.g.
    &amp;quot;eat&amp;quot; is a common verb which does not have a noun sense, and patterns need not protect against noun senses when testing such verbs).
    Our approach can potentially be extended to multiword paths.
    DIRT actually provides two orders of magnitude more relations than the 29,165 single verb relations (subject-verb-object) we extracted.
    On the same 1GB corpus described in Section 5.1, DIRT extracted over 200K paths and 6M unique paraphrases.
    These provide an opportunity to create a much larger corpus of semantic relations, or to construct smaller, in-depth resources for selected subdomains.
    For example, we could extract that take a trip to is similar to travel to, and that board a plane happens before deplane.
