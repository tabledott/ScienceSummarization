, most existing methods for mapping NL sentences to logical forms involve substantial hand-written components that are difficult to maintain (Joshi and Vijay-Shanker, 2001; Bayer et al., 2004; Bos, 2005).
    Zettlemoyer and Collins (2005) present a statistical method that is considerably more robust, but it still relies on hand-written rules for lexical acquisition, which can create a performance bottleneck.
    In this work, we show that methods developed for SMT can be brought to bear on tasks where logical forms are involved, such as semantic parsing.
    In particular, we extend the WASP semantic parsing algorithm by adding variable-binding &#955;-operators to the underlying SCFG.
    The resulting synchronous grammar generates logical forms using &#955;-calculus (Montague, 1970).
    A semantic parser is learned given a set of sentences and their correct logical forms using SMT methods.
    The new algorithm is called &#955;WASP, and is shown to be the best-performing system so far in the GEOQUERY domai
