 and circle denote the performance of our method.
    0.8, we evaluated the token precision and the relative recall in the domains of digital cameras and movies.
    Figure 4 shows the results.
    The results showed both relative recall and token precision were lower than in our method for every 0, in both corpora.
    The optimum 0 was 0.3 in the movie domain and 0.1 in the digital camera domain.
    Therefore, in this preset approach, a tuning process is necessary for each domain.
    Our method does not require this tuning, and thus fully automatic learning was possible.
    Unlike the normal precision-recall tradeoff, the token precision in the movie domain got lower when the 0 is strict.
    This is due to the frequent polar atoms which can be acquired at the low ratios of the polarity.
    Our method does not discard these important polar atoms.
    We also tested the performance while varying the size of the initial lexicon L. We prepared three subsets of the initial lexicon, L0.8, L0.5, and L0.2, rem
