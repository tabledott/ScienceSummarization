 between positive and negative polarity greatly degrades when neutral instances are included in the experiments.
    We also found that achieving the best performance for recognizing contextual polarity requires a wide variety of features.
    This is particularly true for distinguishing between neutral and polar instances.
    Although some features help to increase polar or neutral recall or precision, it is only the combination of features together that achieves significant improvements in accuracy over the baselines.
    Our experiments show that for distinguishing between positive and negative instances, features capturing negation are clearly the most important.
    However, there is more to the story than simple negation.
    Features that capture relationships between instances of clues also perform well, indicating that identifying features that represent more complex interdependencies between sentiment clues may be an important avenue for future research.
