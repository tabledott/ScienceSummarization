 (Stevens 1975), which Bard, Robertson, and Sorace (1996) and Cowart (1997) have applied to the elicitation of linguistic judgments.
    The ME procedure requires subjects to estimate the magnitude of physical stimuli by assigning numerical values proportional to the stimulus magnitude they perceive.
    In contrast to the five- or seven-point scale conventionally used to measure human intuitions, ME employs an interval scale and therefore produces data for which parametric inferential statistics are valid.
    ME requires subjects to assign numbers to a series of linguistic stimuli in a proportional fashion.
    Subjects are first exposed to a modulus item, to which they assign an arbitrary number.
    All other stimuli are rated proportional to the modulus.
    In this way, each subject can establish his or her own rating scale, thus yielding maximally finegraded data and avoiding the known problems with the conventional ordinal scales for linguistic data (Bard, Robertson, and Sorace 1996; Cowart 1997; Sch&
