ccounts of popular newspapers like &#8220;New York Times&#8221;, &#8220;Washington Posts&#8221; etc.
    They report that POS and bigrams both help (contrary to results presented by Go et al. (2009)).
    Both these approaches, however, are primarily based on ngram models.
    Moreover, the data they use for training and testing is collected by search queries and is therefore biased.
    In contrast, we present features that achieve a significant gain over a unigram baseline.
    In addition we explore a different method of data representation and report significant improvement over the unigram models.
    Another contribution of this paper is that we report results on manually annotated data that does not suffer from any known biases.
    Our data is a random sample of streaming tweets unlike data collected by using specific queries.
    The size of our hand-labeled data allows us to perform crossvalidation experiments and check for the variance in performance of the classifier across folds.
