he parts of speech of the head word and the content word respectively.
    These features are called hPos and cPos and are illustrated in Figure 4.
    Both these features generate an implicit yet simple backoff solution for the lexicalized features HEAD WORD (hw) and CONTENT WORD (cw).
    Predicate arguments often contain names or other expressions identified by named entity (NE) recognizers, e.g. dates, prices.
    Thus we believe that this form of semantic information should be introduced in the learning model.
    In FS2 we added the following features: (a) the named entity class of the content word (cNE); and (b) a set of NE features that can take only Boolean values grouped as BOOLEAN NAMED ENTITY FEATURES and defined in Figure 4.
    The cNE feature helps recognize the argument roles, e.g.
    ARGM-LOC and ARGM-TMP, when location or temporal expressions are identified.
    The Boolean NE flags provide information useful in processing complex nominals occurring in argument constituents.
    For example
