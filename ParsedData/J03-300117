 consequent estimates of the size of the German-language Web indexed by AltaVista.
    We set aside words which give discrepant predictions (too high or too low) as (1) AltaVista does not record in its index the language a word comes from, so the count for the string die includes both the German and English occurrences, and (2) a word might be under- or overrepresented in the training corpus or on the Web (consider here, which occurs very often in &#8220;click here&#8221;).
    Averaging the remaining predictions gives an estimate of three billion words of German that could be accessed through AltaVista on the day in February 2000 that we conducted our test. oder 0.00561180 13,566,463 2,417,488,684 sind 0.00477555 11,944,284 2,501,132,644 auch 0.00581108 15,504,327 2,668,062,907 wird 0.00400690 11,286,438 2,816,750,605 nicht 0.00646585 18,294,174 2,829,353,294 eine 0.00691066 19,739,540 2,856,389,983 sich 0.00604594 17,547,518 2,902,363,900 ist 0.00886430 26,429,327 2,981,546,991 auf 0.00744444 24,852,802 3,3
