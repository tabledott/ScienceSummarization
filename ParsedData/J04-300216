    A subjective element is an instance of a potential subjective element, in a particular context, that is indeed subjective in that context (Wiebe 1994).
    In this article, we focus on learning lexical items that are associated with subjectivity (i.e., PSEs) and then using them in concert to disambiguate instances of them (i.e., to determine whether the instances are subjective elements).
    In our subjectivity annotation projects, we do not give the annotators lists of particular words and phrases to look for.
    Rather, we ask them to label sentences according to their interpretations in context.
    As a result, the annotators consider a large variety of expressions when performing annotations.
    We use data that have been manually annotated at the expression level, the sentence level, and the document level.
    For diversity, we use data from the Wall Street Journal Treebank as well as
