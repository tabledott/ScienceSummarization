revious tags, we can rewrite the figure of merit as follows: Now we add some new independence assumptions.
    We assume that the probability of the nonterminal depends only on the immediately preceding tag, and that the probability of the tag immediately following the nonterminal depends only on the nonterminal (see Figure 10), giving: We can calculate 0(1\711,k) and the tritag probabilities as usual.
    The p(1\1`bk I tj_i) and p(tk Nihk) probabilities are estimated from our training data by parsing the training data and counting the occurrences of the nonterminal and the tag weighted by their probability in the parse.
    Again, see Appendix B for details of how these estimates were obtained.
    We will refer to this figure as the boundary trigram estimate.
    We also wished to examine whether contextual information by itself is sufficient as a figure of merit.
    We can derive an estimate based only on easily computable contextual information as follows: Most of the independence assumptions we make ar
