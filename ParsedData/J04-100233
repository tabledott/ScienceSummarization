 
    This section describes the evaluation of CorMet against a gold standard, specifically, by determining how many of the metaphors in a subset of the Master Metaphor List (Lakoff, Espenson, and Schwartz 1991) can be discovered by CorMet given a characterization of the relevant source and target domains.
    The final evaluation of the correspondence between the mappings CorMet discovers and the Master Metaphor List entry is necessarily done by hand.
    This is a highly subjective method of evaluation; a formal, objective evaluation of correctness would be preferable, but at present no such metric is available.
    The Master Metaphor List is the basis for evaluation because it is composed of manually verified metaphors common in English.
    The test set is restricted to those elements of the Master Metaphor List with concrete source and target domains.
    This requirement excludes many important conventional metaphors, such as EVENTS ARE ACTIONS.
    About a fifth of the Master Metaphor List meets this
