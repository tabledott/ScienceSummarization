mance of a DM model (even in its current implementation) in the large and multifarious set of tasks we presented.
    Of course, many issues are still open.
    It is one thing to claim that the models that outperform TypeDM do so because they rely on larger corpora; it is another to show that TypeDM trained on more data does reach the top of the current heap.
    The differences between TypeDM and the other, generally worse-performing DM models remind us that the idea of a shared distributional memory per se is not enough to obtain good results, and the extraction of an ideal DM from the corpus certainly demands further attention.
    We need to reach a better understanding of which pieces of distributional information to extract, and whether different semantic tasks require focusing on specific subsets of distributional data.
    Another issue we completely ignored but which will be of fundamental importance in applications is how a DM-based system can deal with outof-vocabulary items.
    Ideally, we would
