ributed by on (&#8216;on-rel&#8217;) shares its handle (h7) with the ep contributed by the verb it is modifying (&#8216;study-rel&#8217;).
    As such, the two will always have the same scope; no quantifier can intervene.
    Further, the second argument of the on-rel (e) is the event variable of the study-rel.
    The first argument, e', is the event variable of the on-rel and the third argument, z, is the instance variable of the spaceship-rel.
    In (3), the ep contributed by the scopal modifier probably (&#8216;probably-rel&#8217;) has its own handle (h7) which is not shared by anything.
    Furthermore, it takes a handle (h8) rather than the event variable of the study-rel as its argument. h8 is equal modulo quantifiers (QEQ) to the handle of the study-rel (h9), and h7 is equal modulo quantifiers to the argument of the prpstn-rel (h2).
    The prpstn-rel is the ep representing the illocutionary force of the whole expression.
    This means that quantifiers associated with the NPs Keanu and Kung Fu can s
