od called char_align.
    The method was intended as a replacement for sentence-based methods (e.g., (Brown et al., 1991a; Gale and Church, 1991b; Kay and Rosenschein, 1993)), which are very sensitive to noise.
    This paper describes a new program, called word_align, that starts with an initial &amp;quot;rough&amp;quot; alignment (e.g., the output of char_a/ign or a sentence-based alignment method), and produces improved alignments by exploiting constraints at the word-level.
    The alignment algorithm consists of two steps: (1) estimate translation probabilities, and (2) use these probabilities to search for most probable alignment path.
    The two steps are described in the following section.
  
  
    The translation probabilities are estimated using a method based on Brown et al. 's Model 2 (1993), which is summarized in the following subsection, 2.1.1.
    Then, in subsection 2.1.2, we describe modifications that achieve three goals: (1) enable word_align to accept input which may not be aligned by s
