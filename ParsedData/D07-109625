tems in the multilin gual track, and ten systems in the domain adaptationtrack (six of which also participated in the multilin gual track).
			In the result tables below, systems are identified by the last name of the teammember listed first when test runs were uploaded for evaluation.
			In general, this name is also the first author of a paper describing the system in the proceedings, but there are a few exceptions and complications.
			First of all, for four out of twenty-seven systems, no paper was submitted to the proceedings.
