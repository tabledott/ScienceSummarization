of those values.
    For example, Generalization seems to be a very useful notion for expressing how number and gender agreement works in coordinate noun phrases.
    One curious fact about coordination is that conjunction of &amp;quot;I&amp;quot; with &amp;quot;you&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;he&amp;quot; in the subject position typically produces first person verb agreement.

    The problem is discussed in Section V below.
  
  
    Most current grammar formalisms for features have certain built-in limitations.
    Three are relevant here: The prohibition against cyclicity rules out structures that contain circular paths, as in the following example.
    Here the path &lt;a b c&gt; folds back onto i
