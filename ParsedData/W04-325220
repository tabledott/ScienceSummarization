ecommends&#8221; (and therefore has a directed arc to) the candidate keyword that follows in the text, keeping the restraint imposed by the co-occurrence relation.
    We have also tried the reversed direction, where a lexical unit points to a previous token in the text.
    Table 1 includes the results obtained with directed graphs for a co-occurrence window of 2.
    Regardless of the direction chosen for the arcs, results obtained with directed graphs are worse than results obtained with undirected graphs, which suggests that despite a natural flow in running text, there is no natural &#8220;direction&#8221; that can be established between cooccurring words.
    Overall, our TextRank system leads to an Fmeasure higher than any of the previously proposed systems.
    Notice that TextRank is completely unsupervised, and unlike other supervised systems, it relies exclusively on information drawn from the text itself, which makes it easily portable to other text collections, domains, and languages.
