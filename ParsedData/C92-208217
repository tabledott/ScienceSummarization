  The approach presented in this paper, using the algorithm sketched in the previous ubsection, is potentially extensible.
  3 Incorporating Results i n to WordNet To validate this acquisition method, we compared the results of a restricted version of the algorithm with information found in WordNet.
  2 WordNet (Miller et al.
  1990) is a hand-built online thesaurus whose organization is modeled after the results of psycbolin- guistic research.
  To use tile authors words, Wordnet "... is an attempt o organize lexical information in terms of word meanings, rather than word forms.
