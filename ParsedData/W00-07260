    Text chunking is a useful preprocessing step for parsing.
    There has been a large interest in recognizing non-overlapping noun phrases (Ramshaw and Marcus (1995) and follow-up papers) but relatively little has been written about identifying phrases of other syntactic categories.
    The CoNLL-2000 shared task attempts to fill this gap.
  
  
    Text chunking consists of dividing a text into phrases in such a way that syntactically related words become member of the same phrase.
    These phrases are non-overlapping which means that one word can only be a member of one chunk Here is an example sentence: [NP He ] [vp reckons ] [NP the current account deficit] [vp will narrow] [pp to [NP only 1.8 billion] [pp in] [NP September] .

    As far as we know, there are no annotated corpora available which cont
