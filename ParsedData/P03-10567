   For purposes of statistical parsing, three salient differences distinguish the two languages.
    First, Chinese makes less use of function words and morphology than English: determinerless nouns are more widespread, plural marking is restricted and rare, and verbs appear in a unique form with few supporting function words.
    Second, whereas English is largely left-headed and right-branching, Chinese is more mixed: most categories are right-headed, but verbal and prepositional complements follow their heads (Figure 2).
    Significantly, this means that attachment ambiguity among a verb's complements, a major source of parsing ambiguity in English, is rare in Chinese.
    The third major difference is subject pro-drop the null realization of uncontrolled pronominal subjects which is widespread in Chinese, but rare in English.
    This creates ambiguities between parses of subjectless structures as IP (equivalent to ETB's S) or as VP, and between interpretations of preverbal NPs as NP adjuncts or as subje
