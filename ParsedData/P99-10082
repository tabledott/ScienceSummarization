    In this paper we apply much the same methodology to the part-of relation.
    Indeed, in [2] Hearst states that she tried to apply this strategy to the part-of relation, but failed.
    We comment later on the differences in our approach that we believe were most important to our comparative success.
    Looking more widely still, there is an evergrowing literature on the use of statistical/corpusbased techniques in the automatic acquisition of lexical-semantic knowledge ([3-8]).
    We take it as axiomatic that such knowledge is tremendously useful in a wide variety of tasks, from lower-level tasks like noun-phrase reference, and parsing to user-level tasks such as web searches, question answering, and digesting.
