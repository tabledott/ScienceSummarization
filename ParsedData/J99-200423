corpora.
    The second and larger data set was collected by converting the Penn Treebank parses of the Wall Street Journal sentences.
    The objective was to associate each lexical item of a sentence with a supertag, given the phrase structure parse of the sentence.
    This process involved a number of heuristics based on local tree contexts.
    The heuristics made use of information about the labels of a word's dominating nodes (parent, grandparent, and great-grandparent), labels of its siblings (left and right) and siblings of its parent.
    An example of the result of this conversion is shown in Figure 5.
    It must be noted that this conversion is not perfect and is correct only to a first order of approximation owing mostly to errors in conversion and lack of certain kinds of information such as distinction between adjunct and argument preposition phrases, in the Penn Treebank parses.
    Even though the converted supertag corpus can be refined further, the corpus in its present form has proved to
