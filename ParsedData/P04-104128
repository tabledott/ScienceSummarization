in f-structure, not trees.
			The method achieves a preds-only f-score of 80.97% for f-structures with the PA-PCFG in the integrated architecture against the DCU 105and 78.4% against the 2,416 automatically gener ated f-structures for the original Penn-II treebanktrees.
			Evaluating against the PARC 700 Depen dency Bank, the P-PCFG achieves an f-score of 80.24%, an overall improvement of approximately 0.6% on the result reported for the best hand-crafted grammars in (Kaplan et al, 2004).
