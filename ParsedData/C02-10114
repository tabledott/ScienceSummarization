 phrase.
			Since the context vector of the word or phrase to be translated corresponds to words in the source language, while the context vector of a translation candidate corresponds to words in the target language, and further the words in the source language and those in the target language have a many-to-many relationship (i.e., translation ambiguities), it is necessary to accurately transform the context vector in the source language to a context vector in the target language before distance calculation.
			The vector-transformation problem was not, however, well-resolved previously.
			Fung and Yee assumed that in a specific domain there is only one-to-one mapping relationship between words in the two languages.
			The assumption is reasonable in a specific domain, but is too strict in the general domain, in which we presume to perform translation here.
			A straightforward extension of Fung and Yee?s assumption to the general domain is to restrict the many-to-many relationship to that of many-to-one m
