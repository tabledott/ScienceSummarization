  The procedure works u follows.
  It k a reeumve procedure (Couvert_to_HG) which takes in two patametsrs, the first representing the node oe which it k being ?pplied and the ~e~ood the label appearing on the left-hand side of the HG productions for this node.
  ff X is a ~onterminal, for each auxiliary tree ~ whose root hu the label X, we obtain ?
  sequence of production- such that the rmst one has X on the left-hand side.
  Using these productions, we can defoe the string Wl~W ~ where n derived tree in D(~) has ?
