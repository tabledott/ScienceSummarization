ive to collocational information.
    At first, VOLSUNGA multiplied raw relative frequencies into the path probability calculations; but the ratios were so high in some cases as to totally swamp collocational data.
    Thus, normalization is required.
    The present solution is a simple one; all ratios over a fixed limit are truncated to that limit.
    Implementing RTPs increased accuracy by approximately 4%, to the range 95-97%, with a peak of 97.5% on one small sample.
    Thus, about half of the residual errors were eliminated.
    It is likely that tuning the normalization would improve this figure slightly more.
    VOLSUNGA was not designed with psychological reality as a goal, though it has some plausible characteristics.
    We will consider a few of these briefly.
    This section should not be interpreted as more than suggestive.
    First, consider dictionary learning; the program currently assumes that a full dictionary is available.
    This assumption is nearly true for mature language users,
