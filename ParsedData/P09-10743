    For our investigations, we employ a state-of-the-art classification-based NP coreference resolver and focus on the widely used MUC and ACE coreference resolution data sets.
    We hypothesize that performance variation within and across coreference resolvers is, at least in part, a function of (1) the (sometimes unstated) assumptions in evaluation methodologies, and (2) the relative difficulty of the benchmark text corpora.
    With these in mind, Section 3 first examines three subproblems that play an important role in coreference resolution: named entity recognition, anaphoricity determination, and coreference element detection.
    We quantitatively measure the impact of each of these subproblems on coreference resolution performance as a whole.
    Our results suggest that the availability of accurate detectors for anaphoricity or coreference elements could substantially improve the performance of state-ofthe-art resolvers, while improvements to named entity recognition likely offer little gain
