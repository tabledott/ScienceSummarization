ples there are similar or near to it.
    So, the examples with high representative degree are less likely to be an outlier.
    Adding them to the training set will have effect on a large number of unlabeled examples.
    There are only a few works considering this selection criterion (McCallum and Nigam 1998; Tang et al. 2002) and both of them are specific to their tasks, viz. text classification and statistical parsing.
    In this section, we compute the similarity between words using a general vector-based measure, extend this measure to named entity level using dynamic time warping algorithm and quantify the representativeness of a named entity by its density.
    In general vector space model, the similarity between two vectors may be measured by computing the cosine value of the angle between them.
    The smaller the angle is, the more similar between the vectors are.
    This measure, called cosine-similarity measure, has been widely used in information retrieval tasks (Baeza-Yates and Ribeiro-Neto
