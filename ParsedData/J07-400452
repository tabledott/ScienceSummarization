y structures, namely, sets of CCG predicate&#8211;argument dependencies, as described earlier.
    We follow Riezler et al. (2002) in using a discriminative estimation method by maximizing the conditional log-likelihood of the model given the data, minus a Gaussian prior 2 We could model predicate&#8211;argument dependencies together with the derivation, but we wanted to use features from the derivation only, following Hockenmaier and Steedman (2002b).
    Clark and Curran Wide-Coverage Efficient Statistical Parsing term to prevent overfitting (Chen and Rosenfeld 1999; Johnson et al. 1999).
    Thus, given training sentences S1,..., Sm, gold-standard dependency structures, &#960;1, ... , &#960;m, and the definition of the probability of a dependency structure from Equation (13), the objective function is: where L(&#923;) is the log-likelihood of model &#923;, G(&#923;) is the Gaussian prior term, and n is the number of features.
    We use a single smoothing parameter &#963;, so that &#963;i = &#963; for all
