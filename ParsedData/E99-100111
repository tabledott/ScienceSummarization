s, universities, etc.) from financial Web sites, and a list of 27,000 famous people from several websites.
    The results of this run can be seen in Figure 1 in the &amp;quot;common lists&amp;quot; column.
    In essence, this system's performance was comparable to that of the system using lists from the training set as far as location was concerned; it performed slightly worse on the person category and performed badly on organisations.
    In a final experiment we combined the two gazetteers, the one induced from the training texts with the one acquired from public resources, and achieved some improvement in recall at the expense of precision.
    The results of this test run are given in the &amp;quot;combined lists&amp;quot; column in Figure 1.
    We can conclude that the pure list lookup approach performs reasonably well for locations (precision of 90-94%; recall of 75-85%).
    For the person category and especially for the organization category this approach does not yield good performance: although
