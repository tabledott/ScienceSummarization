ontribution, and the &amp;quot;cost effectiveness,&amp;quot; of each of them.
    Such comparative evaluations are not available yet, not even for systems that incorporate several types of data (e.g., McRoy 1992).
    Further research is therefore needed to cornpare the relative importance of different information types and to find optimal ways of combining them.
    When training a statistical model for sense disambiguation, it is necessary to associate the acquired statistics with word senses.
    This seems to require manual tagging of the training corpus with the appropriate sense for each occurrence of an ambiguous word.
    A similar approach is being used for stochastic part of speech taggers and probabilistic parsers, relying on the availability of large, manually tagged (or parsed), corpora for training.
    However, this approach is less feasible for sense disambiguation, for two reasons.
    First, the size of corpora required to acquire sufficient statistics on lexical cooccurrence is usually much
