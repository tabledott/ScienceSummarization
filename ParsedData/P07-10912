    Therefore, while short-distance reordering is under the scope of the distance-based model, long-distance reordering is simply out of the question.
    A terminological remark: In the rest of the paper, we will use the terms global reordering and local reordering in place of long-distance reordering and short-distance reordering respectively.
    The distinction between long and short distance reordering is solely defined by distortion limit.
    Syntax1 is certainly a potential solution to global reordering.
    For example, for the last two Chinese phrases in figure 1(a), simply swapping the two children of the NP node will produce the correct word order on the English side.
    However, there are also reorderings which do not agree with syntactic analysis.
    Figure 1(b) shows how our phrase-based decoder2 obtains a good English translation by reordering two blocks.
    It should be noted that the second Chinese block &#8220;R#, HI&#8221; and its English counterpart &#8220;at the end of&#8
