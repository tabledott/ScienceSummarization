essary to duplicate Collins&#8217; benchmark results.
    Indeed, these as-yet-unpublished details account for an 11% relative increase in error from an implementation including all details to a clean-room implementation of Collins&#8217; model.
    We have also shown a cleaner and equally well-performing method for the handling of punctuation and conjunction, and we have revealed certain other probabilistic oddities about Collins&#8217; parser.
    We have not only analyzed the effect of the unpublished details but also reanalyzed the effect of certain well-known details, revealing that bilexical dependencies are barely used by the model and that head choice is not nearly as important to overall parsing performance as once thought.
    Finally, we have performed experiments that show that the true discriminative power of lexicalization appears to lie in the fact that unlexicalized syntactic structures are generated conditioning on the headword and head tag.
    These results regarding the lack of reliance on
