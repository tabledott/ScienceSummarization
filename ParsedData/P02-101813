hm also records how often each pattern was seen; this is shown in the &#8220;count&#8221; column of Table 2.
    The next step of the algorithm determines approximately how many times each pattern can match some subtree of a version of the training corpus from which all empty nodes have been removed (regardless of whether or not the corresponding substitutions would insert empty nodes correctly).
    This information is shown under the &#8220;match&#8221; column in Table 2, and is used to filter patterns which would most often be incorrect to apply even though they match.
    If c is the count value for a pattern and m is its match value, then the algorithm discards that pattern when the lower bound of a 67% confidence interval for its success probability (given c successes out of m trials) is less than 1/2.
    This is a standard technique for &#8220;discounting&#8221; success probabilities from small sample size data (Witten and Frank, 2000).
    (As explained immediately below, the estimates of c and m giv
