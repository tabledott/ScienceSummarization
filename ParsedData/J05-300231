    For each node of the basis tree, we record all verbalizations from the nodes of the other input trees aligned with a given node.
    A verbalization can be a single word, or it can be a phrase, if a node represents a noun compound or a verb with a particle.
    An example of a fusion lattice, augmented A basis lattice before and after augmentation.
    Solid lines represent aligned edges of the basis tree.
    Dashed lines represent unaligned edges of the basis tree, and dotted lines represent insertions from other theme sentences.
    Added subtrees correspond to sentences from Table 1. with alternative verbalizations, is given in Figure 6.
    Even after this augmentation, the fusion lattice may not include all of the intersection subtrees.
    The main difficulty in subtree insertion is finding an acceptable placement; this is often determined by syntactic, semantic, and idiosyncratic knowledge.
    Therefore, we follow a conservative insertion policy.
    Among all the possible aligne
