 when we realize that there is no other good candidate for a THEME argument, because to 108.1 million shares must be a TARGET and yesterday is most likely ARGM-TMP, we can correctly label it THEME.
    Even though previous work has modeled some correlations between the labels of parse tree nodes (see Section 2), many important phenomena have not been modeled.
    The key properties needed to model this joint structure are: (1) no finite Markov horizon assumption for dependencies among node labels, (2) features looking at the labels of multiple argument nodes and internal features of these nodes, and (3) a statistical model capable of incorporating these long-distance dependencies and generalizing well.
    We show how to build a joint model of argument frames, incorporating novel features into a discriminative log-linear model.
    This system achieves an error reduction of 24.1% on ALL arguments and 36.8% on CORE arguments over a state-of-the-art independent classifier for gold-standard parse trees on Propba
