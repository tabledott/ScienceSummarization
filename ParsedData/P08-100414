    RESOLVER uses a probabilistic model to predict if two strings refer to the same item, based on relational features, in an unsupervised manner.
    In Section 5.2 we report that RESOLVER boosts the recall of O-CRF by 50%.
    To compare the behavior of open, or &#8220;unlexicalized,&#8221; extraction to relation-specific, or &#8220;lexicalized&#8221; extraction, we developed a CRF-based extractor under the traditional RE paradigm.
    We refer to this system as R1-CRF.
    Although the graphical structure of R1-CRF is the same as O-CRF R1-CRF differs in a few ways.
    A given relation R is specified a priori, and R1-CRF is trained from hand-labeled positive and negative instances of R. The extractor is also permitted to use all lexical features, and is not restricted to closedclass words as is O-CRF.
    Since R is known in advance, if R1-CRF outputs a tuple at extraction time, the tuple is believed to be an instance of R.
