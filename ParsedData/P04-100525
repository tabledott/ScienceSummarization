the advantages of probabilistic models is that they can be integrated with other probabilistic models in a principled way, and it would be interesting to investigate how to integrate this kind of model of speech repairs with probabilistic speech recognizers.
    There are other kinds of joint models of reparandum and repair that may produce a better reparandum detection system.
    We have experimented with versions of the models described above based on POS bi-tag dependencies rather than word bigram dependencies, but with results very close to those presented here.
    Still, more sophisticated models may yield better performance.
    It would also be interesting to combine this probabilistic model of speech repairs with the word classifier approach of Charniak and Johnson (2001).
    That approach may do so well because many speech repairs are very short, involving only one or two words Shriberg and Stolcke (1998), so the reparandum, interregnum and repair are all contained in the surrounding word window u
