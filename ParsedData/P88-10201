    The question of whether such additional material should be included at all is not addressed; the structurer tries to say everything it is given.
    The structurer produces all coherent paragraphs (that is, coherent as defined by the relations) that satisfy the given goal(s) for any set of input elements.
    For example, paragraph (b) is produced to the initial goal S H (SEQUENCE goal is produced by PEA, together with the appropriate representation ele- (ASK-I. in response to the does the system a program?.
    Different initial goals will result in different paragraphs.
    Each paragraph is represented as a tree in which branch points are RST relations and leaves are input elements.
    Figure 1 is the tree for para- (b).
    It contains the relations (signalled by 'then' and 'finally&amp;quot;), Elaboration (&amp;quot;in particular&amp;quot;), and Purpose (&amp;quot;in order to&amp;quot;).
