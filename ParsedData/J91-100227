istance between words in a chain is a factor in chain formation.
    The distance will not be &amp;quot;large,&amp;quot; because words in a chain co-relate due to recognizable relations, and large distances would interfere with the recognition of relations.
    The five texts were analyzed with respect to distance between clearly related words.
    The analysis showed that there can be up to two or three intermediary sentences between a word and the preceding element of a chain segment with which it can be linked.
    At distances of four or more intermediary sentences, the word is only able to signal a return to an existing chain.
    Returns happened after between 4 and 19 intermediary sentences in the sample texts.
    One significant fact emerged from this analysis: returns consisting of one word only were always made with a repetition of one of the words in the returned-to chain.
    Returns consisting of more than one word did not necessarily use repetition &#8212; in fact in most cases, the first word
