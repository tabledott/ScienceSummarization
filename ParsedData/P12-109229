be used to represent word contexts as low-dimensional weighted average vectors, which are then clustered to form different meaning groups and used to learn multi-prototype vectors.
			We introduced a new dataset with human judgments on similarity between pairs of words in context, so as to evaluate model?s abilities to capture homonymy and polysemy of words in context.
			Ournew multi-prototype neural language model outperforms previous neural models and competitive base lines on this new dataset.
