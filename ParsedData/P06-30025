 partitionings yields a set of word forms belonging to the same derived syntactic category.
    To gain on text coverage, we add ambiguous high-frequency words that were discarded for partitioning 1 to the lexicon.
    Finally, we train a Viterbi tagger with this lexicon and augment it with an affix classifier for unknown words.
    The resulting taggers are evaluated against outputs of supervised taggers for various languages.
  
  
    The method employed here follows the coarse methodology as described in the introduction, but differs from other works in several respects.
    Although we use 4-word context windows and the top frequency words as features (as in Sch&#252;tze 1995), we transform the cosine similarity values between the vectors of our target words into a graph representation.
    Additionally, we provide a methdology to identify and incorporate POS-ambiguous words as well as low-frequency words into the lexicon.
    Let us consider a weighted, undirected graph G(V,E) (v&#8712;V vertices, (vi,v
