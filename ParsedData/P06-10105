rable corpora.
  
  
    We assume that we have comparable corpora, consisting of newspaper articles in English and Chinese from the same day, or almost the same day.
    In our experiments we use data from the English and Chinese stories from the Xinhua News agency for about 6 months of 2001.2 We assume that we have identified names for persons and locations&#8212;two types that have a strong tendency to be transliterated wholly or mostly phonetically&#8212;in the English text; in this work we use the named-entity recognizer described in (Li et al., 2004), which is based on the SNoW machine learning toolkit (Carlson et al., 1999).
    To perform the transliteration task, we propose the following general three-step approach: The intuition behind the third step is the following.
    Suppose several high-confidence name transliteration pairs occur in a pair of English and Chinese documents.
    Intuitively, this would increase our confidence in the other plausible transliteration pairs in the same document pair
