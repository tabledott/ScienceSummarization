ts some results that we obtained with the three stages of Xtract.
  
  
    Results obtained from The Jerusalem Post corpus have already been reported (e.g., Smadja 1991).
    Figure 12 gives some results for the three-stage process of Xtract on a 10 million&#8212;word corpus of stock market reports taken from the Associated Press newswire.
    The collocations are given in the following format.
    The first line contains the bigrams with the distance, so that &amp;quot;sales fell &#8212;1&amp;quot; says that the two words under consideration are &amp;quot;sales&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;fell,&amp;quot; and that the distance we are considering is &#8212;1.
    The first line is thus the output of stage 1.
    The second line gives the output of stage 2, i.e., the n-grams.
    For example, &amp;quot;takeover-thwart&amp;quot; is retrieved as &amp;quot;44 to thwart AT takeover NN &amp;quot;AT stands for article, NN stands for nouns, and 44 is the number of times this collocation has been retrieved in the corpus.
