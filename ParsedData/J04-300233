 size n, where n = 20,40,..., 2420, 2440 documents.
    Each data point is an average over 25 sample corpora of size n. The sample corpora were chosen from the concatenation of OP1 and OP2, in which 9% of the documents are opinion pieces.
    The sample corpora were created by randomly selecting documents from the large corpus, preserving the 9% distribution of opinion pieces.
    At the smallest corpus size (containing 20 documents), the average number of words is 9,617.
    At the largest corpus size (containing 2440 documents), the average is 1,225,186 words.
    As can be seen in the figure, the precision of unique and other low-frequency words increases with corpus size, with increases tapering off at the largest corpus size tested.
    Words with frequency 2 also realize a nice increase, although one that is not as dramatic, in precision over baseline.
    Even words of frequency 3, 4, and 5 show modest increases.
    To help us understand the importance of low-frequency words in large as opposed to sma
