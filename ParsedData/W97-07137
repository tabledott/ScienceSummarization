hese assumptions hold In this paper, we describe experiments that show that the concepts of rhetorical analysis and nucleanty can be used effectively for determining the most important units in a text We show how these concepts were implemented and discuss results that we obtained with a discoursebased summarization program 2 From discourse trees to summaries &#8212; an empirical view
  
  
    Researchers in computational linguistics (Mann and Thompson, 1988, Matthiessen and Thompson, 1988, Sparck Jones, 1993) have long speculated that the nuclei that pertain to a rhetorical structure tree (RS-tree) (Mann and Thompson, 1988) constitute an adequate summanzation of the text for which that RS-tree was built However, to our knowledge, there was no experiment to confirm how valid this speculation really is In what follows, we describe an experiment that shows that there exists a strong correlation between the nuclei of the RS-tree of a text and what readers perceive to be the most important units in a text We kno
