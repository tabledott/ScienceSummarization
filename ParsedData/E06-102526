    The authors use two sets of 462 adjectives and 502 verbs, respectively, randomly extracted from the basic English word list of the TOEFL test.
    The intercoder agreement results (see Table 2) show a deterioration in agreement (from lenient to strict) of 16.77% for adjectives and 36.42% for verbs.
    Following this, we evaluated our best experiment according to these measures, and obtained a &#8220;strict&#8221; accuracy value of .660 and a &#8220;lenient&#8221; accuracy value of .821, with a relative deterioration of 24.39%, in line with Kim and Hovy&#8217;s observation10.
    This confirms that determining subjectivity and orientation is a much harder task than determining orientation alone.
    The second important observation is that there is very little variance in the results: across all 120 experiments, average SO-accuracy and
