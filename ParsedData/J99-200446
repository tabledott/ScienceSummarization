   Feature-based Lexicalized Tree Adjoining Grammar (FB-LTAG) is a tree-rewriting grammar formalism, unlike context-free Grammars and head grammars, which are stringrewriting formalisms.
    FB-LTAGs trace their lineage to Tree Adjunct Grammars (TAGs), which were first developed in Joshi, Levy, and Takahashi (1975) and later extended to include unification-based feature structures (Vijay-Shanker 1987; Vijay-Shanker and Joshi 1991) and lexicalization (Schabes, Abeille, and Joshi 1988).
    For a more recent and comprehensive reference, see Joshi and Schabes (1996).
    The primitive elements of FB-LTAGs are called elementary trees.
    Each elementary tree is associated with at least one lexical item on its frontier.
    The lexical item associated with an elementary tree is called the anchor of that tree.
    An elementary tree serves as a complex description of the anchor and provides a domain of locality over which the anchor can specify syntactic and semantic (predicate argument) constraints.
