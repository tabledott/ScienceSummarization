ch rule specifies a part-of-speech for the head and argument but does not provide ordering information.
    We require that a minimum proportion of the posterior dependencies be instances of these rules in expectation.
    In contrast to prior work on rule-driven dependency induction (Druck et al., 2009), where each rule has a separately specified expectation, we only set a single minimum expectation for the proportion of all dependencies that must match one of the rules.
    This setup is more relevant for learning with universals since individual rule frequencies vary greatly between languages.
    English-specific Dependency Rules For English, we also consider a small set of hand-crafted dependency rules designed by Michael Collins3 for deterministic parsing, shown in Table 3.
    Unlike the universals from Table 1, these rules alone are enough to construct a full dependency tree.
    Thus they allow us to judge whether the model is able to improve upon a human-engineered deterministic parser.
