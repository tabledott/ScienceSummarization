bout a particular topic, but rather have requirements of genre as well: they are looking for scholarly articles about hypnotism, novels about the French Revolution, editorials about the supercollider, and so forth.
    If genre classification is so useful, why hasn't it figured much in computational linguistics before now?
    One important reason is that, up to now, the digitized corpora and collections which are the subject of much CL research have been for the most part generically homogeneous (i.e., collections of scientific abstracts or newspaper articles, encyclopedias, and so on), so that the problem of genre identification could be set aside.
    To a large extent, the problems of genre classification don't become salient until we are confronted with large and heterogeneous search domains like the World-Wide Web.
    Another reason for the neglect of genre. though, is that it can be a difficult notion to get a conceptual handle on, particularly in contrast with properties of structure or topicality. w
