 dependencies: directed arcs between a head, which is the more &#8220;essential&#8221; word in the relationship, and a modifier, which supplements the meaning of the head.
    For example, Figure 1 contains a dependency between the verb &#8220;report&#8221; (the head) and its object &#8220;sales&#8221; (the modifier).
    A complete analysis of a sentence is given by a dependency tree: a set of dependencies that forms a rooted, directed tree spanning the words of the sentence.
    Every dependency tree is rooted at a special &#8220;*&#8221; token, allowing the selection of the sentential head to be modeled as if it were a dependency.
    For a sentence x, we define dependency parsing as a search for the highest-scoring analysis of x: Here, y(x) is the set of all trees compatible with x and SCORE(x, y) evaluates the event that tree y is the analysis of sentence x.
    Since the cardinality of y(x) grows exponentially with the length of the sentence, directly solving Eq.
    1 is impractical.
