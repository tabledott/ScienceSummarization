    Usually, the different tasks of text generation are divided among two modules (planning and realization), rather than three.
    However, there is a certain amount of disagreement about where the line between the two is to be drawn.
    For example, McKeown's TEXT (McKeown 1985) performs the tasks that Joyce classifies as sentence planning as part of the realization process, whereas Meteer's SPOKESMAN (Meteer 1989) classifies them as part of text planning.
    (See (Meteer 1990, p.23sq) for a useful summary of the terminological issues'.)
    In this paper, &amp;quot;text planning&amp;quot; will always be used in the narrow sense of &amp;quot;content selection and organization&amp;quot;.
    The architecture of Joyce is directly influenced by that of the SEMSYN system (Rosner 1987; Wisner 1988).
    Rosner divides the realization component into two parts, the &amp;quot;generato
