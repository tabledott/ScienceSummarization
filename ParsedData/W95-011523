d of Section 3).
    The better filter cascade produce lexicons whose precision comes close to this mark.
    The best cascades are up to 137% more precise than the baseline model.
    The large MRBD resulted in the most useful filter for this pair of languages.
    Future research will look into why the MRBD's contribution to lexicon precision decreases with more training data.
    Figure 7 shows the relative performance of selected filters when the entire training set of one hundred thousand sentences is used.
    All the presented filters, except the POS Filter, improve performance even when a large training corpus is available.
    Evidently, some information that is useful for inducing translation lexicons cannot be inferred from any amount of training data using only simple statistical methods.
    The best precision for the single best translation is achieved by a cascade of the MRBD, Cognate and Word Alignment Filters.
    To maximize precision for the best of three or more translations, only the Cogn
