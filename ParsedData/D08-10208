esn&#8217;t postulate a preference for any type of transition but rather computes a set of features that capture transitions of all kinds in the text and their relative proportion.
    Their entity coherence features prove to be very suitable for various tasks, notably for information ordering and reading difficulty level.
    Form of reference is also important in wellwritten text and appropriate choices lead to improved readability.
    Use of pronouns for reference to highly salient entities is perceived as more desirable than the use of definite noun phrases (Gordon et al., 1993; Krahmer and Theune, 2002).
    The syntactic forms of first mention&#8212;when an entity is first introduced in a text&#8212;differ from those of subsequent mentions (Poesio and Vieira, 1998; Nenkova and McKeown, 2003) and can be exploited for improving and predicting text coherence (Siddharthan, 2003; Nenkova and McKeown, 2003; Elsner and Charniak, 2008).
