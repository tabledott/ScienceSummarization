is: Table 5 reports the error distribution of the polynomial composite kernel over the major types on the ACE data.
    It shows that 83.5%(198+115/198+115+62) / 85.8%(416 +171/416+171+96) of the errors result from relation detection and only 16.5%/14.2% of the errors result from relation characterization.
    This may be due to data imbalance and sparseness issues since we find that the negative samples are 8 times more than the positive samples in the training set.
    Nevertheless, it clearly directs our future work.
  
  
    In this section, we compare our method with the previous work from the feature engineering viewpoint and report some other observations and issues in our experiments.
    This is to explain more about why our method performs better and significantly outperforms the previous two dependency tree kernels from the theoretical viewpoint.
    (1) Compared with Feature-based Methods: The basic difference lies in the relation instance representation (parse tree vs. feature vector) and the si
