ture forest models have significantly higher accuracy than a baseline model.
    Comparing &#8220;Syntactic features&#8221; with &#8220;Semantic features,&#8221; we see that the former model attained significantly higher accuracy than the latter.
    This indicates that syntactic features are more important for overall accuracy.
    We will examine the contributions of each atomic feature of the syntactic features in Section 5.5.
    Features on predicate&#8211;argument relations were generally considered as important for the accurate disambiguation of syntactic structures.
    For example, PP-attachment ambiguity cannot be resolved with only syntactic preferences.
    However, the results show that a model with only semantic features performs significantly worse than one with syntactic features.
    Even when combined with syntactic features, semantic features do not improve accuracy.
    Obviously, semantic preferences are necessary for accurate parsing, but the features used in this work were not sufficien
