at theorem 2 holds under this weaker assumption.
    There are two ways in which the data can diverge from conditional independence: the rules may either be positively or negatively correlated, given the class value.
    Figure 2a illustrates positive correlation, and figure 2b illustrates negative correlation.
    If the rules are negatively correlated, then their disagreement (shaded in figure 2) is larger than if they are conditionally independent, and the conclusion of theorem 2 is maintained a fortiori.
    Unfortunately, in the data, they are positively correlated, so the theorem does not apply.
    Let us quantify the amount of deviation from conditional independence.
    We define the conditional dependence of F and G given Y = y to If F and G are conditionally independent, then dy = 0.
    This permits us to state a weaker version of rule independence: Definition 4 Rules F and G satisfy weak rule dependence just in case, for y E {+, &#8722;}: dy ` p2 2p1q1 where p1 = minu Pr[F = u|Y = y], p2 = minu P
