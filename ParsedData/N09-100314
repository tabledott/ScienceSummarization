.89 correlation, and both WN30g and the combination of context windows and syntactic context perform best on WordSim353.
    Note that the confidence intervals are quite large in both RG and WordSim353, and few of the pairwise differences are statistically significant.
    Regarding WordNet-based approaches, the use of the glosses and WordNet 3.0 (WN30g) yields the best results in both datasets.
    While MCR16 is close to WN30g for the RG dataset, it lags well behind on WordSim353.
    This discrepancy is further analyzed is Section 5.3.
    Note that the performance of WordNet in the WordSim353 dataset suffers from unknown words.
    In fact, there are nine pairs which returned null similarity for this reason.
    The number in parenthesis in Table 1 for WordSim353 shows the results for the 344 remaining pairs.
    Section 5.2 shows a proposal to overcome this limitation.
    The bag-of-words approach tends to group together terms that can have a similar distribution of contextual terms.
    Therefore, term
