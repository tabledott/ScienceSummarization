e now perform a similarity computation to all vectors in the co-occurrence matrix of the target language.
    The vector with the highest similarity is considered to be the translation of our source-language word.
  
  
    To conduct the simulation, a number of resources were required.
    These are As the German corpus, we used 135 million words of the newspaper Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung (1993 to 1996), and as the English corpus 163 million words of the Guardian (1990 to 1994).
    Since the orientation of the two newspapers is quite different, and since the time spans covered are only in part overlapping, the two corpora can be considered as more or less unrelated.
    For testing our results, we started with a list of 100 German test words as proposed by Russell (1970), which he used for an association experiment with German subjects.
    By looking up the translations for each of these 100 words, we obtained a test set for evaluation.
    Our German/English base lexicon is derived from the Collins G
