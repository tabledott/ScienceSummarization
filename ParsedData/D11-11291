    We are naturally good at understanding ambiguous words given a context, and forming the meaning of a sentence from the meaning of its parts.
    But while human beings seem comfortable doing this, machines fail to deliver.
    Search engines such as Google either fall back on bag of words models&#8212;ignoring syntax and lexical relations&#8212;or exploit superficial models of lexical semantics to retrieve pages with terms related to those in the query (Manning et al., 2008).
    However, such models fail to shine when it comes to processing the semantics of phrases and sentences.
    Discovering the process of meaning assignment in natural language is among the most challenging and foundational questions of linguistics and computer science.
    The findings thereof will increase our understanding of cognition and intelligence and shall assist in applications to automating language-related tasks such as document search.
