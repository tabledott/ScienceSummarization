es have different ranges because some categories are more prolific than others.
    Basilisk outperforms meta-bootstrapping for every category, often substantially.
    For the human and location categories, Basilisk learned hundreds of words, with accuracies in the 80-89% range through much of the bootstrapping.
    It is worth noting that Basilisk&#8217;s performance held up well on the human and location categories even at the end, achieving 79.5% (795/1000) accuracy for humans and 53.2% (532/1000) accuracy for locations.
  
  
    We also explored the idea of bootstrapping multiple semantic classes simultaneously.
    Our hypothesis was that errors of confusion2 between semantic categories can be lessened by using information about multiple categories.
    This hypothesis makes sense only if a word cannot belong to more than one semantic class.
    In general, this is not true because words are often polysemous.
    But within a limited domain, a word usually has a dominant word sense.
    Therefore we ma
