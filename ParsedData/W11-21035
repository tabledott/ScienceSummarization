ch reference as if the translator forgot to delete it.
    As in past years we provided parallel corpora to train translation models, monolingual corpora to train language models, and development sets to tune system parameters.
    Some statistics about the training materials are given in Figure 1.
    To lower the barrier of entry for newcomers to the field, we provided two open source toolkits for phrase-based and parsing-based statistical machine translation (Koehn et al., 2007; Li et al., 2010).
    We received submissions from 56 groups across 37 institutions, as listed in Tables 1, 2 and 3.
    We also included two commercial off-the-shelf MT systems, two online statistical MT systems, and five online rule-based MT systems.
    (Not all systems supported all language pairs.)
    We note that these nine companies did not submit entries themselves, and are therefore anonymized in this paper.
    Rather, their entries were created by translating the test data via their web interfaces.4 The data used to con
