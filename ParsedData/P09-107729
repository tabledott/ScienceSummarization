rom the fact that temporal implicits often contain words like &#8220;yesterday&#8221; or &#8220;Monday&#8221; at the end of the sentence.
    Context is the next most helpful feature for temporal relations.
    For Comparison and Contingency, we analyze the behavior of word pair features under several different settings.
    Specifically we want to address two important related questions raised in recent work by others: (i) is unannotated data from explicits useful for training models that disambiguate implicit discourse relations and (ii) are explicit and implicit relations intrinsically different from each other.
    Wordpairs-TextRels is the worst approach.
    The best use of word pair features is Wordpairsselected.
    This model gives 4% better absolute fscore for Comparison and 14% for Contingency over Wordpairs-TextRels.
    In this setting the TextRels data was used to choose the word pair features, but the probabilities for each feature were estimated using the training portion of the PDTB implicit
