c(Zadeh, 1987) is used here to assign fuzzy sen timent tags to all words in WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998), that is it assigns sentiment tags and a degreeof centrality of the annotated words to the sentiment category.
			This assignment is based on Word Net glosses.
			The implications of this approach for NLP and linguistic research are discussed.
	
	
			Set Some semantic categories have clear membership (e.g., lexical fields (Lehrer, 1974) of color, body parts or professions), while others are much more difficult to define.
			This prompted the developmentof approaches that regard the transition frommem bership to non-membership in a semantic category as gradual rather than abrupt (Zadeh, 1987; Rosch, 1978).
			In this paper we approach the category of sentiment as one of such fuzzy categories wheresome words ? such as good, bad ? are very central, prototypical members, while other, less central words may be interpreted differently by differ ent people.
			Thus, as annotators proceed from thecore of the category
