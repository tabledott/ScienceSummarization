re that more expensive manual evaluation techniques which directly measure translation utility could even more strongly reveal improvement in role confusion errors.
    The hybrid two-pass approach can be compared with the greedy re-ordering based strategy of the ReWrite decoder (Germann et al. 2001), although our search is breadth-first rather than purely greedy.
    Whereas ReWrite was based on wordlevel re-ordering, however, our approach is based on constituent phrase re-ordering, and the phrases to be re-ordered are more selectively chosen via the semantic parse labels.
    Moreover, the objective function being maximized by ReWrite is still the SMT model score; whereas in our case the new objective function is cross-lingual semantic predicate-argument match (plus an implicit search bias toward fewer re-orderings).
    The hybrid two-pass approach can also be compared with serial combination architectures for hybrid MT (e.g., Ueffing et al. 2008).
    But whereas Ueffing et al. take the output from a firs
