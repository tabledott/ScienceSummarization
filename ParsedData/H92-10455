typically consists of approx- imately 12,000 words of text (100 words words of context for 60 instances of each of two senses).
  Thus, there are more than 15 parameters to be estimated from each data point.
  Clearly, we need to be fairly careful given that we have so many parameters and so little evidence.
  Parameter Estimation In principle, the conditional probabilities Pr(toklsense ) can be estimated by selecting those parts of the entire corpus which satisfy the required conditions (e.g., 100- word contexts urrounding instances of one sense of sen- fence, counting the frequency of each word, and dividing the counts by the total number of words satisfying the conditions.
  However, this estimate, which is known as the maximum likelihood estimate (MLE), has a number of well-known problems.
  In particular, it will assign zero probability to words that do not happen to appear in the sample, which is obviously unacceptable.
  We will estimate Pr(toklsense ) by interpolating between local probabilities, prob
