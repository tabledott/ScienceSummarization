 dative alternation.
    For example, consider the sentence (i) &#8220;[Shaw Publishing]ARG0 offered [Mr. Smith]ARG2 [a reimbursement]ARG, &#8221; and the alternative realization (ii) &#8220;[Shaw Publishing]ARG0 offered [a reimbursement]ARG, [to Mr. Smith]ARG2&#8221;.
    When classifying the NP in object position, it is useful to know whether the following argument is a PP.
    If yes, the NP will more likely be an ARG1, and if not, it will more likely be an ARG2.
    A feature template that captures such information extracts, for each argument node, its phrase type and label in the context of the phrase types for all other arguments.
    For example, the instantiation of such a template for [a reimbursement] in (ii) would be [ voice:active NP,PRED,NP-ARG1,PP] We also add a template that concatenates the identity of the predicate lemma itself.
    We should note that Xue and Palmer (2004) define a similar feature template, called syntactic frame, which often captures similar information.
    The important d
