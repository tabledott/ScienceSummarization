ical evaluation of WSD results can be devised.
    Basic questions such as the role of part of speech in WSD, the treatment of metaphor, metonymy, and the like in evaluation, and how to deal with words of differing degrees and types of polysemy, must first be resolved.
    SENSEVAL will likely take us a step closer to this understanding; at the least, it will force consideration of what can be meaningfully regarded as an isolatable sense distinction and provide some measure of the distance between the performance of current systems and a predefined standard.
    The in vitro evaluation envisaged for SENSEVAL demands the creation of a manually sense-tagged reference corpus containing an agreed-upon set of sense distinctions.
    The difficulties of attaining sense agreement, even among experts, have already been outlined.
    Resnik and Yarowsky (1997b) have proposed that for WSD evaluation, it may be practical to retain only those sense distinctions that are lexicalized crosslinguistically.
