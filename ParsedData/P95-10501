ences of words in each pair of sentences.
    The results achieved with these algorithms have been found useful for the compilation of dictionaries, for checking the consistency of terminological usage in translations, and for assisting the terminological work of translators and interpreters.
    However, despite serious efforts in the compilation of corpora (Church &amp; Mercer, 1993; Armstrong &amp; Thompson, 1995) the availability of a large enough parallel corpus in a specific field and for a given pair of languages will always be the exception, not the rule.
    Since the acquisition of non-parallel texts is usually much easier, it would be desirable to have a program that can determine the translations of words from comparable or even unrelated texts.
  
  
    It is assumed that there is a correlation between the co-occurrences of words which are translations of each other.
    If &#8212; for example &#8212; in a text of one language two words A and B co-occur more often than expected from chance, then
