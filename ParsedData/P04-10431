ax structures into flat feature representations which are suitable for a given learning model.
    The main drawback is that structures may not be properly represented by flat features.
    In particular, these problems affect the processing of predicate argument structures annotated in PropBank (Kingsbury and Palmer, 2002) or FrameNet (Fillmore, 1982).
    Figure 1 shows an example of a predicate annotation in PropBank for the sentence: &amp;quot;Paul gives a lecture in Rome&amp;quot;.
    A predicate may be a verb or a noun or an adjective and most of the time Arg 0 is the logical subject, Arg 1 is the logical object and ArgM may indicate locations, as in our example.
    FrameNet also describes predicate/argument structures but for this purpose it uses richer semantic structures called frames.
    These latter are schematic representations of situations involving various participants, properties and roles in which a word may be typically used.
    Frame elements or semantic roles are arguments of predicate
