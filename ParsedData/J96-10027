s consistent with these two constraints.
    In the absence of any other knowledge, a reasonable choice for p is again the most uniform&#8212;that is, the distribution which allocates its probability as evenly as possible, subject to the constraints: Say we inspect the data once more, and this time notice another interesting fact: in half the cases, the expert chose either dans or a.
    We can incorporate this information into our model as a third constraint: We can once again look for the most uniform p satisfying these constraints, but now the choice is not as obvious.
    As we have added complexity, we have encountered two difficulties at once.
    First, what exactly is meant by &amp;quot;uniform,&amp;quot; and how can we measure the uniformity of a model?
    Second, having determined a suitable answer to these questions, how do we go about finding the most uniform model subject to a set of constraints like those we have described?
    The maximum entropy method answers both of these questions, as we w
