Chall formula uses a combination of average sentence length and percentage of words not on a list of 3000 &#8220;easy&#8221; words (Chall and Dale, 1995).
    The Lexile framework combines measures of semantics, represented by word frequency counts, and syntax, represented by sentence length (Stenner, 1996).
    These measures are inadequate for our task; in many cases, teachers want materials with more difficult, topic-specific words but simple structure.
    Measures of reading level based on word lists do not capture this information.
    In addition to the traditional reading level metrics, researchers at Carnegie Mellon University have applied probabilistic language modeling techniques to this task.
    Si and Callan (2001) conducted preliminary work to classify science web pages using unigram models.
    More recently, Collins-Thompson and Callan manually collected a corpus of web pages ranked by grade level and observed that vocabulary words are not distributed evenly across grade levels.
    They deve
