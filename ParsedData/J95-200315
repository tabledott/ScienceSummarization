pression in a discourse substantially affects the resource demands made upon a hearer in discourse processing and through this influences the perceived coherence of the discourse.
    It is well known from the study of complexity theory that the manner in which a class of problems is represented can significantly affect the time or space resources required by any procedure that solves the problem.
    Here too we conjecture that the manner, i.e., linguistic form, in which a discourse represents a particular propositional content can affect the resources required by any procedure that processes that discourse.
    We use the phrase inference load placed upon the hearer to refer to the resources required to extract information from a discourse because of particular choices of linguistic expression used in the discourse.
    We conjecture that one psychological reflex of this inference load is a difference in perceived coherence among discourses that express the same propositional content using different linguis
