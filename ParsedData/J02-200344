 level of generalization, the high score is not too surprising.
    As a final experiment, we compared the task performance using the X2, rather than G2, statistic in the chi-square test.
    The results are given in Table 7 for the complete data set.13 The figures in brackets give the average number of generalized levels.
    The X2 statistic is performing at least as well as G2, and the results show that the average level of generalization is slightly higher for G2 than X2.
    This suggests a possible explanation for the results presented here and those in Dunning (1993): that the X2 statistic provides a less conservative test when counts in the contingency table are low.
    (By a conservative test we mean one in which the null hypothesis is not easily rejected.)
    A less conservative test is better suited to the pseudo-disambiguation task, since it results in a lower level of generalization, on the whole, which is good for this task.
    In contrast, the task that Dunning considers, the discovery of bi
