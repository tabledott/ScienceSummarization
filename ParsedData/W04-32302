part-of-speech in morphological analysis of non-segmented languages.
    In this paper, we show how CRFs can be applied to situations where word boundary ambiguity exists.
    CRFs offer a solution to the problems in Japanese morphological analysis with hidden Markov models (HMMs) (e.g., (Asahara and Matsumoto, 2000)) or with maximum entropy Markov models (MEMMs) (e.g., (Uchimoto et al., 2001)).
    First, as HMMs are generative, it is hard to employ overlapping features stemmed from hierarchical tagsets and nonindependent features of the inputs such as surrounding words, word suffixes and character types.
    These features have usually been ignored in HMMs, despite their effectiveness in unknown word guessing.
    Second, as mentioned in the literature, MEMMs could evade neither from label bias (Lafferty et al., 2001) nor from length bias (a bias occurring because of word boundary ambiguity).
    Easy sequences with low entropy are likely to be selected during decoding in MEMMs.
    The consequence is serio
