dentical to those for the most-frequent heuristic.
  Means using the co-occurrence h uris- tic were perhaps a half percent lower than those obtained with the most-frequent heuristic.
  And when the effects of guessing were removed, an improvement of approximately 2% was obtained, as before.
  This similarity can be attributed to the limited size of the semantic oncordance: no co-occurrence data were available for 28% of the polysemous words, so the most-frequent heuristic had to he used; moreover, those words for which co-occurrence data were available tended to occur in their most frequent senses.
  On the basis of results obtained with the available sample of semantically tagged text, therefore, there is nothing to be gained by using the more complex co-occurrence h uristic.
  Since context is so important in sense identification, however, we concluded that our semantic oncordance is still too small to estimate the potential limits of a co-occurrence h uristic.
