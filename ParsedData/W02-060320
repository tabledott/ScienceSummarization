excessive splitting, e.g., t + alo for talo (cf.
    English h + ouse for house). with their respective correct morphemic analyses.
    We assume that the segmentation algorithm has split the word bigger into the morphs bigg + er, hours&#8217; into hour + s + &#8217; and puutaloja into puu + t + alo + ja.
    Alignment procedure.
    We align the morph sequence with the morphemic label sequence using dynamic programming, namely Viterbi alignment, to find the best sequence of mappings between morphs and morphemic labels.
    Each possible pair of morph/morphemic label has a distance associated with it.
    For each segmented word, the algorithm searches for the alignment that minimizes the total alignment distance for the word.
    The distance d(M, L) for a pair of morph M and label L is given by: where cM,L is the number of word tokens in which the morph M has been aligned with the label L; and cM is the number of word tokens that contain the morph M in their segmentation.
    The distance measure can be tho
