 illustrates how using this improved translation model in the Candide system led to improved translations for the two sample sentences given earlier.
    Though an ideal machine translation system could devour input sentences of unrestricted length, a typical stochastic system must cut the French sentences into polite lengths before digesting them.
    If the processing time is exponential in the length of the input passage (as is the case with the Candide system), then failing to split the French sentences into reasonably-sized segments would result in an exponential slowdown in translation.
    Thus, a common task in machine translation is to find safe positions at which Example of an unsafe segmentation.
    A word in the translated sentence (e3) is aligned to words (y3 and y4) in two different segments of the input sentence. to split input sentences in order to speed the translation process.
    &amp;quot;Safe&amp;quot; is a vague term; one might, for instance, reasonably define a safe segmentation as one
