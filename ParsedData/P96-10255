P ,NP ,NP&gt; denotes prepositional phrase modification of an NP, and so on4.
    Each word in the reduced sentence, with the exception of the sentential head 'announced', modifies exactly one other word.
    We use the notation to state that the jth word in the reduced sentence is a modifier to the hith word, with relationship R35.
    AF stands for 'arrow from'.
    Ri is the triple of labels at the start, middle and end of the arrow.
    For example, ti1 = Smith in this sentence, 4The triple can also be viewed as representing a semantic predicate-argument relationship, with the three elements being the type of the argument, result and functor respectively.
    This is particularly apparent in Categorial Grammar formalisms (Wood 93), which make an explicit link between dependencies and functional application.
    5For the head-word of the entire sentence h, 0, with R3=--&lt;Label of the root of the parse tree &gt;.
    So in this case, AF(5) = (0, &lt; S &gt;). and 1155 = announced, so AF(1) = (5, &lt;NP ,S
