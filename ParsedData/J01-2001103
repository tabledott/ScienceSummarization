grammar view, as explored in LSLT, posits a grammar of possible grammars, that is, a format in which the rules of the morphology and syntax must be written, and it establishes the semantics of these rules, which is to say, how they function.
    This grammar of grammars is called variously Universal Grammar, or Linguistic Theory, and it is generally assumed to be accessible to humans on the basis of an innate endowment, though one need not buy into that assumption to accept the rest of the theory.
    In Syntactic Structures (Chomsky 1957, 51ff.
    ), Chomsky famously argued that the goal of a linguistic theory that produces a grammar automatically, given a corpus as input, is far too demanding a goal.
    His own theory cannot do that, and he suggests that no one else has any idea how to accomplish the task.
    He suggests furthermore that the next weaker position&#8212;that of developing a linguistic theory that could determine, given the data and the account (grammar), whether this was the best grammar&#
