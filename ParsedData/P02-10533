    PMI-IR uses Pointwise Mutual Information (PMI) and Information Retrieval (IR) to measure the similarity of pairs of words or phrases.
    The semantic orientation of a given phrase is calculated by comparing its similarity to a positive reference word (&#8220;excellent&#8221;) with its similarity to a negative reference word (&#8220;poor&#8221;).
    More specifically, a phrase is assigned a numerical rating by taking the mutual information between the given phrase and the word &#8220;excellent&#8221; and subtracting the mutual information between the given phrase and the word &#8220;poor&#8221;.
    In addition to determining the direction of the phrase&#8217;s semantic orientation (positive or negative, based on the sign of the rating), this numerical rating also indicates the strength of the semantic orientation (based on the magnitude of the number).
    The algorithm is presented in Section 2.
