uch as stochastic versions of Earley parsers (Stolcke, 1993), efficiently compute related probabilities, but we won't explore these parsers here.
    We confess that our real interest is in more complicated grammars, such as those that use head words.
    Grammars such as these can best be parsed bottom up.
    That is, we assume independence between the elements of a sequence.
    The probability of node L, = Nx is just its prior probability times its inside 3,k probability, as before.
    The most important difference between global thresholding and beam thresholding is that global thresholding is global: any node in the chart can help prune out any other node.
    In stark contrast, beam thresholding only compares nodes to other nodes covering the same span.
    Beam thresholding typically allows tighter thresholds since there are fewer approximations, but does not benefit from global information.
    Global thresholding is performed in a bottom-up chart parser immediately after each length is completed.
