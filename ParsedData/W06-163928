ods to our problem.
    However, we also believe that our approach has important advantages, including conceptual simplicity and the fact that it is based on an underlying optimization problem that is provably and in practice easy to solve.
  
  
    In this study, we focused on very general types of cross-document classification preferences, utilizing constraints based only on speaker identity and on direct textual references between statements.
    We showed that the integration of even very limited information regarding inter-document relationships can significantly increase the accuracy of support/opposition classification.
    The simple constraints modeled in our study, however, represent just a small portion of the rich network of relationships that connect statements and speakers across the political universe and in the wider realm of opinionated social discourse.
    One intriguing possibility is to take advantage of (readily identifiable) information regarding interpersonal relationships, making use
