    Ideally, this model predicts the start position of the next phrase.
    But as predicting the exact position is rather difficult, we group the possible start positions into classes.
    In the simplest case, we use only two classes.
    One class for the positions to the left and one class for the positions to the right.
    As a refinement, we can use four classes instead of two: 1) one position to the left, 2) more than one positions to the left, 3) one position to the right, 4) more than one positions to the right.
    In general, we use a parameter D to specify 2 &#183; D classes of the types: Let cj,j&#8242; denote the orientation class for a movement from source position j to source position j&#8242; as illustrated in Figure 1.
    In the case of two orientation classes, cj,j&#8242; is defined as: r left, if j&#8242; &lt; j cj,j&#8242; =right, if j&#8242; &gt; j Then, the reordering model has the form p(cj,j&#8242;|fJ1 , eI1, i, j) A well-founded framework for directly modeli
