for relation detection, which means that all positive rela tion instances are combined into one class.
			Then the thresholded output of this binary classifier is used as training data for a second multi-class SVM, which is trained for relation classification.
			The same kernel is used in both stages.
			We present in Table 5 the performance of our shortest path (SP) dependency kernel on the task ofrelation extraction from ACE, where the dependencies are extracted using either a CCG parser (SP CCG), or a CFG parser (SP-CFG).
			We also show the results presented in (Culotta and Sorensen, 2004) for their best performing kernel K4 (a sum between a bag-of-words kernel and their dependency kernel) under both scenarios.
