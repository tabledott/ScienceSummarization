 the point-of-view of NLP since previous efforts at Treebanking and Propbanking have been independent of the special status of any entities, and previous efforts at entity annotation have been independent of corresponding layers of syntactic and semantic structure.
    The decomposition of larger entities into components of a relation, worthwhile by itself on conceptual grounds for entity definition, also allows the component entities to be mapped to the syntactic structure.
    These entities can be viewed as semantic types associated with syntactic constituents, and so our expectation is that automated analyses of these related levels will interact in a mutually reinforcing and beneficial way for development of statistical taggers.
    Development of such statistical taggers is proceeding in parallel with the annotation effort, and these taggers help in the annotation process, as well as being steps towards automatic extraction.
    In this paper we focus on the aspects of this project that have been develo
