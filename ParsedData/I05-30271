mp; Emer son 2003), no single model performed well on all corpora included in the task.
			Rather, systems tended to do well on corpora largely drawn from a set of similar Mandarin varieties to the one they were originally developed for.
			Across cor pora, variation is seen in both the lexicons and also in the word segmentation standards.
			We concluded that, for future systems, generaliza tion across such different Mandarin varieties is crucial.
			To this end, we proposed a new model using character identity, morphological and character reduplication features in a conditional random field modeling framework.
	
	
			Our system builds on research into condi tional random field (CRF), a statistical sequence modeling framework first introduced by Lafferty et al (2001).
			Work by Peng et al (2004) first used this framework for Chinese word segmen tation by treating it as a binary decision task, such that each character is labeled either as the beginning of a word or the continuation of one.
