  The frequency counts for each sense were collected using the rest of SemCor, and then applied to the [our texts.
  While the precision is similar to that of our algorithm, the coverage is 8% worse.

  The precision and coverage shown in all the preceding graphs were relative to the polysemous nouns only.
  Including monosemic nouns precision raises, as shown in table 2, from 43% to 64.5%, and the coverage increases from 79.6% to 86.2%.
