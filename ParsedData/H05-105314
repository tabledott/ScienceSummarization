	We also had between 1.8% (SPORTS) and 4.8% (BNC) unclearinstances.
			The percentage of unlisted instances re flects the fit of WN to the data whilst that of unclear cases reflects the generality of the corpus.6To compute inter-annotator agreement we used Amruta Pu randare and Ted Pedersen?s OMtoSVAL2 Package version 0.01.
			The sense distributions WSD accuracy is strongly related to the entropy of the sense distribution of the target word (Yarowskyand Florian, 2002).
			The more skewed the sense dis tribution is towards a small percentage of the senses, the lower the entropy.
			Accuracy is related to this because there is more data (both training and test) shared between fewer of the senses.
			When the first sense is very predominant (exceeding 80%) it is hard for any WSD system to beat the heuristic of always selecting that sense (Yarowsky and Florian, 2002).
			The sense distribution for a given word may varydepending on the domain of the text being processed.
			In some cases, this may result in a dif
