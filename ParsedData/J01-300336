re left, which were classified by hand, yielding 71 animate pronouns, 11 inanimate pronouns and 12 unclassified occurrences (for lack of sufficient context to recover the antecedent of the pronoun with certainty).
    Thus, at least 76% of usages of they were animate; we assume the percentage of animate usages of the other pronouns to be even higher.
    Since the hypothesis was confirmed, we count pronouns (other than it) in subject position (Kariaeva [19991; cf.
    Aone and McKee [1996]).
    The values for the feature were determined by automatically extracting all subject/verb tuples including our 59 example verbs from the parsed corpus, and computing the ratio of occurrences of pronoun subjects to all subjects for each verb.
    Finally, as indicated in Table 5, the verbs are designated as belonging to &amp;quot;group 1&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;group 2&amp;quot;.
    All the verbs are treated equally in our data analysis and in the machine learning experiments, but this designation does indicate a differe
