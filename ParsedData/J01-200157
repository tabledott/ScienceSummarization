 early in the word, while tries based on backward spelling have the greatest branching structure close to the root node, which is to say at the end of the word. where = + wi+v) For each word, we note what the best parse is, that is, which parse has the highest rating by virtue of the H-function.
    We iterate until no word changes its optimal parse, which empirically is typically less than five iterations on the entire lexicon.22 We now have an initial split of all words into stem plus suffix.
    Even for words like this and stomach we have such an initial split.
    The second approach that we have employed provides a much more rapid convergence on the suffixes of a language.
    Since our goal presently is to identify word-final suffixes, we assume by convention that all words end with an end-of-word symbol (traditionally &amp;quot;#&amp;quot;), and we then tally the counts of all n-grams of length between two and six letters that appear word finally.
    Thus, for example, the word elephant# contains one
