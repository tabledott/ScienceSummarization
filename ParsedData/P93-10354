ure of the target corpus.
    In particular, all that is initially known is that English tends to be right branching and that final punctuation is final punctuation.
    Transformations are then learned automatically which transform the output of the naive parser into output which better resembles the phrase structure found in the training corpus.
    Once a set of transformations has been learned, the system is capable of taking sentences tagged with parts of speech and returning a binary-branching structure with nonterminals unlabelled.2 Initially, the parser operates by assigning a rightlinear structure to all sentences.
    The only exception is that final punctuation is attached high.
    So, the sentence &amp;quot;The dog and old cat ate .&amp;quot; would be incorrectly bracketed as: The parser in its initial state will obviously not bracket sentences with great accuracy.
    In some experiments below, we begin with an even more naive initial state of knowledge: sentences are parsed by assigning them a
