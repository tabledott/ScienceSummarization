    These systems use empirical techniques to learn which terms signal entities of interest, in order to fill in pre-defined templates.
    Our goals are more general than those of information extraction, and so this work should be helpful for that task.
    However, our approach will not solve issues surrounding previously unseen proper nouns, which are often important for information extraction tasks.
    There have been several efforts to incorporate lexical hierarchies into statistical processing, primarily for the problem of prepositional phrase (PP) attachment.
    The current standard formulation is: given a verb followed by a noun and a prepositional phrase, represented by the tuple v, n1, p, n2, determine which of v or n1 the PP consisting of p and
