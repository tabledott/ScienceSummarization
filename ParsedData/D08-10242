e to optimize them all at once using MERT, they resorted to running MERT many times in order to test different combinations of features.
    But it would have been preferable to use a training method that can optimize the features all at once.
    There has been much work on improving MERT&#8217;s performance (Duh and Kirchoff, 2008; Smith and Eisner, 2006; Cer et al., 2008), or on replacing MERT wholesale (Turian et al., 2007; Blunsom et al., 2008).
    This paper continues a line of research on online discriminative training (Tillmann and Zhang, 2006; Liang et al., 2006; Arun and Koehn, 2007), extending that of Watanabe et al. (2007), who use the Margin Infused Relaxed Algorithm (MIRA) due to Crammer et al.
    (2003; 2006).
    Our guiding principle is practicality: like Watanabe et al., we train on a small tuning set comparable in size to that used by MERT, but by parallel processing and exploiting more of the parse forest, we obtain results using MIRA that match or surpass MERT in terms of both translati
