-based system, and the XTAG Research Group(1998) used a tree-adjoining grammar.
    Of all the systems, Ramshaw &amp; Marcus' transformation rule-based system had the best published performance (f-measure 92.0) for several years, and is regarded as the de facto standard for the domain.
    Although several systems have recently achieved slightly higher published results (Munoz et al. : 92.8, Tjong Kim Sang &amp; Veenstra: 92.37, XTAG Research Group: 92.4), their algorithms are significantly more costly, or not feasible, to implement in an active learning framework.
    To facilitate contrastive studies, we have evaluated our active learning and cost model comparisons using Ramshaw &amp; Marcus' system as the reference algorithm in these experiments.
  
  
    Supervised statistical machine learning systems have traditionally required large amounts of annotated data from which to extract linguistic properties of the task at hand.
    However, not all data is created equal.
