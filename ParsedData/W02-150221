king to extract and generalize what is similar across these existing wide-coverage grammars.
    Moreover, the central role of types in the representation of linguistic generalizations enables the kind of underspecification which is useful for expressing what is common among related languages while allowing for the further specialization which necessarily distinguishes one language from another.
    The computational interest is threefold.
    First there is the question of what formal devices the grammar matrix will require.
    Should it include defaults?
    What about domain union (linearization theory)?
    The selection and deployment of formal devices should be informed by on-going research on processing schemes, and here the crosslinguistic perspective can be particularly helpful.
    Where there are several equivalent analyses of the same linguistic phenomena (e.g., morphosyntactic ambiguity or optionality), the choice of analysis can have processing implications that aren&#8217;t necessarily apparen
