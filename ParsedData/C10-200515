a moderate agreement be tween the labelers (Landis and Koch, 1977).
			This means that in fact the sources provide different bias regarding polarity detection.
			39 Data sources Kappa Twendz/TwitterSentiment 0.58 TwitterSentiment/TweetFeel 0.58 Twendz/TweetFeel 0.44 Table 3: Kappa coefficient between pairs of sources.From this analysis we can conclude that com bining the labels provided by the 3 sources canimprove the performance of the polarity detection instead of using one of them in isolation be cause they provide diverse labels (moderate kappa agreement) of reasonable quality, although thereis some issues related to bias of the labels pro vided by them.
			In our experimental evaluation in Section 4, we present results obtained by different strategies of combining these sources that confirm these findings.
			3.3.2 Polarity Features The features used in the polarity detection are the same ones used in the subjectivity detection.
			However, as one would expect the set of the most discriminative features
