fires when a rule&#8217;s source side span in the input sentence matches any of the above-mentioned labels in the input parse, and another which fires when a rule&#8217;s source side span crosses a boundary of one of these labels (e.g., its source side span only partially covers the words in a VP subtree, and it also covers some or all or the words outside the VP subtree).
    These two features are equivalent to Marton and Resnik&#8217;s XP= and XP' feature combinations, respectively.
    Fine-grained features We selected the following nonterminal labels that appear more than 100 times in the tuning data: NP, PP, S, VP, SBAR, ADJP, WHNP, PRT, ADVP, PRN, and QP.
    The labels that were excluded were parts of speech, nonconstituent labels like FRAG, or labels that occurred only two or three times.
    For each of these labels X, we added a separate feature that fires when a rule&#8217;s source side span in the input sentence matches X, and a second feature that fires when a span crosses a boundary of X.
