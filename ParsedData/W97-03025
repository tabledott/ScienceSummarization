-pass parsing, is introduced in Section 4.
    The basic idea is that we can use information from parsing with one grammar to speed parsing with another.
    We run two passes, the first of which is fast and simple, eliminating from consideration many unlikely potential constituents.
    The second pass is more complicated and slower, but also more accurate.
    Because we have already eliminated many nodes in our first pass, the second pass can run much faster, and, despite the fact that we have to run two passes, the added savings in the second pass can easily outweigh the cost of the first one.
    Experimental comparisons of these techniques show that they lead to considerable speedups over traditional thresholding, when used separately.
    We also wished to combine the thresholding techniques; this is relatively difficult, since searching for the optimal thresholding parameters in a multi-dimensional space is potentially very time consuming.
    We .designed a variant on a gradient descent search algori
