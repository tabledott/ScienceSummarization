k of deriving sentence-level discourse trees, when working with human-produced syntactic trees and discourse segments.
  
  
    For the experiments described in this paper, we use a publicly available corpus (RST-DT, 2002) that contains 385 Wall Street Journal articles from the Penn Treebank.
    The corpus comes conveniently partitioned into a Training set of 347 articles (6132 sentences) and a Test set of 38 articles (991 sentences).
    Each document in the corpus is paired with a discourse structure (tree) that was manually built in the style of Rhetorical Structure Theory (Mann and Thompson, 1988).
    (See (Carlson et al., 2003) for details concerning the corpus and the annotation process.)
    Out of the 385 articles in the corpus, 53 have been independently annotated by two human annotators.
    We used this doubly-annotated subset to compute human agreement on the task of discourse structure derivation.
    In our experiments we used as discourse structures only the discourse sub-trees spanning over
