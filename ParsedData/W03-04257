r was trained, in a round-robin fashion, on 4 fifths of the data and applied on the remaining fifth.
    This way, the entire training data can be used to estimate the weight parameters Ai (w) and Pi (C|w, Ci) but, at decoding time, the individual classifier outputs Ci are computed by using the entire training data.
    Table 2 presents the combination results, for different ways of estimating the interpolation parameters.
    A simple combination method is the equal voting method (van Halteren et al., 2001; Tjong Kim Sang et al., 2000), where the parameters are computed as Ai (w) = 1n and Pi (C|w, Ci) = S (C, Ci), where S is the Kronecker operator (S (x, y) := (x = y?1 : 0)) &#8211; each of the classifiers votes with equal weight for the class that is most likely under its model, and the class receiving the largest number of votes wins.
    However, this procedure may lead to ties, where some classes receive the same number of votes &#8211; one usually resorts to randomly selecting one of the tied candidates
