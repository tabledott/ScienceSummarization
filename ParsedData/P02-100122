t pathsets, and * computes infinite unions.
    To compute (1) now, we only need the total weight ti of accepting paths in xi o f o yi (Fig.
    2).
    This can be computed with finite-state methods: the machine (exxi)of o(yixc) is aversion that replaces all input:output labels with c: c, so it maps (E, 6) to the same total weight ti.
    Minimizing it yields a onestate FST from which ti can be read directly!
    The other &#8220;magical&#8221; property of the expectation semiring is that it automatically keeps track of the tangled parameter counts.
    For instance, recall that traversing Q a:x &#8722;) Q should have the same effect as traversing both the underlying arcs &#174; a:p &#8722;) &#174; and &#169; p:x &#8722;) &#169;.
    And indeed, if the underlying arcs have values v1 and v2, then the composed arc @ a:x &#8722;) @ gets weight &#65533;,&#8222;1,p1v1) &#174; p ( g &#65533;N2,p2v2) = (p1p2, p1p2(v1 + v2)), just as if it had value v1 + v2.
    Some concrete examples of values may be useful: Really
