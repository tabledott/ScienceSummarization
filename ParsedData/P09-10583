ds from particular errors in a training corpus.
    We conducted our experiments on Penn Chinese Treebank (Xia et al., 2000) and compared our approach with the best previous approaches reported in the literature.
    Experimental results indicate that our approach can achieve state-of-the-art performance.
    The paper proceeds as follows: Section 2 gives background on the word-character hybrid model, Section 3 describes our policies for correct path selection, Section 4 presents our training method based on MIRA, Section 5 shows our experimental results, Section 6 discusses related work, and Section 7 concludes the paper.
  
  
    In joint word segmentation and the POS tagging process, the task is to predict a path of word hypotheses y = (y1, ... , y#y) = ((w1, p1), ... , (w#y, p#y)) for a given character sequence x = (c1, ... , c#x), where w is a word, p is its POS tag, and a &#8220;#&#8221; symbol denotes the number of elements in each variable.
    The goal of our learning algorithm is to learn a mapping
