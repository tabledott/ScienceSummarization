hographic procedure because we are dealing with transcriptions.
    Obviously, a full understanding of the self-correction system calls for detailed phonetic/phonological investigations.
    After the Surface Copy Editor has applied, the string that the lexical analyzer sees is (11) rather than (10).
    Lexical assignments are made, and the parser proceeds to build the tree structures.
    After some processing, the configuration of the data structures is that shown in Figure 1.
    Before determining what next rule to apply, the two editing rules come into play, the Category Editor and the Stack Editor.
    At this pulse, the Stack Editor will apply because the first constituent in the window is the same (an AUX node) as the current active node, and the current node ends with an edit signal.
    As a result, the first window element is popped into another dimension, leaving the the parser data structures in the state shown in Figure 2.
    Parsing of the sentence proceeds, and eventually reaches the state s
