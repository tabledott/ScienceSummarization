    Knowledge of possible concept verbalizations can help to generate a text which best fits existing syntactic and pragmatic constraints.
    Traditionally, alternative verbalizations are derived from a manual corpus analysis, and are, therefore, application specific.
    The second approach &#8212; utilization of existing lexical resources, such as WordNet &#8212; overcomes the scalability problem associated with an application specific collection of paraphrases.
    Lexical resources are used in statistical generation, summarization and question-answering.
    The question here is what type of WordNet relations can be considered as paraphrases.
