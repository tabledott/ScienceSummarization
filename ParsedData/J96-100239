ribed sets.
    Specifically, we consider functions f (x, y) that are one if y is some particular French word and the context x contains a given English word, and are zero otherwise.
    We employ the following notation to represent these features: Here fi = 1 when April follows in and en is the translation of in; f2 -= 1 when weeks is one of the three words following in and pendant is the translation.
    The set of features under consideration is vast, but may be expressed in abbreviated form in Table 4.
    In the table, the symbol 0 is a placeholder for a possible French word and the symbol is a placeholder for a possible English word.
    The feature fi mentioned above is thus derived from template 2 with 0 = en and 0 = April; the feature f2 is derived from template 5 with 0 = pendant and 0 = weeks.
    If there are IVE I total English words and IVA total French words, there are IVA template-1 features, and IVE I .
    IV.T features of templates 2, 3, 4, and 5.
    Template 1 features give rise to constr
