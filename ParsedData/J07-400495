e sentences are not used for training.
    For the normal-form model we were able to use 35,732 sentences for training (90.2% of Sections 02&#8211;21) and for the dependency model 35,889 sentences (90.6%).
    Table 5 gives training statistics for the normal-form and dependency models (and a hybrid model described in Section 10.2.1), for various sequences of &#946; values, when the training algorithm is run to convergence on an 18-node cluster.
    The training algorithm is defined to have converged when the percentage change in the objective function is less than 0.0001%.
    The &#963; value in Equation (16), which was determined experimentally using the development data, was set at 1.3 for all the experiments in this article.
    The main reason that the normal-form model requires less memory and converges faster than the dependency model is that, for the normal-form model, we applied the two types of normal-form restriction described in Section 9.3: First, categories can only combine if they appear togeth
