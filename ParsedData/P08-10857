oposed an unsupervised tagger based on transformationbased learning (Brill, 1995a), achieving accuracies of above 95%.
    This unsupervised tagger relied on an initial step in which the most probable tag for each word is chosen.
    Optimized lexicons and Brill&#8217;s most-probable-tag Oracle are not available in realistic unsupervised settings, yet, they show that good initial conditions greatly facilitate learning.
    Recent work on unsupervised POS tagging for English has significantly improved the results on this task: GG, SE and most recently TJ report the best results so far on the task of unsupervised POS tagging of the WSJ with diluted dictionaries.
    With dictionaries as small as 1249 lexical entries the LDA-based method with a strong ambiguity-class model reaches POS accuracy as high as 89.7% on a reduced tagset of 17 tags.
    While these 3 methods rely on the same feature set (lexical context, spelling features) for the learning stage, the LDA approach bases its predictions entirely on observ
