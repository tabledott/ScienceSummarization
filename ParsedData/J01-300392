om head words to classes.
    Our work extends each of these approaches in some dimension, thereby providing additional support for the hypothesis that syntax and semantics are correlated in a systematic and predictive way.
    We extend Dorr's alternation-based automatic classification to a statistical setting.
    By using distributional approximations of indicators of alternations, we solve the sparse data problem without recourse to external sources of knowledge, such as the LDOCE, and in addition, we are able to learn argument structure alternations using exclusively positive examples.
    We improve on the approach of Oishi and Matsumoto (1997) by learning argument structure properties, which, unlike grammatical functions, are not marked morphologically, and by not relying on external sources of knowledge.
    Furthermore, in contrast to Siegel (1998) and Lapata and Brew (1999) our method applies successfully to previously unseen words&#8212;i.e., test cases that were not represented in the training set
