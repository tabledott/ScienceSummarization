  Distinguishing Word Senses In Untagged Text
  
    This paper describes an experimental comparison of three unsupervised learning algorithms that distinguish the sense of an ambiguous word in untagged text.
    The methods described in this paper, McQuitty's similarity analysis, Ward's minimum&#8212;variance method, and the EM algorithm, assign each instance of an ambiguous word to a known sense definition based solely on the values of automatically identifiable features in text.
    These methods and feature sets are found to be more successful in disambiguating nouns rather than adjectives or verbs.
    Overall, the most accurate of these procedures is McQuitty's similarity analysis in combination with a high dimensional feature set.
  
  
    Statistical methods for natural language processing are often dependent on the availability of costly knowledge sources such as manually annotated text or semantic networks.
    This limits the applicability of such approaches to domains where this hard to acquire
