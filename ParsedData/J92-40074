nal model of discourse structure cannot depend upon analyses in which the informational and intentional levels of relation are in competition.
    Rather, it is essential that a discourse model include both levels of analysis.
    We show that the assumption of a single rhetorical relation between consecutive discourse elements is one of the reasons that RST analyses are inherently ambiguous.'
    We also show that this same assumption underlies the problem observed by Moore and Paris.
    Finally, we point out that a straightforward approach to revising RST by modifying the definitions of the subject matter relations to indicate associated presentational analyses (or vice versa) cannot succeed.
    Such an approach presumes a one-to-one mapping between the ways in which information can be related and the ways in which intentions combine into a coherent plan to affect a hearer's mental state&#8212;and no such mapping exists.
    We thus conclude that in RST, and, indeed, in any viable theory of discourse stru
