    This paper presents a study in the automatic acquisition of lexical syntax from naturally occurring English text.
    It focuses on discovering the kinds of syntactic phrases that can be used to represent the semantic arguments of particular verbs.
    For example, want can take an infinitive argument and hope a tensed clause argument, but not vice versa: This study focuses on the ability of verbs to take arguments represented by infinitives, tensed clauses, and noun phrases serving as both direct and indirect objects.
    These lexical properties are similar to those that Chomsky (1965) termed subcategorization frames, but to avoid confusion the properties under study here will be referred to as syntactic frames or simply frames.
