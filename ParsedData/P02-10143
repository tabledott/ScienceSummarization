feature set, even though the learning algorithms investigated have built-in feature selection mechanisms.
    We demonstrate empirically that the degradation in performance can be attributed, at least in part, to poor performance on common noun resolution.
    A manually selected subset of 22&#8211;26 features, however, is shown to provide significant gains in performance when chosen specifically to improve precision on common noun resolution.
    Overall, the learning framework and linguistic knowledge source modifications boost performance of Soon&#8217;s learning-based coreference resolution approach from an F-measure of 62.6 to 70.4, and from 60.4 to 63.4 for the MUC-6 and MUC-7 data sets, respectively.
    To our knowledge, these are the best results reported to date on these data sets for the full NP coreference problem.1 The rest of the paper is organized as follows.
    In sections 2 and 3, we present the baseline coreference system and explore extra-linguistic modifications to the machine learning fr
