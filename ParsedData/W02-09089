rms with frequency and frequency rank data from the PTB, BNC and REUTERS, as well as the number of senses in WordNet and Macquarie, and their maximum and minimum depth in the WordNet hierarchy.
    For each term we extracted a thesaurus entry with 200 potential synonyms and their similarity scores.
    The simplest method of evaluation is direct comparison of the extracted thesaurus with a manuallycreated gold standard (Grefenstette, 1994).
    However, on small corpora, rare direct matches provide limited information for evaluation, and thesaurus coverage is a problem.
    Our evaluation uses a combination of three electronic thesauri: the Macquarie (Bernard, 1990), Roget&#8217;s (Roget, 1911) and Moby (Ward, 1996) thesauri.
    Roget&#8217;s and Macquarie are topic ordered and the Moby thesaurus is head ordered.
    As the extracted thesauri do not distinguish between senses, we transform Roget&#8217;s and Macquarie into head ordered format by conflating the sense sets containing each term.
