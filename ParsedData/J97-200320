ave a characterization of subsequential functions based on the definition of a metric on E*.
    Denote by u A v the longest common prefix of two strings u and v in E*.
    It is easy to verify that the following defines a metric on E*: The following theorem describes this characterization of subsequential functions.
    Theorem 6 Let f be a partial function mapping E* to A*. f is subsequential iff: The notion of bounded variation can be roughly understood here as follows: if d(x,y) is small enough, namely if the prefix that x and y share is sufficiently long compared to their lengths, then the same is true of their images by f, f(x) and f(y).
    This theorem can be extended to describe the case of p-subsequential functions by defining a metric do&#176; on (A*)P. For any u = , up) and v(vi,.. , vp) E (A*)P, we define: Assume f p-subsequential, and let T be a p-subsequential transducer realizing f. A transducer Ti, 1 &lt; i &lt; p, realizing a component fi off can be obtained from T simply by keeping only one
