isambiguation can be handled by including a new kind of operator that splits a cluster into subclusters.
    We leave this to future work. above a threshold.9 The operation with the highest score is executed, and the parameters are updated with the new optimal values.
    The QLFs which contain an affected part are reparsed, and operations in the agenda whose score might be affected are re-evaluated.
    These changes are done very efficiently using inverted indexes.
    We omit the details here due to space limitations.
    USP terminates when the agenda is empty, and outputs the current MLN parameters and semantic parses.
    USP learning uses the same optimization objective as hard EM, and is also guaranteed to find a local optimum since at each step it improves the log-likelihood.
    It differs from EM in directly optimizing the likelihood instead of a lower bound.
  
  
    Evaluating unsupervised semantic parsers is difficult, because there is no predefined formal language or gold logical forms for the
