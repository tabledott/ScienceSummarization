rcement&#8221; sense of drug, Sense 2 refers to &#8220;medication&#8221;, Sense 3 to the &#8220;drug industry&#8221; and Sense 4 to &#8220;drugs research&#8221;.
    The inferred senses for drug on the BNC (bottom half of Table 1) are more fine grained.
    For example, the model finds distinct senses for &#8220;medication&#8221; (Sense 1 and 7) and &#8220;illegal substance&#8221; (Senses 2, 4, 6, 7).
    It also finds a separate sense for &#8220;drug dealing&#8221; (Sense 5) and &#8220;enforcement&#8221; (Sense 8).
    Because the BNC has a broader focus, finer distinctions are needed to cover as many senses as possible that are relevant to the target domain (WSJ).
    Layer Analysis We next examine which individual feature categories are most informative in our sense induction task.
    We also investigate whether their combination, through our layered model (see Figure 2), yields performance improvements.
    We used 4 senses for the system trained on WSJ and 8 for the system trained on the BNC (a was set
