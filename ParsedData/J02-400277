ysis is genre-specific; it is based on rhetorical phenomena specific to academic writing, such as problem-solution structure, explicit intellectual attribution, and statements of relatedness to other work.
    The goal of the analysis is to identify the contribution of an article in relation to background material and to other specific current work.
    Our methodology is situated between text extraction methods and fact extraction (template-filling) methods: Although our analysis has the advantage of being more context-sensitive than text extraction methods, it retains the robustness of this approach toward different subdomains, presentational traditions, and writing styles.
    Like fact extraction methods (e.g., Radev and McKeown 1998), our method also uses a &#8220;template&#8221; whose slots are being filled during analysis.
