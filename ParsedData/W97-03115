 two languages (bitexts) (Brown et al., 1993; Melamed, 1997).
    The more accurate algorithms used for constructing translation models, including the EM algorithm, alternate between two phases.
    In the first phase, the algorithm finds and counts the most likely links between word tokens in the two halves of the bitext.
    Links connect words that are hypothesized to be mutual translations.
    In the second phase, the algorithm estimates translation probabilities by dividing the link counts by the total number of links.
    Let S and T represent the distributions of linked words in the source and target' texts.
    A simple translation model is just a joint probability distribution Pr(s, t), which indicates the probability that a randomly selected link in the bitext links
  
  
    The decision whether a given sequence of words should count as an NCC can be made automatically, if it can be expressed in terms of an explicit objective function for the given application.
    The first application I will con
