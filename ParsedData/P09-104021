 is a graph-based parser guided by the predictions of a transition-based parser and currently has the best reported results on the CoNLL-X data sets (Nivre and McDonald, 2008).
    Looking first at the overall attachment score, we see that Su gives a substantial improvement over Sp (and outperforms Spp) for Czech and Slovene, where the scores achieved are rivaled only by the combo system MSTMalt.
    For these languages, there is no statistical difference between Su and MSTMalt, which are both significantly better than all the other parsers, except Spp for Czech (McNemar&#8217;s test, &#945; = .05).
    This is accompanied by an improvement on non-projective arcs, where Su outperforms all other systems for Czech and is second only to the two MST parsers (MST-06 and MSTMalt) for Slovene.
    It is worth noting that the percentage of non-projective arcs is higher for Czech (1.9%) and Slovene (1.9%) than for any of the other languages.
    For the other three languages, Su has a drop in overall attachment score
