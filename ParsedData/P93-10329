rformed by a program that processed the output of the tagger.
    The program had two parts: a finite state parser ran through the text, parsing auxiliary sequences and noting complements after verbs and collecting histogram-type statistics for the appearance of verbs in various contexts.
    A second process of statistical filtering then took the raw histograms and decided the best guess for what subcategorization frames each observed verb actually had.
    The finite state parser The finite state parser essentially works as follows: it scans through text until it hits a verb or auxiliary, it parses any auxiliaries, noting whether the verb is active or passive, and then it parses complements following the verb until something recognized as a terminator of subcategorized arguments is reached.11 Whatever has been found is entered in the histogram.
    The parser includes a simple NP recognizer (parsing determiners, possessives, adjectives, numbers and compound nouns) and various other rules to recognize certai
