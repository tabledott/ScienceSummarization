 more accurate than the baseline system.
    We also compare the top result of our synchronous binarization system with the state-of-theart alignment-template approach (ATS) (Och and Ney, 2004).
    The results are shown in Table 1.
    Our system has a promising improvement over the ATS system which is trained on a larger data-set but tuned independently.
  
  
    Modeling reorderings between languages has been a major challenge for machine translation.
    This work shows that the majority of syntactic reorderings, at least between languages like English and Chinese, can be efficiently decomposed into hierarchical binary reorderings.
    From a modeling perspective, on the other hand, it is beneficial to start with a richer representation that has more transformational power than ITG or binary SCFG.
    Our work shows how to convert it back to a computationally friendly form without harming much of its expressiveness.
    As a result, decoding with n-gram models can be fast and accurate, making it possible
