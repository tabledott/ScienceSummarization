20;find-topic-extract-sentence&#8221; which claims that parallel or similar sentences can only be found in document pairs with high similarity.
    We propose a new, &#8220;find-one-get-more&#8221; principle which claims that document pairs that contain at least one pair of matched sentences must contain others, even if these document pairs do not have high similarity scores.
    Based on this, we propose a novel Bootstrapping method that successfully extracts parallel sentences from a far more disparate and very-non-parallel corpus than reported in previous work.
    This very-non-parallel corpus, TDT3 data, includes documents that are off-topic, i.e. documents with no corresponding topic in the other language.
    This is a completely unsupervised method.
    Evaluation results show that our approach achieves 65.7% accuracy and a 50% relative improvement from baseline.
    This shows that the proposed method is promising.
    We also find that the IBM Model 4 lexical learner is weak on data from very-non-pa
