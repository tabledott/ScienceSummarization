ntroducing subcategorization parameters allows the model to generalize in an important way about rules.
    We have carefully isolated the &#8220;core&#8221; of rules&#8212;the subcategorization frame&#8212;that the model should be certain about.
    We should note that Charniak&#8217;s method will certainly have some advantages in estimation: It will capture some statistical properties of rules that our independence assumptions will lose (e.g., the distribution over the number of PP adjuncts seen for a particular head).
  
  
    Unfortunately, because of space limitations, it is not possible to give a complete review of previous work in this article.
    In the next two sections we give a detailed comparison of the models in this article to the lexicalized PCFG model of Charniak (1997) and the history-based models of Jelinek et al. (1994), Magerman (1995), and Ratnaparkhi (1997).
    For discussion of additional related work, chapter 4 of Collins (1999) attempts to give a comprehensive review of work on sta
