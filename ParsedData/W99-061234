s are satisfying in that they (a) show clear and consistent trends across several diverse languages, (b) show clear trends for improvement as training resources grow, and (c) show that comparable (and robust) classification results can be achieved on this diversity of languages.
  
  
    For future work, natural next steps include incorporating a language independent word segmentation phase like the one proposed by Amitay, Richmond and Smith (1997), to improve the performance on large texts.
    Different statistics can be pre-computed for different languages and language families and stored in external files.
    For example, the a priori probability of a named entity given the set of characteristics of its representation in the text, such as position, capitalization, and relative position of other entities (e.g.
    : first name followed by last name).
    A further step is the implementation of a supervised active learning system based on the present algorithm, in which the most relevant words for future
