h document, stem the terms (words) using the Porter stemming algorithm, calculate the local (document) and global (collection) weights, build a comprehensive dictionary of the collection, and create the inverted index file.
    The number of documents that contain the keywords returned by the Search Engine may be large since only weak Boolean operators were used.
    A new, more restrictive operator was introduced: PARAGRAPH n. This operator searches like an AND operator for the words in the query with the constraint that the words belong only to some n consecutive paragraphs, where n is a controllable positive integer.
    The parameter n selects the number of paragraphs, thus controlling the size of the text retrieved from a document considered relevant.
    The rationale is that most likely the information requested is found in a few paragraphs rather than being dispersed over an entire document.
    Paragraph ordering is performed by a radix sort that involves three different scores: the largest Same_word
