    In other words, when Ident and SUBJECT are split, Ident overrides SUBJECT as the stronger shared property for the zero pronominals that retain the same Cb across adjacent utterances.
    Based on the interpretation of various SUBJ/Ident combinations (see Kameyama 1985 Ch.2 for more details), the constraint is restated as follows:19 (24) Centering Constraint [Japanese] (final version) Two zero pronominals that retain the same Cb in adjacent utterances should share one of the following properties (in descending order of prefe
