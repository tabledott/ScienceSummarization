CKTAIL filters its most performant rules through massive training data, generated by its AUTOTAG-COFtEF component.
    Furthermore, by using an entropy-based method we determine the best partition of corefering expressions in coreference chains.
    New rules are learned by applying a bootstrapping methodology that uncovers additional semantic consistency data.
