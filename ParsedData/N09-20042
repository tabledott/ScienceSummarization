    Such models, which identify semantic frames within input sentences by marking its predicates, and labeling their arguments with the semantic roles that they fill.
    Evidence has begun to accumulate that semantic frames &#8211; predicates and semantic roles &#8211; tend to preserve consistency across translations better than syntactic roles do.
    This is, of course, by design; it follows from the definition of semantic roles, which are less language-dependent than syntactic roles.
    Across Chinese and English, for example, it has been reported that approximately 84% of semantic roles are preserved consistently (Fung et al. 2006).
    Of these, roughly 15% do not preserve syntactic roles consistently.
    Since this directly targets the task of determining semantic correctness, we believe that the adequacy of MT output could be improved
