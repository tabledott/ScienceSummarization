    Doing so leads to the results in Table 3.
    This translates into an estimated 100% precision against 64.1% recall, with a yield of 2491 documents, approximately 1.5 million words per language as counted after removal of HTML markup.
    That is, with a reasonable though admittedly post-hoc revision of the language identification criterion, comparison with human subjects suggests the acquired corpus is nontrivial and essentially noise free, and moreover, that the system excludes only a third of the pages that should have been kept.

    E.g. see the 13-language set of the freely available CMU stochastic language iden
