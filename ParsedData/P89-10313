m's operation.
    We have made this choice because we want to be able to analyse the performance of the algorithms across different domains.
    We focus on the linguistic basis of these approaches, using only selectional restrictions, so that our analysis is independent of the vagaries of a particular knowledge representation.
    Thus what we are evaluating is the extent to which these algorithms suffice to narrow the search of an inference component'.
    This analysis gives us 'But note the definition of success in section 2.1. some indication of the contribution of syntactic constraints, task structure and global focus to anaphoric processing.
    The data on which we compare the algorithms are important if we are to evaluate claims of generality.
    If we look at types of NL input, one clear division is between textual and interactive input.
    A related, though not identical factor is whether the language being analysed is produced by more than one person, although this distinction may be conflated
