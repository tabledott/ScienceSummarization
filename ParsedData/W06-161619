 P contained cnj, for coordination dependencies; and det, for determiner dependencies.
    One exception was added for the coordination constraint: dependencies can cross when coordinated arguments are verbs.
    One drawback of hard deterministic constraints is the undesirable effect noisy data can cause.
    We see this most prominently with coordination argument compatibility.
    Words ending in &#8220;en&#8221; are typically wrongly tagged and cause our coordination argument constraint to discard correct coordinations.
    As a workaround we assigned words ending in &#8220;en&#8221; a wildcard POS tag which is compatible with all POS tags.
  
  
    In this section we report our results.
    We not only present our accuracy but also provide an empirical evaluation of the runtime behaviour of this approach and show how parsing can be accelerated using a simple approximation.
    An important question to answer when using global constraints is: How much of a performance boost is gained when using global co
