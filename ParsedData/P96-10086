heir associated probability scores, are passed to the discourse model.

    The constrained space of candidate pre-discourse meanings Ms (received from the semantic interpretation model), combined with the full space of possible postdiscourse meanings MD, is searched for the single candidate that maximizes P( MD I H,M s) P(Ms,T) P(W IT) ,conditioned on the current history H. The discourse history is then updated and the post-discourse meaning is returned.
    We now proceed to a detailed discussion of each of these three stages, beginning with parsing.
  
  
    Our parse representation is essentially syntactic in form, patterned on a simplified head-centered theory of phrase structure.
    In content, however, the parse trees are as much semantic as syntactic.
    Specifically, each parse node indicates both a semantic and a syntactic class (excepting a few types that serve purely syntactic functions).
    Figure 2 shows a sample parse of a typical ATIS sentence.
    The semantic,/syntactic character o
