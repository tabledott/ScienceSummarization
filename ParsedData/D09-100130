elational triples in the form (R, A1, A2), where R is the relation string, and A1, A2 the argument strings.
    Given a triple and a question, we first match their relation strings, and then match the strings for the argument that is present in the question.
    If both match, we return the other argument string in the triple as an answer.
    We report results when exact match is used (TR-EXACT), or when the triple string can contain the question one as a substring (TR-SUB).
    RESOLVER: RESOLVER (Yates and Etzioni, 2009) inputs TextRunner triples and collectively resolves coreferent relation and argument strings.
    On the GENIA data, using the default parameters, RESOLVER produces only a few trivial relation clusters and no argument clusters.
    This is not surprising, since RESOLVER assumes high redundancy in the data, and will discard any strings with fewer than 25 extractions.
    For a fair comparison, we also ran RESOLVER using all extractions, and manually tuned the parameters based on eyeballing
