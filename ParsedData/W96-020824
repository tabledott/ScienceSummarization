    The current results are for only one simple encoding of the lexical disambiguation problem into a feature vector representing an unordered set of word stems.
    This paper has focused on exploring the space of possible algorithms rather than the space of possible input representations.
    Alternative encodings which exploit positional information, syntactic word tags, syntactic parse trees, semantic information, etc. should be tested to determine the utility of more sophisticated representations.
    In particular, it would be interesting to see if the accuracy ranking of the seven algorithms is affected by a change in the representation.
    Similar comparisons of a range of algorithms should also be performed on other natural language problems such as part-of-speech tagging (Church, 1988), prepositional phrase attachment (Hindle 8,/ Rooth, 1993), anaphora resolution (Anoe &amp; Bennett, 1995), etc..
    Since the requirements of individual tasks vary, different algorithms may be suitable for differen
