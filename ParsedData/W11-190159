perfect speaker turn information.
    Under more realistic application conditions, the spread in performance between genres might be greater.
  
  
    Tables 22 and 23 summarize the approaches of the participating systems along with some of the important dimensions.
    Most of the systems broke the problem into two phases, first identifying the potential mentions in the text and then linking the mentions to form coreference chains.
    Most participants also used rule-based approaches for mention detection, though two did use trained models.
    While trained morels seem able to better balance precision and recall, and thus to achieve a higher F-score on the mention task itself, their recall tends to be quite a bit lower than that achievable by rule-based systems designed to favor recall.
    This impacts coreference scores because the full coreference system has no way to recover if the mention detection stage misses a potentially anaphoric mention.
    Only one of the participating systems cai attempted t
