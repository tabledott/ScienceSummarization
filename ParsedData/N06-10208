   NANC contains news articles from various news sources including the Wall Street Journal, though for this paper, we only use articles from the LA Times.
  
  
    We use the reranking parser to produce 50-best parses of unlabeled news articles from NANC.
    Next, we produce two sets of one-best lists from these 50best lists.
    The parser-best and reranker-best lists represent the best parse for each sentence according to the parser and reranker, respectively.
    Finally, we mix a portion of parser-best or rerankerbest lists with the standard Wall Street Journal training data (sections 2-21) to retrain a new parser (but not reranker1) model.
    The Wall Street Journal training data is combined with the NANC data in the following way: The count of each parsing event is the (optionally weighted) sum of the counts of that event in Wall Street Journal and NANC.
    Bacchiani et al. (2006) show that count merging is more effective than creating multiple models and calculating weights for each model (model in
