the same phenomenon, the one with fewer categories will result in higher percentage agreement just by chance.
    If two coders randomly classify utterances in a uniform manner using the scheme of Table 1, we would expect an equal number of items to fall in each of the four cells in the table, and therefore pure chance will cause the coders to agree on half of the items (the two cells on the diagonal: 14 + 14).
    But suppose we want to refine the simple binary coding scheme by introducing a new category, check, as in the MapTask coding scheme (Carletta et al. 1997).
    If two coders randomly classify utterances in a uniform manner using the three categories in the second scheme, they would only agree on a third of the items (19 + 19 + 19).
    A simple example of agreement on dialogue act tagging.
  
  
    The second reason percentage agreement cannot be trusted is that it does not correct for the distribution of items among categories: We expect a higher percentage agreement when one category is much mor
