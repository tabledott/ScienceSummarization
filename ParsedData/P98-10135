pear as oblique complements.
    Some combinations of frame elements, or Frame Element Groups (FEGs), for some real corpus sentences in the DRIVING frame are shown in Fig.
    2.
    A RIDING_1 frame has the primary mover role as RIDER, and allows as VEHICLE those driven by others.7 In grammatical realizations of this frame, the RIDER can be the subject; the VEHICLE can appear as a direct object or an oblique complement; and the PATH is generally realized as an oblique.
    The FrameNet entry for each of these verbs will include a concise formula for all semanwork includes the separate analysis of the frame semantics of directional and locational expressions. tic and syntactic combinatorial possibilities, together with a collection of annotated corpus sentences in which each possibility is exemplified.
    The syntactic positions considered relevant for lexicographic description include those that are internal to the maximal projection of the target word (the whole VP, AP, or NP for target V, A or N), and tho
