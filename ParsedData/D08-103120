le to ours: Both use gold mention boundaries and types, evaluate using BCubed F-Score, and have the same training and test data split.
    Culotta et al. (2007) is the best comparable system of which we are aware.
    Our results show that a pairwise model with strong features outperforms a state-of-the-art system with a more complex model.
    MUC Score We evaluate the performance of our system using the official MUC score in Table 5.
    In Table 6 we show the relative impact of various features.
    We report data on Dev-Eval, to avoid the possibility of overfitting by feature selection.
    The parameters of the algorithm are chosen to maximize the BCubed F-Score on the Dev-Tune data.
    Note that since we report results on Dev-Eval, the results in Table 6 are not directly comparable with Culotta et al. (2007).
    For comparable results, see Table 4 and the discussion above.
    Our ablation study shows the impact of various classes of features, indicating that almost all the features help, although som
