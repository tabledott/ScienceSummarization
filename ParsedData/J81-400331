ation into definite clauses; (ii) to provide for simple description of left extraposition and related restrictions; (iii) to be comparable in efficiency with DCGs when executed by PROLOG.
    It turns out that these requirements are not contradictory, and that the resulting design is extremely simple.
    The restrictions on extraposition are naturally expressed in terms of scope, and scope is expressed in the formalism by &amp;quot;bracketing out&amp;quot; subderivations corresponding to balanced strings.
    The notion of bracketed string derivation is introduced in order to describe extraposition and bracketing independently of the translation of XGs into logic programs.
    Some questions about XGs have not been tackled in this paper.
    First, from a theoretical point of view it would be necessary to complete the independent characterisation of XGs in terms of bracketed strings, and show rigorously that the translation of XGs into logic programs correctly renders this independent characterisation of the
