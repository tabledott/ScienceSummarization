e key .
  When the response overlaps the key in such a way as to produce a non-trivial set difference, as in the following figure, the response contains precision errors.
  How may we use our model-theoretic notions to provide a scoring mechanism for precision?
  In the case of recall, we conceptually needed to add links to the response , building up the responses equivalence classes so as to end up with the key .
  In the case of precision, we need to do the converse : add links to equivalence classes in the key so as to yield equivalence classes in the response .
  We are switching the "figure" and th e "ground"; that is we are switching our notion of where the base sets come from (th e response rather than the key), and of what defines the partitions on those base sets (the key rather than the response) .
  More precisely, given an equivalence class S defined by the response, we mus t determine the minimal number of links to be added to the key, so as to ensure that each o f the members of the response set
