 then the empirical results are presented.
    We close with an analysis of our findings and a discussion of related work.
    2 Building a Feature Set of Bigrams We have developed an approach to word sense disambiguation that represents text entirely in terms of the occurrence of bigrams, which we define to be two cat &#8212;cat totals big n11= 10 n12= 20 n1+= 30 &#8212;big n21= 40 n22= 930 n2+= 970 totals n+1=50 n+2=950 n++=1000 consecutive words that occur in a text.
    The distributional characteristics of bigrams are fairly consistent across corpora; a majority of them only occur one time.
    Given the sparse and skewed nature of this data, the statistical methods used to select interesting bigrams must be carefully chosen.
    We explore two alternatives, the power divergence family of goodness of fit statistics and the Dice Coefficient, an information theoretic measure related to pointwise Mutual Information.
