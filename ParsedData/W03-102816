is repeated n times to generate n classifiers that then vote to classify an instance.
    It should be noted that my intention is not to argue for this machine learning approach in favour of any other.
    However, one advantage with rules is that they may be inspected, and thus might give an insight into how the learning component makes its decisions, although this is less applicable when applying ensemble techniques.
    The feature values were calculated for each extracted unit in the training and the validation sets, that is for the n-grams, NP-chunks, stemmed NPchunks, patterns, and the stemmed patterns respectively.
    In other words, the within-document frequency, the collection frequency, and the proportion of the document preceding the first appearance for each potential term were calculated.
    Also, the POS tag(s) for each term were extracted.
    In addition, as the machine learning approach is supervised, the class was added, i.e., whether the term is a manually assigned keyword or not.
