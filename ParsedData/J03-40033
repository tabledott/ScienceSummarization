es tackle the ambiguity problem by assigning a probability to each parse tree, thereby ranking competing trees in order of plausibility.
    In many statistical models the probability for each candidate tree is calculated as a product of terms, each term corresponding to some substructure within the tree.
    The choice of parameterization is essentially the choice of how to represent parse trees.
    There are two critical questions regarding the parameterization of a parsing approach: In this article we explore these issues within the framework of generative models, more precisely, the history-based models originally introduced to parsing by Black et al. (1992).
    In a history-based model, a parse tree is represented as a sequence of decisions, the decisions being made in some derivation of the tree.
    Each decision has an associated probability, and the product of these probabilities defines a probability distribution over possible derivations.
    We first describe three parsing models based on this a
