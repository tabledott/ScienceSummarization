son, Haigh, and Atwell report some preliminary results for a parser of this type that uses the technique of simulated annealing to assign the closest fitting analysis on the basis of initial training on the LOB treebank and automatic updating of its statistical data on the basis of further parsed examples.
    Sampson, Haigh, and Atwell give their results in terms of a similarity measure with respect to correct analyses assigned by hand.
    For a 13-sentence sample the mean similarity measure was 80%, and only one example received a fully correct analysis.
    These results suggest that the technique is not reliable enough for practical corpus analysis, to date.
    In addition, the analyses assigned, on the basis of the LOB treebank scheme, are not syntactically determinate (for example, syntactic relations in unbounded dependency constructions are not represented).
    A more promising approach with similar potential robustness would be to infer a probabilistic grammar using Baum-Welch re-estimation from a
