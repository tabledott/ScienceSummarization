o parse and had to be eliminated.
    The syntactic tuples were located by the ESG parser and the postprocessing routine mentioned earlier.
    For the purpose of evaluation, we gathered only the data required for the given test examples.
    Within a practical machine translation system, the disambiguation module would require a database containing all the syntactic tuples of the corpus with their frequency counts.
    In the current research project we did not have the computing resources necessary for constructing the complete database (the major cost being parsing time).
    However, such resources are not needed in order to evaluate the proposed method.
    Since we evaluated the method only on a relatively small number of random sentences, we first constructed the set of all &amp;quot;relevant&amp;quot; target tuples, i.e., tuples that should be considered for the test sentences.
    Then we scanned the entire corpus and extracted only sentences that contain both words from at least one of the relevant
