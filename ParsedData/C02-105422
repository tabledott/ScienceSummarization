f a binary tree (Schwenker, 2001) or a directacyclic graph (Platt et al, 2000).
			Yamada and Mat sumoto (2001) applied such a method to their NEsystem and reduced its CPU time by 39%.
			This ap proach can be combined with our SVM classifers.NE recognition can be regarded as a variablelength multi-class problem.
			For this kind of prob lem, probability-based kernels are studied for more theoretically well-founded methods (Jaakkola and Haussler, 1998; Tsuda et al, 2001; Shimodaira et al., 2001).
	
	
			Our SVM-based NE recognizer attained F = 90.03%.
			This is the best score, as far as we know.
			Since it was too slow, we made SVMs faster.
			The improved classifier is 21 times faster than TinySVMand 102 times faster than SVM-Light.
			The im proved training program is 2.3 times faster than TinySVM and 3.5 times faster than SVM-Light.
			We also presented an SVM-based feature selectionmethod that removed 75% of features.
			These methods can also be applied to other tasks such as chunk ing and POS tagging.
