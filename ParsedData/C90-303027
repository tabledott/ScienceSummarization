first note that CG provides a formalism, based on ordinary linguistic concepts, that is applic- able to any language.
  Work on Finnish and Swedish is in progress.
  Second, CG fully integrates morpho- logy and surface syntax within the same formalism.
  Our present success rate for syntax, with some 220 mapping statements and 25 syntactic constraints, is slightly above 90% (words with unique syntactic labels).
  The remaining words have more than one syntactic label (one of which is correct).
