    4(b) is ill-formed because it is not a continuous segment.
    As for the example the red mentioned above, it is a well-formed floating dependency structure.
    One of the purposes of introducing floating dependency structures is that siblings having a common parent will become a well-defined entity, although they are not considered a constituent.
    We always build well-formed partial structures on the target side in decoding.
    Furthermore, we combine partial dependency structures in a way such that we can obtain all possible well-formed but no ill-formed dependency structures during bottom-up decoding.
    The solution is to employ categories introduced above.
    Each well-formed dependency structure has a category.
    We can apply four combinatory operations over the categories.
    If we can combine two categories with a certain category operation, we can use a corresponding tree operation to combine two dependency structures.
    The category of the combined dependency structure is the result
