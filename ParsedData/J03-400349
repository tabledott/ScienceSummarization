ent as a result of subcategorization parameters; adjacency then adds a 1.5% improvement; and the verb condition adds a final 1% improvement.
    From an engineering point of view, given a choice of whether to add just distance or subcategorization to the model, distance is preferable.
    But linguistically it is clear that adjacency can only approximate subcategorization and that subcategorization is Distribution of nonterminals generated as postmodifiers to an NP (see tree to the left), at various distances from the head.
    A = True means the modifier is adjacent to the head, V = True means there is a verb between the head and the modifier.
    Distributions were calculated from the first 10000 events for each of the three cases in sections 2-21 of the treebank. more &#8220;correct&#8221; in some sense.
    In free-word-order languages, distance may not approximate subcategorization at all well: A complement may appear to either the right or left of the head, confusing the adjacency condition.
