rmation inherent in fully inflected word forms that are not relevant for translation are detected.
    A method for aligning corresponding readings in conventional dictionaries containing pairs of fully inflected word forms has been proposed.
    The approach uses information deduced from one language side to resolve category ambiguity in the corresponding entry in the other language.
    The resulting disambiguated dictionaries have proven to be better suited for improving the quality of machine translation, especially if they are used in combination with the hierarchical lexicon models.
    The amount of bilingual training data required to achieve an acceptable quality of machine translation has been systematically investigated.
    All the methods mentioned previously contribute to a better exploitation of the available bilingual data and thus to improving translation quality in frameworks with scarce resources.
    Three setups for training the parameters of the statistical lexicon on Verbmobil data have
