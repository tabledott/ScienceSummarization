    A phrase is probably non-compositional if such substitutions are not found in the collocation database or their mutual information values are significantly different from that of the phrase.
  
  
    In order to implement the idea of separating noncompositional phrases from compositional ones with mutual information, we must use a criterion to determine whether or not the mutual information values of two collocations are significantly different.
    Although one could simply use a predetermined threshold for this purpose, the threshold value will be totally arbitrary.
    Furthermore, such a threshold does not take into account the fact that with different frequency counts, we have different levels confidence in the mutual information values.
    We propose a more principled approach.
    The frequency count of a collocation is a random variable with binomial distribution.
    When the frequency count is reasonably large (e.g., greater than 5), a biN% 50% 80% 90% 95% 98% 99%
