n tables.
    Simple translation models like Model 1 find more direct use in other applications (e.g., lexicon construction, idiom detection, psychological norms, and cross-language information retrieval), so their computational properties are of wider interest.
    The proofs we presented are based on a worst-case analysis.
    Real s, e, and b tables may have properties that permit faster optimal decoding than the artificial tables constructed above.
    It is also possible to devise approximation algorithms like those devised for other NP-complete problems.
    To the extent that word ordering is like solving the Traveling Salesman Problem, it is encouraging substantial progress continues to be made on Traveling Salesman algorithms.
    For example, it is often possible to get within two percent of the optimal tour in practice, and some researchers have demonstrated an optimal tour of over 13,000 U.S. cities.
    (The latter experiment relied on things like distance symmetry and the triangle inequality con
