y phrases of all three discourse categories.
    But SCONT and SF phrases exhibit similar prominence features and appear distinct from each other only in terms of timing differences.
    A second issue is whether such classification can be done con-line.'
    To address both of these issues, we made pairwise comparisons of consensus-labeled phrase groups using measures of relative change in acoustic-prosodic parameters over a local window of two consecutive phrases.
    Table 6 presents significant findings on relative changes in fO, loudness (measured in decibels), and speaking rate, from prior to current intermediate phrase.8 First, note that SBEG is distinguished from both SCONT and SF in terms of f0 change and db change from prior phrase; that is, while SBEG phrases are distinguished on a variety of measures from all other phrases (including non-consensus-labeled phrases) in Table 5, this table shows that SBEGs are also distinguishable directly from each of the other consensuslabeled categories.
