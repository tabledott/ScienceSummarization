nts) will get instantiated.
    Therefore, the VP complement rule (11) can be applied an unbounded number of times.
    The length of the lists of complements now is not known in advance, and the generator will not terminate.
    Van Noord (1989a) proposes an ad hoc solution that assumes that the empty verb is an inflectional variant of a verb.
    As inflection rules are delayed, the generation process acts as if the empty verb is an ordinary verb, thereby circumventing the problem.
    However, this solution only works if the head that is displaced is always lexical.
    This is not the case in general.
    In Dutch the verb second position can not only be filled by lexical verbs but also by a conjunction of verbs.
    Similarly, Spanish clause structure can be analyzed by assuming the &amp;quot;movement&amp;quot; of complex verbal constructions to the second position.
    Finally, in German it is possible to topicalize a verbal head.
    Note that in these problematic cases the head that lacks sufficient i
