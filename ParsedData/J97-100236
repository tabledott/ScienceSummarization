ogues), they also tended to agree on what type of game it was (INSTRUCT, EXPLAIN, QUERY-W, QUERY-YN, ALIGN, or CHECK) (K = .86, N = 154, k = 4).
    Although this is not the same as agreeing on the category of an initiating move because not all initiating moves begin games, disagreement stems from the same move naming confusions (notably, the distinction between QUERY-YN and CHECK).
    There was also confusion about whether a game with an agreed beginning was embedded or not (K = .46).
    The question of where a game ends is related to the embedding subcode, since games end after other games that are embedded within them.
    Using just the games for which all four coders agreed on the beginning, the coders reached 65% pairwise percent agreement on where the game ended.
    The abandoned game subcode turned out to be so scarce in the cross-coding study that it was not possible to calculate agreement for it, but agreement is probably poor.
    Some coders have commented that the coding practice was unstructu
