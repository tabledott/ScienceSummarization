t, if it is used to provide a single category per word, so it seems that our dependency model is further biased against object extractions, possibly because of the technical unsoundness noted earlier.
    It should be recalled in judging these figures that they are only a first attempt at recovering these long-range dependencies, which most other widecoverage parsers make no attempt to recover at all.
    To get an idea of just how demanding this task is, it is worth looking at an example of object relativization that the parser gets correct.
    Figure 2 gives part of a dependency structure returned by the parser for a sentence from section 00 (with the relations omitted).11 Notice that both respect and confidence are objects of had.
    The relevant dependency quadruples found by the parser are the following:
  
  
    This paper has shown that accurate, efficient widecoverage parsing is possible with CCG.
    Along with Hockenmaier and Steedman (2002b), this is the first CCG parsing work that we are aware
