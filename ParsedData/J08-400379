arning and classification are kept constant.
    Table 4 gives the results of the efficiency evaluation.
    Looking first at learning times, it is obvious that learning time depends primarily on the number of training instances, which is why we can observe a difference of several orders of magnitude in learning time between the biggest training set (Czech) and the smallest training set (Slovene) for a given parsing algorithm.
    Broadly speaking, for any given parsing algorithm, the ranking of languages with respect to learning time follows the ranking with respect to training set size, with a few noticeable exceptions.
    Thus, learning times are shorter than expected, relative to other languages, for Swedish and Japanese, but longer than expected for Arabic and (except in the case of the arc-standard parsers) for Danish.
    However, the number of training instances for the SVM learner depends not only on the number of tokens in the training set, but also on the number of transitions required to parse a
