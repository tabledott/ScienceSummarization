UC-7, and ACE (2000-2004) corpora.
    The MUC-6 data was taken from the Wall Street Journal, whereas the MUC-7 data was from the New York Times.
    The ACE data spanned many different genres similar to the ones in OntoNotes.
    Parse Trees This represents the syntactic layer that is a revised version of the Penn Treebank.
    For purposes of this task, traces were removed from the syntactic trees, since the CoNLL-style data format, being indexed by tokens, does not provide any good means of conveying that information.
    Function tags were also removed, since the parsers that we used for the predicted syntax layer did not provide them.
    One thing that needs to be dealt with in conversational data is the presence of disfluencies (restarts, etc.).
    In the original OntoNotes parses, these are marked using a special EDITED7 phrase tag &#8211; as was the case for the Switchboard Treebank.
    Given the frequency of disfluencies and the performance with which one can identify them automatically,8 a probab
