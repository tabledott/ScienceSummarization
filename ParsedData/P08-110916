native parsing has given results on sentences of length &lt; 15, but most parsing literature gives results on either sentences of length &lt; 40, or all sentences.
    To properly situate this work with respect to both sets of literature we trained models on both length &lt; 15 (WSJ15) and length &lt; 40 (WSJ40), and we also tested on all sentences using the WSJ40 models.
    Our results also provide a context for interpreting previous work which used WSJ15 and not WSJ40.
    We used a relatively simple grammar with few additional annotations.
    Starting with the grammar read off of the training set, we added parent annotations onto each state, including the POS tags, resulting in rules such as S-ROOT &#8212;* NP-S VP-S. We also added head tag annotations to VPs, in the same manner as (Klein and Manning, 2003).
    Lastly, for the WSJ40 runs we used a simple, right branching binarization where each active state is annotated with its previous sibling and first child.
    This is equivalent to children of a s
