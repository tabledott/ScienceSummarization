ng min(i, j) &lt; k &lt; max(i, j), there is a directed path in y from i to k).
    A dependency tree is called projective if it only contains projective arcs.
    Fig.
    1 illustrates this concept.3 The formulation to be introduced in &#167;3 makes use of the notion of the incidence vector associated with a dependency tree y &#8712; Y(x).
    This is the binary vector z &#176;_ hzaia&#8712;A with each component defined as za = ff(a &#8712; y) (here, ff(.) denotes the indicator function).
    Considering simultaneously all incidence vectors of legal dependency trees and taking the convex hull, we obtain a polyhedron that we call the arborescence polytope, denoted by Z(x).
    Each vertex of Z(x) can be identified with a dependency tree in Y(x).
    The Minkowski-Weyl theorem (Rockafellar, 1970) ensures that Z(x) has a representation of the form Z(x) = {z &#8712; R|A  ||Az &#8804; b}, for some p-by-|A| matrix A and some vector b in Rp.
    However, it is not easy to obtain a compact representation (where p g
