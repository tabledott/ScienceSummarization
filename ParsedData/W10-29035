 effectively and generalize better.
    Current semantic parsing approaches extract parsing rules mapping NL to their MR, restricting possible interpretations to previously seen syntactic patterns.
    We replace the rigid inference process induced by the learned parsing rules with a flexible framework.
    We model semantic interpretation as a sequence of interdependent decisions, mapping text spans to predicates and use syntactic information to determine how the meaning of these logical fragments should be composed.
    We frame this process as an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) problem, a powerful and flexible inference framework that allows us to inject relevant domain knowledge into the inference process, such as specific domain semantics that restrict the space of possible interpretations.
    We evaluate our learning approach and model on the well studied Geoquery domain (Zelle and Mooney, 1996; Tang and Mooney, 2001), a database consisting of U.S. geographical information, and natural language questi
