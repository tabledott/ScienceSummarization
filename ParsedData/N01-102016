light improvment is observed for Romanian-Portuguese under S, but no improvement for Italian-Portuguese.
    Also, empirical evidence suggests that the best method is achieved through learning weights with stochastic transducers and then using these weights in the L-S framework. for each word o E 0 for each bridge language B Translate o b E B Vt E T, Calculate D(b,t) Rank t by D(b,t) Score t using information from all bridges Select highest scored t Produce mapping o t Two scoring methods were investigated for the above algorithm: one based on rank and the other on distance.
    The rank-based scoring method takes each proposed target and combines the rank of that proposal across all classifiers, and chooses the translation with the lowest resulting rank (rank 1 is the best proposed translation).
    Since including all the hypothesized translations regardless of ranking performed poorly, we only include the ones with a ranking lower than some threshold N. The distance-based scoring method selects the hypothe
