valent performance as sentence length increases, which is what would be expected from the edge count measures.
    The other two models provide a real time savings over the &amp;quot;stack&amp;quot; model, as can be seen from Figure 5 and from the total CPU times given earlier.
    Through most of the length range, the CPU time needed by the normalized 0 and the trigram estimate is quite close, but at the upper end of the range we can see better performance by the trigram estimate.
    (This improvement comes later than in the edge count statistics because of the small additional amount of overhead work needed to use the trigram estimate.)
  
  
    Earlier, we showed that our ideal figure of merit can be written as: However, the a term, representing outside probability, cannot be calculated directly during a parse, since we need the full parse of the sentence to compute it.
    In some of our figures of merit, we use the quantity p(Mhk, 44), which is closely related to outside probability.
    We call this q
