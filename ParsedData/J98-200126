ure labeling scheme and a mixed labeling and linking scheme.
    We also tried two slightly different taxonomies of definite descriptions, and we varied the way membership in a class was defined to the subjects.
    Both taxonomies were based on the schemes proposed by Hawkins and Prince, but we introduced some changes in order, first, to find a scheme that would be easily understood by individuals without previous linguistic training and would lead to maximum agreement among the classifiers; and second, to make the classification more useful for our goal of feeding the results into an implementation.
    In the first experiment, we used a labeling scheme, and the classes were introduced to the subjects with reference to the surface characteristics of the definite descriptions.
    (See below and Appendix A.)
    The taxonomy we used in this experiment is a simplification of Hawkins's scheme, to which we made three main changes.
    First of all, we separated those anaphoric descriptions whose antecedents hav
