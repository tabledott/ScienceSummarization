moving a single feature.
    This allows us to evaluate
  
  
    the contribution of each feature to the performance of the classification process, by comparing the performance of the subset without it, to the performance using the full set of features.
    We see that the removal of PASS (second line) has no effect on the results, while removal of the remaining features yields a 2-8% decrease in performance.
    (In Table 9, the differences between all reported accuracies are statistically significant, at the p &lt; .05 level, except for between lines 1 and 2, lines 3 and 4, and lines 5 and 6, using an ANOVA [df = 299, F = 37.52], with a Tukey-Kramer post test.)
    We observe that the behavior of the features in combination cannot be predicted by the individual feature behavior.
    For example, CAUS, which is the best individually, does not greatly affect accuracy when combined with the other features (compare line 3 to line 1).
    Conversely, ANIM and TRANS, which do not classify verbs accurately when u
