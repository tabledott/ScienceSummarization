 the kitchen ... We have seen that the desired re-organization can be achieved by taking advantage of the fact that the autoconvolution of a Catalan series produces another Catalan series.
    This reduced processing time from 0(n3) to almost linear time.
    Similar analyses have been discussed for a number of lexically and structurally ambiguous constructions, culminating with the example in section 9, where we transformed a grammar into a form that could be parsed by a single left-to-right pass over the terminal elements.
    Currently, these grammar reformulations have to be performed by hand.
    It ought to be possible to automate this process so that the reformulations could be performed by a grammar compiler.
    We leave this project open for future research.
