 English and German paragraphs.
    However, one of the French documents was badly translated and could not be aligned because of the omission of one long paragraph and the duplication of a short one.
    This document was excluded for the purposes of the remainder of this experiment.
    We will show below that paragraph alignment is an important step, so it is fortunate that it is not particularly difficult.
    In aligning the Hansards, we found that paragraphs were often already aligned.
    For robustness, we decided to align paragraphs within certain fairly reliable regions (denoted by certain Hansard-specific formatting conventions) using the same method as that described below for aligning sentences within each paragraph.
  
  
    Now, let us consider how sentences can be aligned within a paragraph.
    The program makes use of the fact that longer sentences in one language tend to be translated into longer sentences in the other language, and that shorter sentences tend to be translated into shorter
