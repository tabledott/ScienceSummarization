s domains.
    More recently, we show that our SCFG-based parser can be inverted to produce a state-of-the-art NL generator, where a formal MRL is translated into an NL (Wong and Mooney, 2007).
    Currently, the use of learned synchronous grammars in semantic parsing and NL generation is limited to simple MRLs that are free of logical variables.
    This is because grammar formalisms such as SCFG do not have a principled mechanism for handling logical variables.
    This is unfortunate because most existing work on computational semantics is based on predicate logic, where logical variables play an important role (Blackburn and Bos, 2005).
    For some domains, this problem can be avoided by transforming a logical language into a variable-free, functional language (e.g. the GEOQUERY functional query language in Wong and Mooney (2006)).
    However, development of such a functional language is non-trivial, and as we will see, logical languages can be more appropriate for certain domains.
