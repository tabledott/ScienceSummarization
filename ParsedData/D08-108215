kely to generate NL words with similar distribution, regardless of semantic categories.
    For example, The inside (&#946;) probabilities are defined as The outside (&#945;) probabilities are defined as The count ci(t, mv, &#923;k), where t is a NL word or a semantic category, for an instance pair ni &#8801; &#8226; Update the pattern parameter The count ci(r, mv), where r is a hybrid pattern, for an instance pair ni &#8801; hmi, wii: RIVER: largest (RIVER) and CITY: largest (CITY) are both likely to generate the word &#8220;biggest&#8221;.
    In view of this, a smoothing technique is deployed.
    We assume half of the time words can be generated from the production&#8217;s function symbol alone if it is not empty.
    Mathematically, assuming ma with function symbol pa, for a NL word or semantic category t, we have: where &#952;e models the generation of t from an MR production or its function symbol, together with the context A.
  
  
    Though the inside-outside approach already employs packed represen
