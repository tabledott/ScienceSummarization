duces category-specific extraction patterns in addition to a semantic lexicon, while Basilisk focuses exclusively on semantic lexicon induction.
    To evaluate Basilisk&#8217;s performance, we ran experiments with the MUC-4 corpus (MUC-4 Proceedings, 1992), which contains 1700 texts associated with terrorism.
    We used Basilisk to learn semantic lexicons for six semantic categories: BUILDING, EVENT, HUMAN, LOCATION, TIME, and WEAPON.
    Before we ran these experiments, one of the authors manually labeled every head noun in the corpus that was found by an extraction pattern.
    These manual annotations were the gold standard.
    Table 1 shows the breakdown of semantic categories for the head nouns.
    These numbers represent a baseline: an algorithm that randomly selects words would be expected to get accuracies consistent with these numbers.
    Three semantic lexicon learners have previously been evaluated on the MUC-4 corpus (Riloff and Shepherd, 1997; Roark and Charniak, 1998; Riloff and Jones, 1999
