  The techniques were based on Bayesian decision theory, neural networks, and content vectors as used in in- formation retrieval.
  To understand these methods better, we posed s very specific problem: given a set of contexts, each containing the noun line in a known sense, construct a classi- fier that selects the correct sense of line for new contexts.
  To see how the degree of polysemy affects performance, results from three- and slx-sense tasks are compared.
  The results demonstrate hat each of the techniques i able to distinguish six senses of line with an accuracy
