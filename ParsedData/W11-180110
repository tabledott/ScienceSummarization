    Disappointingly, only two teams (UTurku, and ConcordU) performed both supporting and main tasks, and neither used supporting task analyses for the main tasks.
  
  
    Detailed evaluation results and analyses are presented in individual task papers, but interesting observations can be obtained also by comparisons over the tasks.
    Table 4 summarizes best results for various criteria (Note that the results shown for e.g.
    GEa, GEf and GEp may be from different teams).
    The community has made a significant improvement in the repeated GE task, with an over 10% reduction in error from &#8217;09 to GEa.
    Three teams achieved better results than M10, the best previously reported individual result on the &#8217;09 data.
    This indicates a beneficial role from focused efforts like BioNLP-ST.
    The GEf and ID results show that generalization to full papers is feasible, with very modest loss in performance compared to abstracts (GEa).
    The results for PHOSPHORYLATION events in GE and EPI are c
