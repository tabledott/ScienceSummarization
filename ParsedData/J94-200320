hat nonsubcategorized-for discourse entities lack.
  Constraint (3) stipulates that the ranking of the forward centers, Cf, determines from among the elements that are realized in the next utterance, which of them will be the Cb for that utterance.
  If the PREFERRED CENTER, Cp(Ui), is realized in Ui+l, it is predicted to be the Cb(Ui+l) .
  We will use the following forward center ranking for Japanese: 6 (GRAMMATICAL OR ZERO) TOPIC &gt; EMPATHY &gt; SUBJECT &gt; OBJECT2 &gt; OBJECT &gt; OTHERS Backward-looking centers, Cbs, are often deleted or pronominal ized and some transitions between discourse segments are more coherent han others.
  According to the theory of centering, coherence is measured by the hearer s  inference load when interpreting a discourse sequence (Joshi and Weinstein 1981; Grosz, Joshi, and Wein- stein unpublished).
  For instance, discourse segments that continue centering the same entity are more coherent han those that repeatedly shift from one center to another.
  These observations
