ard (1987) extend the ordering constraints in Cf in the following way: &amp;quot;We rank the items in Cf by obliqueness of grammatical relations of the subcategorized functions of the main verb: that is, first the subject, object, and object2, followed by other subcategorized functions, and finally, adjuncts.&amp;quot; (p. 156).
    In order to apply the centering model to pronoun resolution, they use Rule 2 in making predictions for pronominal reference and redefine the rules as follows (quoting Walker, Iida, and Cote [1994]): If some element of Cf(Ui_i) is realized as a pronoun in U&#8222; then so is Cb(U,). figurative names were introduced by Walker, Iida, and Cote (1994).
    BFP-algorithm.
    Transition states are ordered.
    CONTINUE is preferred to RETAIN is preferred to SMOOTHSHIFT is preferred to ROUGH-SHIFT.
    Their algorithm (Table 6) consists of three basic steps (as described by Walker, Iida, and Cote [1994]).9 In order to illustrate this algorithm, we use example (2) from above and supply th
