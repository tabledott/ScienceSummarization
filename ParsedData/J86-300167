 DSP when the utterance from which its primary intention is derived comes so late in the segment?
    We conjecture with regard to such segments as D2 of the movies essay that the primary intention (e.g., 12) may be determined partially (and hence a generalized version become recognizable) before the point at which it is actually expressed in the discourse.
    While the DP/DSP may not be expressed early, there is still partial information about it.
    This partial information often suffices to establish dominance (or satisfaction-precedence) relationships for additional segments.
    As these latter are placed in the hierarchy, their DSPs can provide further partial information for the underspecified DSP.
    For example, even though the intention 10 is expressed directly only in the last utterance of the movies essay, utterance (4) expresses an intention to know whether p or &#8212;p is true (i.e., whether or not parents should let children see movies often and without close monitoring).
