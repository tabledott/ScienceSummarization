cation has stressed that assigned disambiguations for the same document should be related, introducing the global approach (Cucerzan, 2007; Milne and Witten, 2008b; Han and Zhao, 2009; Ferragina and Scaiella, 2010).
    The two critical components of a global approach are the semantic relatedness function &#968; between two titles, and the disambiguation context V. In (Milne and Witten, 2008b), the semantic context is defined to be a set of &#8220;unambiguous surface forms&#8221; in the text, and the title relatedness &#968; is computed as Normalized Google Distance (NGD) (Cilibrasi and Vitanyi, 2007).2 On the other hand, in (Cucerzan, 2007) the disambiguation context is taken to be all plausible disambiguations of the named entities in the text, and title relatedness is based on the overlap in categories and incoming links.
    Both approaches have limitations.
    The first approach relies on the pres2(Milne and Witten, 2008b) also weight each mention in r&#8242; by its estimated disambiguation utility, whi
