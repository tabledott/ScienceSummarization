  Phrasal Cohesion And Statistical Machine Translation
  
    There has been much interest in using phrasal movement to improve statistical machine translation.
    We explore how well phrases cohere across two languages, specifically English and French, and examine the particular conditions under which they do not.
    We demonstrate that while there are cases where coherence is poor, there are many regularities which can be exploited by a statistical machine translation system.
    We also compare three variant syntactic representations to determine which one has the best properties with respect to cohesion.
  
  
    Statistical machine translation (SMT) seeks to develop mathematical models of the translation process whose parameters can be automatically estimated from a parallel corpus.
    The first work in SMT, done at IBM (Brown et al., 1993), developed a noisy-channel model, factoring the translation process into two portions: the translation model and the language model.
    The translation model ca
