			7 The automatic method proposes a predominant sense in every case.
			The best results are obtained when training on a domain relevant corpus.
			In all cases, when training on appropriate training data the automatic methodfor finding predominant senses beats both the ran dom baseline and the baseline provided by SemCor.Table 3 compares WSD accuracy using the auto matically acquired first sense on the 4 categories of 7There is one such word in our sample, striker.
