ojection practical, we rely on the twelve universal part-of-speech tags of Petrov et al. (2011).
    Syntactic universals are a well studied concept in linguistics (Carnie, 2002; Newmeyer, 2005), and were recently used in similar form by Naseem et al. (2010) for multilingual grammar induction.
    Because there might be some controversy about the exact definitions of such universals, this set of coarse-grained POS categories is defined operationally, by collapsing language (or treebank) specific distinctions to a set of categories that exists across all languages.
    These universal POS categories not only facilitate the transfer of POS information from one language to another, but also relieve us from using controversial evaluation metrics,2 by establishing a direct correspondence between the induced hidden states in the foreign language and the observed English labels.
    We evaluate our approach on eight European languages (&#167;6), and show that both our contributions provide consistent and statistical
