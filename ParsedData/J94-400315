tion is not entirely accurate, but it has proven practically useful and reduces the number of distinct tuples.
    In our experience, the following syntactic relations proved useful for resolving ambiguities: As mentioned earlier, the full list of syntactic relations depends on the syntactic theory of the parser.
    Our model is general and does not depend on any particular list.
    However, we have found some desired properties in defining the relevant syntactic relations.
    One such property is the use of deep, or canonical, relations, as was already identified by Grishman, Hirschman, and Nhan (1986).
    This property was directly available from the ESG parser (McCord 1990, 1991), which identifies the underlying syntactic function in constructs such as passives and relative clauses.
    We have also implemented an additional routine, which modified or filtered some of the relations received from the parser.
    This postprocessing routine dealt mainly with function words and prepositional phrases to ge
