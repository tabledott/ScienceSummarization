ical issue is selecting the right level of generalization given the set of examples in the supervised training set.
    We have chosen a known statistical procedure (Katz 1987) that selects the minimum level of generalization such that there is sufficient data in the training set to support discrimination of cases of attaching phrases (arguments) to their head.
    This leads us to the next topic, estimation of probabilities from the supervised training set.
    4.3.3 Estimation of Probabilities.
    The case relation, or selection restriction, to be learned is of the form X P 0, where X is a headword or its semantic class; P is a case, e.g., logical subject, logical object, preposition, etc.
    ; and 0 is a head word or its semantic class.
    One factor in the probability that 0 attaches to X with case P is p' (X P, 0), an estimate of the likelihood of attaching PO to X given P and 0.
    We chose to model a second multiplicative factor p(d), the probability of an attachment where d words separate the head
