may be a good cue for determining the part of speech of a word.'
    If, initially, the word to is not reliably tagged everywhere in the corpus with its proper tag (or not tagged at all), then this cue will be unreliable.
    The transformation-based learner will delay positing a transformation triggered by the tag of the word to until other transformations have resulted in a more reliable tagging of this word in the corpus.
    For a decision tree to take advantage of this information, any word whose outcome is dependent upon the tagging of to would need the entire decision tree structure for the proper classification of each occurrence of to built into its decision tree path.
    If the classification of to were dependent upon the classification of yet another word, this would have to be built into the decision tree as well.
    Unlike decision trees, in transformation-based learning, intermediate classification results are available and can be used as classification progresses.
    Even if decision trees a
