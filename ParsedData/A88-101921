 program inserts brackets into a sequence of parts of speech, producing output such as: The proposed method is a stochastic analog of precedence parsing.
    Recall that precedence parsing makes use of a table that says whether to insert an open or close bracket between any two categories (terminal or nonterminal).
    The proposed method makes use of a table that givvs the probabilities of an open and close bracket between all pairs of parts of speech.
    A sample is shown below for the five parts of speech: AT (article), NN (singular noun), NNS (non-singular noun), VB (uninflected verb), IN (preposition).
    The table says, for example, that there is no chance of starting a noun phrases after an article (all five entries on the AT row are 0) and that there is a large probability of starting a noun phrase between a verb and an noun (the entry in These probabilities were estimated from about 40,000 words (11,000 noun phrases) of training material selected from the Brown Corpus.
    The training material was
