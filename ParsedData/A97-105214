    The performance of the filter for classes with less than 10 exemplars is around chance, and a simple heuristic of accepting all classes with more than 10 exemplars would have produced broadly similar results for these verbs.
    The filter may well be performing poorly because the probability of generating a subcategorization class for a given verb is often lower than the error probability for that class.
    3.3 Parsing Evaluation In addition to evaluating the acquired subcategorization information against existing lexical resources, we have also evaluated the information in the context of an actual parsing system.
    In particular we wanted to establish whether the subcategorization frequency information for individual verbs could be used to improve the accuracy of a parser that uses statistical techniques to rank analyses.
    The experiment used the same probabil
