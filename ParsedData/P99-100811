cant-difference&amp;quot; test, or sigdiff.
    Johnson observes that compared to sigdiff, log-likelihood tends to overestimate the importance of data frequency at the expense of the distance between p(w I p) and p(w).
    Table 3 shows the 20 highest ranked words for each statistical method, using the seed word &amp;quot;car.&amp;quot; The first group contains the words found for the method we perceive as the most accurate, sigdiff and strong conditioning.
    The other groups show the differences between them and the first group.
    The + category means that this method adds the word to its list, &#8212; means the opposite.
    For example, &amp;quot;back&amp;quot; is on the sigdiff-loose list but not the sigdiff-strong list.
    In general, sigdiff worked better than surprise and strong conditioning worked better than loose conditioning.
    In both cases the less favored methods tend to promote words that are less specific (&amp;quot;back&amp;quot; over &amp;quot;airbag&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;use&amp;quot;
