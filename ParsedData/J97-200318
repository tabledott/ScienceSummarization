    Left sequential functions or transducers are those we previously defined.
    Their application to a string proceeds from left to right.
    Right sequential functions apply to strings from right to left.
    According to the theorem, considering a new sufficiently large alphabet SZ allows one to define two sequential functions 1 and r that decompose a rational function f. This result considerably increases the importance of sequential functions in the theory of finite-state machines as well as in the practical use of transducers.
    Berstel (1979) gives a constructive proof of this theorem.
    Given a finite-state transducer T, one can easily construct a left sequential transducer L and a right sequential transducer R such that R o L = T. Intuitively, the extended alphabet Si keeps track of the local ambiguities encountered when applying the transducer from left to right.
    A distinct element of the alphabet is assigned to each of these ambiguities.
