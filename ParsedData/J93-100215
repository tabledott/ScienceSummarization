ther empirical results concerning parse table size and construction time.
    Section 5 motivates our interactive and incremental approach to semi-automatic production of a disambiguated training corpus and describes the variant of the LR parser used for this task.
    Section 6 describes our implementation of a breadth-first LR parser and compares its performance empirically to a highly optimized chart parser for the same grammar, suggesting that (optimized) LR parsing is more efficient in practice for the ANLT grammar despite exponential worst case complexity results.
    Section 7 explains the technique we employ for deriving a probabilistic version of the LR parse table from the training corpus, and demonstrates that this leads to a more refined and parse-context&#8212;dependent probabilistic model capable of distinguishing derivations that in a probabilistic context-free model would be equally probable.
    Section 8 describes and presents the results of our first experiment parsing LDOCE noun definition
