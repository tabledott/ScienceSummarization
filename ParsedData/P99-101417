rring in lexical-semantic representations.
    As a first implementation, consider replacing the relation symbols in the first tree in Fig.
    11 with relation symbols derived from the latent class labeling.
    In the second tree in Fig 11, R17 and R8 are relation symbols with indices derived from the labeling procedure of Sect.
    4.
    Such representations can be semantically interpreted in standard ways, for instance by interpreting relation symbols as denoting relations between events and individuals.
    Such representations are semantically inadequate for reasons given in philosophical critiques of decomposed linguistic representations; see Fodor (1998) for recent discussion.
    A lexicon estimated in the above way has as many primitive relations as there are latent classes.
    We guess there should be a few hundred classes in an approximately complete lexicon (which would have to be estimated from a corpus of hundreds of millions of words or more).
    Fodor's arguments, which are based on the ve
