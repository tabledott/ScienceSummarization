be expected to contain natural anchors, such as chapter and section headings, at which to make an a priori segmentation.
    Gale and Church (1991) note that their method performed considerably better when lengths of sentences were measured in number of characters instead of in number of words.
    Their method is based on a probabilistic model of the distance between two sentences, and a dynamic programming algorithm is used to minimize the total distance between aligned units.
    Their implementation assumes that each character in one language gives rise to, on average, one character in the other language.'
    In our texts, one character in English on average gives rise to somewhat more than 1.2 characters in German, and the correlation between the lengths (in characters) of aligned paragraphs in the two languages was with 0.952 lower than the 0.991 that are mentioned in Gale and Church (1991), which supports our impression that the Scientific American texts we used are hard texts to align, but it is not
