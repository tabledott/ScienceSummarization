m Figure 5, the distribution of rule frequencies is again roughly Zipfian, with the 10 most frequent rules accounting for 59.2% of all rule instantiations (159 rules account for 95%; 591 rules for 99%).
    The growth of rule instantiations is shown in Figure 4.
    If function tags are ignored, the grammar for the corresponding sections of the original Treebank contains 12,409 phrase-structure rules, out of which 6,765 occur only once (Collins 1999).
    These rules also follow a Zipfian distribution (Gaizauskas 1995).
    The fact that both category types and rule instances are also Zipfian for CCGbank, despite its binarized rules, shows that the phenomenon is not just due to the Treebank annotation with its very flat rules.
    Syntactic Rule Coverage on Unseen Data.
    Syntactic rule coverage for unseen data is almost perfect: 51,932 of the 51,984 individual rule instantiations in section 00 (corresponding to 844 different rule types) have been observed in section 02&#8211;21.
