n a projective tree can be defined relative to its governor and its sisters.
    In order to define the linear order in a non projective tree, we will use a projective lift of the tree.
    In this case, the position of a node can be defined only with regards to its governor and sisters in the lift, i.e., its linear governor and sisters.
    Definition: An ordered tree T is said pseudo-projective if there exists a lift T' of tree T which is projective.
    If there is no restriction on the lifting, the previous definition is not very interesting since we can in fact take any non-projective tree and lift all nodes to the root node and obtain a projective tree.
    We will therefore constrain the lifting by a set of rules, called lifting rules.
    Consider a set of (syntactic) categories.
    The following definitions make sense only for trees whose nodes are labeled with categories.'
    The lifting rules are of the following form (LD, SG and LG are categories and w is a regular expression on the set of categ
