ed learning from manually labeled data.
    A bottleneck problem with this supervised learning approach is the lack of annotated data.
    As a special case, we often face the situation where we have a sufficient amount of labeled data in one domain, but have little or no labeled data in another related domain which we are interested in.
    We thus face the domain adaptation problem.
    Following (Blitzer et al., 2006), we call the first the source domain, and the second the target domain.
    The domain adaptation problem is commonly encountered in NLP.
    For example, in POS tagging, the source domain may be tagged WSJ articles, and the target domain may be scientific literature that contains scientific terminology.
    In NE recognition, the source domain may be annotated news articles, and the target domain may be personal blogs.
    Another example is personalized spam filtering, where we may have many labeled spam and ham emails from publicly available sources, but we need to adapt the learned spam f
