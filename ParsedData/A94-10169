    We use a language pair-dependent set of postprocessing rules to alleviate this (for example, by switching the order of adjacent single-word adjective and noun components).
  
  
    Results of multi-engine MT were fed in our experiment into a translator's workstation (TWS) (Cohen et al., 1993), through which a translator either approved the system's output or modified it.
