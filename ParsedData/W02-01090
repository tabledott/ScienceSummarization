  NLTK: The Natural Language Toolkit
  
    NLTK, the Natural Language Toolkit, is a suite of open source program modules, tutorials and problem sets, providing ready-to-use computational linguistics courseware.
    NLTK covers symbolic and statistical natural language processing, and is interfaced to annotated corpora.
    Students augment and replace existing components, learn structured programming by example, and manipulate sophisticated models from the outset.
  
  
    Teachers of introductory courses on computational linguistics are often faced with the challenge of setting up a practical programming component for student assignments and projects.
    This is a difficult task because different computational linguistics domains require a variety of different data structures and functions, and because a diverse range of topics may need to be included in the syllabus.
    A widespread practice is to employ multiple programming languages, where each language provides native data structures and functions t
