467;.m, and the y-intercept &#8467;.y; a fourth component, &#8467;.t, is used to store the candidate translation.
    Algorithm 1 shows the pseudo code for a sweep line algorithm which reduces an input array a[0..K-1] consisting of the K line objects of the candidate repository Cs to its upper envelope.
    By construction, the upper envelope consists of at most K line segments.
    The endpoints of each line segment define the interval boundaries at which the decision made by the decoder will change.
    Hence, as &#947; increases from~8to8, we will see that the most probable translation hypothesis will change whenever &#947; passes an intersection point.
    Let &#947;is &lt; &#947;2s &lt; ... &lt; &#947;fsN denote the sequence of interval boundaries and let AEfs1, AE2s, ..., AEfsN denote the corresponding sequence of changes in the error count where AEns is the amount by which the error count will change if &#947; is moved from a point in [Ns1, &#947;ns) to a point inr [&#947;ns, &#947;ns1q).
