Szarvas et al. (2008) report that 13.45% of the sentences in the abstracts section of the BioScope corpus and 12.70% of the sentences in the full papers section contain negations.
    A system that does not deal with negation would treat the facts in these cases incorrectly as positives.
    Additionally, information about the scope of negation is useful for entailment recognition purposes.
    The approach to the treatment of negation in NLP presented in this paper was introduced in Morante et al. (2008).
    This system achieved a 50.05 percentage of correct scopes but had a number of important shortcomings.
    The system presented here uses a different architecture and different classification task definitions, it can deal with multiword negation signals, and it is tested on three subcorpora of the BioScope corpus.
    It achieves an error reduction of 32.07% compared to the previous system.
    The paper is organised as follows.
    In Section 2, we summarise related work.
