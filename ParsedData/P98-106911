candidate for word ic, then wite wite /ki.
    The similarity scores then become S4 and S5 and S6 = S4 x S5: We also experiment with other combinations of the similarity scores such as S7 = SO x S5.
    All similarity measures S3 &#8212; S7 are used in the experiment for finding a translation for ME &#8226;
  
  
    In order to apply the above algorithm to find the translation for blgt, I liougan from the HKStandard/Mingpao corpus, we first use a script to select the 118 English content words which are not in the lexicon as possible candidates.
    Using similarity measures S3&#8212; S7, the highest ranking candidates of MS are shown in Table 6.
    S6 and S7 appear to be the best similarity measures.
    We then test the algorithm with S7 on more Chinese words which are not found in the lexicon but which occur frequently enough in the Mingpao texts.
    A statistical new word extraction tool can be used to find these words.
    The unknown Chinese words and their English counterparts, as well as the occurre
