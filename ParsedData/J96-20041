 researchers in content analysis have already experienced the same difficulties and come up with a solution in the kappa statistic.
    We discuss what is wrong with reliability measures as they are currently used for discourse and dialogue work in computational linguistics and cognitive science, and argue that we would be better off as afield adopting techniques from content analysis.
  
  
    Computational linguistic and cognitive science work on discourse and dialogue relies on subjective judgments.
    For instance, much current research on discourse phenomena distinguishes between behaviors which tend to occur at or around discourse segment boundaries and those which do not (Passonneau and Litman 1993; Kowtko, Isard, and Doherty 1992; Litman and Hirschberg 1990; Cahn 1992).
    Although in some cases discourse segments are defined automatically (e.g., Rodrigues and Lopes' [1992] definition based on temporal relationships), more usually discourse segments are defined subjectively, based on the intentiona
