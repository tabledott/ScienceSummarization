(93% averaged over tokens, 92% averaged over types).
    In particular, note that this baseline is well above the 75% figure that we associated with Bar-Hillel above.
    Of course, the large number of unambiguous words contributes greatly to the baseline.
    If we exclude the unambiguous words, then the average baseline performance falls to 81% averaged over tokens and 75% averaged over types.
    We will attempt to estimate an upper bound on performance by estimating the ability for human judges to agree with one another (or themselves).
    We will find, not surprisingly, that the estimate varies widely depending on a number of factors, especially the definition of the task.
    Jorgensen (1990) has collected some interesting data that may be relevant for estimating the agreement among judges.
    As part of her dissertation under George Miller at Princeton, she was interested in assessing &amp;quot;the extent of psychologically real polysemy in the mental lexicon for nouns.&amp;quot; Her experiment was d
