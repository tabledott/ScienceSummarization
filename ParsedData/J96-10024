tion 4 we discuss feature selection, and present an automatic method for discovering facts about a process from a sample of output from the process.
    We then present a series of refinements to the method to make it practical to implement.
    Finally, in Section 5 we describe the application of maximum entropy ideas to several tasks in stochastic language processing: bilingual sense disambiguation, word reordering, and sentence segmentation.
  
  
    We introduce the concept of maximum entropy through a simple example.
    Suppose we wish to model an expert translator's decisions concerning the proper French rendering of the English word in.
    Our model p of the expert's decisions assigns to each French word or phrase f an estimate, p(f ), of the probability that the expert would choose f as a translation of in.
    To guide us in developing p, we collect a large sample of instances of the expert's decisions.
    Our goal is to extract a set of facts about the decision-making process from the sample (th
