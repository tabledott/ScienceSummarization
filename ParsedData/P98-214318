;quot;referential distance&amp;quot;.
    Similarly to the first evaluation, we found that the robust approach was not very successful on sentences with too complicated syntax - a price we have to pay for the &amp;quot;convenience&amp;quot; of developing a knowledge-poor system.
    The results from experiment 1 and experiment 2 can be summarised in the following (statistically) slightly more representative figures.
    The lower figure in &amp;quot;Baseline subject&amp;quot; corresponds to &amp;quot;recall&amp;quot; and the higher figure - to &amp;quot;precision&amp;quot;.
    If we regard as &amp;quot;discriminative power&amp;quot; of each antecedent indicator the ratio &amp;quot;number of successful antecedent identifications when this indicator was applied&amp;quot;/&amp;quot;number of applications of this indicator&amp;quot; (for the non-prepositional noun phrase and definiteness being penalising indicators, this figure is calculated as the ratio &amp;quot;number of unsuccessful antecedent identification
