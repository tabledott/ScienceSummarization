iterbi alignment.
    The leftmost column shows how many times they appeared.
    Most of them are correct.
    It even detected frequent sentenceto-sentence translations, since we only imposed a relative length limit for phrasal translations (Section 3).
    However, some of them, such as the one with (in cantonese), are wrong.
    We expected that these junk phrases could be eliminated by phrase pruning (Section 5), however the junk phrases present many times in the corpus were not effectively filtered out.
  
  
    The BLEU score measures the quality of the decoder output sentences.
    We were also interested in the syntactic structure of the decoded trees.
    The leftmost tree in Figure 4 is a decoded tree from the syn-nozf system.
    Surprisingly, even though the decoded sentence is passable English, the tree structure is totally unnatural.
    We assumed that a good parse tree gives high trigram probabilities.
    But it seems a bad parse tree may give good trigram probabilities too.
    We also not
