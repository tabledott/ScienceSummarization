r, we developed an annotationscheme3 for marking the contextual polarity of sub jective expressions.
			Annotators were instructed to tag the polarity of subjective expressions as positive, negative, both, or neutral.
			The positive tag is for positive emotions (I?m happy), evaluations (Greatidea!), and stances (She supports the bill).
			The negative tag is for negative emotions (I?m sad), eval uations (Bad idea!), and stances (She?s against thebill).
			The both tag is applied to sentiment expres sions that have both positive and negative polarity.The neutral tag is used for all other subjective expressions: those that express a different type of sub jectivity such as speculation, and those that do not have positive or negative polarity.Below are examples of contextual polarity anno tations.
