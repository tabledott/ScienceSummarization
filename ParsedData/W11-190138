 we had to provide a skeletal form (.skel of the .conll file which was essentially the .conll file, but with the word column replaced with a dummy string.
    We provided an assembly script that participants could use to create a .conll file taking as input the .skel file and the top-level directory of the OntoNotes distribution that they had separately downloaded from the LDC16 Once the .conll file is created, it can be used to create the individual layers such as .parse, .name, .coref etc. using another set of scripts.
    Since the propositions and word sense layers are inherently standoff annotation, they were provided as is, and did not require that extra merging step.

    Figure 3 shows a sample from a .conll file.
