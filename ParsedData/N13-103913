    This allows sharing of statistical strength between similar clusters.
    Using prefix features of hierarchical clusters in this way was similarly found to be effective for named-entity recognition (Turian et al., 2010) and Twitter POS tagging (Ritter et al., 2011).
    When checking to see if a word is associated with a cluster, the tagger first normalizes the word using the same techniques as described in &#167;3.1, then creates a priority list of fuzzy match transformations of the word by removing repeated punctuation and repeated characters.
    If the normalized word is not in a cluster, the tagger considers the fuzzy matches.
    Although only about 3% of the tokens in the development set (&#167;6) did not appear in a clustering, this method resulted in a relative error decrease of 18% among such word tokens.
    Besides unsupervised word clusters, there are two other sets of features that contain generalized lexical class information.
    We use the tag dictionary feature from Gimpel et al., which
