hare vehicle as an ancestor in the WordNet noun hierarchy.
    WordNet is particularly well suited for similarity measures, since it organizes nouns and verbs into hierarchies of is&#8211;a relations.
    In version 2.0, there are nine separate noun hierarchies that include 80,000 concepts, and 554 verb hierarchies that are made up of 13,500 concepts.
    Is&#8211;a relations in WordNet do not cross part of speech boundaries, so similarity measures are limited to making judgments between noun pairs (e.g., cat and dog) and verb pairs (e.g., run and walk).
    While WordNet also includes adjectives and adverbs, these are not organized into is&#8211;a hierarchies so similarity measures can not be applied.
    However, concepts can be related in many ways beyond being similar to each other.
    For example, a wheel is a part of a car, night is the opposite of day, snow is made up of water, a knife is used to cut bread, and so forth.
