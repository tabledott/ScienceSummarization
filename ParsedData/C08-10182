			However, the simplification also renders the tasksomewhat artificial.
			There are many rewrite operations that could compress a sentence, besides deletion, including reordering, substitution, and inser tion.
			In fact, professional abstractors tend to use these operations to transform selected sentences from an article into the corresponding summary sentences (Jing, 2000).
			Therefore, in this paper we consider sentence compression from a more general perspective and generate abstracts rather than extracts.
			In this framework, the goal is to find a summary of theoriginal sentence which is grammatical and conveys the most important information without necessarily using the same words in the same or der.
			Our task is related to, but different from, paraphrase extraction (Barzilay, 2003).
			We must not only have access to paraphrases (i.e., rewrit
