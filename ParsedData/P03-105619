re 5; in training data, only like-type VPs are coordinated.
    With nominal coordination scope errors, the situation is different: we found no false low attachments.
    False high scopings can be reduced by marking NP conjuncts.
    (Charniak, 2000) claims that a similar strategy proved effective for WSJ parsing.
    A related error arises from the introduction of IPs by communication verbs and commas, as in Figure 6.
    Only a few verbs in our training set take IPs this way, so we address this ambiguity with subcategorization annotation (Collins, 1999), marking VVs possessing IP sisters.
    Most adjunction errors, such as into IP rather than VP, are in principle semantically impotent, since in both cases they are associated with the same verbal head.
    In practice, however, many adjuncts are NPs, and ambiguous adjunctions into IP are superficially indistinguishable from subjects due to pro-drop.
    NP adjuncts into VP are not ambiguous in this way, and from inspection the annotation practice of the Ch
