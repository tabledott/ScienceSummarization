ization to predict the prob abilities of N classes.
			These two-class trees can be pruned with a fixed pruning threshold.
			Hence there is no need to put aside training data for parameter tuning.
			An open question is whether the SVMTool (orother discriminatively trained taggers) could outperform the presented tagger if the same decompo sition of POS tags and the same context size was used.
			We think that this might be the case if the SVM features are restricted to the set of relevant attribute combinations discovered by the decision tree, but we doubt that it is possible to train theSVMTool (or other discriminatively trained taggers) without such a restriction given the difficul ties to train it with the standard context size.Czech POS tagging has been extensively stud ied in the past (Haji?c and Vidov?a-Hladk?a, 1998; Haji?c et al, 2001; Votrubec, 2006).
			Spoustov etal.
			(2007) compared several POS taggers includ ing an n-gram tagger and a discriminatively trained tagger (Mor?ce), and evaluated the
