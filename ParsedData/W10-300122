010) and Ji et al.
    (2010) managed to achieve a noticeable improvement by exploiting cross-domain data.
    Zhao et al. (2010) extended the biological cue word dictionary of their system &#8211; using it as a feature for classification &#8211; by the frequent cues of the Wikipedia dataset, while Ji et al.
    (2010) used the union of the two datasets for training (they have reported an improvement from 47.0 to 58.7 on the Wikipedia evaluation set after a postchallenge bugfix). higher precision than recall.
    There may be two reasons for this.
    The systems may have applied only reliable patterns, or patterns occurring in the evaluation set may be imperfectly covered by the training datasets.
    The most intense participation was on Task1B.
    Here, participants applied various precision/recall trade-off strategies.
    For instance, Tang et al. (2010) achieved a balanced precision/recall configuration, while Li et al.
    (2010) achieved third place thanks to their superior precision.
