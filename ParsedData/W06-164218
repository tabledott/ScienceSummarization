icon. f(a), p(a), and n(a) denote the frequency of the atom and in positive and negative contexts, respectively.
    From each proposition which does not have a polarity, candidate polar atoms in the form of simple atoms (just a verb or adjective) or complex atoms (a verb or adjective and its rightmost argument consisting of a pair of a noun and a postpositional) are extracted.
    For each candidate polar atom a, the total appearances f(a), and the occurrences in positive contexts p(a) and negative contexts n(a) are counted, based on the context of the adjacent clauses (using the method described in Section 4.1).
    If the proposition has the neg feature, the polarity is inverted.
    Table 6 shows examples of candidate polar atoms with their frequencies.
    Among the located candidate polar atoms, how can we distinguish true polar atoms, which should be added to the lexicon, from fake polar atoms, which should be discarded?
    As shown in Section 4, both the coherent precision (72-77%) and the coherent d
