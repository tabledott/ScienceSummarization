, S2 the second quantile, and so on, for n quantiles of equal sizes.10 We also use the notation Si,&#65533; = vk=i Sk.
    Using these notations, we define: quantile (top half) S1 and the overall quality (represented by V (S)).
    For n = 3, DeltaAvg[3] = (V (S1)+V (S1,2)/2&#8722;V (S) = ((V (S1)&#8722;V (S))+ (V (S1,2 &#8722; V (S)))/2, hence it measures an average difference across two cases: between the quality of the top quantile (top third) and the overall quality, and between the quality of the top two quantiles (S1 &#8746;S2, top two-thirds) and the overall quality.
    In general, DeltaAvg[n] measures an average difference in quality across n &#8722; 1 cases, with each case measuring the impact in quality of adding an additional quantile, from top to bottom.
    Finally, we define: where N = |S|/2.
    As before, we write DeltaAvg for DeltaAvgV when the valuation function V is clear from the context.
    The DeltaAvg metric is an average across all DeltaAvg[n] values, for those n values for which the
