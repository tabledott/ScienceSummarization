date expression is surrounded by a suggestive context.
    Sure-fire rules rely on known corporate designators (Ltd., Inc., etc.
    ), person titles (Mr., Dr., Sen.), and definite contexts such as those in Figure 2.
    The sure-fire rules apply after POS tagging and simple semantic tagging, so at this stage words like &amp;quot;former&amp;quot; have already been identified as JJ (adjective), words like &amp;quot;analyst&amp;quot; have been identified as PROF (professions), and words like &amp;quot;brother&amp;quot; as REL (relatives).

    &amp;quot;China International Trust and Investment Corp&amp;quot;) is left untagged at this stage if the company is not listed in a list of known companies.
    Similarly, the system postpones the markup of unknown organizations whose name
