IL counterpart.
    In Figure 3, precision is plotted against recall by varying a threshold on the value of the SVM decision function.
    To avoid clutter, we show only the graphs for the first three systems.
    In Table 4 we show the area under the precision recall curves of all four systems.
    Overall, the learned relation extractors are able to identify the relationship in novel sentences quite accurately and significantly out-perform a bag-of-words baseline.
    The new version of the subsequence kernel SSK&#8211;T1 is significantly more accurate in the MIL setting than the original subsequence kernel SSK&#8211;MIL, and is also competitive with SSK&#8211;SIL, which was trained using a reasonable amount of manually labeled sentence examples.
  
  
    An interesting potential application of our approach is a web relation-extraction system similar to Google Sets, in which the user provides only a handful of pairs of entities known to exhibit or not to exhibit a particular relation, and the system is use
