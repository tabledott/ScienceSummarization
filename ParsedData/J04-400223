 into a sequence of phrases (k = 1,...,K): Note that there are a large number of possible segmentations of a sentence pair into K phrase pairs.
    In the following, we will describe the model for a specific segmentation.
    Eventually, however, a model can be described in which the specific segmentation is not known when new text is translated.
    Hence, as part of the overall search process (Section 5), we also search for the optimal segmentation.
    To allow possible reordering of phrases, we introduce an alignment on the phrase level &#960;K1 between the source phrases f&#732;1K and the target phrases &#732;eK1.
    Hence, &#960;K1 is a permutation of the phrase positions 1, ... , K and indicates that the phrases &#732;ek and &#732;f&#960;k are translations of one another.
    We assume that for the translation between these phrases a specific alignment template zk is used: &#732;ek zk &#732;f&#960;k &#8592;&#8594; Hence, our model has the following hidden variables: Figure 5 gives an example of the wo
