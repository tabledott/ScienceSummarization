is an online algorithm that learns by parsing each sentence and comparing the result with a gold standard.
    Training is complete after multiple passes through the whole corpus.
    Thus we decode using the Chu-Liu-Edmonds (CLE) algorithm due to its speed advantage over ILP (see Section 5.2 for a detailed comparison of runtimes).
    The fact that we decode differently during training (using CLE) and testing (using ILP) may degrade performance.
    In the presence of additional constraints weights may be able to capture other aspects of the data.
  
  
    Our experiments were designed to answer the following questions: Before we try to answer these questions we briefly describe our data, features used, settings for U and P in our parametric constraints, our working environment and our implementation.
    We use the Alpino treebank (van der Beek et al., 2002), taken from the CoNLL shared task of multilingual dependency parsing3.
    The CoNLL data differs slightly from the original Alpino treebank as the co
