and Accuracy being the same.
    However, all of the systems do not classify a post if the post does not contain the information it needs.
    Thus, #guessed &lt; #Total posts, and Precision is not the same as Accuracy.
    Table 4 reports the performance of four systems on the test data: the two baselines, our method using the preferences learned from the web corpus (OpPr) and the method additionally using discourse information to reverse conceded opinions.
    The OpTopic has low recall.
    This is expected, because it relies only on opinions explicitly toward the topics.
    The OpPMI has better recall than OpTopic; however, the precision drops for some debates.
    We believe this is due to the addition of noise.
    This result suggests that not all terms that are relevant to a topic are useful for determining the debate side.
    Finally, both of the OpPr systems are better than both baselines in Accuracy as well as F-measure for all four debates.
    The accuracy of the full OpPr system improves, on a
