  This interface allows the user to provide examples of role- wmt events, which are automatically converted into the appropriate patterns and generalized to cover syntactic variants (passive, relative clause, etc.).
  Through this internee, the user can also generalize l;he pattern semanti(ally (to (:over a broader class of words) and modify the concet)t base and lexicon as needed.
