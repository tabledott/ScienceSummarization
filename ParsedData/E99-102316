ata.
    It performed slightly worse on baseNP recognition than the (Ramshaw and Marcus, 1995) experiments (F0=1=91.6).
    (Cardie and Pierce, 1998) uses a related method but they only store POS tag sequences forming complete baseNPs.
    These sequences were applied to unseen tagged data after which post-processing repair rules were used for fixing some frequent errors.
    This approach performs worse than other reported approaches (F0=1=90.9). training data set.
    The data was processed with the optimal input feature combinations found in the fourth experiment series.
    The accuracy rate contains the fraction of chunk tags that was correct.
    The other three rates regard baseNP recognition.
    The bottom part of the table shows some other reported results with this data set.
    With all but two formats isl-IG achieves better Fo=1 rates than the best published result in (Ramshaw and Marcus, 1995).
    (Veenstra, 1998) uses cascaded decision tree learning (IGTree) for baseNP recognition.
