erefore important for applications to be able to retrieve it easily.
    Also, in the case of structures involving copular verbs, a direct link between the subject and the complement enables equivalent representations across languages (in Chinese, for example, copulas are not explicitly expressed).
    Such parallel representations should presumably help machine translation, and this was a further motivation for choosing content words as heads.
    Another instance where direct links between content words is useful is the case of prepositional complements.
    The SD scheme offers the option of &#8220;collapsing&#8221; dependencies involving a preposition (DP5).
    In the example above, instead of having two relations adjunct(workout, of) and obj(of, Suns) as in PARC or ncmod(workout, of) and dobj(of, Suns) as in GR, SD provides a direct relation between the content words: prep of(workout, Suns).
    Prepositions often work as role markers, and this type of link facilitates the extraction of how the two cont
