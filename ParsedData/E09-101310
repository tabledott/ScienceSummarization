    More formally, we will write P(s) for the distribution over senses s of an ambiguous target in a specific context window and P(w1s) for the probability distribution over context words w given sense s. Each word wi in the context window is generated by first sampling a sense from the sense distribution, then choosing a word from the sense-context distribution.
    P(si = j) denotes the probability that the jth sense was sampled for the ith word token and P(wi|si = j) the probability of context word wi under sense j.
    The model thus specifies a distribution over words within a context window: where S is the number of senses.
    We assume that each target word has C contexts and each context c cate conditional dependencies between variables, whereas plates (the rectangles in the figure) refer to repetitions of sampling steps.
    The variables in the lower right corner refer to the number of samples. consists of Nc word tokens.
    We shall write &#65533;(j) as a shorthand for P(wi|si = j), the multinom
