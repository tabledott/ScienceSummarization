: firstly, the analyses assigned must determinately represent the syntactic relations that hold between all constituents in the input; secondly, they must be drawn from an a priori defined, well-formed set of possible syntactic analyses (such as the set defined by a generative grammar).
    Otherwise, semantic interpretation of the resultant analyses cannot be guaranteed to be (structurally) unambiguous, and the semantic operations defined (over syntactic configurations) cannot be guaranteed to match and yield an interpretation.
    These requirements immediately suggest that approaches that recover only lexical tags (e.g. de Rose 1988) or a syntactic analysis that is the 'closest fit' to some previously defined set of possible analyses (e.g.
    Sampson, Haigh, and Atwell 1989), are inadequate (taken alone).
    Pioneering approaches to corpus analysis proceeded on the assumption that computationally tractable generative grammars of sufficiently general coverage could not be developed (see, for example, pape
