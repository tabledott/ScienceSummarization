    If the distance between two examples is small, then the two examples are similar.
    We use the following definition of distance between two symbolic values Vi and v2 of a feature f: feature f. 7/ is the total number of senses for a word w. This metric for measuring distance is adopted from (Cost and Salzberg, 1993), which in turn is adapted from the value difference metric of the earlier work of (Stanfill and Waltz, 1986).
    The distance between two examples is the sum of the distances between the values of all the features of the two examples.
    During the training phase, the appropriate set of features is extracted based on the method described in Section 3.1.
    From the training examples formed, the distance between any two values for a feature f is computed based on the above formula.
    During the test phase, a test example is compared against all the training examples.
    LEXAS then determines the closest matching training example as the one with the minimum distance to the test examp
