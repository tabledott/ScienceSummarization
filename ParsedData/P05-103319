del that are syntactic phrases might provide a fairer way of testing the hypothesis that syntactic phrases are better phrases.
    This feature adds a factor to (17), { 1 if fij is a constituent 0 otherwise as determined by a statistical tree-substitutiongrammar parser (Bikel and Chiang, 2000), trained on the Penn Chinese Treebank, version 3 (250k words).
    Note that the parser was run only on the test data and not the (much larger) training data.
    Rerunning the minimum-error-rate trainer with the new feature yielded the feature weights shown in Table 2.
    Although the feature improved accuracy on the development set (from 0.314 to 0.322), it gave no statistically significant improvement on the test set.
  
  
    Hierarchical phrase pairs, which can be learned without any syntactically-annotated training data, improve translation accuracy significantly compared with a state-of-the-art phrase-based system.
    They also facilitate the incorporation of syntactic information, which, however, did not prov
