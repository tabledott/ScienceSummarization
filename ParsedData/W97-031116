quation 1: The Kronecker &#246; function is equal to one when its arguments are identical and zero otherwise.
    The form of the objective function again permits easy distribution of its value over the s E S: The formula for estimating the net change in the objective function due to each candidate NCC remains the same: It is easier to estimate the values of v' using only the base translation model, than to estimate the values of since only the most likely translations need to be considered, instead of entire translational distributions. v' (a;) and v' (y) are again estimated under Assumption 2: v'(xy) can be estimated without making the strong assumptions 3 and 4.
    Instead, I use the weaker Assumption 5 Let tx and ty be the most frequent translations of x and y in each other's presence, in the base translation model.
    The most likely translation of xy in the trial translation model will be the more frequent of tx and ti,.
    This quantity can be computed exactly at a reasonable computational expense.
