Sperberg-McQueen &amp; Burnard 1992).
    We use the term &amp;quot;sentence&amp;quot; in a generalized sense including lines in itemized lists, headings, and other nonsentential segments smaller than a paragraph.
    The corpus currently contains about 60Mb of raw data, of which we have been concentrating on approximately 3.2Mb.
    Of this, 2.1Mb is text comprised of approximately 0.35 million English words, with the corresponding Chinese translation occupying the remaining 1.1Mb.
    STATISTICALLY-BASED
  
  
    The statistical approach to alignment can be summarized as follows: choose the alignment that maximizes the probability over all possible alignments, given a pair of parallel texts.
    Formally, where A is an alignment, and Ti and 7-2 are the English and Chinese texts, respectively.
    An alignment A is a set consisting of L1 ,== L2 pairs where each L1 or L2 is an English or Chinese passage.
    This formulation is so extremely general that it is difficult to argue against its pure form.
