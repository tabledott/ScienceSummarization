roles in each cluster.
    Our solution is to assemble a larger IRcorpus of documents for each cluster.
    For example, MUC-4 labels 83 documents with Kidnap, but our learned cluster (kidnap, abduct, release, ...) retrieved 3954 documents from a general corpus.
    We use the Associated Press and New York Times sections of the Gigaword Corpus (Graff, 2002) as our general corpus.
    These sections include approximately 3.5 million news articles spanning 12 years.
    Our retrieval algorithm retrieves documents that score highly with a cluster&#8217;s tokens.
    The document score is defined by two common metrics: word match, and word coverage.
    A document&#8217;s match score is defined as the average number of times the words in cluster c appear in document d: We define word coverage as the number of seen cluster words.
    Coverage penalizes documents that score highly by repeating a single cluster word a lot.
    We only score a document if its coverage, cvg(d, c), is at least 3 words (or less for tiny
