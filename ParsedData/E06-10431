 semantic idiosyncrasy.
    Idiomatic expressions, as a part of the vast family of figurative language, are widely used both in colloquial speech and in written language.
    Moreover, a phrase develops its idiomaticity over time (Cacciari, 1993); consequently, new idioms come into existence on a daily basis (Cowie et al., 1983; Seaton and Macaulay, 2002).
    Idioms thus pose a serious challenge, both for the creation of widecoverage computational lexicons, and for the development of large-scale, linguistically plausible natural language processing (NLP) systems (Sag et al., 2002).
    One problem is due to the range of syntactic idiosyncrasy of idiomatic expressions.
    Some idioms, such as by and large, contain syntactic violations; these are often completely fixed and hence can be listed in a lexicon as &#8220;words with spaces&#8221; (Sag et al., 2002).
    However, among those idioms that are syntactically well-formed, some exhibit limited morphosyntactic flexibility, while others may be more syntactic
