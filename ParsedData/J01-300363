    We think that this property relates to the notion of internal and external causation that is an important factor in distinguishing unergative and unaccusative verbs.
    We refer the interested reader to Stevenson and Merlo (1997b), which discusses the latter issue in more detail. opposite of discriminability), we look at two cells in the matrix: the one in which verbs of the first class were assigned the label of the second class, and the one in which verbs of the second class were assigned the label of the first class.
    (These pairs of cells are those opposite the diagonal of the confusion matrix.)
    By examining the decrease (or increase) in confusability of each pair of classes in going from a fourfeature experiment to the five-feature experiment, we gain insight into how well (or how poorly) the added feature helps to discriminate each pair of classes.
    An analysis of the confusion matrices reveals that the behavior of the features largely
