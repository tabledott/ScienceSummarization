    The domains we have been working on (like many others) contain many date and number expressions.
    While a shallow tool recognizes general structures, the grammar contains rules and types to process these.

    At one point in the development of this grammar, the average number of readings doubled in two months of work.
    We currently have two strategies for addressing this problem: First, we include a mec
