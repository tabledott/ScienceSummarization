d the upper bound (UB) is 71.83%, which is the accuracy obtained under the scenario where the test data is translated into the source language and then annotated using the high-coverage OpinionFinder tool.
    Perhaps not surprisingly, the SVM classifier outperforms Naive Bayes by 2% to 6%, implying that SVM may be better fitted to lessen the amount of noise embedded in the dataset and provide more accurate classifications.
    The first experiment, involving the automatic translation of the MPQA corpus enhanced with manual annotations for subjectivity at sentence level, does not seem to perform well when compared to the experiments in which automatic subjectivity classification is used.
    This could imply that a classifier cannot be so easily trained on the cues that humans use to express subjectivity, especially when they are not overtly expressed in the sentence and thus can be lost in the translation.
    Instead, the automatic annotations produced with a rule-based tool (OpinionFinder), relying on over
