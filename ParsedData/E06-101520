f about 1.5%.
    This suggests that (1) to detect semantic roles, lexical information is very important, (2) bow give a higher contribution as errors in POS-tagging make the word + POS fragments less reliable and (3) as the FrameNet trees are obtained with the Collins&#8217; syntactic parser, tree kernels seem robust to incorrect parse trees.
    Third, we point out that the polynomial kernel on flat features is more accurate than tree kernels but the design of such effective features required noticeable knowledge and effort (Gildea and Jurafsky, 2002).
    On the contrary, the choice of subtrees suitable to syntactically characterize a target phenomenon seems a easier task (see Section 3 for the predicate argument case).
    Moreover, by combining polynomial and SST kernels, we can improve the classification accuracy (Moschitti, 2004), i.e. tree kernels provide the learning algorithm with many relevant fragments which hardly can be designed by hand.
    In fact, as many predicate argument structures are qui
