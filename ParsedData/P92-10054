or relations.
    Restriction is a higher-order predicate.
    Resolution is a formula (the 'referent' of the form expression), or is a meta-variable if the form expression is unresolved.
    Scope is either a metavariable when scoping information is underspecified or a (possibly empty) list of term indices e.g.
    [+i,+j] if term +i outscopes +j.
    The terms identified by the indices must occur within Formula.
    The degree to which a QLF is unresolved corresponds approximately to the extent to which meta-variables (appearing above as Quant, Ref t, Scope, and Resolution) are instantiated to the appropriate kind of object level expressions (though see Section 5 for an explicit characterization of unresolved QLFs and partial interpretations.)
  
  
    Resolution of QLFs through the instantiation of meta-variables has been applied to a wide range of phenomena.
    These include pronouns, definite descriptions, implicit or vague relations, ellipsis and temporal relations (see Alshawi 1990 for an account of
