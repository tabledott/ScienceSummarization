lation of syntactically annotated corpora into different grammatical formalisms such as CCG, TAG, HPSG, or LFG is that the analyses that are captured in the original annotation can be mapped directly (or, at least, without too much additional work) into the desired analyses in the target formalism.
    This can only hold if all constructions that are treated in a similar manner in the original corpus are also treated in a similar manner in the target formalism.
    For the Penn Treebank, our research and the work of others (Xia 1999; Chen and Vijay-Shanker 2004; Chiang 2000; Cahill et al. 2002) have shown that such a correspondence exists in most cases.
    Although the output of most current Treebank parsers is linguistically impoverished, the Treebank annotation itself is not.
    It is precisely the linguistic richness and detail of the original annotation&#8212;in particular, the additional information present in the null elements and function tags that are ignored by most other parsers&#8212;that has mad
