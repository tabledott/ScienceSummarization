is less than either of the marginal totals (the more typical case) the rankings produced by the Dice Coefficient are similar to those of Mutual Information.
    The relationship between pointwise Mutual Information and the Dice Coefficient is also discussed in (Smadja et al., 1996).
    We have developed the Bigram Statistics Package to produce ranked lists of bigrams using a range of tests.

    Decision trees are among the most widely used machine learning algorithms.
    They perform a general to specific search of a feature space, adding the most informative features to a tree structure as the search proceeds.
    The objective is to select a minimal set of features that efficiently partitions the feature space into classes of observations and assemble them into a tree.
    In our case, the observations are manually sense&#8212;tagged examples of an ambiguous word in context and the partitions correspond to the
