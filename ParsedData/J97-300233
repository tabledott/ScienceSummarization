    The problem is that singletons have no discriminative power between alternative bracket matchings&#8212;they only contribute to the ambiguity.
    We can minimize the impact by moving singletons as deep as possible, closer to the individual word they precede or succeed; or in other words, we can widen the scope of the brackets immediately following the singleton.
    In general this improves precision since widescope brackets are less constraining.
    The algorithm employs a rebalancing strategy reminiscent of balanced tree structures using left and right rotations.
    A left rotation changes a (A(BC)) structure to a ((AB)C) structure, and vice versa for a right rotation.
    The task is complicated by the presence of both [] and () brackets with both L1- and L2-singletons, since each combination presents different interactions.
    To be legal, a rotation must preserve symbol order on both output streams.
    However, the following lemma shows that any s
