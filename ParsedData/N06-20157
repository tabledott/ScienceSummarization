structural relations can be semi-automatically annotated with high accuracy.
  
  
    In standard dictionaries, the senses for each word are simply listed.
    In order to allow access to additional useful information, such as subsumption, property inheritance, predicate frames from other sources, links to instances, and so on, our goal is to link the senses to an ontology.
    This requires decomposing the hierarchical structure into subtrees which can then be inserted at the appropriate conceptual node in the ontology.
    The OntoNotes terms are represented in the 110,000-node Omega ontology (Philpot et al., 2005), under continued construction and extension at ISI.
    Omega, which has been used for MT, summarization, and database alignment, has been assembled semi-automatically by merging a variety of sources, including Princeton&#8217;s WordNet, New Mexico State University&#8217;s Mikrokosmos, and a variety of Upper Models, including DOLCE (Gangemi et al., 2002), SUMO (Niles and Pease, 2001), and ISI&#8
