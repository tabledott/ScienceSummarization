muelsson, henderson, lluis) incorporate SRL within parsing, in which case we report the corresponding parsing architecture and inference approach.
    Vickrey and Koller (2008) simplify the sentences to be labeled using a set of hand-crafted rules before deploying a classification model on top of a constituent-based representation.
    Unlike in the case of parsing, few systems (yuret, samuelssson, and morante) combine several PA models and the combination is limited to simple voting strategies (see the PA Comb. column).
    Finally, the ML Methods column lists the Machine Learning (ML) methods used.
    The column indicates that maximum entropy (ME) was the most popular method (12 distinct systems relied on it).
    Support Vector Machines (SVM) (eight systems) and the Perceptron algorithm (three systems) were also popular ML methods.
  
  
    Section 4 summarized the results in the closed and open challenges using the official evaluation measures.
    In this section, we analyze the submitted runs using di
