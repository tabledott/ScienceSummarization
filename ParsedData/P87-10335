isjuncts can also be put into a similar form, with all unconditional conjuncts grouped together before all disjunctive components.
    Thus the disjunctions of a formula can be put into the form (uconji Adi sj 11 A ...Adisji.)
    V ... V (uconj.
    Adi a jy, A ...A diejny).
    The embedding of conjuncts within disjuncts is preserved, but the order of conjuncts may be changed.
    The unconditional conjuncts of a formula contain information that is more definite than the information contained in disjunctions.
    Thus a formula can be regarded as having a definite part, containing only unconditional conjuncts, and an indefinite part, containing a set of disjunctions.
    The definite part contains no disjunction, and therefore it may be represented by a DG structure.
    To encode these parts of a formula, let us define a feature-description as a type of data structure, having two components: iLet A and L be sets of symbols which are used to denote atomic values and feature labels, respectively.
