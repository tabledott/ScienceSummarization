sses by about 8%.
    This resulted in about 2% higher accuracy in the tagging of unknown words.
    The ending-guessing rules constitute the backbone of the guesser and cope with unknown words without clear morphological structure.
    For instance, discussing the problem of unknown words for the robust parsing Bod (1995, 84) writes: &amp;quot;Notice that richer, morphological annotation would not be of any help here; the words &amp;quot;return&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;stop&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;cost&amp;quot; do not have a morphological structure on the basis of which their possible lexical categories can be predicted.&amp;quot; When we applied the ending-guessing rules to these words, the words return and stop were correctly classified as noun/verbs (NN vs vim)) and only the word cost failed to be guessed by the rules.
    The acquired guessing rules employed in our cascading guesser are, in fact, of a standard nature, which, in some form or other, is present in other word-Pos guessers.
    For instance, our
