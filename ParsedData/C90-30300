  CONSTRAINT GRAMMAR AS A FRAMEWORK FOR PARSING RUNNING TEXT Fred Karlsson University of Helsinki Department of General Linguistics Hallituskatu 11 SF-00100 Helsinki Finland e-mail: KARLSS?N@FINUH.bitnet 1.
  Outline Grammars which are used in parsers are often directly imported from autonomous grammar theory and descriptive practice that were not exercised for the explicit purpose of parsing.
  Parsers have been designed for English based on e.g.
  Government and Binding Theory, Generalized Phrase Structure Grammar, and LexicaI-Functional Grammar.
  We present a formalism to be used for parsing where the grammar statements are closer to real text senten- ces and more directly address some notorious pars- ing problems, especially ambiguity.
  The formalism is a linguistic one.
  It relies on transitional probabilities in an indirect way.
  The probabilities are not part of the description.
  The descriptive statements, constraints, do not have the ordinary task of defining the notion correct sentence in L. T
