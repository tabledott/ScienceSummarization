ile WordNet encodes a flat list of 6 senses, some of which strongly related (e.g. race#1 and race#3).
    Also, the ODE provides a sense (ginger root) which is not taken into account in WordNet.
    The structure of the ODE senses is clearly hierarchical: if we were able to map with a high accuracy WordNet senses to ODE entries, then a sense clustering could be trivially induced from the mapping.
    As a result, the granularity of the WordNet inventory would be drastically reduced.
    Furthermore, disregarding errors, the clustering would be well-founded, as the ODE sense groupings were manually crafted by expert lexicographers.
    In the next section we illustrate a general way of constructing sense descriptions that we use for determining a complete, automatic mapping between the two dictionaries.
    For each word w, and for each sense S of w in a given dictionary D E {WORDNET, ODE}, we construct a sense description dD(S) as a bag of words: Specifically, in the case of WordNet, we generate def WN(S) fro
