atisfy the success criterion.
  Thus the question of complete- ness of the algorithm depends on an easily detectable property of the grammar.
  Semantic monotonicity is, by intention, a property of the particular grammar we have been using.
  4.4 A Generat ion  Example As an example of the generation process, we consider the generation of a sentence with a goal logical form passionately( love(sonny, kait)) The example was run using a toy grammar that placed subcate- gorization information in the lexicon, as in the style of analysis of head-driven phrase-structure grammar (HPSG).
  The grammar ignored tense and aspect information, so that, for instance, auxiliary verbs merely identified their own semantics with that of their postverbal complement .n The initial items included the following: (1) [0, NP.
  -~ sonny , ,  O] Sonny (2) [0, NP.+ kait ,,13] Knit [0, V -?
  ,  O] to [0, V -* was ?, O] was [% v - ,  were .
  ,  O] were [0, V -+ loves *, 0] loves [0, V -+ love , ,  0] love [0, V -* loved , ,  0] loved [
