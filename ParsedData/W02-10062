0) and SENSEVAL-2 (Edmonds and Cotton, 2001), were conducted in 1998 and 2001, respectively.
    The lexical sample task in these two SENSEVALs focuses on evaluating WSD systems in disambiguating a subset of nouns, verbs, and adjectives, for which manually sense-tagged training data have been collected.
    In this paper, we conduct a systematic evaluation of the various knowledge sources and supervised learning algorithms on the English lexical sample data sets of both SENSEVALs.
  
  
    There is a large body of prior research on WSD.
    Due to space constraints, we will only highlight prior research efforts that have investigated (1) contribution of various knowledge sources, or (2) relative performance of different learning algorithms.
    Early research efforts on comparing different learning algorithms (Mooney, 1996; Pedersen and Bruce, 1997) tend to base their comparison on only one word or at most a dozen words.
    Ng (1997) compared two learning algorithms, k-nearest neighbor and Naive Bayes, on t
