    Br is a unigram distribution of words that are semantically licensed for property r. fr is a &#8220;fertility&#8221; distribution over the integers that characterizes entity list lengths.
    For example, for the type PERSON, Br for proper heads is quite flat (there are many last names) but fr is peaked at 1 (people have a single last name).
  
  
    We now describe our generative model.
    At the parameter level, we have one parameter group for the types &#964; = (0, T1, ... , Tt), where 0 is a multinomial prior over a fixed number t of types and the {TZ} are the parameters for each individual type, described in greater detail below.
    A second group comprises loglinear parameters &#960; over discourse choices, also described below.
    Together, these two groups are drawn according to P(&#964;|&#955;)P(&#960;|Q2), where &#955; and Q2 are a small number of scalar hyper-parameters described in Section 4.
    Conditioned on the parameters (&#964;, &#960;), a document is generated as follows: A semanti
