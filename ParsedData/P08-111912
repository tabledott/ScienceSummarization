gories, or proper names that include uncapitalized words (e.g., &#8220;United States of America&#8221;).
    These limitations could be easily overcome by incorporating a noun phrase (NP) chunker and extracting NPs.
    Each new class member is then used as a seed instance in the bootstrapping loop.
    We implemented this process as breadth-first search, where each &#8220;ply&#8221; of the search process is the result of bootstrapping the class members learned during the previous iteration as seed instances for the next one.
    During each iteration, we issue a new web query and add the newly extracted class members to the queue for the next cycle.
    We run this bootstrapping process for a fixed number of iterations (search ply), or until no new class members are produced.
    We will refer to this process as reckless bootstrapping because there are no checks of any kind.
    Every term extracted by the pattern is assumed to be a class member.
