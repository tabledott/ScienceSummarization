sented next is implemented using dynamic programming.
    Due to space limitation, we skip the details here.
    In order to control the number of rules, we set three constraints for both finally extracted initial and abstract rules: 1) The depth of a tree in a rule is not greater than h .
    2) The number of non-terminals as leaf nodes is not greater than c .
    3) The tree number in a rule is not greater than d. In addition, we limit initial rules to have at most seven lexical words as leaf nodes on either side.
    However, in order to extract long-distance reordering rules, we also generate those initial rules with more than seven lexical words for abstract rules extraction only (not used in decoding).
    This makes our abstract rules more powerful in handling global structure reordering.
    Moreover, by configuring these parameters we can implement other translation models easily: 1) STSG-based model when d =1 ; 2) SCFG-based model when d =1 and h = 2 ; 3) phrase-based translation model only (no reor
