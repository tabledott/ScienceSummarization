a very low recall.
    For example, for the mention pair his and wife with no words in between, the lexical features together with the fact that there are no words in between is sufficient (though not necessary) to extract the relationship between the two entities.
    The addition of entity types, mention levels and especially, the word proximity features (&#8220;overlap&#8221;) boosts the recall at the expense of the very sets with true (T) and system output (S) mentions and entities. high precision.
    Adding the parse tree and dependency tree based features gives us our best result by exploiting the consistent syntactic patterns exhibited between mentions for some relations.
    Note that the trends of contributions from different feature streams is consistent for the &#8220;truth&#8221; and system output runs.
    As expected, the numbers are significantly lower for the system output runs due to errors made by the mention detection and mention chaining modules.
    We ran the best model on the official
