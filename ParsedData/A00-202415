ees, substituting a subtree with another, or adding additional nodes.
    We implemented these actions using a formalism based on Tree Adjoining Grammar (Joshi, 1987).
    The extraction module is the front end of the summarization system and its role is to extract key sentences.
    Our method is primarily based on lexical relations.
    First, we link words in a sentence with other words in the article through repetitions, morphological relations, or one of the lexical relations encoded in WordNet, similar to step 2 in sentence reduction.
    An importance score is computed for each word in a sentence based on the number of lexical links it has with other words, the type of links, and the directions of the links.
    After assigning a score to each word in a sentence, we then compute a score for a sentence by adding up the scores for each word.
    This score is then normalIF: ((a person or an organization is mentioned the first time) and (the full name or the full description of the person or the organizat
