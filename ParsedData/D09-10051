acked forest&#8221; (Gallo et al., 1993; Klein and Manning, 2004; Huang and Chiang, 2005) is a compact data structure that uses structure-sharing to represent exponentially many trees in polynomial space.
    A weighted hypergraph also defines a probability or other weight for each tree, and can be used to represent the hypothesis space considered (for a given input) by a monolingual parser or a tree-based translation system, e.g., tree to string (Quirk et al., 2005; Liu et al., 2006), string to tree (Galley et al., 2006), tree to tree (Eisner, 2003), or string to string with latent tree structures (Chiang, 2007).
    Given a hypergraph, we are often interested in computing some quantities over it using dynamic programming algorithms.
    For example, we may want to run the Viterbi algorithm to find the most probable derivation tree in the hypergraph, or the k most probable trees.
    Semiring-weighted logic programming is a general framework to specify these algorithms (Pereira and Warren, 1983; Shieber et a
