and observed actions.
    The processes are specified in two parts: first as schemas of rules which conjecture that certain states or actions can be added to a plan being constructed.
    The plausibility of the plans containing the result of the inferences is then evaluated by rating heuristics.
    Thus the plan construction and inference rules are not to be interpreted as valid logical rules of inference.
    There are two inverses to the KNOWIF rule: if A wants to know whether P is true, then A may want P to be true, or A may want P to be false.
    2 Throughout the rest of the paper agent A will usually denote the constructor/executor of plans, and S (or System) the recognizer of plans (usually constructed by A).
    PI.W is the special case of the precondition-action rule where the precondition is the want precondition: (PI.W) [Want rule] For all agents S, A, and C and for all actions ACT whose agent is C, it is plausible that The plan inference rules generate formulas which the recognizing agent believ
