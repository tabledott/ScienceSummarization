verage of unique 4-grams jumps from 3% to 16% &#8211; a level reached only after observing more than 100,000 sentence pairs, or roughly three million words of text, without using paraphrases.
  
  
    Previous research on trying to overcome data sparsity issues in statistical machine translation has largely focused on introducing morphological analysis as a way of reducing the number of types observed in a training text.
    For example, Nissen and Ney (2004) apply morphological analyzers to English and German and are able to reduce the amount of training data needed to reach a certain level of translation quality.
    Goldwater and McClosky (2005) find that stemming Czech and using lemmas improves the word-to-word correspondences when training Czech-English alignment models.
    Koehn and Knight (2003) show how monolingual texts and parallel corpora can be used to figure out appropriate places to split German compounds.
    Still other approaches focus on ways of acquiring data.
