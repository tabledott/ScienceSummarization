    The proposed method generates paraphrases for the input sentences in each application.
    The generated paraphrases are then manually scored based on adequacy, fluency, and usability.
    The results show that the proposed method is promising, which generates useful paraphrases for the given applications.
    In addition, comparison experiments show that our method outperforms a conventional SMT-based PG method.
  
  
    Conventional methods for paraphrase generation can be classified as follows: Rule-based methods: Rule-based PG methods build on a set of paraphrase rules or patterns, which are either hand crafted or automatically collected.
    In the early rule-based PG research, the paraphrase rules are generally manually written (McKeown, 1979; Zong et al., 2001), which is expensive and arduous.
    Some researchers then tried to automatically extract paraphrase rules (Lin and Pantel, 2001; Barzilay and Lee, 2003; Zhao et al., 2008b), which facilitates the rule-based PG methods.
    However,
