itioners to simply plug in word cluster features into their current feature models.
    Given previous work on word clusters for various linguistic structure prediction tasks, these results are not too surprising.
    However, to our knowledge this is the first study to apply the same type of word cluster features across languages and tasks.
    In the second part, we provided two simple methods for inducing cross-lingual word clusters.
    The first method works by projecting word clusters, induced from monolingual data, from a source language to a target language directly via word alignments.
    The second method, on the other hand, makes use of monolingual data in both the source and the target language, together with word alignments that act as constraints on the joint clustering.
    We then showed that by using these cross-lingual word clusters, we can significantly improve on direct transfer of discriminative models for both parsing and NER.
    As in the monolingual case, both types of cross-lingual
