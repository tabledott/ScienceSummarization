o discern among WordNet senses that even linguists have a difficult time distinguishing.
    Table 2 summarizes the results, and Figure 1 shows our algorithm's results (triangles) compared to the performance of the 21 SENSEVAL-2 English All Words participants, when the evaluation is restricted to the same set of noun test instances.6 Hollow circles represent supervised systems and filled circles represent unsupervised systems.'
    Of the systems that are unsupervised, and can therefore be included in a fair comparison, only one is clearly better ort both precision and recall.
  
  
    The results show that the performance of our approach is comparable or superior to most other unsupervised systems, even though it is based on cross-language lexical correspondences, a radically different source of evidence, and even though those correspondences were derived from machine translations rather than clean human translations.
    Here we briefly consider issues that bear on recall and precision, respectively.
