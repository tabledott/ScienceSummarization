alignments in the comparison, S be the set of SURE alignments in the gold standard, and P be the union of the SURE and POSSIBLE alignments in the gold standard.

			= We held out a set of news clusters from our training data and randomly extracted two sets of sentence pairs for blind evaluation.
			The first is a set of 250 sentence pairs extracted on the basis of an edit distance of 5 ? n ? 20, arbitrarily chosen to allow a range of reasonably divergent candidate pairs.
			These sentence pairs were checked by an independent human evaluator to ensure that they contained paraphrases before they were tagged for alignments.
			The second set comprised 116 sentence pairs randomly selected from the set of first-two sentence pairs.
			These were likewise hand vetted by independent human evaluators.
			After an initial training pass and refinement of the linking specification, interrater agreement measured in terms of AER5 was 93.1%
