 could accomplish, and because we were concerned with inheriting strong biases from the limited hand-marked data.
    Thus our second method of finding the pronoun/noun co-occurrences is simply to parse the text and then assume that the noun-phrase at Hobbs distance one is the antecedent.
    Given a pronoun resolution method and a corpus, the result is a set of pronoun/referent pairs.
    By collating by referent and abstracting away to the gender classes of pronouns, rather than individual pronouns, we have the relative frequencies with which a given referent is referred to by pronouns of each gender class.
    We will say that the gender class for which this relative frequency is the highest is the gender class to which the referent most probably belongs.
    However, any syntax-only pronoun resolution strategy will be wrong some of the time - these methods know nothing about discourse boundaries, intentions, or real-world knowledge.
    We would like to know, therefore, whether the pattern of pronoun refe
