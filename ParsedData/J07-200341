ation is a twofold challenge.
    It is a modeling challenge, in part because of the difficulty of coordinating syntactic structures with potentially messy parallel corpora; it is an implementation challenge, because of the added complexity introduced by hierarchical structures.
    Here we have addressed the modeling challenge by taking only the fundamental idea from syntax, that language is hierarchically structured, and integrating it conservatively into a phrase-based model typical of the current state of the art.
    This fusion does no violence to the latter; indeed, we have presented our approach as a logical outgrowth of the phrase-based approach.
    Moreover, hierarchical structure improves translation accuracy significantly.
