   Both of these indicate that targetdependent features are more useful for improving subjectivity classification than for polarity classification.
    This is consistent with our observation in Subsection 6.2 that most errors caused by incorrect target association are made in subjectivity classification.
    We also note that all numbers in Table 3 are much bigger than those in Table 1, which suggests that subjectivity classification of tweets is more difficult than polarity classification.
    Similarly, we evaluated the contribution of target extension for polarity classification.
    According to the results, adding all extended targets improves the accuracy by about 1 point.
    However, the contributions from the three individual methods are not statistically significant.
    As seen in Figure 1, there are several tweets which are not connected with any other tweets.
    For these tweets, our graph-based optimization approach will have no effect.
    The following table shows the percentages of the twee
