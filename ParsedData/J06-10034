rongly related semantically and hence close in the other sense.
  We would thus have very much preferred to be able to adhere to the view of semantic distance as the inverse of semantic relatedness, not merely of similarity, in the present paper.
  Unfortunately, because of the sheer number of methods measuring similarity, as well as those measuring distance as the ?opposite?
  of similarity, this would have made for an awkward presentation.
  Therefore, we have to ask the reader to rely on context when interpreting what exactly the expressions semantic distance, semantically distant, and semantically close mean in each particular case.
  Various approaches presented below speak of concepts and words.
  As a means of acknowledging the polysemy of language, in this paper the term concept will refer to a particular sense of a given word.
  We want to be very clear that, throughout this paper, when we say that two words are ?similar?, this is a short way of saying that they denote similar concepts; we are not ta
