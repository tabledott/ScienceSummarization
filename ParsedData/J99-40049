tiate the free variables of the unary rule in every possible way.
    For instance, we instantiate the free variable i with the value 1, and the free variable A with the nontermirtal X.
    Since w1 = x, the instantiated rule is then Because the value of the top line of the instantiated unary rule, R(X x), has value 0.8, we deduce that the bottom line, [1, X, 2], has value 0.8.
    We instantiate the rule in two other ways, and compute the following chart values: The effect of the binary rule will parallel the second set of loops for the CKY inside algorithm.
    Consider the instantiation i -= 1, k = 2, j = 3, A = X, B = X, C = X, We use the multiplicative operator of the semiring of interest to multiply together the values of the top line, deducing that [I, X, 3] = 0.2 x 0.8 x 0.8 = 0.128.
    Similarly, There are two more ways to instantiate the conditions of the binary rule: The first has the value 1 x 0.8 x 0.128 = 0.1024, and the second also has the value 0.1024.
    When there is more than one way to d
