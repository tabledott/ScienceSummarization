    While more experiments are needed to investigate the usefulness of other sources of information, the feature set described above, while basic, offers good generalization properties.
  
  
    We experimented with the following data-sets3.
    The Semcor corpus (Miller et al., 1993), a fraction of the Brown corpus (Ku&#728;cera and Francis, 1967) which has been manually annotated with Wordnet synset labels.
    Named entities of the categories &#8220;person&#8221;, &#8220;location&#8221; and &#8220;group&#8221; are also annotated.
    The original annotation with Wordnet 1.6 synset IDs has been converted to the most recent version 2.0 of Wordnet.
    Semcor is divided in three parts: &#8220;brown1&#8221; and &#8220;brown2&#8221;, here referred to as &#8220;SEM&#8221;, in which nouns, verbs, adjectives and adverbs are annotated.
    In addition, the section &#8220;brownv&#8221;, &#8220;SEMv&#8221; here, contains annotations only for verbs.
    We also experimented with the Senseval-3 English all-words tas
