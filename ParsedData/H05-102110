			S is an acceptor for the English sentence E, and T is an acceptor for the French sentence F . TheViterbi alignment is found as the path with the high est probability in B. The WFST composition gives the word-to-word alignments between the sentences.
			However, to obtain the phrase alignments, we need to construct additional FSTs not described here.
			2.3 Reordering WFST for MJ-2.
			MJ-2 reordering restricts the maximum allowablejump to 2 phrases and also insists that the reorder ing take place within a window of 3 phrases.
			This latter condition implies that for an input sequence {a, b, c, d}, we disallow the three output sequences: {b, d, a, c; c, a, d, b; c, d, a, b; }.
