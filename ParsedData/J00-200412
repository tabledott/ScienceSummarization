ion model can be effected by a two-stage decomposition.
    The first stage is based on the observation that every sequence L is just an ordered bag, and that the bag B can be modeled independently of its order 0.
    For example, the sequence (abc) consists of the bag {c, a, b} and the ordering relation {(b, 2), (a,1), (c, 3)1.
    If we represent each sequence L as a pair (B, 0), then 2 &amp;quot;Sentence-to-sentence&amp;quot; might be a more transparent term than &amp;quot;sequence-to-sequence,&amp;quot; but all the models that I'm aware of apply equally well to sequences of words that are not sentences.
    Now, let Li and L2 be two sequences and let A be a one-to-one mapping between the elements of L1 and the elements of L2.
    Borrowing a term from the operations research literature, I shall refer to such mappings as assignments.'
    Let A be the set of all possible assignments between L1 and L2.
    Using assignments, we can decompose conditional and joint probabilities over sequences: The second sta
