Sternberg (1982), and Wilks (1978), among others.
    Various mechanisms have been advanced for highlighting certain comparisons or interactions, including relevance (e.g., Hobbs 1983b; Tversky 1977) and salience (Ortony et al. 1985).
    Among computational approaches, Indurkhya's (1988) Constrained Semantic Transference theory of metaphor can be viewed as a formalization of Black's interaction theory (ibid., p. 129).
    Source and target domains are viewed as &amp;quot;systems of relationships.&amp;quot; In metaphorical interpretation, an &amp;quot;implicative complex&amp;quot; of the source domain is imposed on the target domain, thereby shaping the features of the target domain, which in turn produces changes in the features of the source domain, hence the &amp;quot;interaction.&amp;quot; It is assumed that a structural analogy underlies every metaphor (ibid., p. 129).
    A metaphor is identified with the formal notion of a T-MAP which is a pair ( F,S ) where F is a function that maps vocabulary of the
