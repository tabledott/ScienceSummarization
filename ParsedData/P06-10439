 the Penn Treebank (Marcus et al., 1993) which consists of about 40,000 sentences (one million words) annotated with syntactic information.
    We use the standard divisions: Sections 2 through 21 are used for training, section 24 for held-out development, and section 23 for final testing.
    In addition to labeled news data, we make use of a large quantity of unlabeled news data.
    The unlabeled data is the North American News Corpus, NANC (Graff, 1995), which is approximately 24 million unlabeled sentences from various news sources.
    NANC contains no syntactic information and sentence boundaries are induced by a simple discriminative model.
    We also perform some basic cleanups on NANC to ease parsing.
    NANC contains news articles from various news sources including the Wall Street Journal, though for this paper, we only use articles from the LA Times portion.
    To use the data from NANC, we use self-training (McClosky et al., 2006).
    First, we take a WSJ trained reranking parser (i.e. both
