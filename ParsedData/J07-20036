in English word order.
    These three rules, along with some conventional phrase pairs, suffice to translate the sentence correctly: [Aozhou] [shi] [[[yu [Beihan]1 you [bangjiao]2] de [shaoshu guojia]3] zhiyi] [Australia] [is] [one of [the [few countries]3 that [have [dipl. rels.
    ]2 with [N. Korea]1]]] The system we describe in this article uses rules like (3), (4), and (5), which we formalize in the next section as rules of a synchronous context-free grammar (CFG).1 Moreover, the system is able to learn them automatically from a parallel text without syntactic annotation.
    Because our system uses a synchronous CFG, it could be thought of as an example of syntax-based statistical machine translation (MT), joining a line of research (Wu 1997; Alshawi, Bangalore, and Douglas 2000; Yamada and Knight 2001) that has been fruitful but has not previously produced systems that can compete with phrase-based systems in large-scale translation tasks such as the evaluations held by NIST.
