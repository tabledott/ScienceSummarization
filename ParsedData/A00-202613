 in the training data.
    Furthermore, if a feature derived from Table 4 looks at a particular word chi (w) and attribute a, we only allow it if a has occurred as a descendent of 1-We use a dummy ROOT node to generate the top most head word of the phrase chi(w) in some dependency tree in the training set.
    As an example, this condition allows features that look at chi(w) =&amp;quot;to&amp;quot; and $city-toE attr,i but disallows features that look at chi(w) =&amp;quot;to&amp;quot; and $cityfrE The idea behind the search procedure for NLG3 is similar to the search procedure for NLG2, namely, to explore only a fraction of the possible trees by continually sorting and advancing only the top N trees at any given point.
    However, the dependency trees are not built left-to-right like the word sequences in NLG2; instead they are built from the current head (which is initially the root node) in the following order: As before, any incomplete trees that have generated a particular attribute twice, as well as com
