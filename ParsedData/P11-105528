 connect weak supervision with rections.
    By joining two or more Freebase tables, multi-instance learning and extend their relational we can generate many more matches and learn more extraction kernel to this context. relations.
    We also wish to refine our model in order Riedel et al. (2010), combine weak supervision to improve precision.
    For example, we would like and multi-instance learning in a more sophisticated to add type reasoning about entities and selectional manner, training a graphical model, which assumes preference constraints for relations.
    Finally, we are only that at least one of the matches between the also interested in applying the overall learning aparguments of a Freebase fact and sentences in the proaches to other tasks that could be modeled with corpus is a true relational mention.
