    As before, &#928;(p, i, k), &#928;(p, k,j), and (i, l, k) &#8712; Acp together entail &#928;(p, i, j).
    For completeness, we need to show that for any sentence x and dependency forest Gx = (Vx, Ax) for x, there is a transition sequence C0,m such that Gcm = Gx.
    The proof is by induction on the length |x |and is essentially the same as Proof 7 up to the point where we assume the existence of a transition sequence C0,q for the sentence x' = (w0, w1, wp&#8722;1) and subgraph Gx, = (Vx &#8722; {p}, A&#8722;p), where the terminal configuration still has the form cq = (&#955;cq, [ ], [ ], A&#8722;p), but where it can no longer be assumed that &#955;cq = [0, 1,.. .

    If i is a root in Gx, then i &#8712; &#955;cq; but if i &#8712; &#955;cq then i is either a root or has a head j such Nivre Deterministic Incremental Dependency Parsing that j &lt; i in Gx,.
