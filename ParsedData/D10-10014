ependencies as the firstbest output from the dependency parser (the Collins (2003) model has an F1 score of 88.1%; the baseline method has an F1 score of 89.7%; and the dual decomposition method has an F1 score of 90.7%).
    In a second set of experiments, we use dual decomposition to integrate the trigram POS tagger of Toutanova and Manning (2000) with the parser of Collins (2003).
    We again find that the method finds an exact solution in almost all cases, with convergence in just a few iterations of decoding.
    Although the focus of this paper is on dynamic programming algorithms&#8212;both in the experiments, and also in the formal results concerning marginal polytopes&#8212;it is straightforward to use other combinatorial algorithms within the approach.
    For example, Koo et al. (2010) describe a dual decomposition approach for non-projective dependency parsing, which makes use of both dynamic programming and spanning tree inference algorithms.
  
  
    Dual decomposition is a classical method fo
