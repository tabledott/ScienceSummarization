n includes speech that is not intended by the speaker to be part of the content of the utterance.
    This speech must be detected and deleted in order to correctly identify the intended meaning.
    The broad class of disfluencies encompasses a number of phenomena, including word fragments, interjections, filled pauses, restarts, and repairs.
    We are analyzing the repairs in a large subset (over ten thousand sentences) of spontaneous speech data collected for the DARPA Spoken Language Program.'
    We have categorized these disfluencies as to type and frequency, and are investigating methods for their automatic detection and correction.
    Here we report promising results on detection and correction of repairs by combining pattern matching, syntactic and semantic analysis, and acoustics.
    This paper extends work reported in an earlier paper (Shriberg et al., 1992a).
    The problem of disfluent speech for language understanding systems has been noted but has received limited attention.
