rence models may refer to any kind of models that can exploit non-local information, including models that can consider multiple candidate antecedents simultaneously (e.g., ranking models), models that allow joint learning for coreference resolution and related tasks (e.g., anaphoricity determination), models that can directly optimize clustering-level (rather than classification) accuracy, and models that can coordinate with other components of a resolver, such as training instance creation and clustering.
