    The annotated examples were split into a training set (4000 examples), a validation set (500 examples); and a held out test set (500 examples).
    The WEKA machine learning package (Witten and Frank, 1999) was used to test the performance of various learning and meta-learning algorithms, including Na&#239;ve Bayes, Decision Tree, Decision List, Support Vector Machines, Boosting, and Bagging.
    Table 4 shows the list of features used to describe each concept-instance pair for training the CN/PN filter.
    Features are split between those that deal with the entire pattern, only the concept, only the instance, and the pattern&#8217;s overall orthography.
    The most powerful of these features examines an Ontology in order to exploit semantic information about the concept&#8217;s head.
    This semantic information is found by examining the superconcept relations of the concept head in the 110,000 node Omega Ontology (Hovy et al., in prep.
    ).
