ain specific information about dividing sentences into chunks of words of arbitrary types.
    We have chosen to work with a corpus with parse information, the Wall Street Journal WSJ part of the Penn Treebank II corpus (Marcus et al., 1993), and to extract chunk information from the parse trees in this corpus.
    We will give a global description of the various chunk types in the next section.
  
  
    The chunk types are based on the syntactic category part (i.e. without function tag) of the bracket label in the Treebank (cf.
    Bies (1995) p.35).
    Roughly, a chunk contains everything to the left of and including the syntactic head of the constituent of the same name.
    Some Treebank constituents do not have related chunks.
    The head of S (simple declarative clause) for example is normally thought to be the verb, but as the verb is already part of the VP chunk, no S chunk exists in our example sentence.
    Besides the head, a chunk also contains premodifiers (like determiners and adjectives in N
