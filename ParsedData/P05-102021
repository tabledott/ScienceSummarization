    Unlike the MUC results, using more features to train the ranking model does not always yield better performance with respect to the B-CUBED scorer (see rows 3-5 of Table 4).
    In particular, the best result for BNEWS is achieved using only method-based features, whereas the best result for NPAPER is obtained using only partitionbased features.
    Nevertheless, since neither type of features offers consistently better performance than the other, it still seems desirable to apply the two types of features in combination to train the ranker.
    Random ranking.
    Comparing rows 3 and 6 of Table 4, we see that the supervised ranker yields a nontrivial improvement of 2-3% in F-measure over the random ranker for the three data sets.
    Hence, ranking still plays an important role in our approach with respect to the B-CUBED scorer despite its modest performance gains over the two baseline systems.
    Perfect ranking.
    Results in rows 3 and 7 of Table 4 indicate that the supervised ranker underperforms
