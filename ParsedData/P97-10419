    Roughly 80% of the data was used to train the segmentation algorithm, and 20% was used as a blind test set to score the rules learned from the training data.
    In addition to Chinese and Thai, we also performed segmentation experiments using a large corpus of English in which all the spaces had been removed from the texts.
    Most of our English experiments were performed using training and test sets with roughly the same 80-20 ratio, but in Section 3.4.3 we discuss results of English experiments with different amounts of training data.
    Unfortunately, we could not repeat these experiments with Chinese and Thai due to the small amount of handsegmented data available.
    There are three main types of transformations which can act on the current state of an imperfect segmentation: In our syntax, Insert and Delete transformations can be triggered by any two adjacent characters (a bigram) and one character to the left or right of the bigram.
    Slide transformations can be triggered by a sequence of
