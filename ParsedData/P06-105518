   The second approximation that Matsuzaki et al. (2005) present is the Viterbi parse under a new sentence-specific PCFG, whose rule probabilities are given as the solution of a variational approximation of the original grammar.
    However, their rule probabilities turn out to be the posterior probability, given the sentence, of each rule being used at each position in the tree.
    Their algorithm is therefore the labelled recall algorithm of Goodman (1996) but applied to rules.
    That is, it returns the tree whose expected number of correct rules is maximal.
    Thus, assuming one is interested in a per-position score like F1 (which is its own debate), this method of parsing is actually more appropriate than finding the most likely parse, not simply a cheap approximation of it, and it need not be derived by a variational argument.
    We refer to this method of parsing as the max-rule parser.
    Since this method is not a contribution of this paper, we refer the reader to the fuller presentations in Goo
