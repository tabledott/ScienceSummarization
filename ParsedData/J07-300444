]\NP to noted.13 The dependency between the subject and the participial is mediated through the lexical category of the copula, (S[dcl]\NPi)/(S[pss]\NPi) (with the standard semantics apax.px).14 In order to reduce lexical ambiguity and deal with data sparseness, we treat optional by-PPs which contain the &#8220;logical&#8221; subject (NP-LGS) as adjuncts rather than arguments of the passive participle.15 Here is the resulting CCG derivation, together with its dependency structure: 13 In the case of verbs like pay for, which take a PP argument, the null element appears within the PP.
    In order to obtain the correct lexical category of paid, (S[pss]\NP)/(PP/NP), we treat the null element like an argument of the preposition and percolate it up to the PP level.
    14 We assume that the fact that the subject NP argument of passive participials with category S[pss]\NP identifies the patient, rather than agent, is represented in the semantic interpretation of noted, for example, ax.noted'x one, where one&#8217;
