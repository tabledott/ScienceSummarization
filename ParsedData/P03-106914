plays an important role in determining the discourse relations between propositions.
    Although we don&#8217;t have an explicit model of rhetorical relations and their effects on sentence ordering, we capture the lexical inter-dependencies between sentences by focusing on verbs and their precedence relationships in the corpus.
    From the Treebank parses we extracted the verbs contained in each sentence.
    We obtained two versions of this feature: (a) a lemmatized version where verbs were reduced to their base forms and (b) a non-lemmatized version which preserved tense-related information; more specifically, verbal complexes (e.g., I will have been going) were identified from the parse trees heuristically by devising a set of 30 patterns that search for sequences of modals, auxiliaries and verbs.
    This is an attempt at capturing temporal coherence by encoding sequences of events and their morphology which indirectly indicates their tense.
    To give an example consider the text in Figure 3.
