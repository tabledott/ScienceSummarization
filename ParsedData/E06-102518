correct category among Positive, Negative, and Objective7.
    Similarly to (Esuli and Sebastiani, 2005), our training set is obtained by expanding initial seed sets by means of WordNet lexical relations.
    The main difference is that our training set is now the union of three sets of training terms Tr = TrKp &#8746;TrKn &#8746;TrKo obtained by expanding, through K iterations, three seed sets Tr1p, Tr1n, Tr1o, one for each of the categories Positive, Negative, and Objective, respectively.
    Concerning categories Positive and Negative, we have used the seed sets, expansion policy, and number of iterations, that have performed best in the experiments of (Esuli and Sebastiani, 2005), i.e. the seed sets Tr1p = {good} and Tr1 n = {bad} expanded by using the union of synonymy and indirect antonymy, restricting the relations only to terms with the same POS of the original terms (i.e. adjectives), for a total of K = 4 iterations.
    The final expanded sets contain 6,053 Positive terms and 6,874 Negative terms.
