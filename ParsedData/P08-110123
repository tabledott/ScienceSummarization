joint model of Shi and Wang (2007).
    Despite the higher accuracy improvement from the baseline, the joint system did not give higher overall accuracy.
    One likely reason is that Shi and Wang (2007) included knowledge about special characters and semantic knowledge from web corpora (which may explain the higher baseline accuracy), while our system is completely data-driven.
    However, the comparison is indirect because our partitions of the CTB corpus are different.
    Shi and Wang (2007) also chunked the sentences before doing 10-fold cross validation, but used an uneven split.
    We chose to follow Ng and Low (2004) and split the sentences evenly to facilitate further comparison.
    Compared with Ng and Low (2004), our baseline model gave slightly better accuracy, consistent with our previous observations about the word segmentors (Zhang and Clark, 2007).
    Due to the large accuracy gain from the baseline, our joint model performed much better.
    In summary, when compared with existing joint w
