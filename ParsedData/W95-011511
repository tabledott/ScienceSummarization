 upper bound on the internal consistency of ;BiBLE test sets.
    Scores for sentence-based comparisons will always be lower than scores for paragraph-based comparisons, because there will be fewer spurious &amp;quot;hits.&amp;quot; To confirm this, an independent second translation of 50 French Hansard sentences was commissioned.
    The translation scored 0.57 on this test.
  
  
    A bilingual text corpus of Canadian parliamentary proceedings (&amp;quot;Hansards&amp;quot;) was aligned by sentence using the method presented in [Ga191b].
    From the resulting aligned corpus, this study used only sentence pairs that were aligned one to one, and then only when they were less than 16 words long and aligned with high confidence.
    Morphological variants in these sentences were stemmed to a canonical form.
    Fifteen thousand sentence pairs were randomly selected and reserved for testing; one hundred thousand were used for training.
    The independent variable in the experiments was a varying combination of
