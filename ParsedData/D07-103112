te sequence in all of our evalua tions, and at modest numbers of iterations (up to 50) often scored more than 5% better.We also noticed a wide variance in the perfor mance of models due to random initialization (both ? and ? are initially jittered to break symmetry); thiswide variance was observed with all of the estima tors investigated in this paper.
			This means we cannot compare estimators on the basis of single runs, so we ran each estimator 10 times from different random starting points and report both mean and standard deviation for all scores.
			Finally, we also experimented with annealing, in which the parameters ? and ? are raised to the power 1/T , where T is a ?temperature?
			parameter that isslowly lowered toward 1 at each iteration accord ing to some ?annealing schedule?.
			We experimented with a variety of starting temperatures and annealing schedules (e.g., linear, exponential, etc), but wereunable to find any that produced models whose like 0E+0 1E+5 2E+5 Fre quen cy Tag / hidden state (s
