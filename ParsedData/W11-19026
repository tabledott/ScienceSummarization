elations are not annotated in the OntoNotes corpus, e.g., in the text [[Yongkang Zhou], the general manager], only the larger mention is annotated.
    However, appositive and copulative relations provide useful (and highly precise) information to our coreference sieves.
    For this reason, we keep these mentions as candidates, and remove them later during post-processing.
    Once mentions are extracted, we sort them by sentence number, and left-to-right breadth-first traversal order in syntactic trees in the same sentence (Hobbs, 1977).
    We select for resolution only the first mentions in each cluster,3 for two reasons: (a) the first mention tends to be better defined (Fox, 1993), which provides a richer environment for feature extraction; and (b) it has fewer antecedent candidates, which means fewer opportunities to make a mistake.
    For example, given the following ordered list of mentions, {mi, m2, m3, m4, m1&#65533;, m6}, where the subscript indicates textual order and the superscript indicates cl
