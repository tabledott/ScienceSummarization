78% (21/27), whereas relying just on Word Frequencies yields 56% (15/27).
    Here our method corrected 6 errors of the Word Frequencies method, without causing any new errors.
    We attribute the lower success rate for the German examples to the fact that they were not restricted to topics that are well represented in the corpus.
    This poor correspondence between the training and testing texts is reflected also by the low precision of the Word Frequencies method.
    This means that the a priori probability of the target words, as estimated from the training corpora, provides a very poor prediction of the correct selection in the test examples.
    Relative to the a priori probability, the precision of our method is still 22% higher.
    Recently, Dagan, Marcus, and Markovitch have implemented a variant of the disambiguation method of the current paper.
    This variant was developed for evaluating a method that estimates the probability of word combinations which do not occur in the training corpus (Dag
