    Given the precision of n-grams of size up to (usually ), the length of the test set in words ( ) and the length of the reference translation in words ( ), The effectiveness of the BLEU metric has been demonstrated by showing that it correlates with human judgment.
    Let us highlight two properties of the BLEU metric: the reliance on higher n-grams and the brevity penalty BP.
    First, look at Table 1.
    Six different systems are compared here (we will get later into the nature of these systems).
    While the unigram precision of the three systems hovers around 60%, the difference in 4-gram precision is much larger.
    The Finnish system has only roughly half (7.8%) of the 4-gram precision of the Spanish system (14.7%).
    This is the cause for the relative large distance in overall BLEU (28.9% vs. 20.2%)1.
    Higher n-grams (and we could go beyond 4), measure not only syntactic cohesion and semantic adequacy of the output, but also give discriminatory power to the metric.
