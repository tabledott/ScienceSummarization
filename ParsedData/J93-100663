method of Brown, Lai, and Mercer (1991) is based on a hidden Markov model for the generation of aligned pairs of corpora, whose parameters are estimated from a large text.
    For an application of this method to the Canadian Hansard, good results are reported.
    However, the problem was also considerably facilitated by the way the implementation made use of Hansard-specific comments and annotations: these are used in a preprocessing step to find anchors for sentence alignment such that, on average, there are only ten sentences in between.
    Moreover, this particular corpus is well known for the near literalness of its translations, and it is therefore unclear to what extent the good results are due to the relative ease of the problem.
    This would be an important consideration when comparing various algorithms; when the algorithms are actually applied, it is clearly very desirable to incorporate as much prior knowledge (say, on potential anchors) as possible.
    Moreover, long texts can almost always
