			With EM, vector A in Figure 5 is transformed into vector C, which is much closer to vector D, as expected.
			Specifically, EM can split the frequency of a word in English and distribute them into its translations in Chinese in a theoretically sound way (cf., the distributed frequencies of ?internet?).
			Note that if we assume a many-to-one (or one-to-one) mapping ? = = s i icP s cP 1 )|~(1)|~( DD (5) relationship, then the use of EM turns out to be equivalent to that of Major Translation.
			3.5 Combination.
			In order to further boost the performance of translation, we propose to also use the translation method proposed in Nagata et al Specifically, we combine our method with that of Nagata et alby using a back-off strategy.
			Figure 6 illustrates the process of collecting Chinese translation candidates for an English Base NP ?information asymmetry?
			with Nagata et al?s method.
			In the combination of the two methods, we first use Nagata et als method to perform translation; if we cannot
