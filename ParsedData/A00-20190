  An Unsupervised Method For Detecting Grammatical Errors
  
    We present an unsupervised method for detecting grammatical errors by inferring negative evidence from edited textual corpora.
    The system was developed and tested using essay-length responses to prompts on the Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL).
    The errorrecognition system, ALEK, performs with about 80% precision and 20% recall.
  
  
    A good indicator of whether a person knows the meaning of a word is the ability to use it appropriately in a sentence (Miller and Gildea, 1987).
    Much information about usage can be obtained from quite a limited context: Choueka and Lusignan (1985) found that people can typically recognize the intended sense of a polysemous word by looking at a narrow window of one or two words around it.
    Statistically-based computer programs have been able to do the same with a high level of accuracy (Kilgarriff and Palmer, 2000).
    The goal of our work is to automatically identify inappropriate us
