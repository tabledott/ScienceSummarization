a new system consisting of the ensemble of a corpus-based classifier and a lexicon-based classifier with precision-based vote weighting.
    Chinese sentiment analysis has also been studied (Tsou et al., 2005; Ye et al., 2006; Li and Sun, 2007) and most such work uses similar lexiconbased or corpus-based methods for Chinese sentiment classification.
    To date, several pilot studies have been performed to leverage rich English resources for sentiment analysis in other languages.
    Standard Na&#239;ve Bayes and SVM classifiers have been applied for subjectivity classification in Romanian (Mihalcea et al., 2007; Banea et al., 2008), and the results show that automatic translation is a viable alternative for the construction of resources and tools for subjectivity analysis in a new target language.
    Wan (2008) focuses on leveraging both Chinese and English lexicons to improve Chinese sentiment analysis by using lexicon-based methods.
    In this study, we focus on improving the corpus-based method for cros
