ng 'gap threading' (e.g.
    Pereira and Shieber 1987), an alternative treatment of UBCs.
    We were able to use the same techniques for expanding out and inference on the values of the (in this case atomic) features used for threading the gaps to produce a backbone grammar (and parse table) that had the same constraining power with respect to gaps as the original grammar.
    To date, we have not attempted to compute CF backbones for grammars written in formalisms with minimal phrase structure components and (almost) completely general categories, such as HPSG (Pollard and Sag 1987) and UCG (Zeevat, Calder, and Klein 1987); more extensive inference on patterns of possible unification within nested categories and appropriate expanding-out of the categories concerned would be necessary for an LR parser to work effectively.
    This and other areas of complexity in unification-based formalisms need further investigation before we can claim to have developed a system capable of producing a useful LR parse table
