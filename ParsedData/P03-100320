cial for the KM test set (see Table 4).
    We believe this is explained by the fact that the reformulation engine was fine tuned on TREC-specific questions, which are significantly different from KM questions.
    Structured and semi-structured databases were proved to be very useful for question-answering systems.
    Lin (2002) showed through his federated approach that 47% of TREC-2001 questions could be answered using Web-based knowledge sources.
    Clarke et al. (2001) obtained a 30% improvement by using an auxiliary database created from web documents as an additional resource.
    We adopted a different approach to exploit external knowledge bases.
    In our work, we first generated a natural language collection of factoids by mining different structured and semi-structured databases (World Fact Book, Biography.com, WordNet...).
    The generation is based on manually written questionfactoid template pairs, which are applied on the different sources to yield simple natural language question-factoid
