    In this paper, we improve word alignment and, subsequently, MT accuracy by developing a range of increasingly sophisticated methods: 1.
    We first recast the problem of estimating the IBM models (Brown et al., 1993) in a discriminative framework, which leads to an initial increase in word-alignment accuracy.
    2.
    We extend the IBM models with new (sub)models, which leads to additional increases in word-alignment accuracy.
    In the process, we also show that these improvements are explained not only by the power of the new models, but also by a novel search procedure for the alignment of highest probability.
    3.
    Finally, we propose a training procedure that interleaves discriminative training with maximum likelihood training.
    These steps lead to word alignments of higher accuracy which, in our case, correlate with higher MT accuracy.
    The rest of the paper is organized as follows.
    In Section 2, we review the data sets we use to validate experimentally our algorithm
