were then hand-corrected (Pyysalo et al., 2007b).
    While a limited amount of gold standard annotated data was prepared for the Parser Evaluation Shared Task, this is the main source of gold-standard SD data which is currently available.
    In other domains, Zhuang et al. (2006) uses the representation to extract opinions about features in reviews and Meena and Prabhakar (2007) uses it to improve the quality of sentence-level sentiment analysis.
    The open information extraction system TEXTRUNNER (Banko et al., 2007) also makes use of the SD graph representation: its first module uses the Stanford parser and the dependency tool to automatically identify and label trustworthy and untrustworthy extractions.
    Even in theoretical linguistic work, SD has proven very useful: it has hugely facilitated data extraction from corpora, in the context of the NSF-funded project &#8220;Dynamics of probabilistic grammar&#8221; carried out at the Stanford Linguistics department.
