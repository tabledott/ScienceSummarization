			Researchers have furthershown that opinion-oriented information extrac tion can provide analogous benefits to a variety of practical applications including product reputation tracking (Morinaga et al, 2002), opinion-oriented question answering (Stoyanov et al, 2005), and opinion-oriented summarization (e.g. Cardie et al.
			(2004), Liu et al (2005)).
			Moreover, muchprogress has been made in the area of opinion extraction: it is possible to identify sources of opin ions (i.e. the opinion holders) (e.g. Choi et al (2005) and Kim and Hovy (2005b)), to determine the polarity and strength of opinion expressions(e.g. Wilson et al (2005)), and to recognize propo sitional opinions and their sources (e.g. Bethard et al (2004)) with reasonable accuracy.
			To date,however, there has been no effort to simultane ously identify arbitrary opinion expressions, their sources, and the relations between them.
