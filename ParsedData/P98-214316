    We carried out a second evaluation of the approach on a different set of sample texts from the genre of technical manuals (47-page Portable Style-Writer User's Guide (Stylewriter 1994).
    Out of 223 pronouns in the text, 167 were non-anaphoric (deictic and non-anaphoric &amp;quot;it&amp;quot;).
    The evaluation carried out was manual to ensure that no added error was generated (e.g. due to possible wrong sentence/clause detection or POS tagging).
    Another reason for doing it by hand is to ensure a fair comparison with Breck Baldwin's method, which not being available to us, had to be hand-simulated (see 3.3).
    The evaluation indicated 83.6% success rate.
    The &amp;quot;Baseline subject&amp;quot; model tested on the same data scored 33.9% recall and 67.9% precision, whereas &amp;quot;Baseline most recent&amp;quot; scored 66.7%.
    Note that &amp;quot;Baseline subject&amp;quot; can be assessed both in terms of recall and precision because this &amp;quot;version&amp;quot; is not robust: in
