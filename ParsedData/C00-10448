ve or negative labels to each class (there are slightly fewer positive terms, but with a significantly higher rate of occurrence than nega- tive terms).
  Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown applied their method to 1,336 (657 positive and 679 negative) adjectives which were all the oriented adjectives appearing in the corpus 20 times or more.
  Orientation labels were assigned to these adjectives by hand.
  I Subsequent validation of the initial selection and label assignment steps with indepen- dent human judges showed an agreement of 89% tor tile first step and 97% for the second step, establishing that orientation is a fairly objective semantic property.
  Be- cause the accuracy ol the method depends on the den- sity of conjunctions per adjective, Hatzivassiloglou and MeKeown tested separately their algorithm for adjectives appearing in at least 2, 3, 4, or 5 conjunctions in the co l pus; their results are shown in Table I.
  In this paper, we use the model labels assigned by hand by Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown,
