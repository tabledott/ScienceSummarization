at a discourse entity realized as the TOPIC or the EMPATHY LOCUS is more salient and should be ranked higher on the Cf.
  Whenever a discourse ntity simultaneously fulfills multiple roles, the entity is usually ranked according to the highest ranked role.
  In the following sections we will discuss the motivation for this ranking.
  Section 3.1 discusses the role of the grammatical topic marker wa in Japanese.
  Section 3.2 explains the role of EMPATHY in Japanese discourse salience and shows that (GRAMMATICAL OR ZERO) TOPIC &gt; EMPATHY and that EMPATHY &gt; SUBJ.
  Section 3.2.1 shows how the centering algorithm handles utterances with empathy loci.
  Zero topics will not be discussed until Section 5.
  3.1 Topic Discourse ntities that are EVOKED, INFERABLE, or UNUSED can be marked as the TOPIC.
  The speaker cannot mark an entity as the grammatical TOPIC unless the hearer is aware of the object that s /he is going to talk about (Prince 1978a; Kuno 1976b).
  For example: Example 8 Hutari wa paatii ni kimasi
