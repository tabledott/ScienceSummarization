    Semantics therefore seems to trigger a response in cases where more shallow features do not seem to suffice (see examples (1-2)).
    Different feature sources account for different RE type improvements.

    WordNet features are able to improve by 14.3% and 7.7% the accuracy rate for common nouns on the BNEWS and NWIRE datasets (+34 and +37 correctly resolved common nouns out of 238 and 484 respectively), whereas employing Wikipedia yields slightly smaller improvements (+13.0% and +6.6% accuracy increase on th
