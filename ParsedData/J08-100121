arities reflected in grid topology.
    Some of these regularities are formalized in Centering Theory as constraints on transitions of the local focus in adjacent sentences.
    Grids of coherent texts are likely to have some dense columns (i.e., columns with just a few gaps, such as Microsoft in Table 1) and many sparse columns which will consist mostly of gaps (see markets and earnings in Table 1).
    One would further expect that entities corresponding to dense columns are more often subjects or objects.
    These characteristics will be less pronounced in low-coherence texts.
    Inspired by Centering Theory, our analysis revolves around patterns of local entity transitions.
    A local entity transition is a sequence {S, O, X, &#8211;}n that represents entity occurrences and their syntactic roles in n adjacent sentences.
    Local transitions can be easily obtained from a grid as continuous subsequences of each column.
    Each transition will have a certain probability in a given grid.
    For instance
