 based model need not make the correct linguistic choices.
    The performance of the model can only be empirically evaluated, the statistical considerations serve only as heuristics.
    The role of the statistical considerations is therefore to guide us in constructing heuristics that make use of the linguistic data of the sample (the corpus).
    Our experience shows that the statistical methods are indeed very helpful in establishing and comparing useful decision criteria that reflect various linguistic considerations.
    First we discuss decisions based on a single syntactic tuple (as when only one syntactic tuple in the sentence contains an ambiguous word).
    Denote the source language syntactic tuple T and let there be k alternative target tuples for T, denoted by Th &#8226; &#8226; , Tk.
    Let the counts obtained for the target tuples be n1,.
    , nk.
    For notational convenience, we number the tuples by decreasing frequency, i.e., n1 &gt; n2 &gt; &#8226; &#8226; &#8226; &gt; Since our goal is
