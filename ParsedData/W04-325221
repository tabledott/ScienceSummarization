he other TextRank application that we investigate consists of sentence extraction for automatic summarization.
    In a way, the problem of sentence extraction can be regarded as similar to keyword extraction, since both applications aim at identifying sequences that are more &#8220;representative&#8221; for the given text.
    In keyword extraction, the candidate text units consist of words or phrases, whereas in sentence extraction, we deal with entire sentences.
    TextRank turns out to be well suited for this type of applications, since it allows for a ranking over text units that is recursively computed based on information drawn from the entire text.
    To apply TextRank, we first need to build a graph associated with the text, where the graph vertices are representative for the units to be ranked.
    For the task of sentence extraction, the goal is to rank entire sentences, and therefore a vertex is added to the graph for each sentence in the text.
    The co-occurrence relation used for keyword ext
