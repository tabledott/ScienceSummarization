al to 1 if fi is rooted at node n, 0 otherwise.
    Collins and Duffy&#8217;s kernel is defined as where NT1 and NT2 are the sets of nodes in T1 and T2, respectively and A(n1, n2) = E|F| i=1 Ii(n1)Ii(n2).
    The latter is equal to the number of common fragments rooted in nodes n1 and n2.
    A can be computed as follows: jn)), where nc(n1) is the numj= ber of children of n1 and cjn is the j-th child of n. Such tree kernel can be normalized and a &#955; factor can be added to reduce the weight of large structures (refer to (Collins and Duffy, 2002) for a complete description).
    The critical aspect of steps (1), (2) and (3) is that the productions of two evaluated nodes have to be identical to allow the match of further descendants.
    This means that common substructures cannot be composed by a node with only some of its children as an effective PAS representation would require.
    We solve this problem by designing the Shallow Semantic Tree Kernel (SSTK) which allows to match portions of a PAS.
