atural Language Learning (CoNLL) were dedicated to semantic role labeling (SRL), in a monolingual setting (English).
    In 2006 and 2007 the shared tasks were devoted to the parsing of syntactic dependencies, using corpora from up to 13 languages.
    The CoNLL-2008 shared task1 proposes a unified dependency-based formalism, which models both syntactic dependencies and semantic roles.
    Using this formalism, this shared task merges both the task of syntactic dependency parsing and the task of identifying semantic arguments and labeling them with semantic roles.
    Conceptually, the 2008 shared task can be divided into three subtasks: (i) parsing of syntactic dependencies, (ii) identification and disambiguation of semantic predicates, and (iii) identification of arguments and assignment of semantic roles for each predicate.
    Several objectives were addressed in this shared task: Given the complexity of this shared task, we limited the evaluation to a monolingual, Englishonly setting.
