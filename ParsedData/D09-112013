ranian army is not.
    Again, a full solution would require its own model, here we mark as appositions any NPs immediately to the left of a head child NP where the head child NP is identified as a person by the NER tagger.9 We incorporate NP appositive annotation as a constraint during filtering.
    Any mention which corresponds to an appositive node has its set of possible antecedents limited to its parent.
    Along with the appositive constraint, we implement the i-within-i constraint that any non-appositive NP cannot be be coreferent with its parent; this constraint is then propagated to any node its parent is forced to agree with.
    The order in which these constraints are applied is important, as illustrated by the example in Figure 4: First the list of possible antecedents for the appositive NP is constrained to only its parent.
    Now that all appositives have been constrained, we apply the i-withini constraint, which prevents its from having the NP headed by brand in the set of possible antecede
