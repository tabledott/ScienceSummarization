ints out that in a case like annotators are expected to mark (1) Henry Higgins, (2) sales director of Sudsy Soaps, and (3) president of Dreamy Detergents as coreferential.
    (Similar strategies seem to be van Deemter and Kibble On Coreferring adopted by most practitioners of coreference annotation, e.g., Cristea et al. [1999]).
    But since coreference is generally agreed to be a equivalence relation (e.g.
    Hirschman and Chinchor 1997, Section 1.3), this implies that the sales director of Sudsy Soaps and the president of Dreamy Detergents are the same person.
    Clearly, this cannot be right.
    Luckily, there are other parts of the same TD that do a better job of applying the notion of coreference to sentences involving change over time.
    Consider, for example, Section 1.3, where the sentence the stock price fell from $4.02 to $3.85 is discussed.
    Here annotators are asked to consider the stock price as standing in the IDENT relation with $3.85 but not with $4.02, because $3.85 is &amp;quot;the
