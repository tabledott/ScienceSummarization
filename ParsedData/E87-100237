as the original ones did, but there is an algorithm for constructing a single finite-state transducer that will accept the intersection of the pairs they all accept.
    Suppose, now, that this configuration of parallel transducers is put in series with two other standard transducers, one which carries the real empty symbol onto its surrogate, and everything else onto itself, and another transducer that carries the surrogate onto the real empty symbol, then the resulting configuration accepts just the desired set of languages, all of which are also acceptable by single transducers that can be algorithmically derived form the originals.
    It may well appear that the systems we have been considering properly belong to finite-state phonology or graphology, and not to morphology, properly construed.
    Computational linguists have indeed often been guilty of some carelessness in their use of this terminology.
    But it is not hard to see how it could have arisen.
    The first step in any process that treats
