ly, one way to obtain normalized forms of words is to employ a fully fledged morphological analyzer for each of the languages.
    However, we were concerned that our methods should be as independent as possible of any specific facts about the languages being treated, since this would make them more readily usable.
    Furthermore, since our methods attend only to very gross features of the texts, it seemed unreasonable that their success should turn on a very fine analysis at any level.
    We argue that, by adding a guess as to how a word should be normalized to the WSI, we remove no associations that could have been formed on the basis of the original word, but only introduce the possibility of some additional associations.
    Also, it is unlikely that an incorrect normalization will contract any associations at all, especially in view of the fact that these forms, because they normalize several original forms, tend to occur more often.
    They will therefore rarely be misleading.
    For us, a normalize
