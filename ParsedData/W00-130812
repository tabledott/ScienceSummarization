    Table 4 shows the Baseline model's overall assignment accuracies for different parts of speech.
    For example, the accuracy on nouns is greater than the accuracy on adjectives.
    The accuracy on NNPS (plural proper nouns) is a surprisingly low 41.1%.
    Tagger errors are of various types.
    Some are the result of inconsistency in labeling in the training data (Ratnaparkhi 1996), which usually reflects a lack of linguistic clarity or determination of the correct part of speech in context.
    For instance, the status of various noun premodifiers (whether chief or maximum is NN or JJ, or whether a word in -ing is acting as a JJ or VBG) is of this type.
