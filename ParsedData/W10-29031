cess of converting text into a formal meaning representation (MR), is one of the key challenges in natural language processing.
    Unlike shallow approaches for semantic interpretation (e.g., semantic role labeling and information extraction) which often result in an incomplete or ambiguous interpretation of the natural language (NL) input, the output of a semantic parser is a complete meaning representation that can be executed directly by a computer program.
    Semantic parsing has mainly been studied in the context of providing natural language interfaces to computer systems.
    In these settings the target meaning representation is defined by the semantics of the underlying task.
    For example, providing access to databases: a question posed in natural language is converted into a formal database query that can be executed to retrieve information.
    Example 1 shows a NL input query and its corresponding meaning representation.
