en sequence, we identify all sequences of tokens that are found in the phrase clusters.
    The phrases are allowed to overlap with or be nested in one another.
    If a phrase belonging to cluster c is found at positions b to e (inclusive), we add the following features to the CRF classifier: where B (before), A (after), S (start), M (middle), and E (end) denote a position in the input sequence relative to the phrase belonging to cluster c. We treat the cluster membership as binary.
    The similarity between an element and its cluster centroid is ignored.
    For example, suppose the input sentence is &#8220;... guitar legend Jimi Hendrix was ...&#8221; and &#8220;Jimi Hendrix&#8221; belongs to cluster 183.
    Figure 1 shows the attributes at different input positions.
    The cluster features are the cross product of the unigram/bigram labels and the attributes.
    The phrasal cluster features not only help in resolving the ambiguities of words within a phrase, the B and A features also allow words adjac
