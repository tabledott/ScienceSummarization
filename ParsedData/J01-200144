observed, its length is A((T))&#8212;this is the length of the information specifying how long the list is&#8212;plus the length of each stem specification.
    In most of our work, we make the assumption that the length of a stem is the number of letters in it, weighted by the factor log 26 converting to binary bits, in a language with 26 letters!'
    The same reasoning holds for the suffix list F: its length is X((F)) plus the length of each suffix, which we may take to be the total number of letters in the suffix times log 26.
    We return to the question of how long the pointer (found inside a signature) to a stem or suffix is.
    The probability of a stem is its (empirical) frequency, i.e., the total number of words in the corpus corresponding to the words whose analysis includes the stem in question; the probability of a suffix is defined in parallel fashion.
    Using W to indicate all the words of the corpus, we may say that the length of a pointer to a stem t is of length a pointer to suffix f is
