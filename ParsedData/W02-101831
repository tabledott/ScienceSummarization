ccur at least five times in the corpus.
    Before the EM training procedure starts, one has no idea what word/phrase pairs are likely to share the same meaning.
    In other words, all alignments that can generate a sentence pair (E, F) can be assumed to have the same probability.
    Under these conditions, the evidence that a sentence pair (E, F) contributes to the fact that are generated by the same concept is given by the number of alignments that can be built between (E, F) that have a concept that is linked to phrasein sentence E and phrase in sentence F divided by the total number of alignments that can be built between the two sentences.
    Both these numbers can be easily approximated.
    Given a sentence E ofwords, there are ways in which thewords can be partitioned into non-empty sets/concepts, where is the Stirling number of second kind.
    There are also ways in which the words of a sentence F can be partitioned into nonempty sets.
    Given that any words in E can be mapped to any words in F
