orithm in a way which enables it to work off a flat morpho-syntactic analysis of the sentences of a text, while retaining a degree of quality and accuracy in pronorainal anaphora resolution comparable to that reported in (Lappin and l,eass, 1994).
			The modifica- tions discussed below make the algorithm available to a wide range of text processing frameworks, which, due to the lack of full syntactic parsing capability, nor- really would have been unable to use this high preci- sion anap hora resolution tool.
			The work is additionally important, we feel, as it shows that informatkm about the content and logical structure of a text, in princi-.
			pie a core requirement for higher level semantic and discourse processes, can be effectively approximated by the right mix of constituent analysis and inferences about functional relations.
	
	
			The base level linguistic analysis for actaphora resolu- tion is the output of a part of speech tagger, augmented with syntactic function annotatkms for each input to.
