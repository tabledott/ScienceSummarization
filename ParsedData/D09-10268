ct e(d) to be defined only over the topics that correspond to ,C3k is a vector consisting of the parameters of the multinomial distribution corresponding to the kth topic, &#945; are the parameters of the Dirichlet topic prior and 77 are the parameters of the word prior, while &#934;k is the label prior for topic k. For the meaning of the projection matrix L(d), please refer to Eq 1. its labels A(d).
    Since the word-topic assignments zi (see step 9 in Table 1) are drawn from this distribution, this restriction ensures that all the topic assignments are limited to the document&#8217;s labels.
    Towards this objective, we first generate the document&#8217;s labels A(d) using a Bernoulli coin toss for each topic k, with a labeling prior probability &#934;k, as shown in step 5.
    Next, we define the vector of document&#8217;s labels to be X(d) = {k|&#923;(d) k = 1}.
    This allows us to define a document-specific label projection matrix L(d) of size Md &#215; K for each document d, where Md = |X(d)|, as f
