The temporal references in meeting scheduling are somewhat more constrained than in news, where (e.g., in a historical news piece on toxic dumping) dates and times may be relatively unconstrained.
    In addition, their model requires the maintenance of a focus stack.
    They obtained roughly .91 Precision and .80 Recall on one test set, and .87 Precision and .68 Recall on another.
    However, they adjust the reference time during processing, which is something that we have not yet addressed.
    More recently, (Setzer and Gaizauskas 2000) have independently developed an annotation scheme which represents both time values and more fine-grained interevent and event-time temporal relations.
    Although our work is much more limited in scope, and doesn't exploit the internal structure of events, their annotation scheme may be leveraged in evaluating aspects of our work.
    The MUC-7 task (MUC-7 98) did not require VALs, but did test TIMEX recognition accuracy.
    Our 98 F-measure on NYT can be compared for
