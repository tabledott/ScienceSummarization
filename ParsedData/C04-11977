ion term is added, which has the effect of trying to separate the data with a thick separator (Grove and Roth, 2001; Hang et al,2002).
			In the work presented here we use this regu larization with a fixed parameter.
			Experimental evidence has shown that SNoW activations are monotonic with the confidence in the prediction.
			Therefore, it can provide a goodsource of probability estimation.
			We use soft max (Bishop, 1995) over the raw activation values as conditional probabilities, and also the score of the target.
			Specifically, suppose the number of classes is n, and the raw activation values of class i is acti.
			The posterior estimation for class i is derived by the following equation.
			score(i) = pi = e acti ? 1?j?n eactj The score plays an important role in different places.
			For example, the first phase uses the scoresto decide which argument candidates should be filtered out.
			Also, the scores output by the second phase classifier are used in the inference procedure to reason for the best
