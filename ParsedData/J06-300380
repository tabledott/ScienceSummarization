    LRA, like VSM, is a corpus-based approach to measuring relational similarity.
    Past work suggests that a hybrid approach, combining multiple modules, some corpusbased, some lexicon-based, will surpass any purebred approach (Turney et al. 2003).
    In future work, it would be natural to combine the corpus-based approach of LRA with the lexicon-based approach of Veale (2004), perhaps using the combination method of Turney et al. (2003).
    SVD is only one of many methods for handling sparse, noisy data.
    We have also experimented with Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) (Lee and Seung 1999), Probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis (PLSA) (Hofmann 1999), Kernel Principal Components Analysis (KPCA) (Scholkopf, Smola, and Muller 1997), and Iterative Scaling (IS) (Ando 2000).
    We had some interesting results with small matrices (around 2,000 rows by 1,000 columns), but none of these methods seemed substantially better than SVD and none of them scaled up to the matrix sizes we are using h
