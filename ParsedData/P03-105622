on overlaps with both nouns and verbs, so that for example they can head both NPs and VPs.
    In Chinese, on the other hand, the tag assigned to N/V-ambiguous words is determined by the external context, specifically their maximal phrase: with the exception of domination by FRAG, all nouns are immediately dominated by NP, and all verbs by VP.
    To test the impact of Chinese Treebank N/V tagging practices, we tried training the parser with NN and VV training tags merged.
    This yielded a 5.4% drop in Fl for the vanilla PCFG, and a much smaller drop of 1.7% for the refined model, suggesting at first glance that context plus correct independence assumptions can compensate for most of the distributional information gained from N/V tag priors.
    But we also tried the same experiment with the ETB using the small training set and a vanilla PCFG, and found, remarkably, practically no effect: precision increased by 0.06%, and recall decreased by 0.21%.
    Although this result calls for further investigation, w
