en removed from the input buffer but which are still considered as potential candidates for dependency links, either as heads or as dependents.
    A parser configuration is therefore defined as a triple, consisting of a stack, an input buffer, and a set of dependency arcs.
    A stack-based configuration for a sentence x = (w0, w1, ... , wn) is a triple c = (&#963;, &#946;, A), where Both the stack and the buffer will be represented as lists, although the stack will have its head (or top) to the right for reasons of perspicuity.
    Thus, &#963;|i represents a stack with top i and tail &#963;, and j|&#946; represents a buffer with head j and tail &#946;.2 We use square brackets for enumerated lists, for example, [1, 2,.. .
    , n], with [ ] for the empty list as a special case.
    A stack-based transition system is a quadruple S = (C, T, cs, Ct), where Nivre Deterministic Incremental Dependency Parsing Transitions for the arc-standard, stack-based parsing algorithm.
