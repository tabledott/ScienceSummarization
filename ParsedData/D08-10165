 that there exists a dependency link from parent i &#8212;* child j.4 Link roles, etc.
    It would be straightforward to add other variables, such as a binary variable Lij that is true iff there is a link i &#65533; j labeled with role r (e.g., AGENT, PATIENT, TEMPORAL ADJUNCT).
    We wish to define a probability distribution over all configurations, i.e., all joint assignments A to these variables.
    Our distribution is simply an undirected graphical model, or Markov random field (MRF):5 specified by the collection of factors Fm : A H R[ 'O.
    Each factor is a function that consults only a subset of A.
    We say that the factor has degree d if it depends on the values of d variables in A, and that it is unary, binary, ternary, or global if d is respectively 1, 2, 3, or unbounded (grows with n).
    A factor function Fm(A) may also depend freely on the observed variables&#8212;the input sentence W and a known (learned) parameter vector 0.
    For notational simplicity, we suppress these extra arguments
