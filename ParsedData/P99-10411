any statistical or corpus-based NLP methods.
    For example, an underlying assumption in some word sense disambiguation systems, e.g., (Dagan and Itai, 1994; Li et al., 1995; Lin, 1997), is that if two words occurred in the same context, they are probably similar.
    Suppose we want to determine the intended meaning of &amp;quot;product&amp;quot; in &amp;quot;hot product&amp;quot;.
    We can find other words that are also modified by &amp;quot;hot&amp;quot; (e.g., &amp;quot;hot car&amp;quot;) and then choose the meaning of &amp;quot;product&amp;quot; that is most similar to meanings of these words.
    However, this method fails when non-compositional expressions are involved.
    For instance, using the same algorithm to determine the meaning of &amp;quot;line&amp;quot; in &amp;quot;hot line&amp;quot;, the words &amp;quot;product&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;merchandise&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;car&amp;quot;, etc., would lead the algorithm to choose the &amp;quot;line of product&amp;quot; sense of &amp;quot;line&amp;
