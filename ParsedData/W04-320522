f identifying the preferred semantic relation both jump to 68.2% accuracy.
    Also, the overall accuracy of the system climbs to 68.5%.
    As described in Section 2, WordNet contains verb semantic relations.
    A significant percentage of our discovered relations are not covered by WordNet's coarser classifications.
    Of the 40 verb pairs whose system relation was tagged as correct by both judges in our accuracy experiments and whose tag was not `no relation', only 22.5% of them existed in a WordNet relation.
    The experience of extracting these semantic relations has clarified certain important challenges.
    While relying on a search engine allows us to query a corpus of nearly a trillion words, some issues arise: (i) the number of instances has to be approximated by the number of hits (documents); (ii) the number of hits for the same query may fluctuate over time; and (iii) some needed counts are not directly available.
    We addressed the latter issue by approximating these counts using a smaller
