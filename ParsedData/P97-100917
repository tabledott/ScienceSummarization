lationships in which the head or the modifier is a noun.
    We then filtered out (lc, word) pairs with a likelihood ratio lower than 5 (an arbitrary threshold).
    The resulting database contains 354,670 local contexts with a total of 1,067,451 words in them (Table 1 is counted as one local context with 20 words in it).
    Since the local context database is constructed from WSJ corpus which are mostly business news, we only used the &amp;quot;press reportage&amp;quot; part of SemCor which consists of 7 files with about 2000 words each.
    Furthermore, we only applied our algorithm to nouns.
    Table 3 shows the results on 2,832 polysemous nouns in SemCor.
    This number also includes proper nouns that do not contain simple markers (e.g., Mr., Inc.) to indicate its category.
    Such a proper noun is treated as a 3-way ambiguous word: person, organization, or location.
    We also showed as a baseline the performance of the simple strategy of always choosing the first sense of a word in the WordNet.
