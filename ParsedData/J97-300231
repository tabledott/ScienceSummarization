 Wu 1994; Wu and Fung 1994), followed by an EM word-translation-learning procedure (Wu and Xia 1994).
    The latter stage gives us the probabilities directly.
    For the two singleton productions, which permit any word in either sentence to be unmatched, a small &amp;constant can be chosen for the probabilities b1, and b1, so that the optimal bracketing resorts to these productions only when it is otherwise impossible to match the singletons.
    The parameter a here is of no practical effect, and is chosen to be very small relative to the by probabilities of lexical translation pairs.
    The result is that the maximum-likelihood parser selects the parse tree that best meets the combined lexical translation preferences, as expressed by the by probabilities.
    Pre-/post positional biases.
    Many bracketing errors are caused by singletons.
    With singletons, there is no cross-lingual discrimination to increase the certainty between alternative bracketings.
    A heuristic to deal with this is to specif
