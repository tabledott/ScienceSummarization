  Introduction To The Special Issue On The Web As Corpus
  
  
    The Web, teeming as it is with language data, of all manner of varieties and languages, in vast quantity and freely available, is a fabulous linguists&#8217; playground.
    This special issue of Computational Linguistics explores ways in which this dream is being explored.
  
  
    The Web is immense, free, and available by mouse click.
    It contains hundreds of billions of words of text and can be used for all manner of language research.
    The simplest language use is spell checking.
    Is it speculater or speculator?
    Google gives 67 for the former (usefully suggesting the latter might have been intended) and 82,000 for the latter.
    Question answered.
    Language scientists and technologists are increasingly turning to the Web as a source of language data, because it is so big, because it is the only available source for the type of language in which they are interested, or simply because it is free and instantly available.
