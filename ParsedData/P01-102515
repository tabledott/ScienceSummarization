educe the amount of manual work when the complete data set has to be evaluated, which is a precondition for the exact calculation of recall and for plotting precision curves.
    The major drawback of an approach where all low-frequency candidates are excluded is that a large part of the data is lost for collocation extraction.
    In our data, for instance, 80% of the full set of PNV data and 58% of the AdjN data are hapaxes.
    Thus it is important to know how many (and which) true collocations there are among the excluded low-frequency candidates.
    In this section, we estimate the number of collocations in the data excluded from our experiments (i.e., AdjN pairs with and PNV triples with ).
    Because of the large number of candidates in those sets (6 435 for AdjN, 279 880 for PNV), manual inspection of the entire data is impractical.
    Therefore, we use random samples from the candidate sets to obtain estimates for the proportion of true collocations among the low-frequency data.
    We randomly se
