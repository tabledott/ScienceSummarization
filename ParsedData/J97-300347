 required to prepare the training lexicon is minimal and does not require any additional manual annotation.
    Our experiments with the lexicon derived from the CELEX lexical database and word frequencies derived from the Brown Corpus resulted in guessing rule sets that proved to be domain- and corpus-independent (but tag-set-dependent), producing similar results on texts of different origins.
    An interesting by-product of the proposed rule-induction technique is the automatic discovery of the template morphological rules advocated in Mikheev and Liubushkina (1995).
    The induced morphological guessing rules turned out to consist mostly of the expected prefixes and suffixes of English and closely resemble the rules employed by the ispell UNIX spell-checker.
    The rule acquisition and evaluation methods described here are implemented as a modular set of c++ and AWK tools, and the guesser is easily extendible to sublanguage-specific regularities and retrainable to new tag sets and other languages, provi
