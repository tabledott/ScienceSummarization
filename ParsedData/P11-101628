 only information on the current tweet for sentiment classification, we propose to take the related tweets of the current tweet into consideration by utilizing graph-based optimization.
    According to the experimental results, the graph-based optimization significantly improves the performance.
    As mentioned in Section 4.1, in future we would like to explore the relations between a target and any of its extended targets.
    We are also interested in exploring relations between Twitter accounts for classifying the sentiments of the tweets published by them.
