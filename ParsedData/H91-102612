- freq(house, chambre) c = freq(chambre) - freq(house, chambre) d=N-a -b -c Table 2: A Contingency Table chambre house 31,950 12,004 4,793 848,330 We can now measure the association between house and chambre by making use of any one of a number of association measures such as mutual information.
  ~b 2, a g2-like statistic, seems to be a particularly good choice because it makes good use of the off-diagonal cells b andc.
  ?~ 2 = ( ad - be) 2 (a + b) (a + c) (b+ d) (c + d) 02 is bounded between 0 and 1.
  In this case, 02 is 0.62, a relatively high value, indicating the two words are strongly associated, and that they may be translations of one another.
  One can make this argument more rigorous by measuring the confidence that ~2 is different from chance (zero).
  In this case, the variance of ~b z is estimated to be 2.5x10 -5 (see the section "Calculation of Variances"), and hence t = ?~2/~4(var(~2)) = 0.62/~2.5x10 -5 = 123.
  With such a large t, we can very confidently reject he null hypothesis and assume
