n could be used to understand that 'Fords' means &amp;quot;cars whose CAR-MANUFACTURER is Ford&amp;quot; (in Lakoff and Johnson's terms, this is an example of a PRODUCER FOR PRODUCT metonymic concept).
    Grosz et al. (1987) note a similarity between coercion (i.e., metonymy) and modification in noun-noun compounds, and use &amp;quot;modification relations&amp;quot; to decide whether, e.g., &amp;quot;U.S. ships&amp;quot; means &amp;quot;ships of U.S. registry&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;ships whose destination is the U.S.&amp;quot; Hobbs and Martin (1987) and Stallard (1987) also discuss the relationship between metonymy and nominal compounds.
    Hobbs and Martin treat the two phenomena as twin problems of reference resolution in their TACITUS system.
    They argue that resolving reference requires finding a knowledge base entity for an entity mentioned in discourse (i.e., what that entity refers to), and suggest that the resolution of metonymy and nominal compounds both require discovering an implicit relation
