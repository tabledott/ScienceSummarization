nd fusing them into a single coherent sentence.
    Recognizing similar semantic content is also critical for text simplification systems (Marsi and Krahmer 2005b).
    Information extraction enables the detection of regularities of information structure&#8212;events which are reported many times, about different individuals and in different forms&#8212;and making them explicit so that they can be processed and used in other ways.
    Sekine (2006) shows how to use paraphrase recognition to cluster together extraction patterns to improve the cohesion of the extracted information.
    Another recently proposed natural language processing task is that of recognizing textual entailment: A piece of text T is said to entail a hypothesis H if humans reading T will infer that H is most likely true.
    The observant reader will notice that, in this sense, the task of paraphrase recognition can simply be formulated as bidirectional entailment recognition.
    The task of recognizing entailment is an application-indep
