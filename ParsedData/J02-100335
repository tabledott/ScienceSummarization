 the order of nnl a .
    To avoid intractability, the algorithm can be pruned.
    No matter where this is done, the result is a polynomial algorithm.
    By cutting off after Phase 1, for example, only (negations of) atomic properties are combined, producing such descriptions as the black dog that is not a poodle, disregarding more complex descriptions; as a result, completeness is lost, but only for references to nonsingleton sets, because set union does not add descriptive power where the description of singletons is concerned.
    The number of properties to be considered by this simpler algorithm equals (na)2 + 2na &#8722;1.
    To produce descriptions like WHITE n (CAT U DOG) (i.e., white (cats and dogs)) as well, the algorithm can be cut off one phase later, leading to a worst-case running time of O(n3a), and so on for more and more complex descriptions.
    D&amp;RBoolea can, of course, be modified to take advantage of the distinction between Attributes and Values.
    Suppose, for example, that V1 U
