(Central Nervous System Diseases) and so on.
    We use the MeSH hierarchy for generalization across classes of nouns; we use it instead of the other resources in the UMLS primarily because of MeSH&#8217;s hierarchical structure.
    For these experiments, we considered only those noun compounds for which both nouns can be mapped into MeSH terms, resulting in a total of 2245 NCs.
  
  
    Because we have defined noun compound relation determination as a classification problem, we can make use of standard classification algorithms.
    In particular, we used neural networks to classify across all relations simultaneously. shown in boldface are those used in the experiments reported on here.
    Relation ID numbers are shown in parentheses by the relation names.
    The second column shows the number of labeled examples for each class; the last row shows a class consisting of compounds that exhibit more than one relation.
    The notation (1-2) and (2-1) indicates the directionality of the relations.
