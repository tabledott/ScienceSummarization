from our preliminary analysis.
    In many cases, such as read which was classified both by the judges, and the system as a negative candidate, the predominant sense of the verb provides the majority of the data.
    Alternate senses, for example, The book reads well, often do not contribute enough data so as to give rise to a large proportion of errors.
    Finding an appropriate inventory of senses would be difficult, since we would not wish to separate related senses which occur as alternate variants of one another.
    The inventory would therefore require knowledge of the phenomena that we are endeavouring to acquire automatically.
    To show that our method will work for other RSAS, we use the conative.
    Our sample size is rather small since we are limited by the number of positive candidates in the corpus having sufficient frequency for both scFs.
    The sparse data problem is acute when we look at alternations with specific prepositions.
    A sample of 12 verbs (6 positive and 6 negative) remain
