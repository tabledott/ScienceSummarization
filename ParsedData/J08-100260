entry is assigned to a verb, all of the argument dependencies of the verb are counted as errors.
    The numbers in the table include such double-counting.
    Figure 25 shows examples of disambiguation errors.
    The figure shows output from the parser.
    Major causes are classified into three types: attachment ambiguity, argument/ modifier distinction, and lexical ambiguity.
    As attachment ambiguities are well-known error sources, PP-attachment is the largest source of errors in our evaluation.
    Our disambiguation model cannot accurately resolve PP-attachment ambiguities because it does not include dependencies among a modifiee and the argument of the preposition.
    Because previous studies revealed that such dependencies are effective features for PP-attachment resolution, we should incorporate them into our model.
    Some of the attachment ambiguities, including adjective and adverb, should also be resolved with an extension of features.
    However, we cannot identify any effective features f
