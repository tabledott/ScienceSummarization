to synchronized dependency trees) if these conditions hold: Nonoverlap: If w1 w2, then f (wi) f(w2), and similarly, if 01 0 02, then/ (vi) f' (02).
    Synchronization: if f(w) =- v and v &#8364;, then f(g(w)) = h(o), and f' (v) = w. Similarly, if f' (v) w and w e, then f'(h(v)) = g(w), and f(w) = v. Phrase contiguity: The image under f of the maximal substring dominated by a headword w is a contiguous segment of the target string.
    (Here w and v refer to word tokens not symbols (types).
    We hope that the context of discussion will make the type-token distinction clear in the rest of this article.)
    The hierarchical alignment in Figure 6 is synchronized.
    Of course, translations of phrases are not always transparently related by a hierarchical alignment.
    In cases where the mapping between a source and target phrase is unclear (for example, one of the phrases might be an idiom), then the most reasonable choice of hierarchical alignment may be for f and f to link the heads of the phrases only, a
