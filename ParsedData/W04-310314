y sentences as abstracts since only the last two sentences where annotated.
    The annotation of each sentence was performed in the context of its abstract.
    This was true even when only the last two sentences where annotated.
    The annotation guidelines in the appendix were used by all annotators.
    In addition, at the start of the experiment general issues were discussed but none of the specific examples in the sets a-f. We worked with three categories Low Speculative, High Speculative, and Definite.
    All sentences were annotated with one of these.
    The general idea behind the low speculative level was that the authors expressed a statement in such a way that it is clear that it follows almost directly from results but not quite.
    There is a small leap of faith.
    A high speculative statement would contain a more dramatic leap from the results mentioned in the abstract.
    Our inter-annotator agreement results are expressed in the following four tables.
    The first table contains value
