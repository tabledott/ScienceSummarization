in linear time (Ciaramita et al., 2008).
    This can give a significant boost to the adoption of this technology in real-world applications.
    &#8226; We hope that this shared task will motivate several important research directions.
    For example, is the dependency-based representation better for SRL than the constituent-based formalism?
    Does joint learning improve syntactic and semantic analysis?
    &#8226; Surface (string related patterns, syntax, etc.) linguistic features can often be detected with greater reliability than deep (semantic) features.
    In contrast, deep features can cover more ground because they regularize across differences in surface strings.
    Machine learning systems can be more effective by using evidence from both deep and surface features jointly (Zhao, 2005).
    Even though this shared task was more complex than the previous shared tasks, 22 different teams submitted results in at least one of the challenges.
    Building on this success, we hope to expand this effor
