 using this data and are working toward making these materials available to the research community.
    Given the growing interest in corpus studies, it seems timely to devote an issue of CL to this topic.
    In Section 1, we review the experience of the speech recognition community.
    Stochastic methods based on Shannon's noisy channel model have become the methods of choice within the speech community.
    Knowledge-based approaches were tried during the first DARPA speech recognition project in the early 1970s, but have largely been abandoned in favor of stochastic approaches that have become the main focus of DARPA's more recent efforts.
    In Section 2, we discuss how this experience is influencing the language community.
    Many of the most successful speech techniques are achieving major improvements in performance in the language area.
    In particular, probabilistic taggers based on Shannon's noisy channel model are becoming the method of choice because they correctly tag 95% of the words in a
