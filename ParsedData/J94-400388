 two characteristics of the ambiguity phenomena, namely the sparseness and redundancy of the disambiguating data.
    By sparseness we mean that within the large space of alternative interpretations produced by ambiguous utterances, only a small portion is commonly used.
    Therefore, the chance that an inappropriate interpretation is observed in the corpus (in other contexts) is low.
    Redundancy relates to the fact that different informants (such as different lexical relations or deep understanding) tend to support rather than contradict one another, and therefore the chance of picking a &amp;quot;wrong&amp;quot; informant is low.
    It is interesting to compare our method with some aspects of the statistical machine translation system of Brown et al. (1990).
    As mentioned in the introduction, this system also incorporates target language statistics in the translation process.
    To translate a French sentence, f, they choose the English sentence, e, that maximizes the term Pr(e) &#8226; Pr (f e).
