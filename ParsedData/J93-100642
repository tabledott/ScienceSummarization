ne starts at the root, and follows the branch corresponding to its first character to another node.
    From there, the branch for the second character is followed to a third node, and so on, until either the whole string has been matched, or it has been discovered not to be in the set.
    If it is in the set, then the node reached after matching its last character contains whatever information the structure contains for it.
    The economy of the scheme lies in the fact that a node containing information about a string also serves as a point on the way to longer strings of which the given one is a prefix.
    In this application, two items of information are stored with a string, namely the number of textual words in which it occurs as a prefix and as a suffix.
    There is a function from potential break points in words to numbers whose value is maximized to choose the best point at which to break.
    If p and s are the potential prefix and suffix, respectively, and P(p) and S(s) are the number of words i
