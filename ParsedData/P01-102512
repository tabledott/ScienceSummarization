 show, log-likelihood is obviously the best measure.
    It is followed by t-test, , frequency and in this order.
    Frequency and approximate when 50% of the data in the SLs are examined.
    In the remaining part of the lists, yields better results than frequency and is practically identical to the best-performing measures.
    Surprisingly, the precision curves of and in particular increase over the first 60% of the SLs for high-frequency PNV data, whereas the curves for t-test, log-likelihood, and frequency have the usual downward slope (see Figure 6).
    Log-likelihood achieves precision values above 50% for the first 10% of the list, but is outperformed by the t-test afterwards.
    Looking at the first 40% of the data, there is a big gap between the good measures (t-test, log-likelihood, and frequency) and the weak measures ( and ).
    In the second half of the data in the SLs, however, there is virtually no difference between , , and the other measures, with the exception of mere co-occurrence freq
