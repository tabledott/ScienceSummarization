			In other cases, however, the cor relation is not so clear-cut.
			For example by has one of the smallest data sets in training but higher scores than many of the other prepositions, whilefor is notable for the opposite reason, namely hav ing a large dataset but some of the lowest scores.
			The absence of a definite relation between dataset size and performance suggests that theremight be a cline of ?learnability?
			for these prepo sitions: different prepositions?
			contexts may be more or less uniquely identifiable, or they mayhave more or fewer senses, leading to less confusion for the classifier.
			One simple way of verify ing the latter case is by looking at the number of senses assigned to the prepositions by a resource 171 Target prep Confused with at by for from in of on to with at xx 4.65% 10.82% 2.95% 36.83% 19.46% 9.17% 10.28% 5.85% by 6.54% xx 8.50% 2.58% 41.38% 19.44% 5.41% 10.04% 6.10% for 8.19% 3.93% xx 1.91% 25.67% 36.12% 5.60% 11.29% 7.28% from 6.19% 4.14% 6.72%
