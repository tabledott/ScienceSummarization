r the empty nodes that were originally present, and reinsert the relevant empty nodes.
    This blocks the matching of shallower patterns, reducing their match values and hence raising their success probability.
    (Undoubtedly the &#8220;count&#8221; values are also over-estimated in the same way; however, experiments showed that estimating count values in a similar manner to the way in which match values are estimated reduces the algorithm&#8217;s performance).
    Finally, we rank all of the remaining patterns.
    We experimented with several different ranking criteria, including pattern depth, success probability (i.e., c/m) and discounted success probability.
    Perhaps surprisingly, all produced similiar results on the development corpus.
    We used pattern depth as the ranking criterion to produce the results reported below because it ensures that &#8220;deep&#8221; patterns receive a chance to apply.
    For example, this ensures that the pattern inserting an empty NP * and WHNP can apply before t
