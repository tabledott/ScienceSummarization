and finally, the agreement between human judges was lower than in our previous experiments.
    We are currently exploring whether the information produced by the two different systems may be combined to improve the performance of either system alone.
    Another view on the extracted paraphrases can be derived by comparing them with the WordNet thesaurus.
    This comparison provides us with quantitative evidence on the types of lexical relations people use to create paraphrases.
    We selected 112 paraphrasing pairs which occurred at least 20 times in our corpus and such that the words comprising each pair appear in WordNet.
    The 20 times cutoff was chosen to ensure that the identified pairs are general enough and not idiosyncratic.
    We use the frequency threshold to select paraphrases which are not tailored to one context.
    Examples of paraphrases and their WordNet relations are shown in Figure 7.
    Only 40(35%) paraphrases are synonyms, 36(32%) are hyperonyms, 20(18%) are siblings in the hyper
