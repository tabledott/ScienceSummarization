e success of a bitext mapping algorithm hinges on how well it performs three tasks: signal generation, noise filtering, and search.
    The Smooth Injective Map Recognizer (SIMR) algorithm presented here integrates innovative approaches to each of these tasks.
    Objective evaluation has shown that SIMR's accuracy is consistently high for language pairs as diverse as French/English and Korean/English.
    If necessary, SIMR's bitext maps can be efficiently converted into segment alignments using the Geometric Segment Alignment (GSA) algorithm, which is also presented here.
    SIMR has produced bitext maps for over 200 megabytes of French-English bitexts.
    GSA has converted these maps into alignments.
    Both the maps and the alignments are available from the Linguistic Data Consortium.'
