en the humans and the best features is .51 for NL and .55 for VDND.
    An ANOVA yielded a significant effect of feature type (F(9,99) = 5.213; p &lt; 0.01).
    Post-hoc Tukey tests revealed that VL, VT, VD, ND, AD, VLNL, and VTNL perform significantly worse than HH (a = 0.01), whereas NL and VDND are not significantly different from HH (a = 0.01).
    This is in agreement with Experiment 1 and points to the importance of lexical and structural information for the ordering task.
    Barzilay et al. (2002) collected a corpus of multiple orderings in order to study what makes an order cohesive.
    Their goal was to improve the ordering strategy of MULTIGEN (McKeown et al., 1999) a multidocument summarization system that operates on news articles describing the same event.
    MULTIGEN identifies text units that convey similar information across documents and clusters them into themes.
    Each theme is next syntactically analysed into predicate argument structures; the structures that are repeated often enoug
