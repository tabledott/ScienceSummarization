election model conditioned on the structural parse context.
    The output of the parser can be displayed as syntactic trees, and/or factored into a sequence of bilexical grammatical relations (GRs) between lexical heads and their dependents.
    The full system can be extended in a variety of ways &#8211; for example, by pruning PoS tags but allowing multiple tag possibilities per word as input to the parser, by incorporating lexical subcategorization into parse selection, by computing GR weights based on the proportion and probability of the n-best analyses yielding them, and so forth &#8211; broadly trading accuracy and greater domaindependence against speed and reduced sensitivity to domain-specific lexical behaviour (Briscoe and Carroll, 2002; Carroll and Briscoe, 2002; Watson et al., 2005; Watson, 2006).
    However, in this paper we focus exclusively on the baseline unlexicalized system.
    The grammar is expressed in a feature-based, unification formalism.
