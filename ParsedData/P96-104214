to best choose a prior for this problem.
    This basic algorithm needs no parameters.
    If desired, it is possible to tune the frequency of selection, by changing the variance of P(MIS) (or the variance of P(ai = a IS) for each parameter), where larger variances increase the rate of disagreement among the committee members.
    We implemented this effect by employing a temperature parameter t, used as a multiplier of the variance of the posterior parameter distribution.
    A more general algorithm results from allowing (i) a larger number of committee members, k, in order to sample P(MIS) more precisely, and (ii) more refined example selection criteria.
    This gives the following general sequential selection algorithm, executed for each unlabeled input example e: It is easy to see that two member sequential selection is a special case of general sequential selection, where any disagreement is considered sufficient for selection.
    In order to instantiate the general algorithm for larger committees, we
