e bootstrapping process away from ambiguous parts of the search space.
    We will use the abbreviation 1CAT to indicate that only one semantic category was bootstrapped, and MCAT to indicate that multiple semantic categories were simultaneously bootstrapped.
    Figure 6 compares the performance of Basilisk-MCAT with conflict resolution (ba-M) against Basilisk-1CAT (ba-1).
    Most categories show small performance gains, with the BUILDING, LOCATION, and WEAPON categories benefitting the most.
    However, the improvement usually doesn&#8217;t kick in until many bootstrapping iterations have passed.
    This phenomenon is consistent with the visualization of the search space in Figure 5.
    Since the seed words for each category are not generally located near each other in the search space, the bootstrapping process is unaffected by conflict resolution until the categories begin to encroach on each other&#8217;s territories.
