    This suggests that SCF should be used in conjunction with standard features to boost their classification performance.
  
  
    The aim of our experiments are twofold: On the one hand, we study if the PAF representation produces an accuracy higher than standard features.
    On the other hand, we study if SCF can be used to classify verbs according to their syntactic realization.
    Both the above aims can be carried out by combining PAF and SCF with the standard features.
    For this purpose we adopted two ways to combine kernels3: (1) K = K1 &#183; K2 and (2) K = -yK1 + K2.
    The resulting set of kernels used in the experiments is the following: tween the normalized4 PAF-based kernel and the normalized polynomial kernel.
    KPAF&#183;Kpd i.e. the normalized |KPAF|&#183;|Kpd|, product between the PAF-based kernel and the polynomial kernel. tion between the normalized SCF-based kernel and the normalized polynomial kernel.
    KSCF&#183;Kpd |KSCF|&#183;|Kpd|, i.e. the normalized product between
