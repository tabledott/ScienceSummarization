ture) is produced, the results are ordered by preferring trees with the minimum unused number of input elements and the minimum number of remaining unsatisfied subgoals.
    The best tree is then traversed in left-to-right order; leaves provide input to Penman to be generated in English and relations at branch points provide typical interclausal relation words or phrases.
    In this way the structurer performs top-down goal refinement down to the level of the input elements.
  
  
    This work is also being tested in a completely separate domain: the generation of text in a multimedia system that answers database queries.
    Penman produces the following description of the ship Knox (where CTG 070.10 designates a group of ships): (c).
    Knox is en route in order to rendezvous with CTG 070.10, arriving in Pearl Harbor on 4/24, for port visit until 4/30.
    In this text, each clause (en route, rendezvous, arrive, visit) is a separate input element; the structurer linked them using the relations Sequence a
