vised training using the additional one-sense-per-discourse constraint frequently exceeds this value.
    Column 11 shows the performance of Schiitze's unsupervised algorithm applied to some of these words, trained on a New York Times News Service corpus.
    Our algorithm exceeds this accuracy on each word, with an average relative performance of 97% vs. 92%.12
  
  
    This algorithm exhibits a fundamental advantage over supervised learning algorithms (including Black (1988), Hearst (1991), Gale et al. (1992), Yarowsky (1993, 1994), Leacock et al.
    (1993), Bruce and Wiebe (1994), and Lehman (1994)), as it does not require costly hand-tagged training sets.
    It thrives on raw, unannotated monolingual corpora &#8212; the more the merrier.
    Although there is some hope from using aligned bilingual corpora as training data for supervised algorithms (Brown et al., 1991), this approach suffers from both the limited availability of such corpora, and the frequent failure of bilingual translation differences
