    We believe this is because these frequency count based' models cannot easily incorporate non-independent and overlapping features, which are extremely useful in describing the translation process.
    Discriminative models of translation can include such features without making assumptions of independence or explicitly modelling their interdependence.
    However, while discriminative models promise much, they have not been shown to deliver significant gains 'We class approaches using minimum error rate training (Och, 2003) frequency count based as these systems re-scale a handful of generative features estimated from frequency counts and do not support large sets of non-independent features. over their simpler cousins.
    We argue that this is due to a number of inherent problems that discriminative models for SMT must address, in particular the problems of spurious ambiguity and degenerate solutions.
    These occur when there are many ways to translate a source sentence to the same target sentence b
