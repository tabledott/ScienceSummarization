roximate recall, we defined a relative recall measure and conducted a question answering (QA) task of answering defi nition questions.
			5.3.1 Relative recall Although it is impossible to know the number of is-a relationships in any non-trivial corpus, it is possible to compute the recall of a system relative to another system?s recall.
			The recall of a system A, RA, is given by the following formula: C C R AA = where CA is the number of correct is-a relation ships extracted by A and C is the total number of correct is-a relationships in the corpus.
			We define relative recall of system A given system B, RA,B, as: B A B A BA C C R R R == ,Using the precision estimates, PA, from the pre vious section, we can estimate CA ? PA ? |A|, where A is the total number of is-a relationships discov ered by system A. Hence, BP AP R B A BA ? ?
			= ,Figure 3 shows the relative recall of A = pattern based approach relative to B = co-occurrence model.
			Because of sparse data, the pattern-based approach has much higher
