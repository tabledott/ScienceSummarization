ltiple sources of information, including syntactic knowledge, context, and statistics learned from corpus analysis.
    It improves the conciseness of extracted sentences, making them concise and on target.
    Our sentence combination module implements combination rules that were identified by observing examples written by human professionals.
    It improves the coherence of extracted sentences. sentences.
    The cut and paste technique we propose here is a new computational model which we based on analysis of human-written abstracts.
    To do this analysis, we developed an automatic system that can match a phrase in a human-written abstract to the corresponding phrase in the article, identifying its most likely location.
    This decomposition program allows us to analyze the construction of sentences in a human-written abstract.
    Its results have been used to train and test the sentence reduction and sentence combination module.
    In Section 2, we discuss the cut and paste technique in general, fro
