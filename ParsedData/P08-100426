mbined method yielded improvements over the best individual learner for all but one relation.
    The efficacy of ensemble-based methods for extraction was further investigated by (Sigletos et al., 2005), who experimented with combining the outputs of a rule-based learner, a Hidden Markov Model and a wrapperinduction algorithm in five different domains.
    Of a variety ensemble-based methods, stacking proved to consistently outperform the best base-level system, obtaining more precise results at the cost of somewhat lower recall.
    (Feldman et al., 2005) demonstrated that a hybrid extractor composed of a statistical and knowledge-based models outperform either in isolation.
  
  
    Our experiments have demonstrated the promise of relation-independent extraction using the Open IE paradigm.
    We have shown that binary relationships can be categorized using a compact set of lexicosyntactic patterns, and presented O-CRF, a CRFbased Open IE system that can extract different relationships with a precision of
