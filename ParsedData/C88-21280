  A Uniform Architecture for Parsing and Generation Stuart M. SHIEBER Artificial Intelligence Center SRI International Menlo Park, California, USA* Abst rac t The use of a single grammar for both parsing and generation is an idea with a certain elegance, the desirability of which several researchers have noted.
  In this paper, we discuss a more radical possibility: not only can a single grammar be used by different processes engaged in various "directions" of processing, but one and the same language-processing archi- tecture can be used for processing the grammar in the various modes.
  In particular, parsing and generation can be viewed as two processes engaged in by a single parameterized theo- rem pr6ver for the logical interpretation f the formalism.
  We discuss our current implementation f such an architecture, which is parameterized in such a way that it can be used for either purpose with grammars written in the PATR formal- ism.
  Furthermore, the architecture allows fine tuning to re- flect diffe
