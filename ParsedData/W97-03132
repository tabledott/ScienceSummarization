 context of a restricted domain, many polysemous words have a strong preference for one word sense, so knowing the most probable word sense in a domain can strongly constrain the ambiguity.
    We have been experimenting with a corpusbased method for building semantic lexicons semiautomatically.
    Our system uses a text corpus and a small set of seed words for a category to identify other words that also belong to the category.
    The algorithm uses simple statistics and a bootstrapping mechanism to generate a ranked list of potential category words.
    A human then reviews the top words and selects the best ones for the dictionary.
    Our approach is geared toward fast semantic lexicon construction: given a handful of seed words for a category and a representative text corpus, one can build a semantic lexicon for a category in just a few minutes.
    In the first section, we describe the statistical bootstrapping algorithm for identifying candidate category words and ranking them.
    Next, we describe
