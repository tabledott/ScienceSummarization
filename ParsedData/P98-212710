es of WordNet and Roget (Figure 2).
    The similarity measure simwN is based on the proposal in (Lin, 1997).
    The similarity measure sim --Roget treats all the words in Roget as features.
    A word w possesses the feature f if f and w belong to a same Roget category.
    The similarity between two words is then defined as the cosine coefficient of the two feature vectors.
    With simwN and siMRoget, we transform WordNet and Roget into the same format as the automatically constructed thesauri in the previous section.
    We now discuss how to measure the similarity between two thesaurus entries.
    Suppose two thesaurus entries for the same word are as follows: For example, (5) is the entry for &amp;quot;brief (noun)&amp;quot; in our automatically generated thesaurus and (6) and (7) are corresponding entries in WordNet thesaurus and Roget thesaurus.
    (5) brief (noun): affidavit 0.13, petition 0.05, memorandum 0.05, motion 0.05, lawsuit 0.05, deposition 0.05, slight 0.05, prospectus 0.04, document 0.0
