ributive properties if these are upgraded to the level of sets: Let a newfangled distributive property be true of a set iff the property (in ordinary parlance) is true of all its elements (Kamp and Reyle 1993, page 338).
    This requires that the target S is always cast as a set of sets, even if it is viewed distributively.
    For example, if a set of players&#8212;say, a, b, and c&#8212;are to be characterized as a collection (e.g., to say that they won as a team of three), then S = {{a, b, c}}; if they are to be characterized distributively (e.g., to say that each of them has the flu), then S = {{a, b, c}, {a, b}, {a, c}, {b, c}, {a}, {b}, {c}}.
    In this way, the algorithm is able to combine collective and distributive properties, as in those football teams whose members are British.
    We will not explore collective versions of the Incremental Algorithm further here, focusing instead on the relatively simple case of D&amp;RPlural, in which all properties are distributive.
    As in the case of D&amp;
