    )], where p(PPADvIA=Aw) and p(PADJIA=Aw) represent the conditional probabilities of the adverbial and adjectival attachments, respectively.
    The attribute with the lowest overall heterogeneity is selected for the decision tree expansion.
    In the following example (Figure 2) we Classification in this case means deciding whether the PP is adjectival or averbial.
    Verbs of all the node quadruples belong to the WordNet class V. nouns to the class N and descriptions p.the class D. We assume, in this example, that the WordNet hierarchy class V has three subclasses (VI, V2, V3), class N has two subclasses (NI, N2) and class D has also two subclasses (DI, D2)8.
    We use the values Vi, V2 and V3, NI and N2, and Dl and 132 as potential values of the attribute A. Splitting by verb results in three subnodes with
