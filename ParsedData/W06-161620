nstraints?
    We ran the system without any linguistic constraints as a baseline (bl) and compared it to a system with the additional constraints (cnstr).
    To evaluate our systems we use the accuracy over labelled attachment decisions: where Nl is the number of tokens with correct head and label and Nt is the total number of tokens.
    For completeness we also report the unlabelled accuracy: where Nu is the number of tokens with correct head. curacy using nine-fold cross-validation on cross for baseline (bl) and constraint-based (constr) system.
    LC and UC are the percentages of sentences with 100% labelled and unlabelled accuracy, respectively.
    Table 1 shows our results using nine-fold crossvalidation on the cross set.
    The baseline system (no additional constraints) gives an unlabelled accuracy of 84.6% and labelled accuracy of 88.9%.
    When we add our linguistic constraints the performance increases by 0.5% for both labelled and unlabelled accuracy.
    This increase is significant (p &lt;
