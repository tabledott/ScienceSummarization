ning parallel text on the World Wide Web,first reviewing the original algorithm and results and then presenting a set of significant enhancements.
    These enhancements include the use of supervised learning based on structural features of documents to improve classification performance, a new contentbased measure of translational equivalence, and adaptation of the system to take advantage of the Internet Archive for mining parallel text from the Web on a large scale.
    Finally, the value of these techniques is demonstrated in the construction of a significant parallel corpus for a low-density language pair.
  
  
    Parallel corpora&#8212;bodies of text in parallel translation, also known as bitexts&#8212;have taken on an important role in machine translation and multilingual natural language processing.
    They represent resources for automatic lexical acquisition (e.g., Gale and Church 1991; Melamed 1997), they provide indispensable training data for statistical translation models (e.g., Brown et al.
