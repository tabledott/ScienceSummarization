 of which contains all the rules with the same French side and left-hand side.
    From here on, let us Inference rules for the +LM parser.
    Here w[x/X] means the string w with the string x substituted for the symbol X.
    The function q is defined in the text. consider the item scores as costs, that is, negative log (base-10) probabilities.
    Then, for each cell, we throw out any item that has a score worse than: In the +LM parser, the score of an item [X, i, j; e] in the chart does not reflect the LM probability of generating the first (m &#8722; 1) words of e. Thus two items [X, i, j; e] and [X, i, j; e'] are not directly comparable.
    To enable more meaningful comparisons, we define a heuristic When comparing items for pruning (and only for pruning), we add this heuristic function to the score of each item.
    5.3.4 Cube Pruning.
    Now we can develop a compromise between the rescoring and intersection methods.
    Consider Figure 9a.
    To the left of the grid we have four rules with the same
