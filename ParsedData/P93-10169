n its context, in terms of L-marking and inheritance.
    Instead of making barrierhood a property of the nodes in syntactic structures, we define it to be a property of links in the grammar network.
    That is, certain links in the grammar network are classified as barriers.
    In Figure 1, barrier links have a black ink-spot on them.
    Barrierhood is a property of these links, independent of the context.
    This definition of barrier is simpler than Chomsky's since it is context-free.
    In our experiments so far, this simpler definition has been found to be adequate.
    Government Once the notion of barrier has been defined, the government relationship between two nodes in a structure can be defined as follows: government: A governs B if A is the minimal governor that m-commands B via a sequence of non-barrier links, where governors are N, V, P, A, and tensed I.
    Items representing governors are assigned +govern attribute.
    This attribute percolates across head dominance links.
    If an item
