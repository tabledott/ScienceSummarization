er some situations, the generalization error decreases exponentially with the number of queries.
    On the experimental side, active learning has been applied to several different problems.
    Lewis &amp; Gale (1994), Lewis &amp; Catlett (1994) and Liere &amp; Tadepalli (1997) all applied it to text categorization; Engelson &amp; Dagan (1996) applied it to part-of-speech tagging.
    Each approach has its own way of determining uncertainty in examples.
    Lewis &amp; Gale used a probabilistic classifier and picked the examples e whose class-conditional a posteriori probability P(Cie) is closest to 0.5 (for a 2-class problem).
    Engelson &amp; Dagan implemented a committee of learners, and used vote entropy to pick examples which had the highest disagreement among the learners.
    In addition, Engelson &amp; Dagan also investigate several different selection techniques in depth.
    To our knowledge, this paper constitutes the first work to apply active learning to base noun phrase chunking, or to apply
