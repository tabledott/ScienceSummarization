ver, subdividing a category like NP into 30 or 60 subcategories can only provide a very limited representation of phrase meaning and semantic similarity.
    Two strands of work therefore attempt to go further.
    First, recent work in discriminative parsing has shown gains from careful engineering of features (Taskar et al., 2004; Finkel et al., 2008).
    Features in such parsers can be seen as defining effective dimensions of similarity between categories.
    Second, lexicalized parsers (Collins, 2003; Charniak, 2000) associate each category with a lexical item.
    This gives a fine-grained notion of semantic similarity, which is useful for tackling problems like ambiguous attachment decisions.
    However, this approach necessitates complex shrinkage estimation schemes to deal with the sparsity of observations of the lexicalized categories.
    In many natural language systems, single words and n-grams are usefully described by their distributional similarities (Brown et al., 1992), among many others.
