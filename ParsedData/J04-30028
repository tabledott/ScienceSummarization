tive (e.g., tragic, sad, and poignant are identified from bizarre).
    In addition, we use distributional similarity to improve estimates of unseen events: A word is selected or discarded based on the precision of it together with its n most similar neighbors.
    We show that the various subjectivity clues perform better and worse on the same data sets, exhibiting an important consistency in performance (Section 4.2).
    In addition to learning and evaluating clues associated with subjectivity, we address disambiguating them in context, that is, identifying instances of clues that are subjective in context (Sections 4.3 and 4.4).
    We find that the density of clues in the surrounding context is an important influence.
    Using two types of annotations serves us well here, too.
    It enables us to use manual judgments to identify parameters for disambiguating instances of automatically identified clues.
    High-density clues are high precision in both the expression-level and document-level data.
