ences are not accounted for.
    To alleviate this shortcoming it is possible and advisable to automatically detect and merge multiword phrases.
    As will be described in Section 5.2, the conventional bilingual dictionary itself can be used to learn and validate these phrases.
    The resulting multiword phrases Pe for the target language and Pf for the source language are afterwards concatenated within D to form entries consisting of pairs of &#8220;units.&#8221; The next step is to analyze the word forms in D and generate all possible readings of all entries.
    It is also possible to ignore those readings that are considered unlikely for the task under consideration by applying the domain-specific preference rules proposed in Section 2.2.
    The process of generating all readings includes replacing word forms with their lemma-tag representation, which is thereafter reduced by dropping all morpho-syntactic tags not contained in the tag sets Tf and Te.
    Using the tag sequence translation probabilities
