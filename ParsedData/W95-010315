used.
    The development set with no morphological processing was used for these tests.
    At each stage there is a sharp difference in accuracy between tuples with and without a preposition.
    Moreover, if the 14 tuples in the above table were ranked by accuracy, the top 7 tuples would be the 7 tuples which contain a preposition.
  
  
    The backed-off estimate scores appreciably better than other methods which have been tested on the Wall Street Journal corpus.
    The accuracy of 84.5% is close to the human performance figure of 88% using the 4 head words alone.
    A particularly surprising result is the significance of low count events in training data.
    The algorithm has the additional advantages of being conceptually simple, and computationally inexpensive to implement.
    There are a few possible improvements which may raise performance further.
    Firstly, while we have shown the importance of low-count events, some kind of smoothing may improve performance further - this needs to be inves
