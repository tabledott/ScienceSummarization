empt to assign the correct part-of-speech tag to every word encountered.
    Tunable A tagger should be able to take advantage of linguistic insights.
    One should be able to correct systematic errors by supplying appropriate a priori &amp;quot;hints.&amp;quot; It should be possible to give different hints for different corpora.
    Reusable The effort required to retarget a tagger to new corpora, new tagsets, and new languages should be minimal.
  
  
    Several different approaches have been used for building text taggers.
    Greene and Rubin used a rule-based approach in the TAGGIT program [Greene and Rubin, 1971], which was an aid in tagging the Brown corpus [Francis and KuEera, 1982].
    TAGGIT disambiguated 77% of the corpus; the rest was done manually over a period of several years.
    More recently, Koskenniemi also used a rule-based approach implemented with finite-state machines [Koskenniemi, 1990].
    Statistical methods have also been used (e.g., [DeRose, 1988], [Garside et al., 1987]).
