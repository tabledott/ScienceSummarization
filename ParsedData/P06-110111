ir evidence ERij we possess is in fact sense-pair evidence ERkl for a specific pair of senses k0 E senses(i), l0 E senses(j).
    Further, we assume that a new relation between two words is probable only between the correct sense pair, i.e.
    : When computing the conditional probability of a specific new relation Rkl E I(Rab), we assume that the relevant sense pair k0, l0 is the one which maximizes the probability of the new relation, i.e. for k E senses(i), l E senses(j), Our independence assumptions for this extension need only to be changed slightly; we now assume that the evidence ERij depends on the taxonomy T via only a single relation between sensepairs Rkl.
    Using this revised independence assumption the derivation for best-first search over taxonomies for hyponym acquisition remains unchanged.
    One side effect of this revised independence assumption is that the addition of the single &#8220;sense-collapsed&#8221; relation Rkl in the taxonomy T will explain the evidence ERij for the relation o
