 on no information about the languages involved beyond what can be derived from the texts themselves.
    Furthermore, the computations on which it is based are straightforward and robust.
    The plan rests on a relationship between word and sentence alignments arising from the observation that a pair of sentences containing an aligned pair of words must themselves be aligned.
    It follows that a partial alignment on the word level could induce a much more complete alignment on the sentence level.
    A solution to the alignment problem consists of a subset of the Cartesian product of the sets of source and target sentences.
    The process starts from an initial subset excluding pairs whose relative positions in their respective texts is so different that the chance of their being aligned is extremely low.
    This potentially alignable set of sentences forms the basis for a relaxation process that proceeds as follows.
    An initial set of candidate word alignments is produced by choosing pairs of words
