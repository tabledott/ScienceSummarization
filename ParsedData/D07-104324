			There are |Ku| = |K| ? |Knoise| ?useful?
			clusters and |Cu| = |C| ? |Cnoise| ?useful?
			classes.
			The claim is useful classes and clusters are matched to each other and matched pairs contain more data points than unmatched pairs.

			415 of non-matching useful class/cluster pairs.
			Noise clusters are those that contain data points equally from each cluster.
			Error mass of ?2 is distributed across every ?noise?-cluster/ ?useful?-class pair.
			We extend the parameterization technique described in (Dom, 2001) in with |Cnoise| and ?3.
			Noise classes are those that contain data points equally from each cluster.
