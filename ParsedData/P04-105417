mes, but did not obtain a set of weights that produced consistent significant improvements.
    See Section 8 for altern &#945; ate approaches to setting C. Table 4 shows the results of each kernel within an SVM.
    (We augment the LibSVM3 implementation to include our dependency tree kernel.)
    Note that, although training was done over all 24 relation subtypes, we evaluate only over the 5 high-level relation types.
    Thus, classifying a RESIDENCE relation as a LOCATED relation is deemed correct4.
    Note also that K0 is not included in Table 4 because of burdensome computational time.
    Table 4 shows that precision is adequate, but recall is low.
    This is a result of the aforementioned class imbalance &#8211; very few of the training examples are relations, so the classifier is less likely to identify a testing instances as a relation.
    Because we treat every pair of mentions in a sentence as a possible relation, our training set contains fewer than 15% positive relation instances.
