(EN) and SVM(CN) by averaging the prediction values in the same way with the co-training approach.
    TSVM(CN): This method applies the transductive SVM with only Chinese features for sentiment classification in the Chinese view.
    Only English-to-Chinese translation is needed.
    And the unlabeled set is used.
    TSVM(EN): This method applies the transductive SVM with only English features for sentiment classification in the English view.
    Only Chinese-to-English translation is needed.
    And the unlabeled set is used.
    TSVM(ENCN1): This method applies the transductive SVM with both English and Chinese features for sentiment classification in the two views.
    Both English-to-Chinese and Chinese-toEnglish translations are required.
    And the unlabeled set is used.
    TSVM(ENCN2): This method combines the results of TSVM(EN) and TSVM(CN) by averaging the prediction values.
    Note that the first four methods are straightforward methods used in previous work, while the latter four methods are
