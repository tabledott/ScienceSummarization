    The translation process would have been easier if some of the annotation had been more explicit and precise (as in the case of VP coordination, where preprocessing was required to identify the conjuncts, or in NP coordination, where we were not able to distinguish NP lists from appositives) and consistent (most importantly in identifying adjuncts and arguments).
    An important conclusion that follows for the builders of future treebanks is that the tradition established by the Penn Treebank of including all linguistically relevant dependencies should be continued, with if anything even closer adherence to semantically informed linguistic insights into predicate&#8211;argument structural relations.
    Our results also indicate that corpora of at least the order of magnitude of the Penn Treebank are necessary to obtain grammars and parsers that are sufficiently expressive, robust, and wide in coverage to recover these relations completely.
