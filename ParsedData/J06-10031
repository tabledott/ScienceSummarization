  It?s important to note that semantic relatedness is a more general concept than similarity; similar entities are semantically related by virtue of their similarity (bank?trust company), but dissimilar entities may also be semantically related by lexical relationships such as meronymy (car?wheel) and antonymy (hot?cold), or just by any kind of functional rela- tionship or frequent association (pencil?paper, penguin?Antarctica, rain?flood).
  Computa- tional applications typically require relatedness rather than just similarity; for example, money and river are cues to the in-context meaning of bank that are just as good as trust company.
