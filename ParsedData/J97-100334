rmation is described in Youmans (1991), which introduces a variant on type/token curves, called the Vocabulary-Management Profile.
    Type/token curves are simply plots of the number of unique words against the number of words in a text, starting with the first word and proceeding through the last.
    Youmans modifies this algorithm to keep track of how many first-time uses of words occur at the midpoint of every 35-word window in a text.
    Youmans' goal is to study the distribution of vocabulary in discourse rather than to segment it along topical lines, but upon examining many English narratives, essays, and transcripts he notices that sharp upturns after deep valleys in the curve &amp;quot;correlate closely to constituent boundaries and information flow&amp;quot; (p. 788).
    Youmans' analysis of the graphs is descriptive in nature, mainly attempting to identify the cause of each peak or valley in terms of a principle of narrative structure, and is done at a very fined-grained level.
    He discusses
