t appear in WordNet (or in the MRDs) are generally non-compositional, in the relevant sense.
    As noted by Sag et al. (2002) many MWEs are simply &#8220;institutionalized phrases&#8221; whose meanings are perfectly compositional, but whose frequency of use (or other non-linguistic factors) make them highly salient.
    It is certainly clear that many MWEs that appear in WordNet&#8212;examples being law student, medical student, college man&#8212;are perfectly compositional semantically.
    Zhai (1997), in an early attempt to apply statistical methods to the extraction of noncompositional MWEs, made use of what we take to be a more appropriate evaluation metric.
    In his comparison among a number of different heuristics for identifying non-compositional noun-noun compounds, Zhai did his evaluation by applying each heuristic to a corpus of items hand-classified as to their compositionality.
    Although Zhai&#8217;s classification appears to be problematic, we take this to be the appropirate paradigm for e
