n be defined, and show that like CFG's, each member possesses a number of desirable linguistic and computational properties: in particular, the constant growth property and polynomial recognizability.
  
  
    From Thatcher's (1973) work, it is obvious that the complexity of the set of paths from root to frontier of trees in a local set (the tree set of a CFG) is regular'.
    We define the path set of a tree 1 as the set of strings that label a path from the root to frontier of 7.
    The path set of a tree set is the union of the path sets of trees in that tree set.
    It can be easily shown from Thatcher's result that the path set of every local set is a regular set.
    As a result, CFG's can not provide the structural descriptions in which there are nested dependencies between symbols labelling a path.
    For example, CFG's cannot produce trees of the form shown in Figure 1 in which there are nested dependencies between S and NP nodes appearing on the spine of the tree.
    Gazdar (1985) argues this i
