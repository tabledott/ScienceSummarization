    That is, the model does not account for surrounding English words when predicting the appropriate French rendering of an English word.

    The basic model is blind to context, always assigning a probability of 0.3004 to dans and 0.0044 to pendant.
    This can yield errors when Candide is called upon to translate a French sentence.
    Examples of two such errors are shown in Figure 5.
    In the first example, the system has chosen an English sentence in which the French word superieures has been rendered as superior when greater or higher is a preferable translation.
    With no knowledge of context, an expert translator is also quite likely to select superior as the English
