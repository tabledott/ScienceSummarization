ning and work in the area of lexical semantics.
    One of the obvious stumbling blocks in much recent WSD work is the rather narrow view of sense that comes hand-in-hand with the attempt to use sense distinctions in everyday dictionaries, which cannot, and are not intended to, represent meaning in context.
    A different sort of view, one more consistent with current linguistic theory, is required; here, we see the recent work using generative lexicons as providing at least a point of departure.
    Another goal of this paper is to provide a starting point for the growing number of researchers working in various areas of computational linguistics who want to learn about WSD.
    There is renewed interest in WSD as it contributes to various applications, such as machine translation and document retrieval.
    WSD as &amp;quot;intermediate task,&amp;quot; while interesting in its own right, is difficult and perhaps ultimately impossible to assess in the abstract; incorporation of WSD methods into larger appli
