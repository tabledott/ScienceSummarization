s divided into exactly four token fields, which can be either filled or empty (in the case of the three clitic token fields) or correct or incorrect (in the case of the stem token field).
    We report in Figure 5 accuracy over all token fields for all words in the test corpus, as well as recall, precision, and f-measure for the non-null token fields.
    The baseline BL is the tokenization associated with the morphological analysis most frequently chosen for the input word in training.
    8The ATB generates normalized forms of certain clitics and of the word stem, so that the resulting tokens are not simply the result of splitting the original words.
    We do not actually generate the surface token form from our deep representation, but this can be done in a deterministic, rule-based manner, given our rich morphological analysis, e.g., by using ALMORGEANA in generation mode after splitting off all separable tokens.
    While the token-based evaluation is identical to that performed by Diab et al. (2004), t
