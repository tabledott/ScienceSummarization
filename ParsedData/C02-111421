d for this task is to use hand labelled data to train a learning algorithm, which will often pick out particular words as Bayesian classifiers which indicate one sense or the other.
			(So if microsoft occurs in the same sentence as apple we might take this as evidence that apple is being used in the corporate sense.)
			Clearly, the words in the different componentsin Diagram 6 can potentially be used as classi fiers for just this purpose, obviating the need fortime-consuming human annotation.
			This tech nique will be assessed and evaluated in future experiments.
			DemonstrationAn online version of the graph model and the in cremental clustering algorithm described in this paper are publicly available 1 for demonstrationpurposes and to allow users to observe the gen erality of our techniques.
			A sample output is included in Figure 6.
