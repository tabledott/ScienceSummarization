hrase-based models and syntactic structures.
			This is done using CCG supertags, which provide a rich source of syntactic information.
			CCG contains most of the structure ofthe grammar in the lexicon, which makes it possible to introduce CCG supertags as a factor in a factored translation model (Koehn et al, 2006).
			Fac tored models allow words to be vectors of features:one factor could be the surface form and other fac tors could contain linguistic information.
			Factored models allow for the easy inclusion of supertags in different ways.
			The first approach is to generate CCG supertags as a factor in the target and then apply an n-gram model over them, increasing the probability of more frequently seen sequencesof supertags.
			This is a simple way of including syn tactic information in a phrase-based model, and has also been suggested by Hassan et al (2007).
			For both Arabic-English (Hassan et al, 2007) and our experiments in Dutch-English, n-gram models over CCG supertags improve the quality of
