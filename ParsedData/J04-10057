Cohen&#8217;s computation of P(E) on the left, and Siegel and Castellan&#8217;s computation on the right.
    We include the computations of KCo and KS&amp;C as the last step.
    For both Cohen and Siegel and Castellan, P(A) = 125/150 = 0.8333.
    The observed agreement P(A) is computed as the proportion of items the coders agree on to the total number of items; N is the number of items, and k the number of coders (N = 150 and k = 2 in our example).
    Both KCo and KS&amp;C are highly significant at the p = 0.5 &#8727; 10&#8722;5 level (significance is computed for KCo and KS&amp;C according to the formulas in Cohen [1960] and Siegel and Castellan [1988], respectively).
    The difference between KCo and KS&amp;C in Figure 2 is just under 1%, however, the results of the two K computations straddle the value 0.67, which for better or worse has been adopted as a cutoff in computational linguistics.
    This cutoff is based on the assessment of K values in Krippendorff (1980), which discounts K &lt; 0.67 and
