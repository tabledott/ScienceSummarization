 of having naive speakers perform the classification.
    Our experiments were also designed to assess the feasibility of a system to process definite descriptions on unrestricted text and to collect data that could be used for this implementation.
    For both of these reasons, the classification schemes that we tried differ in several respects from those adopted in prior corpus-based studies such as Prince (1981) and Fraurud (1990).
    Our study is also different from these previous ones in that measuring the agreement among annotators became an issue (Carletta 1996).
    For the experiments, we used a set of randomly selected articles from the Wall Street Journal contained in the ACL/DCI CD-ROM, rather than a corpus of transcripts of spoken language corpora such as the HCRC MapTask corpus (Anderson et al. 1991) or the TRAINS corpus (Heeman and Allen 1995).
    The main reason for this choice was to avoid dealing with deictic uses of definite descriptions and with phenomena such as reference failure and re
