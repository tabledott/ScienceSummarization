			+ Classification 75.2 63.3 68.7 Table 15: Performance on the AQUAINT test set.
			There is a significant drop in the precision and recallnumbers for the AQUAINT test set (compared to the pre cision and recall numbers for the PropBank test set which were 84% and 75% respectively).
			One possible reason for the drop in performance is relative coverage of the features on the two test sets.
			The head word, path andpredicate features all have a large number of possible val ues and could contribute to lower coverage when moving from one domain to another.
			Also, being more specific they might not transfer well across domains.
