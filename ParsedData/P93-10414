xical cohesiveness c(Si) of the word list Si is defined as follows: where a(P(Si), tv) is the activity value of the node w in the activated pattern P(S).
    P(Si) is produced by activating each node w E Si with strength s(w)2/ s(w).
    Figure 1 shows a sample pattern of {red, alcoholic, drink).
    (Note that it has highly activated nodes like bottle and wine.)
    The definition of c(Si) above expresses that c(Si) represents semantic homogeneity of Si, since P(Si) represents the average meaning of w E Si.
    For example: c(&amp;quot;Molly saw a cat.
    It was her family pet.
    She wished to keep a lion.&amp;quot; = 0.403239 (cohesive), c(&amp;quot;There is no one but me.
    Put on your clothes.
    I can not walk more.&amp;quot; = 0.235462 (not cohesive).
  
  
    A graph of LCP, which plots c(Si) at the text position i, indicates changing of segments: As shown in Figure 2, the segment boundaries can be detected by the valleys (minimum points) of LCP.
    The LCP, shown in Figure 3, has large hills a
