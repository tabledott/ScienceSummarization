complex task of planning a round-trip journey from Harvard Square to several Boston tourist sights.
    Thus, the tasks were designed to require increasing levels of planning complexity.
    The speakers were provided with various maps, and could write notes to themselves as well as trace routes on the maps.
    For the duration of the experiment, the speakers were in face-to-face contact with a silent partner (a confederate) who traced on her map the routes described by the speakers.
    The speech was subsequently orthographically transcribed, with false starts and other speech errors repaired or omitted; subjects returned several weeks after their first recording to read aloud from transcriptions of their own directions.
    For this paper, the spontaneous and read recordings for one male speaker were acoustically analyzed; fundamental frequency and energy were calculated using Entropic speech analysis software.
