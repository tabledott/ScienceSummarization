sides establishing a relationship between syntactic alternations and underlying semantic properties of verbs, our approach extends existing corpus-based learning techniques to the detection and automatic acquisition of argument structure.
    To date, most work in this area has focused on learning of subcategorization from unannotated or syntactically annotated text (e.g., Brent [1993]; Sanfilippo and Poznanski [1992]; Manning [1993]; Collins [1997]).
    Others have tackled the problem of lexical semantic classification, but using only subcategorization frequencies as input data (Lapata and Brew 1999; Schulte im Walde 2000).
    Specifically, these researchers have not explicitly addressed the definition of features to tap directly into thematic role differences that are not reflected in subcategorization distinctions.
    On the other hand, when learning of thematic role assignment has been the explicit goal, the text has been semantically annotated (Webster and Marcus 1989), or external semantic resources
