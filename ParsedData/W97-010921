    For the attachment of the prepositional phrases in unseen sentences, we have modified Quinlan's ID3 algorithm [Q86], [BR91] which belongs to the the family of inductive learning algorithms.
    Using a huge training set of classified examples, it uncovers the importance of the individual words (attributes) and creates a decision tree that is later used for classification of unseen examples7.
    The algorithm uses the concepts of the WordNet hierarchy as attribute values and creates the decision tree in the following way: Let T be a training set of classified quadruples.
    1..
    If all the examples in T are of the same PP attachment type (or satisfy the homogeneity termination condition, see below) then the result is a leaf labelled with this type, else Let us briefly explain each step of the algorithm.
    1.
    If the examples belong to the same class (set T is homogenous), the tree expansion terminates.
    However, such situation is very unlikely due to the non-perfect training
