eights in the two hidden grammars.
    We first merge the models for English and Chinese by taking a union of the multinomial families of each and the corresponding prior parameters.
    We then add a normal expert that ties between the parts of speech in the respective partition structures for both grammars together.
    Parts of speech are matched through the single coarse tagset (footnote 4).
    For example, with TIEV, let V = VEng U VChi be the set of part-of-speech tags which belong to the verb category for either treebank.
    Then, we tie parameters for all part-of-speech tags in V .
    We tested this joint model for each of TIEV, TIEN, TIEV&amp;N, and TIEA.
    After running the inference algorithm which learns the two models jointly, we use unseen data to test each learned model separately.
    Table 1 includes the results for these experiments.
    The performance on English improved significantly in the bilingual setting, achieving highest performance with TIEV&amp;N.
