semantically related concepts will be physically close in the knowledge base, and can thus be found by traversing the arcs for a limited distance.
    But Polaroid Words looked only for possible relatedness between words in the same sentence; trying to find connections with all the words in preceding sentences was too complicated and too likely to be led astray.
    The idea of lexical chains, however, can address this weakness in Polaroid Words; lexical chains provide a constrained easy-to-determine representation of context for consideration of semantic distance.
    1.2.2 Cohesion and Discourse Structure.
    The second major importance of lexical chains is that they provide a clue for the determination of coherence and discourse structure.
    When a chunk of text forms a unit within a discourse, there is a tendency for related words to be used.
    It follows that if lexical chains can be determined, they will tend to indicate the structure of the text.
    We will describe the application of lexical coh
