    A key finding of Miller et al.&#8217;s work was that a system developed by annotating role fillers in text and training a statistical system performed at the same level as one based on writing a large system of rules, which requires much more highly skilled labor to design.
    We use as the baseline of all our parsing experiments the model described in Collins (1999).
    The algorithm is a form of chart parsing, which uses dynamic programming to search through the exponential number of possible parses by considering subtrees for each subsequence of the sentence independently.
    To apply chart parsing to a probabilistic grammar, independence relations must be assumed to hold between the probabilities of a parse tree and the internal structure of its subtrees.
    In the case of stochastic context-free grammar, the probability of a tree is independent of the internal structure of its subtrees, given the topmost nonterminal of the subtree.
