Stochastic Tree Insertion Grammar (STIG) (Schabes and Waters, 1994), an 0 (n3 ) formalism, but this method has problems, because the STIG undergenerates since it is missing some elementary trees.
    A different approach would be to use multiple-pass parsing.
    We could first find a contextfree covering grammar for the STAG, and use this as a first pass, and then use the full STAG for the second pass.
    The grammars described here are fairly simple, presented for purposes of explication.
    In other work in preparation, in which we have used a significantly more complicated grammar, which we call the Probabilistic Feature Grammar (PFG), the improvements from multiple-pass parsing are even more dramatic: single pass experiments are simply too slow to run at all.
    We have also found the automatic thresholding parameter optimization algorithm to be very useful.
    Before writing the parameter optimization algorithm, we developed the PFG grammar and the multiple-pass parsing technique and ran a series of
