    It is important to show that subjective coding distinctions can be understood and applied by people other than the coding developers, both to make the coding credible in its own right and to establish that it is suitable for testing empirical hypotheses.
    Krippendorff (1980), working within the field of content analysis, describes a way of establishing reliability, which applies here.
    Krippendorff argues that there are three different tests of reliability with increasing strength.
    The first is stability, also sometimes called test-rest reliability, or intertest variance; a coder's judgments should not change over time.
    The second is reproducibility, or intercoder variance, which requires different coders to code in the same way.
    The third is accuracy, which requires coders to code in the same way as some known standard.
