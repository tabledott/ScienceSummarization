ria and why this measure is more appropriate than another frequently used measure&#8212;mutual information.
    Our approach is based on the assumption that each collocation is unambiguous in the source language and has a unique translation in the target language (at least in a clear majority of the cases).
    In this way, we can ignore the context of the collocations and their translations, and base our decisions only on the patterns of co-occurrence of each collocation and its candidate translations across the entire corpus.
    This approach is quite different from those adopted for the translation of single words (Klavans and Tzoukermann 1990; Dorr 1992; Klavans and Tzoukermann 1996), since for single words polysemy cannot be ignored; indeed, the problem of sense disambiguation has been linked to the problem of translating ambiguous words (Brown et al. 1991; Dagan, Itai, and Schwa11 1991; Dagan and Itai 1994).
    The assumption of a single meaning per collocation was based on our previous experience wit
