sed-class dependent morphemes such as case markers, copula, topicalizers, and conjunctions.
    Since most of the semantic content resides in the leading head morpheme, we eliminate for word alignment all trailing morphemes, which reduces the KTB&#8217;s vocabulary size from 10,052 to 3,104.
    Existing morphological processing tools for many languages are often unweighted finite-state transducers that encode the possible analyses for a surface form word.
    One such tool, klex, is available for Korean (Han, 2004).
    Unfortunately, while the unweighted FST describes the set of valid analyses, it gives no way to choose among them.
    We treat this as a noisy channel: Korean morpheme-tag pairs are generated in sequence by some process, then passed through a channel that turns them into Korean words (with loss of information).
    The channel is given by the FST, but without any weights.
    To select the best output, we model the source process.
    We model the sequence of morphemes and their tags as a lo
