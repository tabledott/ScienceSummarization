as the minimum number of edit operations needed to transform a word string to the other word string.
    Position-independent Word Error Rate (PER) measures the minimum number of edit operations needed to transform a word string to any permutation of the other word string.
    The PER score (Och, 2002) is then computed as a ratio of this distance to the number of words in the reference word string.
    The second class of translation loss functions uses information only from the parse-trees of the two translations, so that .
    This loss function has no access to any information from the source sentence or the word alignments.
    Examples of such loss functions are tree-edit distances between parse-trees, string-edit distances between event representation of parse-trees (Tang et al., 2002), and treekernels (Collins and Duffy, 2002).
    The computation of tree-edit distance involves an unconstrained alignment of the two English parse-trees.
    We can simplify this problem once we have a third parse tree (f
