valuation A vital part of any language engineering application is the evaluation of its performance, and a development environment for this purpose would not be complete without some mechanisms for its measurement in a large number of test cases.
    GATE contains two such mechanisms: an evaluation tool (AnnotationDiff) which enables automated performance measurement and visualisation of the results, and a benchmarking tool, which enables the tracking of a system's progress and regression testing.
    6.1 The AnnotationDiff Tool Gate's AnnotationDiff tool enables two sets of annotations on a document to be compared, in order to either compare a system-annotated text with a reference (hand-annotated) text, or to compare the output of two different versions of the system (or two different systems).
    For each annotation type, figures are generated for precision, recall, F-measure and false positives.
    The AnnotationDiff viewer displays the two sets of annotations, marked with different colours (similar to
