ntics can be thought of as the constructive proving of the ;trings grammaticality: parsing can he viewed as logical deduction.
  -3ut, given a deductive framework that can represent the semantics ff the formalism abstractly enough to be independent of processing, he generation of strings matching some criteria can equally well be hought of as a deductive process, namely, a process of constructive ~roof of the existence of a string that matches the criteria.
  The dif- erence rests in which information is given as premises and what the ~oal is to be proved.
  This observation opens up the following possi- bility: not only can a single grammar be used by different processes ~ngaged in various "directions" of processing, but one and the same anguage-processing architecture can be employed for processing the grammar in the various modes.
  In particular, parsing and generatioa :an be viewed as two processes engaged in by a single parameterized ;heorem prover for the logical interpretation of the formalism.
