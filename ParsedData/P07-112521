buted neural system.
    The sentence does not, in fact, contain a hedge but rather a statement of observed non-universal behaviour.
    However, an almost identical variant with &#8216;could&#8217; instead of &#8216;can&#8217; would be a strong speculative candidate.
    This highlights the similarity between many hedge and non-hedge instances, which makes such cases hard to learn in a weakly supervised manner.
  
  
    We have shown that weakly supervised ML is applicable to the problem of hedge classification and that a reasonable level of accuracy can be achieved.
    The work presented here has application in the wider academic community; in fact a key motivation in this study is to incorporate hedge classification into an interactive system for aiding curators in the construction and population of gene databases.
    We have presented our initial results on the task using a simple probabilistic model in the hope that this will encourage others to investigate alternative learning models and pursue new t
