age indicated how far from the target one would have to look in order to recognise that there was an error.
    For example, in the case of &amp;quot;an period&amp;quot; the error occurs at a distance of one word from period.
    When the error is an omission, as in &amp;quot;lived in Victorian period&amp;quot;, the distance is where the missing word should have appeared.
    In this case, the missing determiner is 2 positions away from the target.
    When more than one error occurred, the distance of the one closest to the target was marked.
    Table 3 lists the precision and recall for the 20 test words.
    The column labelled &amp;quot;Recall&amp;quot; is the proportion of human-judged errors in the 250sentence sample that were detected by ALEK.
    &amp;quot;Total Recall&amp;quot; is an estimate that extrapolates from the human judgements of the sample to the entire test set.
    We illustrate this with the results for pollution.
    The human judge marked as incorrect usage 91.2% of the sample from AL
