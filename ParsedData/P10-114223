del, it does not address the other problem: failure to identify the most probable candidate antecedent.
    Ranking models, on the other hand, allow us to determine which candidate antecedent is most probable given an NP to be resolved.
    Ranking is arguably a more natural reformulation of coreference resolution than classification, as a ranker allows all candidate antecedents to be considered simultaneously and therefore directly captures the competition among them.
    Another desirable consequence is that there exists a natural resolution strategy for a ranking approach: an anaphoric NP is resolved to the candidate antecedent that has the highest rank.
    This contrasts with classification-based approaches, where many clustering algorithms have been employed to coordinate the pairwise classification decisions, and it is still not clear which of them is the best.
    The notion of ranking candidate antecedents can be traced back to centering algorithms, many of which use grammatical roles to rank forward
