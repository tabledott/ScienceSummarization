) When we discover a statistic that we feel is useful, we can acknowledge its importance by requiring that our model accord with it.
    We do this by constraining the expected value that the model assigns to the corresponding feature function f. The expected value off with respect to the model p(ylx) is where /77(x) is the empirical distribution of x in the training sample.
    We constrain this expected value to be the same as the expected value of f in the training sample.
    That is, we require We call the requirement (3) a constraint equation or simply a constraint.
    By restricting attention to those models p(y1x) for which (3) holds, we are eliminating from consideration those models that do not agree with the training sample on how often the output of the process should exhibit the feature f. To sum up so far, we now have a means of representing statistical phenomena inherent in a sample of data (namely, 13(f)), and also a means of requiring that our model of the process exhibit these phenomena (na
