emoving the indomain vs. out-of-domain distinction focusing on news translations only.
    The main reason for this was eliminating the advantage statistical systems have with respect to test data that are from the same domain as the training data.
    Analogously to previous years, the main focus of comparing the quality of different approaches is on manual evaluation.
    Here, also, we reduced the number of dimensions with respect to which the different systems are compared, with sentencelevel ranking as the primary type of manual evaluation.
