the pipeline architecture in row 3, we see that F-score rises significantly by 2.2&#8211;3.8% for true mentions, and improves by a smaller margin of 0.3&#8211;1.7% for system mentions.
    These results demonstrate the benefits of joint modeling.
    Our cluster-ranking model.
    Finally, we evaluate our cluster-ranking model.
    As in the mentionranking baseline, we employ both the pipeline architecture and the joint architecture for discoursenew detection.
    Results are shown in rows 5 and 6 of Tables 3 and 4, respectively, for the two architectures.
    When true mentions are used, the pipeline architecture yields an F-score of 61.8&#8211; 74.8, which represents a significant improvement over the mention ranker adopting the pipeline architecture.
    With the joint architecture, the cluster ranker achieves an F-score of 63.3&#8211;76.0.
    This also represents a significant improvement over the mention ranker adopting the joint architecture, the best of the baselines, and suggests that cluster ranking
