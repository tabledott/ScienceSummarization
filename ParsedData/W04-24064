ces of the target word that are to be discriminated.
    The cell entries of the matrix show the degree to which the pair of instances represented by the corresponding row and column are (dis)similar.
    The (dis)similarity is computed from the first order context vectors of the instances which show each instance as a vector of features that directly occur near the target word in that instance.
    (Sch&#168;utze, 1998) introduces second order context vectors that represent an instance by averaging the feature vectors of the content words that occur in the context of the target word in that instance.
    These second order context vectors then become the input to the clustering algorithm which clusters the given contexts in vector space, instead of building the similarity matrix structure.
    There are some significant differences in the approaches suggested by Pedersen and Bruce and by Sch&#168;utze.
    As yet there has not been any systematic study to determine which set of techniques results in better s
