ct placing an upper bound on edit distance relative to the length of the sentence.
			Pairs that had been seen before in either order were also rejected.
			Filtered in this way, our dataset yields 139K non identical sentence pairs at a Levenshtein distance of n ? 12.
			3 Mean Levenshtein distance was 5.17, and mean sentence length was 18.6 words.
			We will refer to this dataset as L12.
			3.1.1 First sentences The second extraction technique was specifically intended to capture paraphrases which might contain very different sets of content words, word order, and so on.
			Such pairs are typically used to illustrate the phenomenon of paraphrase, but precisely because their surface dissimilarity renders automatic discovery difficult, they have generally not been the focus of previous computational approaches.
			In order to automatically identify sentence pairs of this type, we have attempted to take advantage of some of the unique characteristics of the dataset.
			The topical clustering is sufficiently pre
