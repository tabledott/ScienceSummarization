er prefixes of length 6 to define features.
    We report the following evaluation metrics: partof-speech accuracy (POS), unlabeled attachment score (UAS), labeled attachment score (LAS), and tagged labeled attachment score (TLAS).
    TLAS is a new metric defined as the percentage of words that are assigned the correct part-of-speech tag, the correct head and the correct dependency label.
    In line with previous work, punctuation is included in the evaluation for the CoNLL data sets but excluded for the two benchmark data sets.
    Table 1 presents results on the development sets of the CoNLL 2009 shared task with varying values of the two tag parameters k (number of candidates) and &#945; (maximum score difference to 1-best tag) and beam parameters fixed at b1 = 40 and b2 = 4.
    We use the combined TLAS score on the development set to select the optimal settings for each language.
    For Chinese, we obtain the best result with 3 tags and a threshold of 0.1.6 Compared to the baseline, we observe a POS i
