synchronous TAGs, which characterize correstxmdences between languages.
			The formalism's intended usage is to relate expressions of natural anguages to their asso- ciated semantics represented in a logical form language, or to their translations in another natural language; in summary, we intend the formalism to allow TAGs to be used beyond their role in syntax proper.
			We also discuss its application to concrete xamples, and mention some computational issues that arise in its interpretation.
	
	
			mal Description Language interpretation tasks can be thought of as asso- ciating a syntactic analysis of a sentence with some other stmcture,---a logical form representation r an analysis of a target language sentence, perhaps.
			Synchronous TAGs are defined so as to make such associations explicit.
			The original language and its associated structures are both defined by grammars tated in a TAG formalism; the two TAGs are synchronous in the sense that adjunction and substitution operations are applied simul
