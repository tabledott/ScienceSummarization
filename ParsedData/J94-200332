 con- straints on coreference (Reinhart 1976; Brennan, Friedman, and Pollard 1987; Iida 1993).
  These contra-indexing constraints specify that in a sentence such as He likes him, that he and him cannot co-specify the same discourse ntity.
  The algorithm applies centering theory to the problem of resolving anaphoric reference.
  Application of the algorithm requires three basic steps.
  GENERATE possible Cb-Cf combinations FILTER by constraints, e.g.
  contra-indexing,?
  sortal predicates, centering rules and constraints RANK by transition orderings In order to apply this algorithm to Japanese, possible Cb-Cf combinations (GEN- ERATE step 1) must be constructed from the surface string and information from the subcategorization frame of the verb.
  First the verb subcategorization s examined, and if there are more entities than appear in the surface string, zeros are postulated as forward centers.
  These zeros are then treated just like pronouns in English by the rest of the algorithm.
  We use a different
