		This paper presents two Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms forBayesian inference of probabilistic context free grammars (PCFGs) from ter minal strings, providing an alternative to maximum-likelihood estimation usingthe Inside-Outside algorithm.
		We illus trate these methods by estimating a sparse grammar describing the morphology ofthe Bantu language Sesotho, demonstrat ing that with suitable priors Bayesian techniques can infer linguistic structure in situations where maximum likelihoodmethods such as the Inside-Outside algo rithm only produce a trivial grammar.
	
	
			The standard methods for inferring the parameters of probabilistic models in computational linguistics arebased on the principle of maximum-likelihood esti mation; for example, the parameters of ProbabilisticContext-Free Grammars (PCFGs) are typically estimated from strings of terminals using the InsideOutside (IO) algorithm, an instance of the Ex pectation Maximization (EM
