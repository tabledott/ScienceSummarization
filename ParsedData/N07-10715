, e.g.
    CBC (Pantel and Lin 2002).
    In this paper, we experiment with two sets of semantic classes, one from WordNet and one from CBC.
    Another thread related to our work includes extracting from text corpora paraphrases (Barzilay and McKeown 2001) and inference rules, e.g.
    TEASE1 (Szpektor et al. 2004) and DIRT (Lin and Pantel 2001).
    While these systems differ in their approaches, neither provides for the extracted inference rules to hold or fail based on SPs.
    Zanzotto et al. (2006) recently explored a different interplay between SPs and inferences.
    Rather than examine the role of SPs in inferences, they use SPs of a particular type to derive inferences.
    For instance the preference of win for the subject player, a nominalization of play, is used to derive that &#8220;win =&gt; play&#8221;.
    Our work can be viewed as complementary to the work on extracting semantic inferences and paraphrases, since we seek to refine when a given inference applies, filtering out incorrect infere
