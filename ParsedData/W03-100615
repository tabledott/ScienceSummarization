   For example, the dsubcat for the passive version of hit would be NP0 NP1.
    Semsubcat.
    This is the semantic subcategorization frame.
    We first experiment with the set of features described in Gildea and Palmer (2002): Pred HW, Arg HW, Phrase Type, Position, Path, Voice.
    Call this feature set GP0.
    The error rate, 10.0%, is lower than that reported by Gildea and Palmer (2002), 17.2%.
    This is presumably because our training and test data has been assembled in a different manner as mentioned in Section 5.
    Our next experiment is on the same set of features, with the exception that Path has been replaced with Supertag Path.
    (Feature set GP1).
    The error rate is reduced from 10.0% to 9.7%.
    This is statistically significant (t-test, p &lt; 0.05), albeit a small improvement.
    One explanation for the improvement is that Path does not generalize as well as Supertag path does.
    For example, the path feature value VBG&#57739;VP&#57739;VP&#57739;S&#57740;NP reflects surface subj
