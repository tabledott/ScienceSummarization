r approach for feature selection (Kohavi &amp; John, 1997).
    We start with a model based on a set of predefined baseline features.
    Then we train models combining the baseline with all additional features separately.
    We choose the best performing feature (fmeasure according to Vilain et al. (1995)), adding it to the model.
    We then train classifiers combining the enhanced model with each of the remaining features separately.
    We again choose the best performing classifier and add the corresponding new feature to the model.
    This process is repeated as long as significant improvement can be observed.
    In our experiments we split the data in three sets according to the agreement of the anaphor: third person masculine and feminine pronouns (3mf), third person neuter pronouns (3n), and third person plural pronouns (3p).
    Since only 3n-pronouns have nonNP-antecedents, we were mainly interested in improvements in this data set.
    We used the same baseline model for each data set.
