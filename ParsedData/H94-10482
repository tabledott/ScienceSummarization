  guaranteed tobe optimal but appears experimentally to yield a good subset of features as judged by the accuracy rate in making the PP-attachment decisons.
  These search strategies can be applied to other attachment decisions.
  We use data from two treebanks: the IBM-Lancaster Treebank of Computer Manuals and the University of Pennsylvania WSJ treebank.
  We extract he verb phrases which include PP phrases either attached to the verb or to an object noun phrase.
  Then our model assigns a probability to either of the possible attachments.
  We consider models of the exponential family that are derived using the Maximum Entropy Principle [1].
  We begin by an overview of ME models, then we describe our feature selection method and a method for constructing a larger pool of features from an exisiting set, and then give some of our results and conclusions.
