ystems (including several unsupervised systems, as listed in Table 3) is significantly higher than the baseline, with the best system performing at 72.9% (79.3%) for fine grained (coarse grained) scoring.
    Not surprisingly, several of the top performing systems are based on combinations of multiple classifiers, which shows once again that voting schemes that combine several learning algorithms outperform the accuracy of individual classifiers.
  
  
    The English lexical sample task in SENSEVAL3 featured English ambiguous words that were to be tagged with their most appropriate WordNet or Wordsmyth sense.
    The objective of this task was to: (1) Determine feasibility of reliably finding the English lexical sample Word Sense Disambiguation task.
    Precision and recall figures are provided for both fine grained and coarse grained scoring.
