ostly related to (Koehn and Schroeder, 2007) but explores different assumptions about available adaptation data: i.e. only monolingual in-domain texts are available.
    The adaptation of the translation and re-ordering models is performed by generating synthetic bilingual data from monolingual texts, similarly to what proposed in (Schwenk, 2008).
    Interpolation of multiple phrase tables is applied in a more principled way than in (Koehn and Schroeder, 2007): all entries are merged into one single table, corresponding feature functions are concatenated and smoothing is applied when observations are missing.
    The approach proposed in this paper has many similarities with the simplest technique in (Ueffing et al., 2007), but it is applied to a much larger monolingual corpus.
    Finally, with respect to previous work we also investigate the behavior of the minimum error training procedure to optimize the combination of feature functions on a small in-domain bilingual sample.
