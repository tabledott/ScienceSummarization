t of constructing annotated corpora led researchers to look for ways to train parsers on unannotated text.
    This can either be semi-supervised parsing, using both annotated and unannotated data (McClosky et al., 2006) or unsupervised parsing, training entirely on unannotated text.
    The past few years have seen considerable improvement in the performance of unsupervised parsers (Klein and Manning, 2002; Klein and Manning, 2004; Bod, 2006a; Bod, 2006b) and, for the first time, unsupervised parsers have been able to improve on the right-branching heuristic for parsing English.
    All these parsers learn and parse from sequences of part-of-speech tags and select, for each sentence, the binary parse tree which maximizes some objective function.
    Learning is based on global maximization of this objective function over the whole corpus.
    In this paper I present an unsupervised parser from plain text which does not use parts-of-speech.
    Learning is local and parsing is (locally) greedy.
