 from existing systems (Lin, 1998a; Lin, 1998b; Grefenstette, 1994).
    Our proposed weight functions are motivated by our intuition that highly predictive attributes are strong collocations with their terms.
    Thus, we have implemented many of the statistics described in the Collocations chapter of Manning and Sch&#168;utze (1999), including the T-Test, X2-Test, Likelihood Ratio, and Mutual Information.
    Some functions (suffix LOG) have an extra log2(f(w, r, w&#57742;) + 1) factor to promote the influence of higher frequency attributes.
  
  
    For the purposes of evaluation, we selected 70 single-word noun terms for thesaurus extraction.
    To avoid sample bias, the words were randomly selected from WordNet such that they covered a range of values for the following word properties: frequency Penn Treebank and BNC frequencies; number of senses WordNet and Macquarie senses; specificity depth in the WordNet hierarchy; concreteness distribution across WordNet subtrees.
