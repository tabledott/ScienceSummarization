 the formula for computing the probability of an alignment and target string given a source string).1 answering To simplify our work and to enable us exploit existing off-the-shelf software, in the experiments we carried out in conjunction with this paper, we assumed a flat distribution for the two steps in our 1 The distortion probabilities depicted in Figure 1 are a simplification of the distortions used in the IBM Model 4 model by Brown et al.
    (1993).
    We chose this watered down representation only for illustrative purposes.
    Our QA system implements the full-blown Model 4 statistical model described by Brown et al. generative story.
    That is, we assumed that it is equally likely to take any cut in the tree and equally likely to choose as Answer any syntactic/semantic element in an answer sentence.
  
  
    Assume that the question-answer pair in Figure 1 appears in our training corpus.
    When this happens, we know that 1977 is the correct answer.
