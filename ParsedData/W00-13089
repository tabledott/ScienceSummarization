    The data was divided into contiguous parts: sections 0-20 were used for training, sections 21-22 as a development test set, and sections 23-24 as a final test set.
    The data set sizes are shown below together with numbers of unknown words.
    The testing procedure uses a beam search to find the tag sequence with maximal probability given a sentence.
    In our experiments we used a beam of size 5.
    Increasing the beam size did not result in improved accuracy.
    The preceding tags for the word at the beginning of the sentence are regarded as having the pseudo-tag NA.
    In this way, the information that a word is the first word in a sentence is available to the tagger.
    We do not have a special end-of-sentence symbol.
    We used a tag dictionary for known words in testing.
    This was built from tags found in the training data but augmented so as to capture a few basic systematic tag ambiguities that are found in English.
    Namely, for regular verbs the -ed form can be either a VBD or
