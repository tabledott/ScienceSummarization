 label and using a specialized classifier for labeling.
    However this was combined with a slight decrease in unlabeled attachment score, hence it was not considered worth the effort.
  
  
    The parser does not attempt to assign a dependency relation to the root.
    A simple correction of assigning a default value for each language gave an improvement in the LAS as shown in Table 1.
    Out of the 45 dependency relations that the parser had to assign to a sentence, the largest number of errors occurred assigning N&lt;PRED (62), ACC (46), PIV (43), CJT (40), N&lt; (34), P&lt; (30).
    The highest number of head error occurred at the CPOS tags PRP with 193 and V with 176.
    In particular just four prepositions (em, de, a, para) accounted for 120 head errors.
    Most of the errors occur near punctuations.
    Often this is due to the fact that commas introduce relative phrases or parenthetical phrases (e.g.
