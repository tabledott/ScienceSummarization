    , vn is: A vector is normalized to have length 1 by dividing each dimension by the original vector length.
    Cosine.
    We measure the similarity of two vectors x and y by the cosine of the angle they form: The cosine ranges from 11 for vectors pointing in the same direction to 0 for orthogonal vectors.
    Other similarity measures, such as Lin&#8217;s measure (Lin 1998b), work better than the cosine in some tasks (Curran and Moens 2002; Pad&#180;o and Lapata 2007).
    However, the cosine is the most natural similarity measure in the geometric formalism we are adopting, and we stick to it as the default approach to measuring similarity.
    Vector sum.
    Two or more vectors are summed in the obvious way, by adding their values on each dimension.
    We always normalize the vectors before summing.
    The resulting vector points in the same direction as the average of the summed normalized vectors.
    We refer to it as the centroid of the vectors.
