 (While we are working on the C-rule-FSM 771 and are not yet in a final state, we have not yet recognized n itself.)
    Each new dependent 71' brings with it a multiset of nodes being lifted from the, subtree it is the root of.
    Call this multiset LM.
    The new entry will be (m, q', LMULM ) (where q is the state that m transitions to when n' is recognized as the next linear dependent.
    When we have reached a final state q of the rule-FSM m, we have recognized a complete subtree rooted in the new governor, 7/.
    Some of the dependent nodes of ?I will be both syntactic and linear dependents of n, and the others will be linear dependents of 7/, but lifted from a descendent of i.
    In addition, i may have syntactic dependents which are not realized as its own linear dependent and are lifted away.
    (No other options are possible.)
    Therefore, when we have reached the final state of a rule-FSM, we must connect up all nodes and lifting conditions before we can proceed to put an entry (in, q, L) in
