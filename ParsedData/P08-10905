e set of events 1We analyzed FrameNet (Baker et al., 1998) for insight, but found that very few of the frames are event sequences of the type characterizing narratives and scripts. rather than just pairs of related frames) and apply it to a different task (finding a coherent structured narrative in non-topic-specific text).
    More recently, Brody (2007) proposed an approach similar to caseframes that discovers highlevel relatedness between verbs by grouping verbs that share the same lexical items in subject/object positions.
    He calls these shared arguments anchors.
    Brody learns pairwise relations between clusters of related verbs, similar to the results with caseframes.
    A human evaluation of these pairs shows an improvement over baseline.
    This and previous caseframe work lend credence to learning relations from verbs with common arguments.
    We also draw from lexical chains (Morris and Hirst, 1991), indicators of text coherence from word overlap/similarity.
    We use a related notion of p
