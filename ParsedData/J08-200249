 one weight for each of the s dimensions of the feature vector.
    The probability (or score) of an assignment L according to this re-ranking model is defined as The score of an assignment L not in the top n is zero.
    We train the model to maximize the sum of log-likelihoods of the best assignments minus a quadratic regularization term.
    In this framework, we can define arbitrary features of labeled trees that capture general properties of predicate&#8211;argument structure.
    We will introduce the features of the joint re-ranking model in the context of the example parse tree shown in Figure 9.
    We model dependencies not only between the label of a Oracle upper bounds for top n non-overlapping assignments from local model on CORE and ALL arguments, using gold-standard parse trees.
