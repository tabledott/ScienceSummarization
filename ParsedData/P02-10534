    Their algorithm performs well, but it is designed for isolated adjectives, rather than phrases containing adjectives or adverbs.
    This is discussed in more detail in Section 3, along with other related work.
    The classification algorithm is evaluated on 410 reviews from Epinions2, randomly sampled from four different domains: reviews of automobiles, banks, movies, and travel destinations.
    Reviews at Epinions are not written by professional writers; any person with a Web browser can become a member of Epinions and contribute a review.
    Each of these 410 reviews was written by a different author.
    Of these reviews, 170 are not recommended and the remaining 240 are recommended (these classifications are given by the authors).
    Always guessing the majority class would yield an accuracy of 59%.
    The algorithm achieves an average accuracy of 74%, ranging from 84% for automobile reviews to 66% for movie reviews.
    The experimental results are given in Section 4.
