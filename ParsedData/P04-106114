h, the direction (generating to the left or right of the head), and the adjacency (whether or not an argument has been generated yet in the current direction, a binary variable).
    The stopping decision is estimated directly, with no smoothing.
    If a stop is generated, no more arguments are generated for the current head to the current side.
    If the current head&#8217;s argument generation does not stop, another argument is chosen using: PCHOOSE(aIh, dir).
    Here, the argument is picked conditionally on the identity of the head (which, recall, is a word class) and the direction.
    This term, also, is not smoothed in any way.
    Adjacency has no effect on the identity of the argument, only on the likelihood of termination.
    After an argument is generated, its subtree in the dependency structure is recursively generated.
    Formally, for a dependency structure D, let each word h have left dependents depsD(h,l) and right dependents depsD(h, r).
    The following recursion defines the probability
