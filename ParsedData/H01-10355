/French/Spanish/Czech and character-based model variants for Chinese, with no use of mor- phological analysis or stemming, POS-tagging, bracketing or dic- tionary resources.
  PART-OF-SPEECHTAGGER INDUCTION Part-of-speech tagging is the first of four applications covered in this paper.
  The goal of this work is to project POS analysis capabil- ities from one language to another via word-aligned parallel bilin- gual corpora.
  To do so, we use an existing POS tagger (e.g.
  Brill, 1995) to annotate the English side of the parallel corpus.
  Then, as illustrated in Figure 1 for Chinese and French, the raw tags are transferred via the word alignments, yielding an extremely noisy initial training set for the 2nd language.
  The third crucial step is to generalize from these noisy projected annotations in a robust way, yielding a stand-alone POS tagger for the new language that is con- siderably more accurate than the initial projected tags.
  Additional details of this algorithm are given in Yarowsky and Ngai (2
