722;9).
    We constructed a simple distributional space with M = 100 dimensions, i.e., those connected to the 100 most frequent co-occurrence words.
    In the case of vectors obtained from Baroni and Lenci (2010)&#8217;s DM tensor, we differentiated between phrases and sentences, due to the disparate amount of words contained in them (see Section 2.1).
    To represent phrases, we used vectors of dynamic dimensionality, since these form a richer and denser representation.
    The sentences considered in Section 4 are too large for this approach and all word vectors must be members of the same vector space.
    Hence, these sentence vectors have fixed dimensionality D = 100, consisting of the &#8220;most significant&#8221; 100 dimensions, i.e., those reflecting the 100 most frequent contexts.
  
  
    Our first experiment focused on modeling similarity judgments for short phrases gathered in human experiments.
    Distributional representations of individual words are commonly evaluated on tasks based on th
