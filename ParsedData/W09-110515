 validation experiments, whereas the results provided for papers and clinical reports have been obtained by training on the full abstracts subcorpus and testing on the papers and clinical reports subcorpus.
    The latter experiment is therefore a test of the robustness of the system when applied to different text types within the same domain.
    The evaluation is made using the precision and recall measures (Van Rijsbergen, 1979), and their harmonic mean, F-score.
    In the negation finding task, a negation token is correctly classified if it has been classified as being at the beginning or inside the negation signal.
    We also evaluate the percentage of negation signals that have been correctly identified.
    In the scope finding task, a token is correctly classified if it has been correctly classified as being inside or outside of the scope of all the negation signals that there are in the sentence.
    This means that when there is more than one negation signal in the sentence, the token has to be co
