traditions in semantic classification, is very appealing, as it attempts to capture &amp;quot;typical&amp;quot; properties of classes of words.
    However, it is not clear at all that unrestricted language is indeed structured the way it is assumed by class based models.
    In particular, it is not clear that word cooccurrence patterns can be structured and generalized to class cooccurrence parameters without losing too much information.
    This paper suggests an alternative approach which assumes that class based generalizations should be avoided, and therefore eliminates the intermediate level of word classes.
    Like some of the class based models, we use a similarity metric to measure the similarity between cooccurrence patterns of words.
    But then, rather than using this metric to construct a set of word classes, we use it to identify the most specific analogies that can be drawn for each specific estimation.
    Thus, to estimate the probability of an unobserved cooccurrence of words, we use data
