 CDG parsing is done in the following three steps: In this section, we will show, through a step-by-step example, that the filtering algorithms can be effectively used to narrow down the structural ambiguities of CDG parsing.
    The Example We use a PP-attachment example.
    Consider sentence (4).
    Because of the three consecutive prepositional phrases (PPs), this sentence has many structural ambiguities.
    (4) Put the block on the floor on the table in the room.
    One of the possible syntactic structures is shown in Figure 42.
    To simplify the following discussion, we treat the grammatical symbols V. NP, and PP as terminal symbols (words), since the analysis of the internal structures of such phrases is irrelevant to the point being made.
    The correspondence between such simplified dependency structures and the equivalent phrase structures should be clear.
    Formally, the input sentence that we will parse with CDG is (5).
