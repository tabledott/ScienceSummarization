 for other languages.
    Another source of potential error is that the average sentence length of Arabic is much higher than other languages (around 37 words/sentence).
    However, if we only look at performance for sentences of length less than 30, the labeled accuracy is still only 71%.
    The fact that Arabic has only 1500 training instances might also be problematic.
    For example if we train on 200, 400, 800 and the full training set, labeled accuracies are 54%, 60%, 62% and 67%.
    Clearly adding more data is improving performance.
    However, when compared to the performance of Slovene (1500 training instances) and Spanish (3300 instances), it appears that Arabic parsing is lagging.
  
  
    We have presented results showing that the spanning tree dependency parsing framework of McDonald et al. (McDonald et al., 2005b; McDonald and Pereira, 2006) generalizes well to languages other than English.
    In the future we plan to extend these models in two ways.
    First, we plan on examining the pe
