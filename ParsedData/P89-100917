  PSEUDO-PARTIT I VE  NPS Partitive and pseudo-partitive noun phrases, ex- emplified by half  of  the carrots and three pounds of carrots respectively, are very common in recipes; EPICURE is capable of generating both.
  So, for example, the pseudo-partitive noun phrase three pounds of carrots (as represented by the knowledge base entity shown in figure 1) is generated from the deep semantic structure shown in figure 7 via the surface semantic structure shown in figure 8.
  The generation of partitive noun phrases re- quires slightly different semantic structures, de- scribed in greater detail in Dale (1989b).
