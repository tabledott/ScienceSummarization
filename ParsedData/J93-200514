 certain transformations to lexical meanings.
    Thus for every predicate, Q, we can generate its opposition, -Q.
    Similarly, these two predicates can be related temporally to generate the transition events defining this opposition.
    These operations include but may not be limited to: negation; &lt;, temporal precedence; &gt;, temporal succession; =, temporal equivalence; and act, an operator adding agency to an argument.
    We will call the concept space generated by these operations the Projective Conclusion Space of a specific quale for a lexical item.
    To return to the example of tape above, the predicates read and copy are related to the telic value by just such an operation, while predicates such as mount and dismount&#8212;i.e. unmount&#8212;are related to the formal role.
    Following the previous discussion, with mounted as the predicate Q, successive applications of the negation and temporal precedence operators derives the transition verbs mount and dismount.'
