ul for tasks such as summarization and question answering (Clark, Steedman, and Curran 2004).
    Furthermore, Bos et al. (2004) and Bos (2005) have demonstrated that the output of CCGbank parsers can be successfully translated into Kamp and Reyle&#8217;s (1993) Discourse Representation Theory structures, to support question answering and the textual entailment task (Bos and Markert 2005).
    We hope that these results can be ported to other corpora and other similarly expressive grammar formalisms.
    We also hope that our experiences will be useful in designing guidelines for future treebanks.
    Although implementational details will differ across formalisms, similar problems and questions to those that arose in our work will be encountered in any attempt to extract expressive grammars from annotated corpora.
    Because CCGbank preserves most of the linguistic information in the Treebank in a somewhat less noisy form, we hope that others will find it directly helpful for inducing grammars and statistic
