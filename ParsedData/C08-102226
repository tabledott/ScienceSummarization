			This is one of the errors themodel never detects: a fact which is not surpris ing when we consider that this noun occurs only four times in the whole of the training data.

			In developing this model, our first aim was not to create something which learns like a human, butsomething that works in the best and most effi cient possible way.
			However, it is interesting to see whether human learners and classifiers display similar patterns of errors in preposition choice.This information has twofold value: as well as being of pedagogical assistance to instructors of En glish L2, were the classifier to display student-like error patterns, insights into ?error triggers?
			could be derived from the L2 pedagogical literature
