e parse y for x with transition sequence C0,m is thus the sum of the feature representations/scores of the configurationtransition pairs in C0,m: Finally, the configuration of the new hypothesis is obtained by evaluating t(h.c) (line 11).
    The new hypothesis is then inserted into TMP in score-sorted order (line 12).
    The pruning parameters b1 and b2 determine the number of hypotheses allowed in the beam and at the same time control the tradeoff between syntactic and morphological ambiguity.
    First, we extract the b1 highest scoring hypotheses with distinct dependency trees.
    Then we extract the b2 highest scoring remaining hypotheses, which will typically be tagging variants of dependency trees that are already in the beam.
    In this way, we prevent the beam from getting filled up with too many tagging variants of the same dependency tree, which was found to be harmful in preliminary experiments.
    One final thing to note about the inference algorithm is that the notion of permissibility for a
