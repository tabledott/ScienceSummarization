  Using Emoticons To Reduce Dependency In Machine Learning Techniques For Sentiment Classification
  
    Sentiment Classification seeks to identify a piece of text according to its author&#8217;s general feeling toward their subject, be it positive or negative.
    Traditional machine learning techniques have been applied to this problem with reasonable success, but they have been shown to work well only when there is a good match between the training and test data with respect to topic.
    This paper demonstrates that match with respect to domain and time is also important, and presents preliminary experiments with training data labeled with emoticons, which has the potential of being independent of domain, topic and time.
  
  
    Recent years have seen an increasing amount of research effort expended in the area of understanding sentiment in textual resources.
    A sub-topic of this research is that of Sentiment Classification.
    That is, given a problem text, can computational methods determine if
