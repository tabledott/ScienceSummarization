on in which to extend the present work is toward across-sentence inferences.
    Example 30 &amp;quot;John drank from the faucet&amp;quot; (Lehnert 1978, p. 221).
    Example 31 &amp;quot;John filled his canteen at the spring&amp;quot; (Ibid.).
    Metonymy seems closely related to the work on non-logical inferencing done by Schank (Schank 1973) and the Yale Group (Schank 1975; Schank and Abelson 1977; Schank and Riesbeck 1981).
    For example, Lehnert (1978) observes that just one inference is required for understanding both (30) and (31).
    The inference, that water comes from the faucet in (30) and the spring in (31), is an instance of PRODUCER FOR PRODUCT in which the faucet and spring are PRODUCERs and water is the PRODUCT.
    However, the inference is not a metonymy because it is from unused cases of the verbs 'drink' and 'fill' whereas metonymy only occurs in the presence of a violated selection restriction, that neither (30) nor (31) contain.
    Metaphor recognition in the met* method is related
