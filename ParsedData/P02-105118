    Then, we use the IdentiFinder named entity identifier (Bikel et al., 1999) to identify all named entities in the top retrieved documents for each sub-phrase.
    All named entities of the type of the named entity in question (e.g., PERSON) found in the retrieved documents and that contain the sub-phrase used in the search are scored using our transliteration module and added to the list of translation candidates, and the re-scoring is repeated.
