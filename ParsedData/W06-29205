r theories related to dependency grammar are word grammar (Hudson, 1984) and link grammar (Sleator and Temperley, 1993).
    Some relatively recent rule-based full dependency parsers are Kurohashi and Nagao (1994) for Japanese, Oflazer (1999) for Turkish, Tapanainen and J&#168;arvinen (1997) for English and Elworthy (2000) for English and Japanese.
    While phrase structure parsers are usually evaluated with the GEIG/PARSEVAL measures of precision and recall over constituents (Black et al., 1991), Lin (1995) and others have argued for an alternative, dependency-based evaluation.
    That approach is based on a conversion from constituent structure to dependency structure by recursively defining a head for each constituent.
    The same idea was used by Magerman (1995), who developed the first &#8220;head table&#8221; for the Penn Treebank (Marcus et al., 1994), and Collins (1996), whose constituent parser is internally based on probabilities of bilexical dependencies, i.e. dependencies between two words.
