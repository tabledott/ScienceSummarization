  If the situation arises in which more than one variable is associated with the :EXT markers, it is assumed that there is an error in the word definition.
  N Note that the :INT and :EXT markers how up only in the RLCS.
  The CLCS does not include any such markers, since it is intended to be a language-independent r presentation for the source- and target-language sentences.
  Thematic divergence is one of three types of possible positioning variations that force the G?T4 to be overridden.
  Two additional positioning variations are promo- tional and demotional divergences, which will be defined in the next two sections.
  Whereas thematic divergence involves a repositioning of two satellites relative to a head, promot
