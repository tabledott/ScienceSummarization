er, there is no analysis of the statistical significance of these correlations.
    In Swerts and Ostendorf (1995), prosodic as well as textual features are shown to be correlated with their independently obtained (but fairly trivial) discourse segmentations of travel-planning interactions, with statistical significance.
    Hearst's (1994) TextTiling algorithm structures expository text into sequential segments based on term repetition.
    Hearst (1994) uses information retrieval metrics (see Section 4.1) to evaluate two versions of TextTiling against independently derived segmentations produced by at least three of seven human judges.
    Precision was .66 for the best version, compared with .81 for humans; recall was .61 compared with .71 for humans.
    The use of term repetition (and a related notion of lexical cohesion) is not unique to Hearst's work; related studies include Morris and Hirst (1991), Youmans (1991), Kozima (1993), and Reynar (1994).
    Unlike Hearst's work, these studies either use seg
