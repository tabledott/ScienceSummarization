ers; and 0.88 with the combined ME and Bayesian classifiers).
    Our work is novel in that we are the first to report specific performance results for a preposition error detector trained and evaluated on general corpora.
    While the training for the ME classifier was done on a separate corpus, and it was this classifier that contributed the most to the high precision, it should be noted that some of the filters were tuned on the evaluation corpus.
    Currently, we are in the course of annotating additional ESL essays for preposition errors in order to obtain a larger-sized test set.
    While most NLP systems are a balancing act between precision and recall, the domain of designing grammatical error detection systems is distinguished in its emphasis on high precision over high recall.
    Essentially, a false positive, i.e., an instance of an error detection system informing a student that a usage is incorrect when in fact it is indeed correct, must be reduced at the expense of a few genuine errors slipp
