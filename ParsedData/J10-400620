otential of ternary distributional structures is the major reason for the lack of unification in corpus-based semantics.
    The debate in DSMs has so far mostly focused on the context choice&#8212;for example, lexical collocates vs. documents (Sahlgren 2006; Turney and Pantel 2010)&#8212;or on the costs and benefits of having structured contexts (Pad&#180;o and Lapata 2007; Rothenh&#168;ausler and Sch&#168;utze 2009).
    Although we see the importance of these issues, we believe that a real breakthrough in DSMs can only be achieved by overcoming the limits of current two-way models of distributional data.
    We propose here the alternative DM approach, in which the core geometrical structure of a distributional model is a three-way object, namely a third-order tensor.
    As in structured DSMs, we adopt word&#8211;link&#8211;word tuples as the most suitable way to capture distributional facts.
    However, we extend and generalize this assumption, by proposing that, once they are formalized as a threeway t
