ually redundant because the subject can be recognized purely structurally.
  The -TMP tag here marks time (TeMPoral) phrases.
  Our use of "small clauses" follows one simple rule:, every S maps into a single predication, so here the predicate-argument structure would be something like consider(I, fool(Kris)).
  ARGUMENT-ADJUNCT STRUCTURE In a well developed predicate-argument scheme, it would seem desirable to label each argument of a predicate with an appropriate semantic label to identify its role with respect o that predicate.
