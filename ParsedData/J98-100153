e Brown Corpus (one million words), the relatively common word ash occurs only eight times, and only once in its sense as tree.
    The sense ashes = remains of cremated body, although common enough to be included in learner's dictionaries such as the LDOCE and the OALD, does not appear, and it would be nearly impossible to find the dozen or so senses in many everyday dictionaries such as the CED.
    In addition, the many possible co-occurrences for a given polysemous word are unlikely to be found in even a very large corpus, or they occur too infrequently to be significant.'
    Smoothing is used to get around the problem of infrequently occurring events, and in particular to ensure that non-observed events are not assumed to have a probability of zero.
    The best-known smoothing methods are that of Turing-Good (Good 1953), which hypothesizes a binomial distribution of events, and that of Jelinek and Mercer (1985), which combines estimated parameters on distinct subparts of the training corpus.'
