imes, and report the average directed accuracy achieved.
    The results are shown in Table 1.
    We compare to work by Cohen et al. (2008) and Cohen and Smith (2009).
    Looking at Table 1, we can first of all see the benefit of randomized initialization over the harmonic initializer for DMV.
    We can also see a large gain by adding smoothing to DMV, topping even the logistic normal prior.
    The unsmoothed EVG actually performs worse than unsmoothed DMV, but both smoothed versions improve even on smoothed DMV.
    Adding lexical information (L-EVG) yields a moderate further improvement.
    As the greatest improvement comes from moving to model EVG smoothed-skip-head, we show in Table 2 the most probable arguments for each val, dir, using the mean of the appropriate variational Dirichlet.
    For d = right, v = 1, P(A|v, d) largely seems to acts as a way of grouping together various verb types, while for d = left, v = 0 the model finds that nouns tend to act as the closest left argument. tion, accordin
