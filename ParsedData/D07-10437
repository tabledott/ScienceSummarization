ss is symmetrical to homogeneity.
			Inorder to satisfy the completeness criteria, a clustering must assign all of those datapoints that are members of a single class to a single cluster.
			To eval uate completeness, we examine the distribution of cluster assignments within each class.
			In a perfectlycomplete clustering solution, each of these distribu tions will be completely skewed to a single cluster.We can evaluate this degree of skew by calculat ing the conditional entropy of the proposed clusterdistribution given the class of the component dat apoints, H(K|C).
			In the perfectly complete case, H(K|C) = 0.
			However, in the worst case scenario, 411each class is represented by every cluster with a dis tribution equal to the distribution of cluster sizes, H(K|C) is maximal and equals H(K).
			Finally, in the degenerate case where H(K) = 0, when there is a single cluster, we define completeness to be 1.
			Therefore, symmetric to the calculation above, we define completeness as: c = { 1 if H(K,C) = 0 1
