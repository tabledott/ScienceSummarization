it.
    The exact formula is: where subjfreq(patterni) is the frequency of patterni in subjective training sentences, and freq(patterni) is the frequency of patterni in all training sentences.
    (This may also be viewed as the precision of the pattern on the training data.)
    Finally, we use two thresholds to select extraction patterns that are strongly associated with subjectivity in the training data.
    We choose extraction patterns for which freq(patterni) &gt; 01 and Pr(subjective | patterni) &gt; 02.
    Figure 3 shows some patterns learned by our system, the frequency with which they occur in the training data (FREQ) and the percentage of times they occur in subjective sentences (%SUBJ).
    For example, the first two rows show the behavior of two similar expressions using the verb asked.
    100% of the sentences that contain asked in the passive voice are subjective, but only 63% of the sentences that contain asked in the active voice are subjective.
