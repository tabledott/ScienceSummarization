ize some objective function on a set of development data.
    Because the standard objectives (e.g., 1-best BLEU, expected BLEU, marginal likelihood) are not convex, only approximate solutions to the optimization problem are available, and the parameters learned are typically only locally optimal and may strongly depend on parameter initialization and search hyperparameters.
    Additionally, stochastic optimization and search techniques, such as minimum error rate training (Och, 2003) and Markov chain Monte Carlo methods (Arun et al., 2010),3 constitute a second, more obvious source of noise in the optimization procedure.
    This variation in the parameter vector affects the quality of the model measured on both development data and held-out test data, independently of any ex- explored regularization of MERT to improve generperimental manipulation.
    Thus, when trying to de- alization on test sets.
