ased language model such as Chelba and Jelinek (2000) or Roark (2001).
    Further experiments are planned on the generalizability of our classifier to text from other sources (e.g. newspaper articles, web pages); to accomplish this we will add higher level text as negative training data.
    We also plan to test these techniques on languages other than English, and incorporate them with an information retrieval system to create a tool that may be used by teachers to help select reading material for their students.
