99), D (van Dongen, 2000), micro averaged precision and recall (Dhillon et al, 2003)), F-measure relies on a post-processing step in which each cluster is assigned to a class.
			These techniques share certain problems.
			First, they calculate the goodness not only of the given clustering solution, but also of the cluster-class matching.
			Therefore, in order for the goodness of two clustering solutions to be compared using one these measures, an identicalpost-processing algorithm must be used.
			This problem can be trivially addressed by fixing the classcluster matching function and including it in the def inition of the measure as in H . However, a secondand more critical problem is the ?problem of matching?
			(Meila, 2007).
			In calculating the similarity between a hypothesized clustering and a ?true?
			cluster ing, these measures only consider the contributions from those clusters that are matched to a target class.This is a major problem, as two significantly differ ent clusterings can result in id
