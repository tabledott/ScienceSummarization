 nominal predicates than verbal predicates.
    Unfortunately, this group did not submit a systemdescription paper so it is not clear what was their approach.

    The number in parentheses next to the WSJ+Brown scores indicates the system rank in the corresponding data set.
    Systems can mitigate the inherent differences between verbal and nominal predicates with different models for the two sub-problems.
    This was indeed the approach taken by two out of the top three systems (johansson and che).
    Johansson and Nugues (2008) developed different models for verbal and nominal predicates and implemented separate feature selection processes for each model.
