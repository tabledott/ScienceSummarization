or element/object produces a result1.
    For example, ammonia produces nitric oxide.
    We evaluate this relation on the CHEM corpus.
    For each semantic relation, we manually extracted a small set of seed examples.
    The seeds were used for both Espresso as well as RH02.
    Table 1 lists a sample of the seeds as well as sample outputs from Espresso.
    We implemented the systems outlined in Section 4.1, except for GI03, and applied them to the TREC and CHEM datasets.
    For each output set, per relation, we evaluate the precision of the system by extracting a random sample of instances (50 for the TREC corpus and 20 for the CHEM corpus) and evaluating their quality manually using two human judges (a total of 680 instances were annotated per judge).
    For each instance, judges may assign a score of 1 for correct, 0 for incorrect, and 1/2 for partially correct.
    Example instances that were judged partially correct include &#8220;analyst is-a manager&#8221; and &#8220;pilot is-a teacher&#8221;.
