t set using a list of 57472 Chinese words from the NMSU CHSEG segmenter (described in the next section).
    This greedy algorithm produced an initial score of F=64.4.
    A sequence of 2897 transformations was learned from the training set; applied to the test set, they improved the score from F=64.4 to 84.9, a 57.8% error reduction.
    From a simple Chinese word list, the rule-based algorithm was thus able to produce asegmentation score comparable to segmentation algorithms developed with a large amount of domain knowledge (as we will see in the next section).
    This score was improved further when combining the character-as-word (CAW) and the maximum matching algorithms.
    In the maximum matching algorithm described above, when a sequence of characters occurred in the text, and no subset of the sequence was present in the word list, the entire sequence was treated as a single word.
    This often resulted in words containing 10 or more characters, which is very unlikely in Chinese.
    In this experim
