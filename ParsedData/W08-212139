fferent evaluation measures, e.g., Exact Match or Perfect Proposition F1 scores, and different views of the data, e.g., only nonprojective dependencies or NomBank versus PropBank frames.
    Table 12: Summary of system architectures that participated in the closed and open challenges.
    The closed-challenge systems are sorted by macro labeled Fl score on the WSJ+Brown corpus.
    Because some open-challenge systems did not implement syntactic parsing, these systems are sorted by labeled Fl score of the semantic dependencies on the WSJ+Brown corpus.
    Only the systems that have a corresponding paper in the proceedings are included.
    Systems that participated in both challenges are listed only in the closed challenge.
    Acronyms used: D -syntactic dependencies, P - predicate, A - argument, I - identification, C -classification.
    Overall arch. stands for the complete system architecture; D Arch. stands for the architecture of the syntactic parser; D Comb. indicates if the final parser output was gene
