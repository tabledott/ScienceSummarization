hreshold, the algorithm stops and returns the words in the collocation network as a description of the event.
			Figure 2 sketches an example.
			The collocations ?Chanchu?s path?, ?Typhoon eye?, and ?Chanchu affects?
			are added into the network in sequence based on their MI.
			We have two alternatives to add the collocations to the event description.
			The first method adds the collocations which have the highest mutual information as discussed above.
			In contrast, the second method adds the collocations which have the highest product of mutual information and change of temporal mutual information.

			Experiments and Discussions Temporal Mutual Information versus Mutual Information In the experiments, we adopt the ICWSM weblog data set (Teng &amp; Chen, 2007; ICWSM, 2007).
			This data set collected from May 1, 2006 through May 20, 2006 is about 20 GB.
			Without loss of generality, we use the English weblog of 2,734,518 articles for analysis.
