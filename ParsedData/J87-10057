orm must have the following structure: all(r, representative(r) , ...) since the universal is outermost.
    Now the existential is within the scope of the universal by hypothesis, and since it provides a restriction on the range of the variable r, it must occur in the restriction of the quantifier.
    Thus, we have: all(r, representative(r) &amp; some(c, company(c), of(c,r)), ...saw(r,$)...) But where can the quantifier most be put to bind the variable s corresponding to the samples seen?
    It must outscope its occurrence in the body of the universal, but it must also by hypothesis outscope the existential in the restriction of the universal.
    To outscope both, it must outscope the universal itself, but this violates the assumed scope relations.
    Thus, no such reading is possible.
    By a similar argument, it follows from the logical structure of English that in general a quantifier from elsewhere in a sentence cannot come after the quantifier associated with a head noun and before the quantifier a
