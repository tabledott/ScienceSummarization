author1 and author 2 in the author identification application.
    During the training phase, we attempt to estimate Pr(wI source) for all words w in the vocabulary and all sources.
    Then during the testing phase, we score all documents as follows and select high scoring documents as being relatively likely to have been generated by the source of interest.
    In the sense disambiguation application, the 100-word context surrounding instances of a polysemous word (e.g., sentence) are treated very much like a document.'
    That is, during the testing phase, we are given a new instance of a polysemous word, e.g., sentence, and asked to assign it to one or more senses.
    We score the words in the 100-word context using the formula given above, and assign the instance to sense1 if the score is large.
    The conditional probabilities, Pr(w1 sense), are determined during the training phase by counting the number of times that each word in the vocabulary was found near each sense of the polysemous word (and t
