he SAS screen is divided into three sections: one for writing programs, one for the system&#8217;s response as it executes the program, and a third for output tables and charts. semi-super (+ constraints): The screen is divided into three sections: one for writing programs, one for the system&#8217;s response as it executes the program, and a third for output tables and charts. bit more explicit: Here we have introduced explicit conditioning events L = l and L = s to state that that the sentence in question is either the long version or the short version.
    We do this because in order to get the equation that K&amp;M (and ourselves) start with, it is necessary to assume the following This means we assume that the probability of, say, s as a short (compressed) sentence is simply its probability as a sentence.
    This will be, in general, false.
    One would hope that real compressed sentences are more probable as a member of the set of compressed sentences than they are as simply a member of all English se
