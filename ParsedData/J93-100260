e top node and cover the same input have their top nodes merged, being treated by higher level structures as a single sub-analysis).
    However, we generalize the technique of atomic category packing described by Tomita, driven by atomic category names, to complex feature-based categories following Alshawi (1992): the packing of sub-analyses is driven by the subsumption relationship between the feature values in their top nodes.
    An analysis is only packed into one that has already been found if its top node is subsumed by, or is equal to that of the one already found.
    An analysis, once packed, will thus never need to be unpacked during parsing (as in Tomita's system) since the value of each feature will always be uniquely determined.
    Our use of local ambiguity packing does not in practice seem to result in exponentially bad performance with respect to sentence length (cf.
    Johnson 1989) since we have been able to generate packed parse forests for sentences of over 30 words having many thousand
