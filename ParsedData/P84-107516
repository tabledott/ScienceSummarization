    Such lexical rules have been used for encoding the active/passive dichotomy, &amp;quot;there&amp;quot; insertion, extraposition, and other socalled relation-changing rules.
    The PATR-II formalism is a completely declarative formalism, as evidenced by its denotational semantics and the order-independence of its definition.
    Modularity is achieved through the ability to define primitive templates and lexical rules that are shared among lexical items, as well as by the declarative nature of the grammar formalism itself, removing problems of interaction of rules.
    Rules are guaranteed to always mean the same thing, regardless of the environment of other rules in which they are placed.
    Implementability is an empirical matter, given credence by the fact that we now have three implementations of the formalism.
    One desirable aspect of the simplicity and declarative nature of the formalis
