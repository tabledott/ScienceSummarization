ated models of translational equivalence among word types can play a central role in both kinds of applications.
    Applications where word order is not essential include For these applications, empirically estimated models have a number of advantages over handcrafted models such as on-line versions of bilingual dictionaries.
    Two of the advantages are the possibility of better coverage and the possibility of frequent updates by nonexpert users to keep up with rapidly evolving vocabularies.
    A third advantage is that statistical models can provide more accurate information about the relative importance of different translations.
    Such information is crucial for applications such as cross-language information retrieval (CUR).
    In the vector space approach to CUR, the query vector Q' is in a different language (a different vector space) from the document vectors D. A word-to-word translation model T can map Q' into a vector Q in the vector space of D. In order for the mapping to be accurate, T must
