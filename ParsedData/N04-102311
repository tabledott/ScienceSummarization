000 candidates need to be considered in the -best list.
    In addition, the parallel hyperplanes separating and actually are unable to distinguish good translations from bad translations, since they are not trained to distinguish any translations in .
    Furthermore, many good translations in may differ greatly from , since there are multiple references.
    These facts cause problems for the applicability of reranking algorithms.
    Our first attempt to handle this problem is to redefine the notion of good translations versus bad translations.
    Instead of separating and , we say the top of the -best translations are good translations, and the bottom of the -best translations are bad translations, where .
    Then we look for parallel hyperplanes splitting the top translations and bottom translations for each sentence.
    Figure 1 illustrates this situation, where and .
    Furthermore, if we only look for the hyperplanes to separate the good and the bad translations, we, in fact, discard the order inf
