    For example, Figure 25 shows an example error of the attachment of a relative clause.
    The correct answer is that the Examples of disambiguation errors. subject of yielded is acre, but this cannot be determined only by the relation among yield, grapes, and acre.
    The resolution of these errors requires a novel type of feature function.
    Errors of argument/modifier distinction are prominent in deep syntactic analysis, because arguments and modifiers are not explicitly distinguished in the evaluation of CFG parsers.
    Figure 25 shows an example of the argument/modifier distinction of a to-infinitive clause.
    In this case, the to-infinitive clause is a complement of tempts.
    The subcategorization frame of tempts seems responsible for this problem.
    However, the disambiguation model wrongly assigned a lexical entry for a transitive verb because of the sp
