 because of the lack of a shared training and test dataset.
    Furthermore, none of the published work of which we are aware has systematically compared the contribution of different feature types to the AA task, and only one (Powers et al., 2002) assesses the ease with which the system can be subverted given some knowledge of the features deployed.
    We have shown experimentally how rank preference models can be effectively deployed for automated assessment of ESOL free-text answers.
    Based on a range of feature types automatically extracted using generic text processing techniques, our system achieves performance close to the upper bound for the task.
    Ablation tests highlight the contribution of each feature type to the overall performance, while significance of the resulting improvements in correlation with human scores has been calculated.
    A comparison between regression and rank preference models further supports our approach.
