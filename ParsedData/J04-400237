f target language sentences.
    Each hypothesis is the translation of a part of the source language sentence.
    A hypothesis is extended by appending one target word.
    The set of all hypotheses can be structured as a graph with a source node representing the sentence start, goal nodes representing complete translations, and intermediate nodes representing partial translations.
    There is a directed edge between hypotheses n1 and n2 if the hypothesis n2 is obtained by appending one word to hypothesis n1.
    Each edge has associated costs resulting from the contributions of all feature functions.
    Finally, our search problem can be reformulated as finding the optimal path through this graph.
    &#732; In the first step, we determine the set of all source phrases in f for which an applicable alignment template exists.
    Every possible application of an alignment template z = (FJy1 , EI~1 , &#732;A) to a subsequence f j+J&#65533;&#8722;1 of the source sentence is called an alignment j template inst
