mSent and AutSent.
    The correlation coefficient for AnsWdRecall to HumSent in our test set is 98%, and from HumSent to AutSent is also 98%.
    With respect to ease of answer key preparation, P&amp;R and AutSent are clearly superior, since they use the publisher-provided answer key.
    HumSent requires human annotation for each question.
    We found this annotation to be of moderate difficulty.
    Finally, we note that precision, as well as recall, will be useful to evaluate systems that can return clauses or phrases, possibly constructed, rather than whole sentence extracts as answers.
    Since most national standardized tests feature a large multiple-choice component, many available benchmarks are multiple-choice exams.
    Also, although our short-answer metrics do not impose a penalty for incorrect answers, multiplechoice exams, such as the Scholastic Aptitude Tests, do.
    In real-world applications, it might be important that the system be able to assign a confidence level to its answers.
