exical association attachment procedure.
    First, we note that the task of judging attachment on the basis of verb, noun and preposition alone is not easy.
    The human judges had overall error rates of 10-15%.
    (Of course this is considerably better than always choosing noun attachment.)
    The lexical association procedure based on t-scores is somewhat worse than the human judges, with an error rate of 22%, but this also is an improvement over simply choosing the nearest attachment site.
    If we restrict the lexical association procedure to choose attachment only in cases where its confidence is greater than about 95% (i.e., where t is greater than 2.1), we get attachment judgements on 607 of the 880 test sentences, with an overall error rate of 15% (Table 3).
    On these same sentences, the human judges also showed slight improvement.
    Our model takes frequency of cooccurrence as evidence of an underlying relationship, but makes no attempt to determine what sort of relationship is involved.
