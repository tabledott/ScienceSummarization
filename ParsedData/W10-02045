s as having the same emotion.
    The General Inquirer (Stone et al., 1966) has 11,788 words labeled with 182 categories of word tags, including positive and negative semantic orientation.3 It also has certain other affect categories, such as pleasure, arousal, feeling, and pain but these have not been exploited to a significant degree by the natural language processing community.
    Work in emotion detection can be roughly classified into that which looks for specific emotion denoting words (Elliott, 1992), that which determines tendency of terms to co-occur with seed words whose emotions are known (Read, 2004), that which uses hand-coded rules (Neviarouskaya et al., 2009), and that which uses machine learning and a number of emotion features, including emotion denoting words (Alm et al., 2005).
    Much of this recent work focuses on six emotions studied by Ekman (1992).
    These emotions&#8212; joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, and surprise&#8212; are a subset of the eight proposed in Plutchik (1980).
