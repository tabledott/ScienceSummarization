ty in dependency parsing, even though it still holds true that the structures (6&#8211;7) in Figure 4 cannot be parsed incrementally.
    This raises the question how frequently these structures are found in practical parsing, which is equivalent to asking how often the arc-eager algorithm deviates from strictly incremental processing.
    Although the answer obviously depends on which language and which theoretical framework we consider, we will attempt to give at least a partial answer to this question in the next section.
    Before that, however, we want to relate our results to some previous work on context-free parsing.
    First of all, it should be observed that the terms top-down and bottom-up take on a slightly different meaning in the context of dependency parsing, as compared to their standard use in context-free parsing.
    Since there are no nonterminal nodes in a dependency graph, top-down construction means that a head is attached to a dependent before the dependent is attached to (some of) i
