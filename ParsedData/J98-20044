    (See Figure 1.)
    In our experiments, we use only tag sequences (as given in the test data) for parsing.
    More accurate probability estimates should be attainable using lexical information in future experiments, as more detail usually leads to better statistics, but lexicalized figures of merit are beyond the scope of the research described here.
    Note that our &amp;quot;ideal&amp;quot; figure is simply a heuristic, since there is no guarantee that a constituent that scores well on this measure will appear in the correct parse of a sentence.
    For example, there may be a very large number of low-probability derivations of N' 1c, which are combined here to give a high value, but a parse of the 1, sentence can only include one of these derivations, making it unlikely that 1\141,k appears in the most probable parse of the sentence.
    On the other hand, there is no reason to believe that such cases ar
