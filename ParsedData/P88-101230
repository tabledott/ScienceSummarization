s predicates impose on their arguments, allowing for metonymy.
    Implementations of different orders of interpretation, or different sorts of interaction among syntax, compositional semantics, and local pragmatics, can then be seen as different orders of search for a proof of s(0, n, e).
    In a syntax-first order of interpretation, one would try first to prove all the &amp;quot;syntactic&amp;quot; atoms, such as np(i, j. x), before any of the &amp;quot;local pragmatic&amp;quot; atoms, such as p'(e, c).
    Verb-driven interpretation would first try to prove vp(j , k, p, args, req) by proving v(i, j, w) and then using the information in the requirements associated with the verb to drive the search for the arguments of the verb, by deriving subst(req, cons(c,args)) before trying to prove the various np atoms.
    But more fluid orders of interpretation are obviously possible.
    This formulation allows one to prove those things first which are easiest to prove.
    It is also easy to see how processing cou
