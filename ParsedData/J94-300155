the second occurs in the possessive suffix Im, meaning 'my.'
    Both suffixes can be used together, and the harmony is illustrated by the different realizations of the abstract vowels in the forms apartmanlArIm and adreslArIm.
    These appear as apartmanlarim 'my apartments' and adreslerim 'my addresses.'
    Using only the simple non-feature notation we started out with, we can describe this variation with the following four rules: The proper surface forms for these words are produced if these rules are ordered as we have given them&#8212;inserting front vowels first&#8212;and if each of them is applied from left to right.
    However, applying the rules in this way gives the wrong result when we create the dative possessive form of adres instead of the possessive plural.

    But the rules as given will map adresImA to adresima instead.
    This is because the e
