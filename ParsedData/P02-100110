ted FSAs), replace all weights with their reciprocals, and compose the result with f.9 6P(w, x) defines the source model, and is often an &#8220;identity FST&#8221; that requires w = x, really just an FSA.
    7We propose also using n-tape automata to generalize to &#8220;branching noisy channels&#8221; (a case of dendroid distributions).
    In Ew,x P(v|w)P(v,|w)P(w, x)P(y|x), the true transcription w can be triply constrained by observing speech y and two errorful transcriptions v, v', which independently depend on w. 8A corresponding problem exists in the joint case, but may be easily avoided there by first pruning non-coaccessible states.
    9It suffices to make g unambiguous (one accepting path per string), a weaker condition than determinism.
    When this is not possible (as in the inverse of Fig.
    1b, whose conditionalizaNormalization is particularly important because it enables the use of log-linear (maximum-entropy) parameterizations.
    Here one defines each arc weight, coin weight, or regexp
