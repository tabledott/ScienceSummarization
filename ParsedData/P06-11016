 senses i and j are (m, n)-cousins if their closest least common ij to denote that i and j are (m, n)-cousins.
    Thus coordinate terms are (1,1)-cousins; technically the hypernym relation may also be seen as a specific case of this representation; an immediate parent in the hypernym hierarchy is a (1, 0)-cousin, and the k-th ancestor is a (k, 0)-cousin.
    A semantic taxonomy such as WordNet enforces certain taxonomic constraints which disallow particular taxonomies T. For example, the ISA transitivity constraint in WordNet requires that each synset inherits the hypernyms of its hypernym, and the part-inheritance constraint requires that each synset inherits the meronyms of its hypernyms.
    For the case of hyponym acquisition we enforce the following two taxonomic constraints on the hypernym and (m, n)-cousin relations: Constraint (1) requires that the each synset inherits the hypernyms of its direct hypernym; constraint (2) simply defines the (m, n)-cousin relation in terms of the atomic hypernym relati
