hich were manually translated into the functional GEOQUERY language (Tang and Mooney, 2001).
    The average sentence length is 7.48, much shorter than ROBOCUP.
    250 of the queries were also translated into Spanish, Japanese and Turkish, resulting in a smaller, multilingual data set.
    For each domain, there was a minimal set of initial rules representing knowledge needed for translating basic domain entities.
    These rules were always included in a lexicon.
    For example, in GEOQUERY, the initial rules were: NUM &#8212;* (x, x), for all x ER; CITY &#8212;* (c, cityid(&#8217;c&#8217;, )), for all city names c (e.g. new york); and similar rules for other types of names (e.g. rivers).
    Name translations were provided for the multilingual data set (e.g.
    CITY &#8212;* (nyuu yooku, cityid(&#8217;new york&#8217;, )) for Japanese).
    Standard 10-fold cross validation was used in our experiments.
    A semantic parser was learned from the training set.
    Then the learned parser was used to transla
