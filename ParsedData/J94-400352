    In this section we give a detailed analysis of the selections performed by the algorithm and, in particular, analyze the cases when it failed.
    The analysis of these modes suggests possible improvements of the model and indicates its limitations.
    As described earlier, the algorithm's failure includes either the cases for which the method was not applicable (no selection), or the cases for which it made an incorrect selection.
    The following paragraphs list various reasons for both types.
    At the end of the section, we discuss the possibility of adapting our approach to monolingual applications.
    In the cases that were treated correctly by our method, such as the examples given in the previous sections, the statistics succeeded in capturing two major types of disambiguating data.
    In preferring 'sign-treaty' upon 'seal-treaty' (in Example 1), the statistics reflect the relevant semantic constraint.
    In preferring
