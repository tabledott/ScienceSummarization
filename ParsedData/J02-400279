n a similar task by Kupiec, Pedersen, and Oren (1995), but instead the features we use.
    We have adapted 13 sentential features in such a way that they work robustly for our task (i.e., for unrestricted, real-world text).
    We also present three new features that detect scientific metadiscourse in a novel way.
    The results of an intrinsic system evaluation show that the system can identify sentences expressing the specific goal of a paper with 57% precision and 79% recall, sentences expressing criticism or contrast with 57% precision and 42% recall, and sentences expressing a continuation relationship to other work with 62% precision and 43% recall.
    This substantially improves a baseline of text classification which uses only a TF*IDF model over words.
    The agreement of correctly identified rhetorical roles with human relevance judgments is even higher (96% precision and 70% recall for goal statements, 70% precision and 24% recall for contrast, 71% precision and 39% recall for continuation).
