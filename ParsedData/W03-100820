    The CCG parser returns predicate-argument structures that include long-range dependencies; therefore, it seems inherently better suited for this task.
    However, the performance of our CCG system is lowered by the fact that the syntactic analyses in its training corpus differ from those that underlie PropBank in important ways (in particular in the notion of heads and the complement-adjunct distinction).
    We would expect a higher performance for the CCG-based system if the analyses in CCGbank resembled more closely those in PropBank.
    Our results also indicate the importance of recovering long-range dependencies, either through the trace information in the Penn Treebank, or directly, as in the predicate-argument structures returned by the CCG parser.
    We speculate that much of the performance improvement we show could be obtained with traditional (ie. non-CCG-based) parsers if they were designed to recover more of the information present in the Penn Treebank, in particular the trac
