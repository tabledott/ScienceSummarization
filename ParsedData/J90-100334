sive and prone to errors of omission.
    The ways that concordances are sorted don't adequately support current lexicographic practice.
    Despite the fact that a concordance is indexed by a single word, often lexicographers actually use a second word such as from or an equally common semantic concept such as a time adverbial to decide how to categorize concordance lines.
    In other words, they use two words to triangulate in on a word sense.
    This triangulation approach clusters concordance lines together into word senses based primarily on usage (distributional evidence), as opposed to intuitive notions of meaning.
    Thus, the question of what is a word sense can be addressed with syntactic methods (symbol pushing), and need not address semantics (interpretation), even though the inventory of tags may appear to have semantic values.
    The triangulation approach requires &amp;quot;art.&amp;quot; How does the lexicographer decide which potential cut points are &amp;quot;interesting&amp;quot; and wh
