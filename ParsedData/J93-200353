last of these vacancies; in general, r[i]i may be placed in any but the rightmost ON - 1 of the remaining vacancies.
    Because rto must occupy the leftmost place of any of the words from TN, we must take care to leave room at the end of the string for the remaining words from this tablet.
    As with Model 4, we allow d1 to depend on the center of the previous cept and on fj, but we suppress the dependence on eu_ii since we should otherwise have too many parameters.
    For [ii &gt; 0 and k&gt; 1, we assume Again, the final factor enforces the constraint that Ttipc land in a vacant position, and, again, we assume that the probability depends on 4 only through its class.
    Model 5 is described in more detail in Appendix B.
    As with Model 4, we leave the details of the count and reestimation formulae to the reader.
    No incremental evaluation of the likelihood of neighbors is possible with Model 5 because a move or swap may require wholesale recomputation of the likelihood of an alignment.
