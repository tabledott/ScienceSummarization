f that the Morning Star rises can be proved as one would prove his belief in the consequences of any other syllogism whose premises he believed, in accordance with a treatment of reasoning about developed in a longer version this This solution is in the spirit of our whole representational approach in that it forces us to be painfully explicit about everything.
    The notation does no magic for us.
    There is a significant cost associated with this solution, however.
    When proper names are represented as predicates and not as constants, the natural way to state the uniqueness of proper names is by means of foilowing sort: tar(z) tar(y) z since from the axioms for we can show that tar( M S), it follow that We thus restate the axiom for the uniqueness of proper names as rel-identieal(z, y) A similar modification must be made for functions.
    Since we are using only predicates, the uniqueness of the value of a function must be encoded with an axiom like y, ather(y, z = and y are both fathers of z and y a
