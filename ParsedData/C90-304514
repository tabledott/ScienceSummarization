ifferent readings, cor- responding to the idiomatic (die'(yeorge')) and literal (kick'(george ~,bucket')) interpretations, respectively.
			All of the arguments for the TAG analysis of idioms and light verb constructions can then be maintained in a formalism that allows for semantics for them as well.
			In particular, ? Discontinuous syntactic onstituents can be seman- tic'ally localized.
			Nonstandard long-distance dependencies are stat- able without resort to reanalysis.
			Both frozen and flexible idioms can be easily char- acterized.
			4.2 Quant i f ie rs.
			In order to characterize quantifier scoping possibilities, we use a synchronous TAG whose base formalism is multi-component TAGs (Joshi, 1987), in which the prim- itive operation is incorporation (by multiple substitutions and adjunctions) of a set of elementary trees at once.
			In synchronous multi-component TAGs, the links between trees connect, in general, a set of nodes in one tree with a set in another.
			In particular, an NP will be linked
