erformance when adopting our automatic clustering was 70.84% (1,025/1,447 items).
    To make it clear that the performance improvement is not only due to polysemy reduction, we considered a subset of the Senseval-3 test set including only the incorrect answers given by the fine-grained version of Gambl (623 items).
    In other words, on this data set Gambl performs with 0% accuracy.
    We compared the performance of Gambl when adopting our automatic clustering with the accuracy of the random baseline.
    The results were respectively 34% and 15.32% accuracy.
    These experiments prove that the performance in Table 4 is not due to chance, but to an effective way of clustering word senses.
    Furthermore, the systems in the Table are not taking advantage of the information given by the clustering (trained systems could be retrained on the coarse clustering).
    To assess this aspect, we performed a further experiment.
    We modified the sense inventory of the SSI lexical knowledge base by adopting the c
