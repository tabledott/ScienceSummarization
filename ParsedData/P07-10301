 patterns (&#8216;X is a country&#8217;) can be exploited to automatically generate hyponyms of a specified word.
    Subsequent work (to be discussed in detail below) extended this initial idea along two dimensions.
    One objective was to require as small a userprovided initial seed as possible.
    Thus, it was observed that given one or more such lexical patterns, a corpus could be used to generate examples of hyponyms that could then, in turn, be exploited to generate more lexical patterns.
    The larger and more reliable sets of patterns thus generated resulted in larger and more precise sets of hyponyms and vice versa.
    The initial step of the resulting alternating bootstrap process &#8211; the user-provided input &#8211; could just as well consist of examples of hyponyms as of lexical patterns.
    A second objective was to extend the information that could be learned from the process beyond hyponyms of a given word.
    Thus, the approach was extended to finding lexical patterns that could produ
