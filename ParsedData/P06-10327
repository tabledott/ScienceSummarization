tailed description of the system can be found in (Menezes &amp; Quirk 2005) and (Quirk et al., 2005).
    In keeping with current best practices in SMT, our system is a phrasal machine translation system that attempts to learn mappings between &#8220;phrases&#8221; (which may not correspond to linguistic units) rather than individual words.
    What distinguishes this system from other phrasal SMT systems is that rather than aligning simple sequences of words, it maps small phrasal &#8220;treelets&#8221; generated by a dependency parse to corresponding strings in the target.
    This &#8220;Tree-To-String&#8221; model holds promise in that it allows us to potentially benefit from being able to access a certain amount of structural information during translation, without necessarily being completely tied to the need for a fully-well-formed linguistic analysis of the input&#8212;an important consideration when it is sought to handle ungrammatical or otherwise illformed ESL input, but also simultaneously to capt
