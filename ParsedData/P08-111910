ss &#8220;PRESIDENT&#8221; could refer to country presidents or corporate presidents, and &#8220;BUSH&#8221; could refer to a plant or a person.
    But in the pattern &#8220;PRESIDENTS such as BUSH&#8221;, both words will surely refer to country presidents.
    Another advantage of the doubly-anchored pattern is that an ambiguous or underspecified class name will be constrained by the presence of the class member.
    For example, to generate a list of company presidents, someone might naively define the class name as PRESIDENTS.
    A singly-anchored pattern (e.g., &#8220;PRESIDENTS such as *&#8221;) might generate lists of other types of presidents (e.g., country presidents, university presidents, etc.).
    Because the doubly-anchored pattern also requires a class member (e.g., &#8220;PRESIDENTS such as BILL GATES and *&#8221;), it is likely to generate only the desired types of instances.
    To evaluate the performance of the doubly-anchored pattern, we began by using the pattern to search the web and e
