in addition to part-ofspeech tags.
    Introducing the word clusters immediately brings the performance up to a very competitive level.
    Phrasal clusters obtained from the LDC corpus give the same level of improvement as word clusters from the web corpus that is 20 times larger.
    The best F-score of 90.90, which is about 1 point higher than the previous best result, is obtained with a combination of clusters.
    Adding POS tags to this configuration caused a small drop in F1.
  
  
    We now look at the use of phrasal clusters in a very different application: query classification.
    The goal of query classification is to determine to which ones of a predefined set of classes a query belongs.
    Compared with documents, queries are much shorter and their categories are much more ambiguous.
    The task in the KDDCUP 2005 competition2 is to classify 800,000 internet user search queries into 67 predefined topical categories.
    The training set consists of 111 example queries, each of which belongs t
