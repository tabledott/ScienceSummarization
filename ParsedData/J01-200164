rs with a complete set of what a grammarian would take to be the paradigmatic set of suffixes for its class: this will be neither the stems with the highest nor the stems with the lowest frequency, but those in between.
    In addition, there will be a large range of words with no acceptable morphological analysis, which is just as it should be: John, stomach, the, and so forth.
    To get a sense of what are identified as regular signatures in a language such as English, let us look at the results of a preliminary analysis in Table 2 of the 86,976 words of The Adventures of Tom Sawyer, by Mark Twain.
    The signatures in Table 2 are ordered by the breadth of a signature, defined as follows.
    A signature a has both a stem count (the number of stems associated with it) and an affix count (the number of affixes it contains), and we use log (stem count) * log (affix count) as a rough guide to the centrality of a signature in the corpus.
    The suffixes identified are given in Table 3 for the final analysis
