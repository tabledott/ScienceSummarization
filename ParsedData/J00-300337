 a summand in Equation 6 whose word- and recognizer-based likelihoods with the n-gram discourse grammars described earlier.
    The best accuracy obtained from transcribed words, 71%, is encouraging given a comparable human performance of 84% (the interlabeler agreement, see Section 2.2).
    We observe about a 21% relative increase in classification error when using recognizer words; this is remarkably small considering that the speech recognizer used had a word error rate of 41% on the test set.
    We also compared the n-best DA classification approach to the more straightforward 1-best approach.
    In this experiment, only the single best recognizer hypothesis is used, effectively treating it as the true word string.
    The 1-best method increased classification error by about 7% relative to the n-best algorithm (61.5% accuracy with a bigram discourse grammar).
    We also investigated prosodic information, i.e., information independent of the words as well as the standard recognizer acoustics.
