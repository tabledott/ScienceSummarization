kana inventory containing 81 symbols, including the dot-separator (.).
    The first WFST simply merges long Japanese vowel sounds into new symbols aa, ii, uu, ee, and oo.
    The second WFST maps Japanese sounds onto katakana symbols.
    The basic idea is to consume a whole syllable worth of sounds before producing any katakana.
    For example: This fragment shows one kind of spelling variation in Japanese: long vowel sounds (00) are usually written with a long vowel mark ( 21&amp;quot; ) but are sometimes written with repeated katakana ( 71- 71.).
    We combined corpus analysis with guidelines from a Japanese textbook (Jorden and Chaplin 1976) to turn up many spelling variations and unusual katakana symbols: and so on.
    Spelling variation is clearest in cases where an English word like switch shows up transliterated variously ( 4 &#8216;2 4 'Y , 7 9 4 'Y ) in different dictionaries.
    Treating these variations as an equivalence class enables us to learn general sound mappings even if our bilingual g
