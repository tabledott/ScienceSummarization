accuracy of the mode, but after around sixteen topics, gains became much smaller.
			The effect of ? is also related to the number of topics, as a value of S for a very large number of topics might overwhelm the observed data, while the same value of S might be the perfect balance for a smaller number of topics.For comparison, the method of using a WORDNET WALK applied to smaller contexts such as sentences or documents achieves an accuracy of between 26% and 30%, depending on the level of smoothing.
	
	
			This method works well in cases where the delineation can be readily determined from the over all topic of the document.
			Words such as ?kid,?
