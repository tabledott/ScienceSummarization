 or tuning to the specific prob lems.
			Some work is required to fit each probleminto the general framework of PairClass (supervised classification of word pairs) but the core al gorithm is the same in each case.
	
	
			This section presents four sets of experiments, with analogies, synonyms, antonyms, and associations.
			We explain how each task is treated as a problem of classifying analogous word pairs, we give the experimental results, and we discuss past work on each of the four tasks.
			3.1 SAT Analogies.
			In this section, we apply PairClass to the taskof recognizing analogies.
			To evaluate the performance, we use a set of 374 multiple-choice ques tions from the SAT college entrance exam.
			Table 2 shows a typical question.
			The target pair is called the stem.
			The task is to select the choice pair that is most analogous to the stem pair.
			Stem: mason:stone Choices: (a) teacher:chalk (b) carpenter:wood (c) soldier:gun (d) photograph:camera (e) book:word Solution: (b) carpenter:wood Table 2
