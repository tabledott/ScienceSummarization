d in Table 3.
    While it is true that all of the studies reported in Table 3 used four senses of interest, it is not clear that any of the other experimental parameters were held constant in all studies.
    Therefore, this comparison is only suggestive.
    In order to facilitate more meaningful comparisons in the future, we are donating the data used in this experiment to the Consortium for Lexical Research (ftp site: clr.nmsu.edu) where it will be available to all interested parties.
    In this paper, we presented a method for formulating probabilistic models that use multiple contextual features for word-sense disambiguation without requiring untested assumptions regarding the form of the model.
    In this approach, the joint distribution of all variables is described by only the most systematic variable interactions, thereby limiting the number of parameters to be estimated, supporting computational efficiency, and providing an understanding of the data.
    Further, different types of variables, suc
