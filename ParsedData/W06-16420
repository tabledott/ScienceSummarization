  Fully Automatic Lexicon Expansion For Domain-Oriented Sentiment Analysis
  
    This paper proposes an unsupervised lexicon building method for the detecof which convey positive or negative aspects in a specific domain.
    The lexical entries to be acare called the minimum human-understandable syntactic structures that specify the polarity of clauses.
    As a clue to obtain candidate atoms, we use the tendency for same polarities to appear successively in contexts.
    Using the overall density and precision of coherency in the corpus, the statistical estimation picks up appropriate polar atoms among candidates, without any manual tuning of the threshold values.
    The experimental results show that the precision of polarity assignment with the automatically acquired lexicon was 94% on average, and our method is robust for corpora in diverse domains and for the size of the initial lexicon.
