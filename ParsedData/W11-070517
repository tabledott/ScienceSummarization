tree (EW (JJ) (great) (POS)), the PT kernel will use (EW (JJ) (great) (POS)), (EW (great) (POS)), (EW (JJ) (POS)), (EW (JJ) (great)), (EW (JJ)), (EW (great)), (EW (POS)), (EW), (JJ), (great), and (POS).
    This means that the PT tree kernel attempts to use full information, and also abstracts away from specific information (such as the lexical item).
    In this manner, it is not necessary to create by hand features at all levels of abstraction.
  
  
    We propose a set of features listed in Table 4 for our experiments.
    These are a total of 50 type of features.
    We calculate these features for the whole tweet and for the last one-third of the tweet.
    In total we get 100 additional features.
    We refer to these features as Senti-features throughout the paper.
    Our features can be divided into three broad categories: ones that are primarily counts of various features and therefore the value of the feature is a natural number E N. Second, features whose value is a real number E R. These are pri
