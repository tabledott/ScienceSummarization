tuples t = (w1, l, w2), such that w1 co-occurs with w2 and l represents the type of this co-occurrence relation.
    For instance, the tuple (marine, use, bomb) in the toy example reported in Table 1 encodes the piece of distributional information that marine co-occurs with bomb in the corpus, and use specifies the type of the syntagmatic link between these words.
    Each tuple t has a weight, a real-valued score vt, assigned by a scoring function 6 : W1 x L x W2 - 4R.
    A weighted tuple structure consists of the set TW of weighted distributional tuples tw = (t,vt) for all t E T and 6(t) = vt.
    The 6 function encapsulates all the operations performed to score the tuples, for example, by processing an input corpus with a dependency parser, counting the occurrences of tuples, and weighting the raw counts by mutual information.
    Because our focus is on how tuples, once they are harvested, should be represented geometrically, we gloss over the important challenges of choosing the appropriate W1, L and W2
