sual 100 occurrences of Okay, according to the two tables in Figure 4.
    In Example 5, the proportions of each category are very similar among coders, at 55 versus 60 Accept, and 45 versus 40 Ack.
    However, in Example 6 coder 1 favors Accept much more than coder 2 (75 versus 40 occurrences) and conversely chooses Ack much less frequently (25 versus 60 occurrences).
    In both cases, P(A) is 0.65 and &#954;S&amp;C is stable at 0.27, but &#954;Co goes from 0.27 to 0.418.
    Our initial example in Figure 1 is also affected by bias.
    The distribution in Example 1 yielded &#954;Co = 0.6724 but &#954;S&amp;C = 0.6632.
    If the bias decreases as in Example 2, &#954;Co becomes 0.6632, the same as &#954;S&amp;C.
  
  
    The issue that remains open is which computation of &#954; to choose.
    Siegel and Castellan&#8217;s &#954;S&amp;C is not affected by bias, whereas Cohen&#8217;s &#954;Co is.
    However, it is questionable whether the assumption of equal distributions underlying &#954;S&amp;C is approp
