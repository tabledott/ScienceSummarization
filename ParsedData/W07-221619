s an exact min-risk decoding procedure.
    Let R(T, T') be the Hamming distance between two dependency graphs for an input sentence x = This is a common definition of risk between two graphs as it corresponds directly to labeled dependency parsing accuracy (McDonald et al., 2005a; By setting the edge weights to wk = e((i j)k). we ij can directly solve this problem using the edge expectation algorithm described in Section 3.3 and the argmax algorithm described in Section 3.1.
    Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) (Lafferty et al., 2001) are global discriminative learning algorithms for problems with structured output spaces, such as dependency parsing.
    For dependency parsing, CRFs would define the conditional probability of a dependency graph T for a sentence x as a globally norHere, the weights wk ij are potential functions over each edge defined as an exponentiated linear classifier with weight vector w E RN and feature vector f(i, j, k) E RN, where fu(i, j, k) E R represents a single dimension of the ve
