 al., 1998) and NYU's MENE and MENE-Proteus systems on different training and test sets.
    We are not sure why MENEProteus was hurt more badly by the evaluationtime switch from aviation disaster articles to missue/rocket launch articles, but suspect that it may have been due to Identifinder's greater quantity and quality of training data.
    BBN used 790,000 words of training data to our 321,000.
    The quality advantage may have come from selecting sentences from a larger corpus for their annotators to tag which were chosen so as to increase the variety of training data.
    When MENE-only and Identifinder are compared training on the same number of articles and testing on within-domain data, Identifinder still has an edge.
    We speculate that this is due to the dynamic updating of Identifinder's vocabulary during decoding when person or organization names are recognized, which gives the system a sort of long-distance reference resolution which is lacking in MENE.
    In addition.
