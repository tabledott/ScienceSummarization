, E = early maximum, C = classical).
    The patterns are summarised in table 3, each entry in the table showing the patterns for the two tests under the given conditions.
    Although there is some variations in the readings, for example in the &amp;quot;similar/DO+TO&amp;quot; case, we can draw some general conclusions about the patterns obtained from different sorts of data.
    When the lexicon is degraded (D2), the pattern is always classical.
    With a good lexicon but either degraded transitions or a test corpus differing from the training corpus, the pattern tends to be early maximum.
    When the test corpus is very similar to the model, then the pattern is initial maximum.
    Furthermore, examining the accuracies in table 2, in the cases of initial maximum and early maximum, the accuracy tends to be significantly higher than with classical behaviour.
    It seems likely that what is going on is that the model is converging to towards something of similar &amp;quot;quality&amp;quot; in each case, b
