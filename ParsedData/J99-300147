different types.
    One class of errors relates to the algorithm's strategy.
    In the case of the BFP algorithm, the corresponding row also contains the number of ambiguous cases generated by this algorithm (we counted ambiguities as errors, since FunC produced only one reading in these cases).
    A second class of errors results from error chains, mainly caused by the strategy of each approach or by ambiguities in the BFP algorithm.
    A third error class is caused by the intersentential specifications, e.g., the correct antecedent is not accessible because it is realized in an embedded clause (reported speech).
    Finally, other errors were mainly caused by split antecedents (plural pronouns referring to a couple of antecedents in singular), reference to events (or propositions), and cataphora.
    5.1.4 Interpretation.
    While the rate of errors caused by the specifications for complex sentences and by other reasons is almost identical (the small difference can be explained by false positives), the
