source domain onto vocabulary of the target domain and S is a set of sentences from the source domain which are expected to transfer to the target domain.
    A metaphor is &amp;quot;coherent&amp;quot; if the transferred sentences S are logically consistent with the axioms of the target domain, and &amp;quot;strongly coherent&amp;quot; if they already lie in the deductive closure of those axioms (cf.
    Stallard 1987, p. 181).
    S is thus the &amp;quot;implicative complex&amp;quot; of the source domain imposed on the target domain.
    Every metaphorical interpretation of a given set of sentences is associated with a T-MAP.
    There may be several possible T-MAPs for a set of sentences.
    I would argue that Hobbs (1983a; 1983b) has also taken an interaction view of metaphor.
    Hobbs' goal has been to develop a unified process of discourse interpretation based on the drawing of appropriate inferences from a large knowledge base, which Hobbs sometimes calls &amp;quot;selective inferencing&amp;quot; (e.g
