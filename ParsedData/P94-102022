presented here is the maximum entropy approach to developing language models ([24], [25], [19] and [20]).
    Although this approach has not been applied to wordsense disambiguation, there is a strong similarity between that method of model formulation and our own.
    A maximum entropy model for multivariate data is the likelihood function with the highest entropy that satisfies a pre-defined set of linear constraints on the underlying probability estimates.
    The constraints describe interactions among variables by specifying the expected frequency with which the values of the constrained variables co-occur.
    When the expected frequencies specified in the constraints are linear combinations of the observed frequencies in the training data, the resulting maximum entropy model is equivalent to a maximum likelihood model, which is the type of model used here.
    To date, in the area of natural language processing, the principles underlying the formulation of maximum entropy models have been used only to
