a &amp;quot;no confirmation&amp;quot; dialogue strategy, in contrast to the explicit and implicit confirmation strategies used in Figures 2 and 3.
    Second, Figure 5 illustrates new types of user utterances that do not directly further the informational goals of the task.
    In U2, the user asks the agent a wh-question about the DR attribute itself, rather than providing information about that attribute's value.
    Since U2 satisfies a knowledge precondition related to answering Cl, U2 contributes to the DR goal and is tagged as such.
    In U3, the user similarly asks a yes-no question that addresses a subgoal related to answering Cl.
    Finally, U5 illustrates a user request for an agent action, and is tagged with the RT attribute.
    The value of RT in the AVM instantiation for the dialogue would be &amp;quot;reserve?'
    Second, consider the very different domain and task of diagnosing a fault and repairing a circuit (Smith and Gordon, 1997).
    Figure 6 presents one dialogue from this domain.
