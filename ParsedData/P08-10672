atures that are not representable here.
    Ideally, we would wish to combine the merits of both approaches, where an efficient inference algorithm could integrate both local and non-local features.
    Unfortunately, exact search is intractable (at least in theory) for features with unbounded scope.
    So we propose forest reranking, a technique inspired by forest rescoring (Huang and Chiang, 2007) that approximately reranks the packed forest of exponentially many parses.
    The key idea is to compute non-local features incrementally from bottom up, so that we can rerank the n-best subtrees at all internal nodes, instead of only at the root node as in conventional reranking (see Table 1).
    This method can thus be viewed as a step towards the integration of discriminative reranking with traditional chart parsing.
    Although previous work on discriminative parsing has mainly focused on short sentences (&#8804; 15 words) (Taskar et al., 2004; Turian and Melamed, 2007), our work scales to the whole Treeba
