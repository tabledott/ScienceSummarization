f PoS tagging in a pipelined NLP system by incorporating our SCL tagger into a WSJ-trained dependency parser and and evaluate it on MEDLINE data.
    We use the parser described by McDonald et al. (2005b).
    That parser assumes that a sentence has been PoStagged before parsing.
    We train the parser and PoS tagger on the same size of WSJ data.
    Figure 7 shows dependency parsing accuracy on our 561-sentence MEDLINE test set.
    We parsed the sentences using the PoS tags output by our source domain supervised tagger, the SCL tagger from subsection 7.1, and the gold PoS tags.
    All of the differences in this figure are significant according to McNemar&#8217;s test.
    The SCL tags consistently improve parsing performance over the tags output by the supervised tagger.
    This is a rather indirect method of improving parsing performance with SCL.
    In the future, we plan on directly incorporating SCL features into a discriminative parser to improve its adaptation properties.
