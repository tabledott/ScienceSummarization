y rules, the mechanism of head selection is introduced.
    Now there are 4 forms of binary rules: determined by the four possible combinations of head selections (Y or Z) and orientation selections (straight or inverted).
    The rules for generating lexical pairs at the leaves of the tree are now predetermined: Putting them all together, we are able to derive a lexicalized bilingual parse tree for a given sentence pair.
    In Figure 2, the example in Figure 1 is revisited.
    The probability of the lexicalized parse is: The factors of the product are ordered to show the generative process of the most probable parse.
    Starting from the start symbol 5, we first choose the head word pair for 5, which is see/vois in the example.
    Then, we recursively expand the lexicalized head constituents using the lexicalized structural rules.
    Since we are only lexicalizing rather than bilexicalizing the rules, the non-head constituents need to be lexicalized using head generation rules so that the top-down gener
