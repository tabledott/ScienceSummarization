    In this table we show the results both with and without the OSPD heuristic.
    The results for the English SENSEVAL-2 tasks were generally much lower than those for the original SENSEVAL competition.
    At the time of the SENSEVAL-2 workshop, this was assumed to be due largely to the use of WordNet as the inventory, as opposed to HECTOR (Atkins 1993), but Palmer, Trang Dang, and Fellbaum (forthcoming) have subsequently shown that, at least for the lexical sample tasks, this was due to a harder selection of words, with a higher average level of polysemy.
    For three of the most polysemous verbs that overlapped between the English lexical sample for SENSEVAL and SENSEVAL-2, the performance was comparable.
    Table 2 shows our precision results including use of the OSPD heuristic, broken down by part of speech.
    Although the precision for nouns is greater than that for verbs, the difference is much less when we remove the trivial monosemous cases.
