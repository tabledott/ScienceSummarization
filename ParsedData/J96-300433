m presented here to a corpus of 20 million words,' using a set of initial estimates of the word frequencies.'
    In this re-estimation procedure only the entries in the base dictionary were used: in other words, derived words not in the base dictionary and personal and foreign names were not used.
    The best analysis of the corpus is taken to be the true analysis, the frequencies are re-estimated, and the algorithm is repeated until it converges.
    Clearly this is not the only way to estimate word-frequencies, however, and one could consider applying other methods: in particular since the problem is similar to the problem of assigning part-of-speech tags to an untagged corpus given a lexicon and some initial estimate of the a priori probabilities for the tags, one might consider a more sophisticated approach such as that described in Kupiec (1992); one could also use methods that depend on a small hand-tagged seed corpus, as suggested by one reviewer.
    In any event, to date, we have not compared diffe
