nsupervised Model 4 did not have access to the wordalignments in our training set.
    Callison-Burch et al. (2004) demonstrated that the GIZA++ models could be trained in a semi-supervised manner, leading to a slight decrease in error.
    To our knowledge, our AER of 5.19 is the best reported result, generative or discriminative, on this data set.
  
  
    Recently, a number of discriminative word alignment models have been proposed, however these early models are typically very complicated with many proposing intractable problems which require heuristics for approximate inference (Liu et al., 2005; Moore, 2005).
    An exception is Taskar et al. (2005) who presented a word matching model for discriminative alignment which they they were able to solve optimally.
    However, their model is limited to only providing one-to-one alignments.
    Also, no features were defined on label sequences, which reduced the model&#8217;s ability to capture the strong monotonic relationships present between European langu
