    Judge M is an undergraduate computer science student, and judge D has no background in computer science or linguistics.
    Judge J, with help from M, developed the original coding instructions, and Judge J directed the process in step 4.
    The analysis performed in step 3 reveals strong evidence of relative bias among the judges.
    Each pairwise comparison of judges also shows a strong pattern of symmetric disagreement.
    The two-category latent class model produces the most consistent clusters across the data configurations.
    It, therefore, is used to define the bias-corrected tags.
    In step 4, judge B was excluded from the interactive discussion for logistical reasons.
    Discussion is apparently important, because, although B's Kappa values for the first study are on par with the others, B's Kappa values for agreement with the other judges change very little from the first to the second study (this is true across the range of certainty values).
    In contrast, agreement among the
