cise to ensure that, in general, articles in the same cluster overlap significantly in overall semantic content.
			Even so, any arbitrary pair of sentences from different articles within a cluster is unlikely to exhibit a paraphrase relationship: The Phi-X174 genome is short and compact.
			This is a robust new step that allows us to make much larger pieces.
			To isolate just those sentence pairs that represent likely paraphrases without requiring significant string similarity, we exploited a common journalistic convention: the first sentence or two of 3A maximum Levenshtein distance of 12 was selected for the purposes of this paper on the basis of experiments with corpora extracted at various edit distances.
			a newspaper article typically summarize its content.
			One might reasonably expect, therefore, that initial sentences from one article in a cluster will be paraphrases of the initial sentences in other articles in that cluster.
			This heuristic turns out to be a powerful one, often correctly assoc
