ating the dictionary definition of a concept as a context, and finding the resultant of the first order context vectors of the words in the definition.
    In particular, we define a Word Space by creating first order context vectors for every word w that is not a stop word and that occurs above a minimum frequency in our corpus.
    The specific steps are as follows: &#8594; The first order context vector w, therefore, encodes the co&#8211;occurrence information of word w. For example, consider the gloss of lamp &#8211; an artificial source of visible illumination.
    The Gloss Vector for lamp would be formed by adding the first order context vectors of artificial, source, visible and illumination.
    In these experiments, we use WordNet as the corpus of text for deriving first order context vectors.
    We take the glosses for all of the concepts in WordNet and view that as a large corpus of text.
    This corpus consists of approximately 1.4 million words, and results in a Word Space of approximately 20,
