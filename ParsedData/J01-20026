ormance for data-driven automatic word class taggers on the usual type of material (e.g., tagging English text with single tags from a low-detail tagset) is at 96-97% correctly tagged words, but accuracy levels for specific classes of ambiguous words are much lower.
    Finally, a number of rather different methods that automatically generate a fully functional tagging system from annotated text are available off-the-shelf.
    First experiments (van Halteren, Zavrel, and Daelemans 1998; Brill and Wu 1998) demonstrated the basic validity of the approach for tagging, with the error rate of the best combiner being 19.1% lower than that of the best individual tagger (van Halteren, Zavrel, and Daelemans 1998).
    However, these experiments were restricted to a single language, a single tagset and, more importantly, a limited amount of training data for the combiners.
    This led us to perform further, more extensive, tagging experiments before moving on to other tasks.
    Since then the method has also been ap
