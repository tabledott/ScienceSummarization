    Although some of the systems that implemented joint approaches obtained good results, the top five systems in the closed challenge are essentially systems with pipeline architectures.
    Furthermore, Johansson and Nugues (2008) and Riedel and Meza-Ruiz (2008) showed that joint learning/optimization improves the overall results, but the improvement is not large.
    These initial efforts indicate at least that the joint modeling of this problem is not a trivial task.
    The D Arch. and D Inference columns summarize the parsing architectures and the corresponding inference strategies.
    Similar to last year&#8217;s shared task (Nivre et al., 2007), the vast majority of parsing models fall in two classes: transition-based (&#8220;trans&#8221; in the table) or graph-based (&#8220;graph&#8221;) models.
    By and large, transition-based models use a greedy inference strategy, whereas graph-based models used different Maximum Spanning Tree (MST) algorithms: Carreras (2007) &#8211; MSTC, Eisner (2000) &#82
