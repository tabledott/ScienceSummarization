 lengths correspond to disjoint sets of features.
			Consequently, the SVM algorithm will induce lower weights for features occur ring in longer paths, resulting in a linear separator that works irrespective of the size of the dependency paths.
	
	
			In (Zelenko et al, 2003), the authors do relation extraction using a tree kernel defined over shallow parse tree representations of sentences.
			The same tree kernel is slightly generalized in (Culotta andSorensen, 2004) and used in conjunction with dependency trees.
			In both approaches, a relation in stance is defined to be the smallest subtree in the parse or dependency tree that includes both entities.
			In this paper we argued that the information relevant to relation extraction is almost entirely concentrated in the shortest path in the dependency tree, leading to an even smaller representation.
			Another difference between the tree kernels above and our new kernel is that the tree kernels used for relation extraction are opaque i.e. the semantics of t
