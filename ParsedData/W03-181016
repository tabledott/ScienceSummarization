    Thesaurus: Using the method proposed by Lin (1998a) we produced a thesaurus with 500 nearest neighbours for the set of phrasal verbs as described above.
    Tuples of the form &lt;verb, argument head, grammatical relation&gt; from the parsed BNC data were used for this purpose where the verb was the multiword phrasal and the grammatical relations used were subjects and direct objects.
    We did likewise for the simplex verbs contained within the phrasals (e.g. blow from blow up).
    We investigated various measures which compare the nearest neighbours of the phrasal verb to the neighbours of the corresponding simplex verb.
    We also tried various measures on the neighbours of the phrasal verb.
    We supply short labels for these for ease of reference. overlap The size of the overlap of the top X phrasal neighbours with the same number of the corresponding simplex verb's neighbou
