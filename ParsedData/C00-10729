  SUM- MARIST employs several different heuristics in tile topic identification stage to score terms and sen- tences.
  The score of a sentence is simply the sum of all the scores of content-bearing terms in the sen- tence.
  These heuristics arc implemented in separate modules using inputs from preprocessing modules such as tokenizer, part-of-speech tagger, morpholog- ical analyzer, term frequency and tfidf weights cal- culator, sentence length calculator, and sentence lo- cation identifier.
  Ve only activate the position mod- ule, tile tfidfmodule, and the.
  topic signature module for comparison.
  We discuss the effectiveness of these modules in Section 6.
