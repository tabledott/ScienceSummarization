which in newspaper texts is more frequent than the color white.
    Since our lemmatizer is not context-sensitive, this word was left unlemmatized, which explains the result.
    To be able to compare our results with other work, we also did a quantitative evaluation.
    For all test words we checked whether the predicted translation (first word in the ranked list) was identical to our expected translation.
    This was true for 65 of the 100 test words.
    However, in some cases the choice of the expected translation in the test set had been somewhat arbitrary.
    For example, for the German word Strafie we had expected street, but the system predicted road, which is a translation quite as good.
    Therefore, as a better measure for the accuracy of our system we counted the number of times where an acceptable translation of the source word is ranked first.
    This was true for 72 of the 100 test words, which gives us an accuracy of 72%.
    In another test, we checked whether an acceptable translation a
