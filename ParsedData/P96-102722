    The distinguished index identifies this as a sentence that makes a claim about a running event.
    &amp;quot;John&amp;quot; is the name of the entity that stands in the `argl ' relation to the running which took place in the past and which was fast.
    Nothing turns on these details which will differ with differing ontologies, logics, and views of semantic structure.
    What concerns us here is a procedure for generating a sentence from a structure of this general kind.
    Assume that the lexicon contains entries like those in A prima facie argument for the utility of these particular words for expressing ( I) can be made simply by noting that, modulo appropriate instantiation of the variables, the semantics of each of these words subsumes (1).
  
  
    The entries in (2), with their variables suitably instantiated, become the initial entries of an agenda and we begin to move them to the chart in accordance with the algorithm schema, say in the order given.
    The variables in
