  Ia this see@m, we consider the mathematical modelling of the calculus.
  This can be used to show that the set of equations describing a grammar will always have a solution, which we can consider as the denotation of the grammar.
  Tire model that we present here is based on the work by llxnmds and Kssper [Pmund, et al.
  1986] and in particular their notion ofsatisfiability of formulae.
  [,st I" be the space of partial flmetions (with the parLial ordering E, the standard ordering on partial functions) defined by /" = (L .-~ F) + A where A is set of atoms and L is set of labels.
  This space has been characterized by Pereira and Sheiber [Pereira ctal .
  Any expression e (which is not a hmction) can b
