			The data set used for experimental evaluation is the standard data set from the Wall Street Journal section of the Penn Treebank, with sections 2?21 3Given the parsing algorithm, N can never have a head or a right dependent in the current configuration.4In TiMBL, the value of k in fact refers to k nearest dis tances rather than k nearest neighbors, which means that, evenwith k = 1, the nearest neighbor set can contain several instances that are equally distant to the test instance.
