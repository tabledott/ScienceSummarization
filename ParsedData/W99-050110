 the ranking is sufficiently close and there is another way to check the validity of the disambiguation As a last resort, we can use a statistical approach to disambiguate those words that can not be done with any of the methods described so far Consider a collocating word-word pair w1 &#8212; w2 in which we consider that wi has been disambiguated already The disambiguation of w2 proceeds as follows { woul,&amp;quot; OR w1w21(1)&amp;quot; OR &amp;quot;w1w;(21)&amp;quot; We have searched the Internet using the AltaVista search engine The number of hits for each similarity list measures the relatedness of wi with each sense to; and thus provides a ranking of the senses The following procedure was used to disambiguate 12,762 words from 1000 randomly selected glosses Step 1 Identify and separate the monosemous words - that have only one sense in WordNet (in our experiment 6468 words were found) Step 2 Apply Method 1 - Heuristics - to the remaining 6294 polysemous words Method 1 provides correct disambiguation for
