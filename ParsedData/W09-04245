emented by the number of its occurrences in the source sentence.
    For our submission, we used k = 20, which resulted in 1.5 million (out of 23 million) sentence pairs being selected for use as training data.
    There were 30,037,600 English words and 30,083,927 French words in the subsampled training corpus.
    Hierarchical phrase-based translation requires a translation grammar extracted from a parallel corpus, where grammar rules include associated feature values.
    In real translation tasks, the grammars extracted from large training corpora are often far too large to fit into available memory.
    In such tasks, feature calculation is also very expensive in terms of time required; huge sets of extracted rules must be sorted in two directions for relative frequency calculation of such features as the translation probability p(f|e) and reverse translation probability p(e|f) (Koehn et al., 2003).
    Since the extraction steps must be re-run if any change is made to the input training data, the time r
