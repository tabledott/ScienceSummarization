    For our experiment, 560 nouns and 170 verbs were defined in this way.
    We estimate that this semantic annotation proceeded at about 90 words per hour.
    4.3.2 Supervised Training.
    From the TREEBANK project at the University of Pennsylvania, we used 20,000 words of MUC-3 texts that had been bracketed according to major syntactic category.
    The bracketed constituents for the sentence below appears in Figure 8.
    From the example one can clearly infer that bombs can explode, or more properly, that bomb can be the logical subject of explode, that at dawn can modify explode, etc.
    Naturally good generalizations based on the instances are more valuable than the instances themselves.
    Since we have a hierarchical domain model, and since the manual semantic annotation states the relationship between lexical items and concepts in the domain model, we can use the domain model hierarchy as a given set of categories for generalization.
    However, the crit
