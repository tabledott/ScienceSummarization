 there is no standard definition of Chinese words.
    In this paper, we define Chinese words as one of the following four types: entries in a lexicon, morphologically derived words, factoids, and named entities.
    We then present a Chinese word segmentation system which provides a solution to the four fundamental problems of word-level Chinese language processing: word segmentation, morphological analysis, factoid detection, and named entity recognition (NER).
    There are no word boundaries in written Chinese text.
    Therefore, unlike English, it may not be desirable to separate the solution to word segmentation from the solutions to the other three problems.
    Ideally, we would like to propose a unified approach to all the four problems.
    The unified approach we used in our system is based on the improved source-channel models of Chinese sentence generation, with two components: a source model and a set of channel models.
    The source model is used to estimate the generative probability of a wo
