   Relative merits of each approach should be clarified in the future.
    It is assumed that an equivalent interpretation heuristic is used by a hearer.
    Roughly, a pronoun &amp;quot;realizes&amp;quot; the current Cb that continues the previous Cb.'
    In this paper, I will first point out certain facts that the basic Centering rule does not explain, then propose a further constraint that substantiates the basic rule.
    This is called the &amp;quot;property-sharing&amp;quot; constraint, which requires that two pronominal elements realizing the same Cb in adjacent utterances share a certain common grammatical property.
    This shared property itself is expressed as a default preference order reflecting the nature of the constraint as a discourse rule.
    The initial formulation of the constraint only refers to the grammatical function SUBJECT.
    It explains the problem cases for the basic Centering rule in Japanese and English.
    It also accounts for a subset of what appears to be an effect of str
