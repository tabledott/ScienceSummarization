disambiguation.
    For example, including such information will make the model less likely to pick multiple nodes to fill the same role or to come up with a labeling that does not contain an obligatory argument.
    We added a whole label sequence feature template that extracts the labels of all argument nodes, and preserves information about the position of the predicate.
    Two templates for whole label sequences were added: one having the predicate voice only, and another also including the predicate lemma.
    These templates are instantiated as follows for the example candidate argument sequence: [voice:active, ARG1, PRED, ARG4, ARGM-TMP] [voice:active, lemma:accelerate, ARG1, PRED, ARG4, ARGM-TMP] We also add variants of these templates that use a generic ARG label instead of specific labels for the arguments.
    These feature templates have the effect of counting the number of arguments to the left and right of the predicate, which provides useful global information about argument structure.
