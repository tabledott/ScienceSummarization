    This solution is problematic because the information provided by the phrase itself can not be used by this kind of methods.
    And, experimental results show that relation extraction task can benefit from dependencies within a phrase.
    To solve this issue, we introduce the concept of phrase dependency parsing and propose an approach to construct it.
    Phrase dependency parsing segments an input sentence into &#8220;phrases&#8221; and links segments with directed arcs.
    The parsing focuses on the &#8220;phrases&#8221; and the relations between them, rather than on the single words inside each phrase.
    Because phrase dependency parsing naturally divides the dependencies into local and global, a novel tree kernel method has also been proposed.
    The remaining parts of this paper are organized as follows: In Section 2 we discuss our phrase dependency parsing and our approach.
    In Section 3, experiments are given to show the improvements.
    In Section 4, we present related work and Section
