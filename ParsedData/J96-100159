ch of these sentences.
    The frequency of each word (in sentences) is also computed at this stage.
    Thus, all the necessary information is collected from the corpus database at this preprocessing phase with only one pass over the corpus file.
    At the translation phase, only the indices are accessed.
    For the translation phase, we developed an algorithm that avoids computing the Dice coefficient for French words when the result must necessarily fall below the threshold.
    Using the index file on the English part of the corpus, we collect all French sentences that match the source collocation, and produce a list of all words that appear in these sentences, together with their frequency (in sentences) in this subset of the French corpus.
    This operation takes only a few seconds to perform, and yields a list of a few thousand French words.
    The list also contains the local frequency of these words (i.e., frequency within this subset of the French corpus), and is sorted by this frequency in decr
