83), induce a disjunctive set of conjunctive rules and therefore represent concepts in DNF.
    Some recent results have indicated that representing concepts in CNF (a conjunction of disjunctions) frequently performs somewhat better (Mooney, 1995).
    Some concepts are more compactly represented in CNF compared to DNF and vice versa.
    Therefore, both representations are included.
    Finally, decision lists (Rivest, 1987) are ordered lists of conjunctive rules, where rules are tested in order and the first one that matches an instance is used to classify it.
    A number of effective concept-learning systems have employed decision lists (Clark &amp; Niblett, 1989; Quinlan, 1993; Mooney Sc Califf, 1995) and they have already been successfully applied to lexical disambiguation (Yarowsky, 1994).
    All of the logic-based methods are variations of the FOIL algorithm for induction of first-order function-free Horn clauses (Quinlan, 1990), appropriately simplified for the propositional case.
    They are calle
