ed from the definition of C-arg arguments.
  Given the predicate, some argument classes are illegal (e.g., predicate stalk can take only A0 or A1).
  This information can be found in PropBank Frames.
  1 There are other constraints such as ?exactly one V argument per class,?
  or ?V?A1?C-V pattern?
  as introduced by Punyakanok et al.
  However, we did not find them particularly helpful in our experiments.
  Therefore, we exclude those constraints in the presentation here.
  267 Computational Linguistics Volume 34, Number 2 This constraint comes from the fact that different predicates take different types and numbers of arguments.
  By checking the PropBank Frame file of the target verb, we can exclude some core argument labels.
  Note that constraints 1, 2, and 3 are actually implemented in the argument identifi- cation stage (see Section 3.2).
  In addition, they need to be explicitly enforced only when full parsing information is not available because the output of the pruning heuristics never violates the
