 al., 2003), which contains bilingual phrase pairs and scores indicating their utility.
    The surface heuristic is the most popular method for phrase-table construction.
    It extracts all consistent phrase pairs from word-aligned bitext (Koehn et al., 2003).
    The word alignment provides bilingual links, indicating translation relationships between words.
    Consistency is defined so that alignment links are never broken by phrase boundaries.
    For each token w in a consistent phrase pair p, all tokens linked to w by the alignment must also be included in p. Each consistent phrase pair is counted as occurring once per sentence pair.
    The scores for the extracted phrase pairs are provided by normalizing these flat counts according to common English or Foreign components, producing the conditional distributions p( f|e) and p(e |f).
    The surface heuristic can define consistency according to any word alignment; but most often, the alignment is provided by GIZA++ (Och and Ney, 2003).
