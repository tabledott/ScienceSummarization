ators are presented with an interface which gives them access to both the frameset descriptions and the full syntactic parse of any sentence from the treebank and allows them to select nodes in the parse tree for labeling as arguments of the predicate selected.
  For any verb they are able to examine both the descriptions of the arguments and the example tagged sentences, much as they have been presented here.
  The tagging is done on a verb-by-verb basis, known as lexical sampling, rather than all-words annotation of running text.
  The downside of this approach is that it does not quickly provide a stretch of fully annotated text, needed for early assessment of the usefulness of the resource (see subsequent sections).
  For this reason a domain-specific subcorpus was automatically extracted from the entirety of the treebank, consisting of texts roughly primarily concerned with financial reporting and identified by the presence of a dollar sign anywhere in the text.
