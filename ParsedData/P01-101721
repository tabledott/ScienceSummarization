xity.
    If either of the other two explanations were correct one would not expect much difference between the two groups.
    The results are shown in Table 4.
    We see there that, for example, sentences for which the grammar model has the superior perplexity have average recall 5.9 (= 84.9&#8212;79.0) percentage points higher than the sentences for which the trigram model performed better.
    The gap for precision is 5.6.
    This seems to support our hypothesis.
  
  
    We have presented two grammar-based language models, both of which significantly improve upon both the trigram model baseline for the task (by 24% for the better of the two) and the best previous grammar-based language model (by 14%).
    Furthermore we have suggested that improvement of the underlying parser should improve the model&#8217;s perplexity still further.
    We should note, however, that if we were dealing with standard Penn Tree-bank Wall-StreetJournal text, asking for better parsers would be easier said than done.
