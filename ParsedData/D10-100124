    Subgradient algorithms perform updates that are similar to gradient descent: The previous section described how the method in figure 4 can be used to minimize the dual L(u) of the original linear program.
    We now turn to the problem of recovering a primal solution of the LP.
    The method we propose considers two cases: (Case 1) If at any stage during the algorithm, then simply take to be the primal solution.
    In this case the pair exactly solves the original LP.9 If this case arises in the algorithm in figure 1, then the resulting solution is binary (i.e., it is a member of Q), and the solution exactly solves the ori countered during the algorithm: --76 = Ek x = Ek x(2k) and Ozdaglar (2009) show that as K &#8212;* oo, these averaged solutions converge to the optimal primal solution.10 A second strategy (as given in figure 1) is to simply take as an approximation to the primal solution.
    This method is a heuristic, but previous work (e.g., Komodakis et al. (2007)) has shown that it is effectiv
