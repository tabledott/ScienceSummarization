s iterative procedure will increase the likelihood of (3) at each step.
  
  
    For each adaptation experiment, we start off with a classifier built from an initial training set consisting of the BC training examples.
    At each adaptation iteration, WSJ adaptation examples are selected one at a time and added to the training set.
    The adaptation process continues until all the adaptation examples are added.
    Classification accuracies averaged over 3 random trials on the WSJ test examples at each iteration are calculated.
    Since the number of WSJ adaptation examples differs for each of the 21 nouns, the learning curves we will show in the various figures are plotted in terms of different percentage of adaptation examples added, varying from 0 to 100 percent in steps of 1 percent.
    To obtain these curves, we first calculate for each noun, the WSD accuracy when different percentages of adaptation examples are added.
    Then, for each percentage, we calculate the macro-average WSD accuracy over a
