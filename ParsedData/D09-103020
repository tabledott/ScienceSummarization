ns for each article back to Mechanical Turk, and asked other Turkers to vote on whether each question was a good and to indicate if it was redundant with any other questions in the set.
    We sorted questions to maximize the votes and minimized redundancies using a simple perl script, which discarded questions below a threshold, and eliminated all redundancies.
    Taking the test We posted machine translated versions of the foreign articles along with the questions, and had Turkers answer them.
    We ensured that no one would see multiple translations of the same article.
    Grading the answers We aggregated the answers and used Mechanical Turk to grade them.
    We showed the human translation of the article, one question, the sample answer, and displayed all answers to it.
    After the Turkers graded the answers, we calculated the percentage of questions that were answered correctly for each system.
    Turkers created 90 questions for 10 articles, which were subsequently filtered down to 47 good quest
