    The class chosen for &amp;quot;VMS,&amp;quot; for example, is incorrect, and may reflect the fact that in a DEC troubleshooting database, authors see no need to further specify VMS as &amp;quot;VMS operating system.&amp;quot; A more interesting observation is that, among the collocations associated with the terms, there are often several that might qualify as classes of which the term is an instance, e.g., DECWindows could also be classified as &amp;quot;software&amp;quot;; TK50 might also qualify as &amp;quot;tape.&amp;quot; From a generative lexicon perspective, these alternative classifications reflect multiple inheritance through the noun's qualia.
    That is, &amp;quot;cartridge&amp;quot; is further specifying the formal role of tape for TK50.
