onstraints (e.g., a question answering situation) this framework is able to make use of the new information and enhance the performance at decision time, without retraining the classifiers.
    As we show, our formulation supports not only improved accuracy, but also improves the &#8216;human-like&#8221; quality of the decisions.
    We believe that it has the potential to be a powerful way for supporting natural language inferences.
