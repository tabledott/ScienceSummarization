    An alternative approach to reranking candidate parses is to work with inference criteria which admit dynamic programming solutions.
    Fig.
    3 shows three possible objective functions which use the easily obtained posterior marginals of the parse tree distribution.
    Interestingly, while they have fairly different decision theoretic motivations, their closed-form solutions are similar.
    25,000 samples do not improve the numbers appreciably.
    One option is to maximize likelihood in an approximate distribution.
    Matsuzaki et al. (2005) present a VARIATIONAL approach, which approximates the true posterior over parses by a cruder, but tractable sentence-specific one.
    In this approximate distribution there is no derivation / parse distinction and one can therefore optimize exact match by selecting the most likely derivation.
    Instead of approximating the tree distribution we can use an objective function that decomposes along parse posteriors.
