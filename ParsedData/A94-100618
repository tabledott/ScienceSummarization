the first choice (40%) or the second choice (7%) in the candidate list.
    For the remaining 53% of the terms, the correct answer was always somewhere in the concordances.
    Using the interface, the glossary was translated at a rate of about 100 terms per hour.
    Smadja (1992) and van der Eijk (1993) describe term translation methods that use bilingual texts that were aligned at the sentence level.
    Their methods find likely translations by computing statistics on term cooccurrence within aligned sentences and selecting source-target pairs with statistically significant associations.
    We found that explicit word alignments enabled us to identify translations of infrequent terms that would not otherwise meet statistical significance criteria.
    If the words of a term occur at least several times in the document (regardless of the term frequency) then word_align is likely to align them correctly and termight will identify the correct translation.
    If only some of the words of a term are frequent
