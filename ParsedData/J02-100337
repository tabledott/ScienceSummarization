 to Boolean combinations.
    For example, if an object x is identified through the relation R(xy) and the predicate P(y), then the degrees of preference of both R and P are relevant, and it is unclear which of the two is more important.)
    Once D&amp;RBoolean,Att is constructed along these lines, the question of overlapping Values arises in exactly the same way as in the case of D&amp;RAtt and D&amp;RPlural,Att.
    The problem arises if components of different unions overlap, as when the algorithm compares Vi,jUVk,l and Vi,jUVk,l,, where Vk,l and Vk,l, overlap in the sense of Section 3.1: as in the case of D&amp;RAtt, simply choosing the option that removes the most distractors may cause the algorithm to become incomplete.
    This problem can be overcome as before, using either limited backtracking or inclusion of all relevant options (Section 3.1).
    Instead of exploring D&amp;RBoolean,Att any further, we will return to its predecessor, D&amp;RBoolean, to prove that it is powerful enough to do its job
