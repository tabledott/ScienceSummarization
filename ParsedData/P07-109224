 sufficient triangulated data.
    We obtained similar results for en &#8212;* de.
    Our experimental results so far have shown that triangulation is not a mere approximation of the source-target phrase-table, but that it extracts additional useful translation information.
    We now assess the phrase-table quality more directly.
    Comparative statistics of a standard and a triangulated phrase-table are given in Table 4.
    The coverage over source and target phrases is much higher in the standard table than the triangulated tables, which reflects the reduced ability of triangulation to extract large phrases &#8212; despite the large increase in the number of events.
    The table also shows the overlapping probability mass which measures the sum of probability in one table for which the events are present in the other.
    This shows that the majority of mass is shared by both tables (as joint distributions), although there are significant differences.
    The JensenShannon divergence is perhaps more ap
