    Therefore, I would like to thank all the people who took the effort to annotate the Penn Treebank, the Susanne Corpus, the Stuttgarter Referenzkorpus, the NEGRA Corpus, the Verbmobil Corpora, and several others.
    And, last but not least, I would like to thank the users of TnT who provided me with bug reports and valuable suggestions for improvements.
