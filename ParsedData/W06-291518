    While one might solicit these contrasting word pairs from domain experts, our results show that statistical models such as SVM and naive Bayes can automatically acquire them.
    In addition to identifying the perspective of a document, we are interested in knowing which sentences of the document strongly conveys perspective information.
    Sentence-level perspective annotations do not exist in the bitterlemons corpus, which makes estimating parameters for the proposed Latent Sentence Perspective Model (LSPM) difficult.
    The posterior probability that a sentence strongly covey a perspective (Example (6)) is of the most interest, but we can not directly evaluate this model without gold standard annotations.
    As an alternative, we evaluate how accurately LSPM predicts the perspective of a document, again using 10-fold
