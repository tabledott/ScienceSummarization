  The Mathematics Of Statistical Machine Translation: Parameter Estimation
  
    We describe a series of five statistical models of the translation process and give algorithms for estimating the parameters of these models given a set of pairs of sentences that are translations of one another.
    We define a concept of word-by-word alignment between such pairs of sentences.
    For any given pair of such sentences each of our models assigns a probability to each of the possible word-by-word alignments.
    We give an algorithm for seeking the most probable of these alignments.
    Although the algorithm is suboptimal, the alignment thus obtained accounts well for the word-by-word relationships in the pair of sentences.
    We have a great deal of data in French and English from the proceedings of the Canadian Parliament.
    Accordingly, we have restricted our work to these two languages; but we feel that because our algorithms have minimal linguistic content they would work well on other pairs of languages
