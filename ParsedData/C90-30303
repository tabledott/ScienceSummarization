  context-dependent morphological disambigua- tion, , determination of intrasentential clause boun- daries, , disalnbiguation of surface syntactic functions.
  The first four of these modules are executed se- quentially, optimally followed by parallel execution of the last three modules which constitute syntax proper.
  We have a five-stage parsing-process.
  In this general setting, CG is the formalism of the fifth stage, syntax proper.
  The same CG constraint formalism is used to disambiguate morphological and syntactic ambiguities, and to locate clause boun- daries in a complex sentence.
  Parts of the CG for- rnalism are used also in morphosyntactic mapping.
  Real texts are full with idiosyncracies in regard to headings, footnotes, paragraph structure, interpunc- tuation, use of upper and lower case, etc.
  Such phenomena must be properly normalized.
  Further- more several purely linguistic phenomena must be somehow dealt
