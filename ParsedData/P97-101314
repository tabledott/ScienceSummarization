    In fact, the discourse marker that is responsible for most of our algorithm recall failures is and.
    Since a shallow analyzer cannot identify with sufficient precision whether an occurrence of and has a discourse or a sentential usage, most of its occurrences are therefore ignored.
    It is true that, in this way, the discourse structures that we build lose some potential finer granularity, but fortunately, from a rhetorical analysis perspective, the loss has insignificant global repercussions: the vast majority of the relations that we miss due to recall failures of and are JOINT and SEQUENCE relations that hold between adjacent clauses.
    Evaluation.
    To evaluate our algorithm, we randomly selected three texts, each belonging to a different genre: Three independent judges, graduate students in computational linguistics, broke the texts into clauses.
    The judges were given no instructions about the criteria that they had to apply in order to determine the clause boundaries; rather, they
