final result is not comparable to state-of-the-art techniques.
			As most errors were attributable to the hyponomy structure of WORDNET, incorporating the novel use of topicmodeling presented here with a more mature unsu pervised WSD algorithm to replace the underlyingWORDNET-WALK could lead to advances in state of-the-art unsupervised WSD accuracy.
