natural text is to recognize the words it contains, and this generally involves analyzing each of them in terms of a constituent set of formatives of some kind.
    Most important among the difficulties that this entails are those having to do with the different shapes that formatives assume in different environments.
    In other words, the principal difficulties of morphological analysis are in fact phonological or graphological.
    The inventor of two-level morphology, Kimmo Koskenniemi, is fact provided a finite-state account not just of morphophonemics (or morphographemics), but also of morphotactics.
    He took it that the allowable set of words simply constituted a regular set of morheme sequences.
    This is probably the more controversial part of his proposal, but it is also the less technically elaborate, and therefore the one that has attracted less attention.
    As a result, the term &amp;quot;two-level morphology&amp;quot; has come to be commonly accepted as applying to any system of word rec
