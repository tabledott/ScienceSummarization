 is learned au- tomatically to try to prediet proper attachment based on any of a number of possible contextual giles.
			Baseline l l indle and Rooth (IIR91, 1\[17{93) describe corpus-based approach to disambiguating between prepositional phrase attachlnent to the main verb and to the object nonn phrase (such as in the ex- ample sentence above).
			They first point out that simple attachment s rategies snch as right associa- tion (Kim73) and miuimal a.tbtchment (Fra78) do not work well i,l practice' (see (WFB90)).
			They then suggest using lexical preference, estimated from a large corpus of text, as a method of re- solving attachment ambiguity, a technique the}' call "lexical association."
			From a large corpus of pursed text, they first find all nonn phrase heads, and then record the verb (if' any) that precedes the head, and the preposition (if any) that follows it, as well as some other syntactic inforlnation about the sentence.
			An algorithm is then specified 1,o try to extract attachment informatio
