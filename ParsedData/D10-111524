s of observed ANs is in a sense almost trivial.
    Whether we synthesize an AN for generation or decoding purposes, we would want the synthetic AN to look as much as possible like a real AN in its natural usage contexts, and cooccurrence vectors of observed ANs are a summary of their usage in actual linguistic contexts.
    However, it might be the case that the specific resources we used for our vector construction procedure are not appropriate, so that the specific observed AN vectors we extract are not reliable (e.g., they are so sparse in the original space as to be uninformative, or they are strictly tied to the domains of the input corpora).
    We provide here some preliminary qualitative evidence that this is in general not the case, by tapping into our own intuitions on where ANs should be located in semantic space, and thus on how sensible their neighbors are.
    First, we computed centroids from normalized SVD space vectors of all the ANs that share the same adjective (e.g., the normalized vector
