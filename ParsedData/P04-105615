    All Medline abstracts were tokenized and then POS tagged using Brill's tagger (Brill, 1995).
    Each extracted protein name in the test data was compared to the human-tagged data, with the positions taken into account.
    Two extractions are considered a match if they consist of the same character sequence in the same position in the text.
    Results are shown in Tables 3 and 4 which give average precision, recall, and F-measure using 10-fold cross validation.
    These tables show that, in terms of Fmeasure, the use of global templates for modto improve a Maximum-Entropy tagger; however, these features do not fully capture the mutual influence between the labels of acronyms and their long forms, or between entity repetitions.
    In particular, they only allow earlier extractions in a document to influence later ones and not vice-versa.
    The RMN approach handles these and potentially other mutual influences between entities in a more complete, probabilistically sound manner.
