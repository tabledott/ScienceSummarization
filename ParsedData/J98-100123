nce), making it impossible to determine their effectiveness on real texts.
    For less obvious reasons, many of the AI-based disambiguation results involve highly ambiguous words and fine sense distinctions (e.g., ask, idea, hand, move, use, work, etc.) and unlikely test sentences (The astronomer married the star), which make the results even less easy to evaluate in the light of the now-known difficulties of discriminating even gross sense distinctions.
    The AI-based work of the 1970s and 1980s was theoretically interesting but not at all practical for language understanding in any but extremely limited domains.
    A significant roadblock to generalizing WSD work was the difficulty and cost of hand-crafting the enormous amounts of knowledge required for WSD: the so-called &amp;quot;knowledge acquisition bottleneck&amp;quot; (Gale, Church, and Yarowsky 1993).
    Work on WSD reached a turning point in the 1980s when large-scale lexical resources, such as dictionaries, thesauri, and corpora, became widely
