pace.
    Later, we show experiments with up to six thresholds.
    Since we don't have time to parse with one million parameter combinations, we need a better search algorithm.
    Ideally, we would like to be able to pick a performance level (in terms of either entropy or precision and recall) and find the best set of thresholds for achieving that performance level as quickly as possible.
    If this is our goal, then a normal gradient descent technique won't work, since we can't use such a technique to optimize one function of a set of variables (time as a function of thresholds) while holding another one constant (performance) .3 We wanted a metric of performance which would be sensitive to changes in threshold values.
    In particular, our ideal metric would be strictly increasing as our thresholds loosened, so that every loosening of threshold values would produce a measurable increase in performance.
    The closer we get to this ideal, the fewer sentences we need to test during parameter optimization
