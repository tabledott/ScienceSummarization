 insufficient grammatical relations for the tuples employed.
    Two such words, today and one, each occurred 5 times in the test data.
    Extending the grammatical relations used for building the thesaurus should improve the coverage.
    There were a similar number of words that were not covered by a predominant sense in SemCor.
    For these one would need to obtain more sense-tagged text in order to use this heuristic.
    Our automatic ranking gave 67% precision on these items.
    This demonstrates that our method of providing a first sense from raw text will help when sense-tagged data is not available.
  
  
    A major motivation for our work is to try to capture changes in ranking of senses for documents from different domains.
    In order to test this we applied our method to two specific sections of the Reuters corpus.
    We demonstrate that choosing texts from a particular domain has a significant influence on the sense ranking.
    We chose the domains of SPORTS and FINANCE since there is suf
