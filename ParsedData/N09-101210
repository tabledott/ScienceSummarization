rammars, these annotations correspond to words and/or parts-ofspeech.
    Additionally, split-head bilexical CFGs require that each word sij in sentence si is represented in a split form by two terminals called its left part sijL and right part sijR.
    The set of these parts constitutes the terminal symbols of the grammar.
    This split-head property relates to a particular type of dependency grammar in which the left and right dependents of a head are generated independently.
    Note that like CFGs, split-head bilexical CFGs can be made probabilistic.
    The most successful recent work on dependency induction has focused on the Dependency Model with Valence (DMV) by Klein and Manning (2004).
    DMV is a generative model in which the head of the sentence is generated and then each head recursively generates its left and right dependents.
    The arguments of head H in direction d are generated by repeatedly deciding whether to generate another new argument or to stop and then generating the argument if
