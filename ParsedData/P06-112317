ing constituents on one side of the bitext and with no gaps, alignment failure rates rose from 3% to 34%, but allowing a single gap on the side of the bitext that was not constrained by a parse tree brought the failure rate back down to 3%.
    With two constraining trees the failure rate was 61%, and allowing gaps did not lower it, for the same reasons that allowing gaps on the tree-constrained side made no difference in Table 3.
    The trends in the fiction bitext (Table 5) were similar to those in the MTEval bitext, but the coverage was always higher, for two reasons.
    First, the median sentence size was lower in the fiction bitext.
    Second, the MTEval translators were instructed to translate as literally as possible, but the fiction translators paraphrased to make the fiction more interesting.
    This freedom in word choice reduced the frequency of cognates and thus imposed fewer constraints on the hierarchical alignment, which resulted in looser estimates of the lower bounds.
    We would expect
