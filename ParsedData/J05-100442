  Kappas on the combined identification and classication decision, calculated over all nodes in the tree, are .91 including all sub- types of ArgM and .93 over numbered arguments only.
  Interannotator agreement among nodes that either annotator identified as an argument was .84, including ArgMs and .87, excluding ArgMs.
  Discrepancies between annotators tended to be less on numbered arguments than on the selection of function tags, as shown in the confusion matrices of Tables 3 and 4.
