created by applying a se ries of grammar rules, where each rule matches a fragment of the source and creates a fragment of the target tree.
			A rule in the grammar consists of a pair of elementary trees and a mapping between the variables (frontier non-terminals) in both trees.
			A derivation is a sequence of rules yielding a target tree with no remaining variables.
			Cohn and Lapata (2007) extract a STSG froma parsed, word-aligned corpus of source and target sentences.
			Specifically, they extract the mini mal set of synchronous rules which can describe each tree pair.
			These rules are minimal in the sensethat they cannot be made smaller (e.g., by replac ing a subtree with a variable) while still honouring the word-alignment.
			Decoding The grammar allows us to search for all sister trees for a given tree.
			The decoder maximises over this space: y ? =argmax y:S(y)=x ?(y) (1) where ?(y) = ? r?y ??(r, S(y)), ??
			(2) Here x is the source (uncompressed) tree, y is a derivation which produces the sourc
