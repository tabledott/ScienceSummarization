uency is one useful evidence source.
    Observe in Table 3 that in an 80 million word collection of newswire text the relative frequency distribution of sang/sing is 1427/1204 (or 1.19/1), which indicates a reasonably close frequency match, while the singed/sing ratio is 0.007/1, a substantial disparity.
    However, simply looking for close relative frequencies between an inflection and its candidate root is inappropriate, given that some inflections are relatively rare and expected to occur much less frequently than the root form.
    Thus in order to be able to rank the sang/sing and singed/sing candidates effectively, it is necessary to be able to quantify how well each fits (or deviates from) expected frequency distributions.
    To do so, we use simple non-parametric statistics to calculate the probability of a particularvBD ratio by examining how frequently other such ratios in a similar range have been seen in the corpus.
    Figure 1 illustrates such a histogram (based on the log of the ratios to fo
