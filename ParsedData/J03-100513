   The priority queues are limited in size, and only the 1,000 hypotheses with the highest probability are maintained.
    Each priority queue is assigned a threshold to select the hypotheses that are going to be extended, and the process of assigning these thresholds is rather complicated.
    A restriction on the possible word reorderings, which is described in Section 3.6, is applied.
    Wang and Waibel (1997) presents a search algorithm for the IBM-2 translation model based on the A&#8727; concept and multiple stacks.
    An extension of this algorithm is demonstrated in Wang and Waibel (1998).
    Here, a reshuffling step on top of the original decoder is used to handle more complex translation models (e.g., the IBM-3 model is added).
    Translation approaches that use the IBM-2 model parameters but are based on DP are presented in Garc&#180;&#305;a-Varea, Casacuberta, and Ney (1998) and Niessen et al. (1998).
    An approach based on the hidden Markov model alignments as used in speech recognition is
