l and Fmean are based on singleword matches.
    To take into account the extent to which the matched unigrams in the two strings are in the same word order, METEOR computes a penalty for a given alignment as follows.
    First, the sequence of matched unigrams between the two strings is divided into the fewest possible number of &#8220;chunks&#8221; such that the matched unigrams in each chunk are adjacent (in both strings) and in identical word order.
    The number of chunks (ch) and the number of matches (m) is then used to calculate a fragmentation fraction: frag = ch/m.
    The penalty is then computed as: The value of y determines the maximum penalty (0 &lt; y &lt; 1).
    The value of 0 determines the functional relation between fragmentation and the penalty.
    Finally, the METEOR score for the alignment between the two strings is calculated as: score = (1 &#8722; Pen) &#183; Fmean In all previous versions of METEOR , the values of the three parameters mentioned above were set to be: a = 0.9, 0 = 3.
