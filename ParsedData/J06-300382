ts are based on the frequencies of 64 hand-built patterns in a large corpus.
    LRA extends this approach in three ways: (1) The patterns are generated dynamically from the corpus, (2) SVD is used to smooth the data, and (3) a thesaurus is used to explore variations of the word pairs.
    With the WMTS corpus (about 5 &#215; 1010 English words), LRA achieves an F of 56.5%, whereas the F of VSM is 40.3%.
    We have presented several examples of the many potential applications for measures of relational similarity.
    Just as attributional similarity measures have proven to have many practical uses, we expect that relational similarity measures will soon become widely used.
    Gentner et al. (2001) argue that relational similarity is essential to understanding novel metaphors (as opposed to conventional metaphors).
    Many researchers have argued that metaphor is the heart of human thinking (Lakoff and Johnson 1980; Hofstadter and the Fluid Analogies Research Group 1995; Gentner et al. 2001; French 2002).
