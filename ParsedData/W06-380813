measure, for which we re-tuned these parameters.)
    Note that we learned a single set of shared parameters for all authors, whereas (Pang and Lee, 2005) tuned k and &#945; on a per-author basis.
    To demonstrate that our implementation of metric labeling produces comparable results, we also determined the optimal author-specific parameters.
    Table 1 shows the accuracy obtained over 20 trials with |L |= 0.9n for each author, using SVM regression, reg+PSP using shared c, &#945; parameters, and reg+PSP using authorspecific c, &#945; parameters (listed in parentheses).
    The best result in each row of the table is highlighted in bold.
    We also show in bold any results that cannot be distinguished from the best result using a paired t-test at the 0.05 level.
    (Pang and Lee, 2005) found that their metric labeling method, when applied to the 4-class data we are using, was not statistically better than regression, though they observed some improvement for authors (c) and (d).
