nd valleys, and also meaningless noise.
    The graph is so complicated that one can not easily determine which valley should be considered as a segment boundary.
    The shape of the window, which defines weight of words in it for pattern production, makes LCP smooth.
    Experiments on several window shapes (e.g. triangle window, etc.) shows that Harming window is best for clarifying the macroscopic features of LCP.
    The width of the window also has effect on the macroscopic features of LCP, especially on separability of segments.
    Experiments on several window widths (A =5 &#8212; 60) reveals that the Hanning window of A =25 gives the best correlation between LCP and segments.
  
  
    This section inspects the correlation between LCP and segment boundaries perceived by the human judgments.
    The curve of Figure 4 shows the LCP of the simplified version of 0.Henry's &amp;quot;Springtime a la Carte&amp;quot; (Thornley, 1960).
    The solid bars represent the histogram of segment boundaries reported
