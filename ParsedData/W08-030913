e system translations.
    The English, French, German and Spanish test sets were automatically parsed using high quality parsers for those languages (Bikel, 2002; Arun and Keller, 2005; Dubey, 2005; Bick, 2006).
    The word alignments were created with Giza++ (Och and Ney, 2003) applied to a parallel corpus containing the complete Europarl training data, plus sets of 4,051 sentence pairs created by pairing the test sentences with the reference translations, and the test sentences paired with each of the system translations.
    The phrases in the translations were located using standard phrase extraction techniques (Koehn et al., 2003).
    Because the word-alignments were created automatically, and because the phrase extraction is heuristic, the phrases that were selected may not exactly correspond to the translations of the selected source phrase.
    We noted this in the instructions to judges: Rank each constituent translation from Best to Worst relative to the other choices (ties are allowed).
