n (29) is unity, it is equally clear that this can no longer be the case if we assume that Pr(llik = e) depends only on], i, m, and 1 for i &gt; 0.
    Because the distortion probabilities for assigning positions to later words do not depend on the positions assigned to earlier words, Model 3 wastes some of its probability on what we might call generalized strings, i.e., strings that have some positions with several words and others with none.
    When a model has this property of not concentrating all of its probability on events of interest, we say that it is deficient.
    Deficiency is the price that we pay for the simplicity that allows us to write Equation (43).
    Deficiency poses no serious problem here.
    Although Models 1 and 2 are not technically deficient, they are surely spiritually deficient.
    Each assigns the same probability to the alignments (Je n'ai pas de stylo 1 I(1) do not(2,4) have(3) a(5) pen(6)) and (Je pas ai ne de stylo 1 I(1) do not(2,4) have(3) a(5) pen(6)), and, therefore, e
