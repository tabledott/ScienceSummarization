he latter is less useful, part-of-speech may provide additional power.
  
  
    In this paper, we have examined the problem of disambiguating cue phrases in both text and speech.
    We have presented results of several analyses of cue phrase usage in corpora of recorded, transcribed speech, in which we examined a number of text-based and prosodic features to find which best predicted a discourse/sentential distinction.
    Based on these studies, we have proposed an intonational model for cue phrase disambiguation in speech, based on intonational phrasing and pitch accent, and a model for cue phrase disambiguation in text, based on orthographic indicators and part-ofspeech information.
    Work on the meanings associated with particular intonational features, such as phrasing and pitch accent type, provides an explanation for the different prosodic configurations associated with discourse and sentential uses of cue phrases.
    As we have demonstrated above, discourse uses of cue phrases fit one of two mode
