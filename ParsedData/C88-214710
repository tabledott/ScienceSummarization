, we may wish to obtain verb-clusters by adiunctions atnodes which are labelled ~s verbs.
  In such a c~se, we will have to associate two feature structures with pre.lexical nodes too.
  715 Let Us now consider the case when adjoining takes place as showu in the figure 4.
  The notation we use is to write alongside ach node, the t and b statements, with the t statement written above the b statement.
  Let us say that t~oot,b~oot aud tloo~,b/oo~ are the t and b statements of the root and foot nodes of the auxiliary tree used for adjunction at the node r/.
  Based on what t and b stand for, it is obvious that on adjnnction tim statements ,~ and troot hold of the node corresponding to the root of the anxifiary tree.
  Similarly, the statements b, and b/oot hold of the node corresponding to the foot of the auxiliary tree.
  Thus, ou adjunction, we unify t, with t~oot, and b,~ with b/oot.
  In fact, this adjunetion is permissible only if t,.oot and t o are cmnpatible as are b/oo~ and b,.
  If we do not adjoin at t
