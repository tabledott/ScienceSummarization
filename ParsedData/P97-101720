ieves the objectives outlined in Section 1.
    It ports easily to new language pairs; the P(w) and P(eitv) models are entirely reusable, while other models are learned automatically.
    It is robust against OCR noise, in a rare example of high-level language processing being useful (necessary, even) in improving low-level OCR.
    We plan to replace our shortest-path extraction algorithm with one of the recently developed kshortest path algorithms (Eppstein, 1994).
    We will then return a ranked list of the k best translations for subsequent contextual disambiguation, either by machine or as part of an interactive man-machine system.
    We also plan to explore probabilistic models for Arabic/English transliteration.
    Simply identifying which Arabic words to transliterate is a difficult task in itself; and while Japanese tends to insert extra vowel sounds, Arabic is usually written without any (short) vowels.
    Finally, it should also be possible to embed our phonetic shift model P( jle) inside a spe
