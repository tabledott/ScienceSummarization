 instances that consist of sets of features paired with their classes corresponding to the correct parsing actions.
    These instances can be obtained by running the algorithm on a corpus of sentences for which the correct parse trees are known.
    Instead of using the classifier to determine the parser&#8217;s actions, we simply determine the correct action by consulting the correct parse trees.
    We then record the features and corresponding actions for parsing all sentences in the corpus into their correct trees.
    This set of features and corresponding actions is then used to train a classifier, resulting in a complete parser.
    When parsing a sentence with n words, the parser takes n shift actions (exactly one for each word in the sentence).
    Because the maximum branching factor of trees built by the parser is two, the total number of binary reduce actions is n &#8211; 1, if a complete parse is found.
    If the input string is rejected, the number of binary reduce actions is less than n &#821
