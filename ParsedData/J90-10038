 be much less than P(x) P(y), forcing I(x,y) &#171; 0.
    In our application, word probabilities P(x) and P(y) are estimated by counting the number of observations of x and y in a corpus, f (x) and f (y), and normalizing by N, the size of the corpus.
    (Our examples use a number of different corpora with different sizes: 15 million words for the 1987 AP corpus, 36 million words for the 1988 AP corpus, and 8.6 million tokens for the tagged corpus.)
    Joint probabilities, P(x,y), are estimated by counting the number of times that xis followed by y in a window of w words,f,(x,y), and normalizing by N. The window size parameter allows us to look at different scales.
    Smaller window sizes will identify fixed expressions (idioms such as bread and butter) and other relations that hold over short ranges; larger window sizes will highlight semantic concepts and other relationships that hold over larger scales.
    Table 1 may help show the contrast.2 In fixed expressions, such as bread and butter and drink and
