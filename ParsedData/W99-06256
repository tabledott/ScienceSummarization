arity generally involve the creation of a vector or profile of characteristics of a text fragment, and then computing on the basis of frequencies the distance between vectors to determine conceptual distance [Salton and Buckley 1988; Salton 19891.
    Features typically include stemmed words although sometimes multi-word units and collocations have been used [Smeaton 1992], as well as typological characteristics, such as thesaural features.
    The distance between vectors for one text (usually a query) and another (usually a document) then determines closeness or similarity [van Rijsbergen 1979].
    In some cases, the texts are represented as vectors of sparse n-grams of word occurrences and learning is applied over those vectors [Schapire and Singer 1999].
    But since our definition of similarity is oriented to the small-segment goal, we make more fine-grained distinctions.
    Thus, a set of passages that would probably go into the same class by standard IR criteria would be further separated by our met
