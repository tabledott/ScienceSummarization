ore a different strategy to perform MBR decoding over Translation Lattices (Ueffing et al., 2002) that compactly encode a huge number of translation alternatives relative to an N-best list.
    This is a model-independent approach in that the lattices could be produced by any statistical MT system &#8212; both phrase-based and syntaxbased systems would work in this framework.
    We will introduce conditions on the loss functions that can be incorporated in Lattice MBR decoding.
    We describe an approximation to the BLEU score (Papineni et al., 2001) that will satisfy these conditions.
    Our Lattice MBR decoding is realized using Weighted Finite State Automata.
    We expect Lattice MBR decoding to improve upon N-best MBR primarily because lattices contain many more candidate translations than the Nbest list.
    This has been demonstrated in speech recognition (Goel and Byrne, 2000).
    We conduct a range of translation experiments to analyze lattice MBR and compare it with N-best MBR.
