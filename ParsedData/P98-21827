andom distributions than if they had each occurred twice and had always co-occurred.
    A simple probability does not capture this fact.
    The rationale for using two different statistics for this task is that each is well suited for its particular role, and not particularly well suited to the other.
    We have already mentioned that the simple ratio is ill suited to dealing with infrequent occurrences.
    It is thus a poor candidate for ranking the final output, if that list includes words of as few as one occurrence in the corpus.
    The log likelihood statistic, we found, is poorly suited to selecting new seed words in an iterative algorithm of this sort, because it promotes high frequency nouns, which can then overly influence selections in future iterations, if they are selected as seed words.
    We termed this phenomenon infection, and found that it can be so strong as to kill the further progress of a category.
    For example, if we are processing the category vehicle and the word artillery is
