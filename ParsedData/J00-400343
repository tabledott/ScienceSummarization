acholder and Ravin 1997; Mikheev, Moens, and Grover 1999) and was one of the tasks evaluated in the Sixth and Seventh Message Understanding Conferences.
    In MUC-6, 15 different systems participated in the competition (Sundheirri 1995).
    For the version of the system discussed and evaluated here, we implemented a preliminary algorithm for named entity recognition that we developed ourselves; a more recent version of the system (1shikawa 1998) uses the named entity recognition software developed by HCRC for the MUC-7 competition (Mikheev, Moens, and Grover 1999).
    WordNet contains the types of a few names&#8212;typically, of famous people, countries, states, cities, and languages.
    Other entity types can be identified using appositive constructions and abbreviations (such as Mr, Co., and Inc.) as cues.
    Our algorithm for assigning a type to proper names is based on a mixture of the heuristics just described.
    The system first looks for the above-mentioned cues to try to identify the name type.
