n below, we discard all signatures that are associated with only one stem (these latter form the overwhelming majority, well over 90%) and all signatures with only one suffix.
    The remaining signatures we shall call regular signatures, and we will call all of the suffixes that we find in them the regular suffixes.
    As we shall see, the regular suffixes are not quite the suffixes we would like to establish for the language, but they are a very good approximation, and constitute a good initial analysis.
    The nonregular signatures produced by the take-all-splits approach are typically of no interest, as examples such as ch.e.eriaLerials.rimony.rons.uring and el.ezed.nce.reupon.ther illustrate.
    The reader may identify the single English pseudostem that occurs with each of these signatures.
    The regular signatures are thus those that specify exactly the entire set of suffixes used by at least two stems in the corpus.
    The presence of a signature rests upon the existence of a structure as in (6),
