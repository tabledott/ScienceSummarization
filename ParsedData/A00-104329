phrases based only on their syntactic categories, while the focus of our system is on deciding when it is appropriate to remove a phrase.
    Other researchers worked on the text simplification problem, which usually involves in simplifying text but not removing any phrases.
    For example, (Carroll et al., 1998) discussed simplifying newspaper text by replacing uncommon words with common words, or replacing complicated syntactic structures with simpler structures to assist people with reading disabilities.
    (Chandrasekar et al., 1996) discussed text simplification in general.
    The difference between these studies on text simplification and our system is that a text simplification system usually does not remove anything from an original sentence, although it may change its structure or words, but our system removes extraneous phrases from the extracted sentences.
  
  
    We present a novel sentence reduction system which removes extraneous phrases from sentences that are extracted from an article in
