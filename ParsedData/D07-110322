 of poorly supported pairs, which agrees with intuition.Although there may be other approaches to prun ing that achieve a similar effect, the use of Fisher?s exact test is mathematically and conceptually one of the simplest since it asks a question separately for each phrase pair: ?Considering this phase pair in isolation of any other analysis on the corpus, could it have occurred plausibly by purely random processes inherent in the corpus construction??
			If the answer is ?Yes?, then it is hard to argue that the phrase pair is an association of general applicability from the evidence in this corpus alone.
			Note that the removal of 1-count phrase pairs is subsumed by significance pruning with a thresholdgreater than ? and many of the other simple ap proaches (from an implementation point of view) are more difficult to justify as simply as the above significance test.
			Nonetheless, there remains workto do in determining if computationally simpler ap proaches do as well.
