e is a fairly straightforward extension of them that can evaluate empty node and antecedent recovery, as described in section 3.
    The rest of this section provides a brief introduction to empty nodes, especially as they are used in the Penn Treebank.
    Non-local dependencies and displacement phenomena, such as Passive and WH-movement, have been a central topic of generative linguistics since its inception half a century ago.
    However, current linguistic research focuses on explaining the possible non-local dependencies, and has little to say about how likely different kinds of dependencies are.
    Many current linguistic theories of non-local dependencies are extremely complex, and would be difficult to apply with the kind of broad coverage described here.
    Psycholinguists have also investigated certain kinds of non-local dependencies, and their theories of parsing preferences might serve as the basis for specialized algorithms for recovering certain kinds of non-local dependencies, such as WH dep
