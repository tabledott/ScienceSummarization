s, capturing relation differences which can play a role in applications (DP2), while sticking to notions of traditional grammar (DP3).
    The SD scheme also chooses content words as heads of the dependencies (DP5).
    Auxiliaries, complementizers, and so on, are dependents of them.
    This choice in design is driven by the kind of information that is useful for applications.
    For instance, in the sentence Considered as a whole, Mr. Lane said, the filings required under the proposed rules &#8220;will be at least as effective, if not more so, for investors following transactions&#8221; (WSJ-R), effective is chosen as the head of the quoted phrase.
    This enables the representation to have a direct dependency (nsubj for nominal subject) between the key content words effective and filings.
    Such a link is more difficult to infer from the GR scheme, where be is chosen as the head.
    However the relation between effective and filings is key to extracting the gist of the sentence semantics, and it is th
