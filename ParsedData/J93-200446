icated because of the current Treebanks essentially context-free represen- tation.
  For example, there is at present no satisfactory representation for sentences in which complement oun phrases or clauses occur after a sentential level adverb.
  Either the adverb is trapped within the VP, so that the complement can occur within the VP where it belongs, or else the adverb is attached to the S, closing off the VP and forcing the complement to attach to the S. This "trapping" problem serves as a limitation for groups that currently use Treebank material semiautomatically to derive lexicons for particular applications.
  For most of these problems, however, solutions are possible on the basis of mechanisms already used by the Treebank Project.
  For example, the pseudo-attachment no ation can be extended to indicate a variety of crossing depen- dencies.
  We have recently begun to use this mechanism to represent various kinds of dislocations, and the Treebank annotators themselves have developed a detailed propo
