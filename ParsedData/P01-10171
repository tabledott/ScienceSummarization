    It is also worthy of note that many of these [1,3,6,7] are that is, for a try to find the parse by Equation 1: = arg (1) This is interesting because insofar as they comthese parsers define a language-model in that they can (in principle) assign a probability to all possible sentences in the language by com
  
  
    All of the most accurate statistical parsers [1,3, 6,7,12,14] are lexicalized in that they condition probabilities on the lexical content of the sentences being parsed.
    Furthermore, all of these where p(7, s) is zero if the yield of 7 =&#65533; s. Language models, of course, are of interest because speech-recognition systems require them.
    These systems determine the words that were
