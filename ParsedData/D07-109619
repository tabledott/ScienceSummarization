t labeled data sets.
			The first two were annotated as part of the PennBioIE project (Kulick et al, 2004) and consist of sentences drawn from either biomedical or chemical research abstracts.
			Like the source WSJ corpus, this data is annotated using thePenn Treebank phrase structure scheme.
			To con vert these sets to dependency structures we used the same procedure as before (Johansson and Nugues,2007a).
			Additional care was taken to remove sen tences that contained non-WSJ part-of-speech tagsor non-terminals (e.g., HYPH part-of-speech tag in dicating a hyphen).
			Furthermore, the annotation scheme for gaps and traces was made consistent with the Penn Treebank wherever possible.
			As already mentioned, the biomedical data set was distributed as a development set for the training phase, while the chemical data set was only used for final testing.
			The third target data set was taken from theCHILDES database (MacWhinney, 2000), in partic ular the EVE corpus (Brown, 1973), which has beenannotated with
