guage model is integrated by intersecting the English-side CFG with the language model, which is a weighted finitestate automaton.
  
  
    The training process begins with a word-aligned corpus: a set of triples hf, e, &#8764;i, where f is a French sentence, e is an English sentence, and &#8764; is a (manyto-many) binary relation between positions of f and positions of e. We obtain the word alignments using the method of Koehn et al. (2003), which is based on that of Och and Ney (2004).
    This involves running GIZA++ (Och and Ney, 2000) on the corpus in both directions, and applying refinement rules (the variant they designate &#8220;final-and&#8221;) to obtain a single many-to-many word alignment for each sentence.
    Then, following Och and others, we use heuristics to hypothesize a distribution of possible derivations of each training example, and then estimate the phrase translation parameters from the hypothesized distribution.
    To do this, we first identify initial phrase pairs using the same cr
