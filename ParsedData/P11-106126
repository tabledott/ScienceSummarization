ible to learn accurate POS taggers for languages which do not have any annotated data, but have translations into a resource-rich language.
    Our results outperform strong unsupervised baselines as well as approaches that rely on direct projections, and bridge the gap between purely supervised and unsupervised POS tagging models.
