s this desired weighting: (where W = word tokens.
    S = sentences.
    C' = characters, T = word types).
    The 55 cues in our experiments can be combined to almost 3000 different ratios.
    The log representation ensures that all these ratios are available implicitly while avoiding overfitting and the high computational cost of training on a large set of cues.
    Variation measures capture the amount of variation of a certain count cue in a text (e.g.. the standard deviation in sentence length).
    This type of useful metric has not been used in previous work on genre.
    The experiments in this paper are based on 55 cues from the last three groups: lexical, characterlevel and derivative cues.
    These cues are easily computable in contrast to the structural cues that have figured prominently in previous work on genre.
  
  
    The corpus of texts used for this study was the Brown Corpus.
    For the reasons mentioned above, we used our own classification system, and eliminated texts that did not fa
