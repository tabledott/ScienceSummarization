s is given in Table 5.
    Note that we can only compare macroaveraged recall for SENSEVAL-1 systems, since the sense of each individual test instance output by the SENSEVAL-1 participating systems is not available.
    The comparison indicates that our SVM system is better than the best official SENSEVAL-2 and SENSEVAL-1 systems at the level of significance 0.05.
    Note that we are able to obtain state-of-the-art results using a single learning algorithm (SVM), without resorting to combining multiple learning algorithms.
    Several top SENSEVAL-2 participating systems have attempted the combination of classifiers using different learning algorithms.
    In SENSEVAL-2, JHU used a combination of various learning algorithms (decision lists, cosinebased vector models, and Bayesian models) with various knowledge sources such as surrounding words, local collocations, syntactic relations, and morphological information.
    SMUls used a k-nearest neighbor algorithm with features such as keywords, collocations, PO
