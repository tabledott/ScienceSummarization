 this procedure from the leaves to the root of t we have our most likely non-overlapping assignment.
    By slightly modifying this procedure, we obtain the most likely assignment according to a product of local identification and classification models.
    We use the local models in conjunction with this search procedure to select a most-likely labeling in testing.
    The complexity of this algorithm is linear in the number of nodes in the parse tree, which is usually much less than the square of the number of words in the sentence (l2), the complexity of the Punyakanok and Roth (2001) algorithm.
    For example, for a binarybranching parse tree, the number of nodes is approximately 2l.
    The speedup is due to the fact that when we label parse tree nodes, we make use of the bracketing constraints imposed by the parse tree.
    The shortest path algorithm proposed by Punyakanok and Roth can also be adapted to achieve this lower computational complexity.
    It turns out that enforcing the non-overlapping c
