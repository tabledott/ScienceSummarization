y different segments in the forms on the right.
    For these purposes, the &amp;quot;n&amp;quot; of the first pair of forms should be ignored since it is contributed by the prosodic template, and not by the root. consonantal slot in the prosodic template only in the case of the shorter form.
    The structure of the second and third forms is equally straighforward, but it is less easy to see how our machinery could account for them.
    Once again, the template calls for four root consonants and, where only three are provided, one must do double duty.
    But in this case, the effect is achieved through gemination rather than spreading so that the gemination mechanism just outlined is presumably in play.
    That mechanism makes no provision for gemination to be invoked only when needed to fill slots in the prosodic template that would otherwise remain empty.
    If the mechanism were as just described, and the triliteral forms were &amp;quot;CVGCVC&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;tVCVGCVC&amp;quot; respectively, th
