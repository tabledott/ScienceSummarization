tives, anaphora or lexical relations (Jing, 1999).
    One interesting problem for future work is the question of how much context to include from a sentence from which an intersected phrase is drawn.
    Currently, we include no context, but in some cases context is crucial even though it is not a part of the intersection.
    This is the case, for example, when the context negates, or denies, the embedded sub-clause which matches a sub-clause in another negating context.
    In such cases, the resulting summary is actually false.
    This occurs just once in our test cases, but it is a serious error.
    Our work will characterize the types of contextual information that should be retained and will develop algorithms for the case of negation, among others.
