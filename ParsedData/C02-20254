  Their wide distribution and common acceptance make the HPSG framework and resources an excellent anchor point for the Redwoods treebanking initiative.
  The key innovative aspect of the Redwoods ap- proach to treebanking is the anchoring of all linguis- tic data captured in the treebank to the HPSG frame- work and a generally-available broad-coverage gram- mar of English, the LinGO English Resource Grammar (Flickinger, 2000) as implemented with the LKB gram- mar development environment (Copestake, 2002).
  Un- like existing treebanks, there is no need to define a (new) form of grammatical representation specific to the tree- bank.
  Instead, the treebank records complete syntacto- semantic analyses as defined by the LinGO ERG and pro- vide tools to extract different types of linguistic informa- tion at varying granularity.
