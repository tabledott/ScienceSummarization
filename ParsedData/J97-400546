s gain is the solution to the equation: where q&#8222; is the distribution that results from adding f to the field with log weight a.
    This equation can be solved using Newton's method.
    Define To find the value of a for which F(a) = 0, we begin at a convenient point ao (the &amp;quot;null&amp;quot; weight ao = 0 recommends itself) and iteratively compute: F(at) Della Pietra, Della Pietra, and Lafferty (1995) show that F'(at) is equal to the negative of the variance off under the new field, which I will write &#8211;17&#8222;[f].
    To compute the iteration (6) we need to be able to compute F(at) and F'(at).
    For F(at) we require p[f] and q&#8222;[f], and F'(at) can be expressed as [f simply the average value of f in the training corpus.
    The remaining terms are all of the form qa [FL We can re-express this expectation in terms of the old field -gold The expectations qoid fief] can be obtained by generating a random sample (z1, .
