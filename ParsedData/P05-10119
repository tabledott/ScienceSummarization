 phrasal category (e.g.
    NP, VP) WORD the surface form of the head word POS the part-of-speech of the head word LE the lexical entry assigned to the head word parsing a treebank, while this approximation causes bias in the training data and results in lower accuracy.
    The trade-off between the parsing cost and the accuracy will be examined experimentally.
    We have several ways to integrate p with the estimated model p(tIT(s)).
    In the experiments, we will empirically compare the following methods in terms of accuracy and estimation time.
    Filtering only The unigram probability p is used only for filtering.
    Product The probability is defined as the product of p and the estimated model p. Reference distribution p is used as a reference distribution of p. Feature function log is used as a feature function of p. This method was shown to be a generalization of the reference distribution method (Johnson and Riezler, 2000).
  
  
    Feature functions in the log-linear models are designed to captu
