  The table shows very low error rates for the similarity-based models, up to 15 points lower than the EM-based models.
    The error rates sus error rate by frequency band, Jaccard, uniform weights of Resnik's model are considerably higher than both the EM-based and the similarity-based models, which is unexpected.
    While EM-based models have been shown to work better in SRL tasks (Gildea and Jurafsky, 2002), this has been attributed to the difference in coverage.
    In addition to the full coverage condition, we also computed error rate and coverage for the half coverage case.
    In this condition, the error rates of the EM-based models are unchanged, while the error rates for all similarity-based models as well as Resnik's model rise to values between 0.4 and 0.6.
    So the EM-based model tends to have preferences only for the &#8220;right&#8221; words.
    Why this is so is not clear.
    It may be a genuine property, or an artifact of the FrameNet data, which only contains chosen, illustrative sent
