r[G = u|Y = y], and q1 = 1 &#8722; p1.
    By definition, p1 and p2 cannot exceed 0.5.
    If p1 = 0.5, then weak rule dependence reduces to independence: if p1 = 0.5 and weak rule dependence is satisfied, then dy must be 0, which is to say, F and G must be conditionally independent.
    However, as p1 decreases, the permissible amount of conditional dependence increases.
    We can now state a generalized version of theorem 2: Theorem 3 For all F E W1, G E W2 that satisfy weak rule dependence and are nontrivial predictors in the sense that minu Pr[F = u] &gt; Pr[F =&#65533; G], one of the following inequalities holds: Consider figure 3.
    This illustrates the most relevant case, in which F and G are positively correlated given Y .
    (Only the case Y = + is shown; the case Y = &#8722; is similar.)
    We assume that the minority values of F are error values; the other cases are handled as in the discussion of theorem 2.
    Let u be the minority value of G when Y = +.
    In figure 3, a is the probability
