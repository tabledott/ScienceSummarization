ntaining it were extracted from the North American News Corpus.
    Preprocessing included detecting sentence boundaries and part-of-speech tagging.
    As in the development system, the model of general English was based on bigram and trigram frequencies of function words and part-ofspeech tags from 30-million words of the San Jose Mercury News.
    For each test word, all of the test sentences were marked by ALEK as either containing an error or not containing an error.
    The size of the test set for each word ranged from 1,400 to 20,000 with a mean of 8,000 sentences.
    To evaluate the system, for each test word we randomly extracted 125 sentences that ALEK classified as containing no error (C-set) and 125 sentences which it labeled as containing an error (E-set).
    These 250 sentences were presented to a linguist in a random order for blind evaluation.
    The linguist, who had no part in ALEK's development, marked each usage of the target word as incorrect or correct and in the case of incorrect us
