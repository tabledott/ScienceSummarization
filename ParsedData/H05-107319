eases data complexity.
			Third and finally, the EMOTION class is combined by basic emotion labels, rather than an original annotated label.
			More detailed averaged results from 10-fold cross-validation are included in table 6 using all features and the separated tuning and evaluationdata condition sep-tune-eval.
			With these parame ters, approximately 3% improvement in accuracy over the na??ve baseline P(Neutral) was recorded, and 5% over the content BOW, which obviously did poorly with these parameters.
