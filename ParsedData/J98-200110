nections between discourse entities; this makes familiarity-based analyses more attractive.
    From a methodological point of view, it was important to choose an annotation scheme that (i) would make the classification task doable by subjects not trained in linguistics, and (ii) had already been applied to the task of corpus analysis.
    We felt that we could ask naive subjects to assign each definite description to one of a few classes and to identify its antecedent when appropriate; we also wanted an annotation scheme that would characterize the whole range of definite description use, so that we would not need to worry about eliminating definite .descriptions from our texts because they were unclassifiable.
    For these reasons, we chose Hawkins's list of definite description uses (Hawkins 1978) and Prince's taxonomy (Prince 1981, 1992) as our starting point, and developed from there two slightly different annotation schemes, which allowed us to see whether it was better to describe the classes to our a
