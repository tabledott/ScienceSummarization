  2.1 Features and Search The feature function ?
  is a second-order edge- factored representation (McDonald and Pereira, 2006; Carreras, 2007).
  The second-order repre- sentation allows us to express features not only of head?dependent links, but also of siblings and chil- dren of the dependent.
  This feature set forces us to adopt the expensive search procedure by Car- reras (2007), which extends Eisner?s span-based dynamic programming algorithm (1996) to allow second-order feature dependencies.
  Since the cost function ?
  is based on the cost of single links, this procedure can also be used to find the maximizer of F (x i , y ij )+?
  (y i , y ij ), which is ne
