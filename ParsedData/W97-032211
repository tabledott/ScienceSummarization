    Experiments were conducted to disambiguate 13 different words using 3 different feature sets.
    In these experiments, each of the 3 unsupervised disambiguation methods is applied to each of the 13 words using each of the 3 feature sets; this defines a total of 117 different experiments.
    In addition, each experiment was repeated 25 times in order to study the variance introduced by randomly selecting initial parameter estimates, in the case of the EM algorithm, and randomly selecting among equally distant groups when clustering using Ward's and McQuitty's methods.
    In order to evaluate the unsupervised learning algorithms we use sense&#8212;tagged text in these experiments.
    However, this text is only used to evaluate the accuracy of our methods.
    The classes discovered by the unsupervised learning algorithms are mapped to dictionary senses in a manner that maximizes their agreement with the sense&#8212;tagged text.
    If the sense&#8212;tagged text were not availab
