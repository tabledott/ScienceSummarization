 because for each 7-, there are Oz! arrangements that lead to the pair f, a.
    Figure 4 shows the two tableaux for (bon marche cheap(1,2)).
    Except for degenerate cases, there is one alignment in .4(e, f) for which Pr(ale, f) is greatest.
    We call this the Viterbi alignment for (f le) and denote it by V(f le).
    We know of no practical algorithm for finding V(f le) for a general model.
    Indeed, if someone were to claim that he had found V(f le), we know of no practical algorithm for demonstrating that he is correct.
    But for Model 2 (and, thus, also for Model 1), finding V(fle) is straightforward.
    For each j, we simply choose aj so as to make the product t(fjI ec,i)a(ailj , m, 1) as large as possible.
    The Viterbi alignment depends on the model with respect to which it is computed.
    When we need to distinguish between the Viterbi alignments for different models, we write V(f le; 1), V(fle; 2), and so on.
    We denote by &#8222;4,___1(e, f) the set of alignments for which al = i.
