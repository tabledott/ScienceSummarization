igned atomic categories such as NP, or functor categories like (S[dcl]\NP)/NP (transitive declarative verb) or S/S (sentential modifier).
    Adjuncts are represented as functor categories such as S/S which expect and return the same type.
    We use indices to number the arguments of functor categories, eg.
    (S[dcl]\NP1)/NP2, or S/S1, and indicate the wordword dependencies in the predicate-argument structure as tuples (wh, ch, i, wa), where ch is the lexical category of the head word wh, and wa is the head word of the constituent that fills the ith argument of ch.
    Long-range dependencies can be projected through certain types of lexical categories or through rules such as coordination of functor categories.
    For example, in the lexical category of a relative pronoun, (NP\NP;)/(S[dcl]/NP;), the head of the NP that is missing from the relative clause is unified with (as indicated by the indices i) the head of the NP that is modified by the entire relative clause.
