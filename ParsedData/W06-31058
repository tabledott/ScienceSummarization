( 1I1, eI1, a) such that a provides a oneto-one mapping from &#65533;fI1 to eI1 where all phrase pairs (&#65533;faj, ej) are compatible with the word alignment.
    This constraint has two important effects.
    First, we force P(ej |li) = 0 for all phrase pairs not compatible with the word-level alignment for some sentence pair.
    This restriction successfully reduced the total legal phrase pair types from approximately 250 million to 17 million for 100,000 training sentences.
    However, some desirable phrases were eliminated because of errors in the word alignments.
    Second, the time to compute the e-step is reduced.
    While in principle it is still intractable, in practice we can compute most sentence pairs&#8217; contributions in under a second each.
    However, some spurious word alignments can disallow all segmentations for a sentence pair, rendering it unusable for training.
    Several factors including errors in the word-level alignments, sparse word alignments and non-literal translations
