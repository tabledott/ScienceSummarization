s shown in Figure 1, is the product of two terms: the a priori probability of W and the probability that y will appear at the output of the channel when * is placed at the input.
    The a priori probability of W, Pr (W), is the probability that the string W will arise in English.
    We do not attempt a formal definition of English or of the concept of arising in English.
    Rather, we blithely assume that the production of English text can be characterized by a set of conditional probabilities, Pr(wk w), in terms of which the probability of a string of words, w, can be expressed as a product: Here, wki-1 represents the string wi w2 &#8226; &#8226; &#8226; wk_i .
    In the conditional probability Pr(wk I -1 , ) we call wk-1 the history and wk the prediction.
    We refer to a computational mechanism for obtaining these conditional probabilities as a language model.
    Often we must choose which of two different language models is the better one.
