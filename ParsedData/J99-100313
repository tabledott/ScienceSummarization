o work with this model of cooccurrence.2 The information in the translation model was more reliable than characterlevel cognate information, so it produced a higher signal-to-noise ratio in the bitext space.
    Therefore, Dagan, Church, and Gale were able to filter out many of the imperfections of the initial bitext map.
    A limitation of Church's method, and therefore also of Dagan, Church, and Gale's method, is that orthographic cognates exist only among languages with similar alphabets (Church et al. 1993).
    Fung investigated ways to make these methods useful when cognates cannot be found.
    First, working with Church, she introduced the KVec algorithm (Fung and Church 1994), which used a rough model of co-occurrence to bootstrap a small translation lexicon.
    The translation lexicon indicated points of correspondence in the bitext map, much the same way as matching character n-grams.
    These points of correspondence could then be further refined using the methods previously developed by Church
