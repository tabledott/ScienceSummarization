 with the uniform distribution.
			The binary features, such as SFT and BDFT, are assigned the initial value of 0.5.
			For DFT and RFT, the initial probability is 1N!
			, whereN is the number of the children.
			CFT is initial ized as 0.25.
			SubFT is initialized as 1.0 for anysubstitution at the first iteration.
			After each itera tion, the updateProbability function recalculatesthese probabilities based on the cnt for each fea ture.
