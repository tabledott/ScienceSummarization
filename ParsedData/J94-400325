an its true value, because other counts in Equation 1 are too large, thus, preventing p1 from passing the threshold.
    To deal with this problem, we have chosen another criterion for significance&#8212;the odds ratio.
    We choose the alternative T1 only if all the ratios exceed a prespecified threshold.
    Note that Pi/13j = n1/n1, and since n1 &gt; n2 &gt; &#8226; &#8226; &#8226; &gt; nk, the ratio 151 /152 is less than or equal to all the other ratios.
    Therefore, it suffices to check the odds ratio only for /51/152.
    This criterion is less sensitive to noise of the above-mentioned type than Pi, since it depends only on the two largest counts.
    3.1.1 Underlying Assumptions.
    The use of a probabilistic model necessarily introduces several assumptions on the structure of the corresponding linguistic data.
    It is important to point out these assumptions, in order to be aware of possible inconsistencies between the model and the linguistic phenomena for which it is used.
    The first assump
