ting at the next (previous) hanzi until the end (beginning) of the sentence is reached.
    Papers that use this method or minor variants thereof include Liang (1986), Li et al. (1991), Cu and Mao (1994), and Nie, Jin, and Hannan (1994).
    The simplest version of the maximum matching algorithm effectively deals with ambiguity by ignoring it, since the method is guaranteed to produce only one segmentation.
    Methods that allow multiple segmentations must provide criteria for choosing the best segmentation.
    Some approaches depend upon some form of constraint satisfaction based on syntactic or semantic features (e.g., Yeh and Lee [1991], which uses a unification-based approach).
    Others depend upon various lexical heuristics: for example Chen and Liu (1992) attempt to balance the length of words in a three-word window, favoring segmentations that give approximately equal length for each word.
    Methods for expanding the dictionary include, of course, morphological rules, rules for segmenting persona
