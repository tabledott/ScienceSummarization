 all output labels are equal to 0.
    The subsets considered in the algorithm are then exactly those obtained in the powerset determinization of automata, all residual outputs c(q, w) being equal to 0.
    Both space and time complexity of the determinization algorithm for automata are exponential.
    There are minimal deterministic automata with exponential size with respect to an equivalent nondeterministic one.
    A fortiori the complexity of the determinization algorithm in the weighted case we just described is also exponential.
    However, in some cases in which the degree of nondeterminism of the initial transducer is high, the determinization algorithm turns out to be fast and the resulting transducer has fewer states than the initial one.
    We present examples of such cases, which appear in speech recognition, in the last section.
    We also present a minimization algorithm that allows the size of subsequential transducers representing power series to be reduced.
