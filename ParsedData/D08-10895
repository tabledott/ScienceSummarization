ome key linguistic phenomena (presented later in this paper) which have motivated the development of parsing-based approaches.
			We also illustrate this with results that are significantly better than previous approaches, in particular the lexical reordering models of Moses, a widely used phrase-based SMT system (Koehn et al, 2007).This paper is organized as follows: the train ing of lexicalized re-ordering models is described in Section 3.
			In Section 4, we describe how to combine shift-reduce parsing with left-to-right beamsearch phrase-based decoding with the same asymptotic running time as the original phrase-based decoder.
			We finally show in Section 6 that our ap proach yields results that are significantly better thanprevious approaches for two language pairs and dif ferent test sets.
	
	
			We compare our re-ordering model with related work (Tillman, 2004; Koehn et al, 2007) using alog-linear approach common to many state-of-the art statistical machine translation systems (Och and Ney, 2004).
