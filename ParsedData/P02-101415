    Results and discussion.
    Results using the expanded feature set are shown in the All Features block of Table 2.
    These and all subsequent results also incorporate the learning framework changes from Section 3.
    In comparison, we see statistically significant increases in recall, but much larger decreases in precision.
    As a result, F-measure drops precipitously for both learning algorithms and both data sets.
    A closer examination of the results indicates very poor precision on common nouns in comparison to that of pronouns and proper nouns.
    (See the indented All Features results in Table 2.7) In particular, the classifiers acquire a number of lowprecision rules for common noun resolution, presumably because the current feature set is insufficient.
    For instance, a rule induced by RIPPER classifies two NPs as coreferent if the first NP is a proper name, the second NP is a definite NP in the subject position, and the two NPs have the same semantic class and are at most
