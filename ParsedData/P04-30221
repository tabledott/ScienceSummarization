orresponding to entities and relations and built generative models for the augmented trees.
    More recently, (Zelenko et al., 2003) have proposed extracting relations by computing kernel functions between parse trees and (Culotta and Sorensen, 2004) have extended this work to estimate kernel functions between augmented dependency trees.
    We build Maximum Entropy models for extracting relations that combine diverse lexical, syntactic and semantic features.
    Our results indicate that using a variety of information sources can result in improved recall and overall F measure.
    Our approach can easily scale to include more features from a multitude of sources&#8211;e.g.
    WordNet, gazatteers, output of other semantic taggers etc.&#8211;that can be brought to bear on this task.
    In this paper, we present our general approach, describe the features we currently use and show the results of our participation in the ACE evaluation.
    Automatic Content Extraction (ACE, 2004) is an evaluation conducted
