e identified in each sentence.
    The third step is polarity assignment: the polarity of each proposition is examined by considering the polar atoms.
    This section describes the last two processes, which are based on a deep sentiment analysis method analogous to machine translation (Kanayama et al., 2004) (hereafter &#8220;the MT method&#8221;).
    Our basic tactic for clause-level SA is the highprecision detection of polar clauses based on deep syntactic analysis.
    &#8216;Clause-level&#8217; means that only predicative verbs and adjectives such as in (7) are detected, and adnominal (attributive) usages of verbs and adjectives as in (8) are ignored, because utsukushii (&#8216;beautiful&#8217;) in (8) does not convey a positive polarity.
    Here we use the notion of a proposition as a clause without modality, led by a predicative verb or a predicative adjective.
    The propositions detected from a sentence are subject to the assignment of polarities.
    Basically, we detect a proposition only at the
