bs are translated into Chinese, it is difficult to achieve large coverage by listing translation pairs.
    We will show that a set of rigid selection restrictions on verb arguments can at best define a default situation for the verb usage.
    The translations from English verbs to Chinese verb compounds that we present here provide evidence of the reference to the context and to a fine-grained level of semantic representation.
    Therefore, we propose a novel verb semantic representation that defines each verb by a set of concepts in different conceptual domains.
    Based on this conceptual representation, a similarity measure can be defined that allows correct lexical choice to be achieved, even when there is no exact lexical match from the source language to the target language.
    We see this approach as compatible with other interlingua verb representation methods, such as verb representations in KBMT (Nirenburg,1992) and UNITRAN (Dorr, 1990).
    Since these methods do not currently employ a multi-d
