 investigate this we categorized the 880 triples according to the nature of the relationship underlying the attachment.
    In many cases, the decision was difficult.
    The argument/adjunct distinction showed many gray cases between clear participants in an action and clear adjuncts, such as temporal modifiers.
    We made rough best guesses to partition the cases into the following categories: argument, adjunct, idiom, small clause, systematic locative indeterminacy, other systematic indeterminacy, and light verb.
    With this set of categories, 78 of the 880 cases remained so problematic that we assigned them to the category other.
    Table 5 shows the proportion of items in a given category that were assigned the correct attachment by the lexical association procedure.
    Even granting the roughness of the categorization, some clear patterns emerge.
    Our approach is most successful at attaching arguments correctly.
    Notice that the 378 noun arguments constitute 65% of the total 586 noun attachme
