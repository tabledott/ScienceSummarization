    Local coherence has been extensively studied within the modeling framework put forward by Centering Theory (Grosz et al., 1995; Walker et al., 1998; Strube and Hahn, 1999; Poesio et al., 2004; Kibble and Power, 2004).
    One of the main assumptions underlying Centering is that a text segment which foregrounds a single entity is perceived to be more coherent than a segment in which multiple entities are discussed.
    The theory formalizes this intuition by introducing constraints on the distribution of discourse entities in coherent text.
    These constraints are formulated in terms offocus, the most salient entity in a discourse segment, and transition of focus between adjacent sentences.
    The theory also establishes constraints on the linguistic realization of focus, suggesting that it is more likely to appear in prominent syntactic positions (such as subject or object), and to be referred to with anaphoric expressions.
    A great deal of research has attempted to translate principles of
