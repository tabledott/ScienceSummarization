rds are assigned to the most relevant synset.
    In this sense, PageRank is used an alternative to simulated annealing to find the optimal pairwise combinations.
    The method was evaluated on the Senseval-3 dataset, as shown in row Mih05 on Table 2.
    (Sinha and Mihalcea, 2007) extends their previous work by using a collection of semantic similarity measures when assigning a weight to the links across synsets.
    They also compare different graph-based centrality algorithms to rank the vertices of the complete graph.
    They use different similarity metrics for different POS types and a voting scheme among the centrality algorithm ranks.
    Here, the Senseval-3 corpus was used as a development data set, and we can thus see those results as the upper-bound of their method.
    We can see in Table 2 that the methods presented in this paper clearly outperform both Mih05 and Sin07.
    This result suggests that analyzing the LKB structure as a whole is preferable than computing pairwise similarity measure
