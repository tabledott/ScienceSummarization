 our proposed alignments (a) against hand-annotated alignments, which are marked with sure (s) and possible (p) alignments.
    The alignment error rate (AER) is given by, The class of at most 1-to-1 alignment matchings, A1-1, has been considered in several works (Melamed, 2000; Taskar et al., 2005; Moore et al., 2006).
    The alignment that maximizes a set of potentials factored as in Equation (1) can be found in O(n3) time using a bipartite matching algorithm (Kuhn, 1955).1 On the other hand, summing over A1-1 is #P-hard (Valiant, 1979).
    Initially, we consider heuristic alignment potentials given by Dice coefficients where Cef is the joint count of words (e, f) appearing in aligned sentence pairs, and Ce and Cf are monolingual unigram counts.
    We extracted such counts from 1.1 million French-English aligned sentence pairs of Hansards data (see Section 6.1).
    For each sentence pair in the Hansards test set, we predicted the alignment from A1-1 which maximized the sum of Dice potentials.
