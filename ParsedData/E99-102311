    A summary of the results can be found in table 33.
    We achieved higher P3=1 for all representations except for the bracket pair representation.
    The third experiment series was similar to the second but instead of adding output of one experiment we added classification results of three, four or five experiments of the first series.
    By doing this we supplied the learning algorithm with information about different context sizes.
    This information is available to TBL in the rules which use different contexts.
    We have limited ourselves to examining all successive combinations of three, four and five experiments of the lists (L=0/R=0, 1/1, 2/2, 3/3, 4/4), (0/1, 1/2, 2/3, 3/4) and (1/0, 2/1, 3/2, 4/3).
    A summary of the results can be found in table 4.
    The results for four representation formats improved.
    In the fourth experiment series we have experimented with a different value for the number of nearest neighbors examined by the iBl-IG algorithm (parameter k).
