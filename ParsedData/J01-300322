-drops (such as play) have the least marked transitive argument structure of the three.
    Under the assumptions of markedness theory outlined above, we then predict that unergatives are the least frequent in the transitive, that unaccusatives have intermediate frequency in the transitive, and that object-drop verbs are the most frequent in the transitive.
    Causativity Due to the causative alternation of unergatives and unaccusatives, the thematic role of the subject of the intransitive is identical to that of the object of the transitive, as shown in the second and third columns of thematic roles in Table 3.
    Given the identity of thematic role mapped to subject and object positions across the two alternants, we expect to observe the same noun occurring at times as subject of the verb, and at other times as object of the verb.
    In contrast, for object-drop verbs, the thematic role of the subject of the intransitive is identical to that of the subject of the transitive, not the object of the transit
