n oar algorithm for obvious reasons.
  We let pairs of the form (g,C) belong to elements of the array, where g is - - before and C represents the local constraints to be associated with this ?ode.
  We then alter the algorithm as follows.
  If (X,CI) refers to a uode at which we attempt to adjoin with an auxiliary tree (whose root is denoted by (Y,Cs)).
  would determined by C I.
  is allowed, then we can add (X,Cs) in the corresponding element of the array.
  In cases I through 4, we do not attempt o add a new element if any one of the children has an obligatory constraint.
  Once it has bee?
  determined that the given string belongs to the language, we ca?

  a way similar to the scheme adopted i?
  CYK algorithm.To make this process simpler and more efficient, we can use pointers from the new clement added to the elements which caused it to be put there.
  For example, consider Case i of the algorithm (step 10 ).
  If we add a node Z to A(i.i,k,I I, because of the pr~nce  of its childre
