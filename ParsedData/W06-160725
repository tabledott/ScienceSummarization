s-box smoothing; this yields an average gain of 1.6 BLEU points over relative frequencies.
    In the large-corpus setting, the best technique is a loglinear combination of relative-frequency estimates with Zens-Ney smoothing, with a gain of 1.1 BLEU points.
    Of the two glass-box smoothing methods tested, Zens-Ney appears to have a slight advantage over Koehn-Och-Marcu.
    Of the blackbox methods tested, Kneser-Ney is clearly better for small corpora, but is equivalent to GoodTuring for larger corpora.
    The paper describes several smoothing alternatives which we intend to test in future work:
