the translation edit rate (TER) (Snover et al., 2006) was used to align hypotheses in (Sim et al., 2007).
    The alignments from TER are consistent as they do not depend on the test set size.
    Also, a more heuristic alignment method has been proposed in a different system combination approach (Jayaraman and Lavie, 2005).
    A full comparison of different alignment methods would be difficult as many approaches require a significant amount of engineering.
    Confusion networks are generated by choosing one hypothesis as the &#8220;skeleton&#8221;, and other hypotheses are aligned against it.
    The skeleton defines the word order of the combination output.
    Minimum Bayes risk (MBR) was used to choose the skeleton in (Sim et al., 2007).
    The average TER score was computed between each system&#8217;s-best hypothesis and all other hypotheses.
    The MBR hypothesis is the one with the minimum average TER and thus, may be viewed as the closest to all other hypotheses in terms of TER.
