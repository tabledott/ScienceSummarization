ause they are explicitly mentioned).
    The entities in FS5 are considered before those in FS4 as potential referents.
    The wheelpuller has three screws: two small screws fasten the side arms, and a large screw in the center is the main functioning part.
    As a result, this large screw is implicitly in focus in FS5 (Grosz 1977) and thus identified as the referent without the two setscrews ever being considered.
    Attentional state also constrains the search for referents of pronouns.
    Because pronouns contain less explicit information about their referents than definite descriptions, additional mechanisms are needed to account for what may and may not be pronominalized in the discourse.
    One such mechanism is centering (which we previously called immediate focusing; Grosz, Joshi, and Weinstein 1983; Sidner 1979).
    Centering, like focusing, is a dynamic behavior, but is a more local phenomenon.
    In brief, a backward-looking center is associated with each utterance in a discourse segment; of
