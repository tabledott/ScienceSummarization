nd F-measure for a given class C are defined as follows.
    Recall is the percentage of all instances of class C correctly identified.
    |all instances of C | Precision is the percentage of instances classified as class C that are class C in truth.
    Prec(C) = |instances of C correctly identified | |all instances identified as C | F-measure is the harmonic mean of recall and precision.
    In our two-step process for recognizing contextual polarity, the first step is neutral&#8211;polar classification, determining whether each instance of a clue from the lexicon is neutral or polar in context.
    In our test set, there are 26,729 instances of clues from the lexicon.
    The features we use for this step were listed above in Table 7 and described in Section 7.1.
    In this section, we perform two sets of experiments.
    In the first, we compare the results of neutral&#8211;polar classification using all the neutral&#8211;polar features against two baselines.
    The first baseline uses just the word to
