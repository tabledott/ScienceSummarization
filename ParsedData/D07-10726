 process definition (Ferguson, 1973) or the Chinese restaurant process (Pitman, 2002).
			The stick breaking representation captures the DP prior most explicitly and allows us to extend the finite mixture model with minimal changes.
			Later, it will enable us to readily define structured models in a form similar to their classical versions.
			Furthermore, an efficient variational inference algorithm can be developed in this representation (Section 2.6).
			The key difference between the Bayesian finite mixture model and the DP mixture model is that the latter has a countably infinite number of mixture components while the former has a predefined K. Note that if we have an infinite number of mixture components, it no longer makes sense to consider a symmetric prior over the component probabilities; the prior over component probabilities must decay in some way.
			The stick-breaking distribution achieves this as follows.
			We write ? ?
