y value, d(y, 1C(x)) = 0 if y E 1C(x) and 1 otherwise.
    Consider, for example, the constraint C1 in the advertisements domain.
    While the vast majority of the instances satisfy the constraint, some violate it in more than one place.
    Therefore, once the binary distance is set to 1, the algorithm looses the ability to discriminate constraint violations in other locations of the same instance.
    This may hurt the performance in both the inference and the learning stage.
    Computing the Hamming distance exactly can be a computationally hard problem.
    Furthermore, it is unreasonable to implement the exact computation for each constraint.
    Therefore, we implemented a generic approximation for the hamming distance assuming only that we are given a boolean function OC(yN) that returns whether labeling the token xN with state yN violates constraint with respect to an already labeled consider the prefix x1, x2, x3, x4, which contains no punctuation or newlines and was labeled AUTH, AUTH, DATE, DATE.
