ck the head of a constituent from among the heads of its children.
    To the left of M is a sequence of one or more left labels Li(c) including the special termination symbol A, which indicates that there are no more symbols to the left, and similarly for the labels to the right, Ri(c).
    Thus an expansion e(c) looks like: The expansion is generated by guessing first M, then in order L1 through Lm+1 (= A), and similarly for R1 through Rn+1.
    In anticipation of our discussion in Section 4.2, note that when we are expanding an Li we do not know the lexical items to its left, but if we properly dovetail our &#8220;guesses&#8221; we can be sure of what word, if any, appears to its right and before M, and similarly for the word to the left of Rj.
    This makes such words available to be conditioned upon.
    Finally, the parser of [3] deviates in two places from the strict dictates of a language model.
    First, as explicitly noted in [3], the parser does not compute the partition function (normalization c
