venient stand-in for a proper word sense disambiguation algorithm here.
    When word sense is controlled in this way, the accuracy of the paraphrases extracted from the automatic alignments raises dramatically from 48.9% to 57% without language model re-ranking, and further to 61.9% when language model re-ranking was included.
  
  
    Barzilay and McKeown (2001) extract both singleand multiple-word paraphrases from a monolingual parallel corpus.
    They co-train a classifier to identify whether two phrases were paraphrases of each other based on their surrounding context.
    Two disadvantages of this method are that it requires identical bounding substrings, and has bias towards single words.
    For an evaluation set of 500 paraphrases, they report an average precision of 86% at identifying paraphrases out of context, and of 91% when the paraphrases are substituted into the original context of the aligned sentence.
    The results of our systems are not directly comparable, since Barzilay and McKeown (2
