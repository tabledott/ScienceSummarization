ror rates obtained by the different subjectivity detection approaches.
			TwitterSA achieved lower error rate than both Unigrams and ReviewSA.
			As a result, these numbers confirm that features inferred from meta information of words and specific syntax featuresfrom tweets are better indicators of the subjectivity than unigrams.
			Another advantage of our approach is since it uses only 20 features, the training and test times are much faster than using thousands of features like Unigrams.
			One of the reasons why TwitterSA obtained such a good performance was the process of data cleansing (see Sec tion 3).
			The label quality provided by the sources for this task was very poor: 0.66 for Twendz and 0.68 for TwitterSentiment.
			By cleaning the data,the error decreased from 19.9, TwitterSA(nocleaning), to 18.1, TwitterSA(cleaning).
			Regard ing ReviewSA, its lower performance is expected since tweets are composed by single sentences and ReviewSA relies on the proximity between sentences to perform subjecti
