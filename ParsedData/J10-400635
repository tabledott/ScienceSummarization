he binary tuple obtained from the triple (&#955;1, &#955;2, &#955;3) by removing &#955;n.
    For instance, in mode-1 matricization, the entry (1:marine, 1:own, 2:gun) in the tensor in Table 2 is mapped onto the entry (1:marine, 3:(own, gun)).
    Table 3 reports the matrices A, B, and C, respectively, obtained by applying labeled mode-1, mode-2, and mode-3 matricization to the labeled tensor in Table 2.
    The columns of each matrix are labeled with pairs, according to the definition of labeled matricization we just gave.
    From now on, when we refer to mode-n matricization we always assume we are performing labeled mode-n matricization.
    The rows and columns of the three matrices resulting from n-mode matricization of a third-order tensor are vectors in spaces whose dimensions are the corresponding column and row elements.
    Such vectors can be used to perform all standard linear algebra operations applied in vector-based semantics: Measuring the cosine of the angle between vectors, applying singula
