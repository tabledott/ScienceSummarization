 The morphological generator expects to receive as input a sequence of tokens of the form lemma inflection_label. where lemma specifies the lemma of the word form to be generated, inflection specifies the type of inflection (i.e. s, ed, en or ing), and label specifies the PoS of the word form.
    The PoS labels follow the same pattern as in the Lancaster CLAWS tag sets (Garside et al., 1987; Burnard, 1995). with noun tags starting with N. etc.
    The symbols + and _ are delimiters.
    An example of a morphological generator rule is given in (1).
    We do not curreutly cover comparative and superlative forms of adjectives or adverbs since t heir pro Ind ivit,: is much less predictable.

    The braces signify exactly one occurrence of an element of the character set abbreviated by the symbol A; we assume here that A abbreviates the upper and lower case letters of the alphabet.
