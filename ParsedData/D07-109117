umber, by default 50.This is, however, not a perfect solution.
			We are cur rently working on a more efficient search for the top50 translation options to replace the current brute force approach.
	
	
			We carried out a number of experiments using the factored translation model framework, incorporatingboth linguistic information and automatically gener ated word classes.
			This work is implemented as part of the open source Moses1 system (Koehn et al, 2007).
			We used the default settings for this system.
			6.1 Syntactically Enriched Output.
			In the first set of experiments, we translate surfaceforms of words and generate additional output fac tors from them (see Figure 4 for an illustration).
