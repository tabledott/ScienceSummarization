fers from the above in its focus.
    We relate verbs to each other rather than organize them into classes or identify their frames or thematic roles.
    WordNet does provide relations between verbs, but at a coarser level.
    We provide finer-grained relations such as strength, enablement and temporal information.
    Also, in contrast with WordNet, we cover more than the prescriptive cases.
    Previous web mining work has rarely addressed extracting many different semantic relations from Web-sized corpus.
    Most work on extracting semantic information from large corpora has largely focused on the extraction of is-a relations between nouns.
    Hearst (1992) was the first followed by recent larger-scale and more fully automated efforts (Pantel and Ravichandran 2004; Etzioni et al. 2004; Ravichandran and Hovy 2002).
    Recently, Moldovan et al. (2004) present a learning algorithm to detect 35 fine-grained noun phrase relations.
    Turney (2001) studied word relatedness and synonym extraction, while Lin
