d between the prefix hx1, ... , xk&#8722;1i and xk.
    It then adds the link with the strongest positive weight and repeats the process (adding a link can change the set of links which may be added).
    When all possible links are assigned a zero weight by the parser, the parser reads the next word of the utterance and repeats the process.
    This is a greedy algorithm which optimizes every step separately.
  
  
    The weight function which assigns a weight to a candidate link is lexicalized: the weight is calculated based on the lexical entries of the words which are to be connected by the link.
    It is the task of the learning algorithm to learn the lexicon.
    The lexicon stores for each word x a lexical entry.
    Each such lexical entry is a sequence of adjacency points, holding statistics relevant to the decision whether to link x to some other word.
    These statistics are given as weights assigned to labels and linking properties.
    Each adjacency point describes a different link based at x
