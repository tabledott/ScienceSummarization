 or &#8220;however&#8221; (Grosz and Sidner, 1986; Hirschberg and Litman, 1993; Knott, 1996).
    Cue phrases have been shown to be a useful feature for supervised topic segmentation (Passonneau and Litman, 1993; Galley et al., 2003), but cannot be incorporated by current unsupervised models.
    One reason for this is that existing unsupervised methods use arbitrary, hand-crafted metrics for quantifying lexical cohesion, such as weighted cosine similarity (Hearst, 1994; Malioutov and Barzilay, 2006).
    Without supervision, it is not possible to combine such metrics with additional sources of information.
    Moreover, such hand-crafted metrics may not generalize well across multiple datasets, and often include parameters which must be tuned on development sets (Malioutov and Barzilay, 2006; Galley et al., 2003).
    In this paper, we situate lexical cohesion in a Bayesian framework, allowing other sources of information to be incorporated without the need for labeled data.
    We formalize lexical cohesion
