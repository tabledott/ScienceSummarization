s annotated with information about negation and speculation.
    The annotation indicates the boundaries of the scope and the keywords, as shown in (1) above.
    In the annotation, scopes are extended to the biggest syntactic unit possible, so that scopes have the maximal length, and the negation signal is always included in the scope.
    The annotation guidelines and the inter-annotator agreement information can be found on the web page.
    The BioScope corpus consists of three parts: clinical free-texts (radiology reports), biological full papers and biological paper abstracts from the GENIA corpus (Collier et al., 1999).
    Table 1 shows statistics about the corpora.
    Negation signals are represented by one or more tokens.
    Only one negation signal (exclude) that occurs in the papers subcorpus does not occur in the abstracts subcorpus, and six negation signals (absence of, exclude, favor, favor over, may, rule out that appear in the clinical subcorpus do not appear in the abstracts subcorpus.
