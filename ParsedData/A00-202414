 comparison.
    21t is actually also possible that the reduction program decides no phrase in a sentence should be removed, thus the result of reduction is the same as the input.
    To build the combination module, we first manually analyzed a corpus of combination examples produced by human professionals, automatically created by the decomposition program, and identified a list of combination operations.
    Table 1 shows the combination operations.
    To implement a combination operation, we need to do two things: decide when to use which combination operation, and implement the combining actions.
    To decide when to use which operation, we analyzed examples by humans and manually wrote a set of rules.
    Two simple rules are shown in Figure 4.
    Sample outputs using these two simple rules are shown in Figure 5.
    We are currently exploring using machine learning techniques to learn the combination rules from our corpus.
    The implementation of the combining actions involves joining two parse tr
