d on the comparison of full f-structures, represented as triples relation(predicate, argument).
    The predicateargument relations of the f-structure for one parse of the sentence Meridian will pay a premium of $30.5 million to assume $2 billion in deposits. are shown in Fig.

    The DR annotation for our example sentence, obtained via a mapping from f-structures to Carroll et al&#8217;s annotation scheme, is shown in Fig.

    Superficially, the LFG and DR representations are very similar.
    One difference between the annotation schemes is that the LFG representation in general specifies more relation tuples than the DR representation.
    Also, multiple occurences of the same lexical item are indicated explicitly in the LFG representation but not in the DR representation.
    The main conceptual difference between the two annotation schemes is the fact that the DR scheme crucially refers to phrase-structure properties and word order as well as to grammatical relations in the definition of de
