le probability is calculated by marginalizing over cluster values: As with the other methods of generalization described in this section, automatic clustering was applied only to noun phrases, which represent 50% of the constituents in the test data.
    We would not expect head word to be as valuable for other phrase types.
    The second most common category is prepositional phrases.
    The head of a prepositional phrase (PP) is considered to be the preposition, according to the rules we use, and because the set of prepositions is small, coverage is not as great a problem.
    Furthermore, the preposition is often a direct indicator of the semantic role.
    (A more complete model might distinguish between cases in which the preposition serves as a case or role marker and others in which it is semantically informative, with clustering performed on the preposition&#8217;s object in the former case.
    We did not attempt to make this distinction.)
    Phrase types other than NP and PP make up only a small p
