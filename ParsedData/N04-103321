3.2.
    The results are summarized in Table 5.
    We see that the uniform smoothing method improves translation quality.
    There is only a minor improvement, but it is consistent among all evaluation criteria.
    It is statistically significant at the 94% level.
    The unigram method hurts performance.
    There is a degradation of the mWER of 0.9%.
    In the following, all phrase-based systems use the uniform smoothing method.
    The translation results of the different systems are shown in Table 6.
    Obviously, the monotone phrase-based system outperforms the monotone single-word based system.
    The result of the phrase-based system is comparable to the nonmonotone single-word based search with the IBM constraints.
    With respect to the mPER, the PB system clearly outperforms all single-word based systems.
    If we compare the monotone phrase-based system with the nonmonotone alignment template system, we see that the mPERs are similar.
    Thus the lexical choice of words is of the same qual
