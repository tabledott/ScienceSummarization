put passed to MENE as a final step.
    MENE also opens up new avenues for collaboration whereby different organizations could focus on different aspects of the problem of N.E. recognition with the maximum entropy system acting as an arbitrator.
    MENE also offers the prospect of achieving very high performance with very little effort.
    Since MENE starts out with a fairly high base score just on its own, we speculate that a MENE user could then construct a hand-coded system which only focused on MENE's weaknesses, while skipping the areas in which MENE is already strong.
    Finally, one can imagine a user acquiring licenses to several different N.E. systems, generating some training data, and then combining it all under a MENE-like system.
    We have shown that this approach can yield performance which is competitive with that of a human tagger.
  
  
    We would like to thank Troy Straszheim for writing the Viterbi search routine used in this work.
