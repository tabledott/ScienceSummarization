    Under appropriate conditions, we could reconstruct P(a, b) from these quantities using Gibbs sampling, and, in general, that is the best we can do.
    However, while reconstructing the joint probabilities from these local conditional probabilities may be difficult, estimating the local probabilities themselves is no harder than it is for acyclic models: we take observations of the local environments and use any maximum likelihood estimation method we desire.
    In our experiments, we used local maxent models, but if the event space allowed, (smoothed) relative counts would do.
    Cyclic or not, we can view the product of local probabilities from a dependency network as a score: where Pa(xi) are the nodes with arcs to the node xi.
    In the case of an acyclic model, this score will be the joint probability of the event x, P(x).
    In the general case, it will not be.
    However, we can still ask for the event, in this case the tag sequence, with the highest score.
