 for the subject (in both transitive and intransitive forms), and Theme for the optional object; see the last row of Table 3.
    For further details and support of this analysis, please see the discussion in Stevenson and Merlo (1997b) and Merlo and Stevenson (2000b).
    For our purposes here, the important fact to note is that each of the three classes can be uniquely identified by the pattern of thematic assignments across the two alternants of the verbs.
    2.2 Features for Automatic Classification Our next task then is to derive, from these thematic patterns, useful features for automatically classifying the verbs.
    In what follows, we refer to the columns of Table 3 to explain how we expect the thematic distinctions to give rise to distributional properties, which, when appropriately approximated through corpus counts, will discriminate across the three classes.
    Transitivity Consider the first two columns of thematic roles in Table 3, which illustrate the role assignment in the transitive const
