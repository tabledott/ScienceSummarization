    When the decoder chooses to extend a hypothesis by selecting word w from original system A, the decoder marks w as used.
    The decoder then proceeds to identify and mark as used a word in each of the other original systems.
    If w is aligned to words in any of the other original translation systems, then the words that are aligned with w are also marked as used.
    For each system that does not have a word that aligns with w, the decoder establishes an artificial alignment between w and a word in this system.
    The intuition here is that this artificial alignment corresponds to a different translation of the same source-language word that corresponds to w. The choice of an artificial alignment cannot violate constraints that are imposed by alignments that were found by the matcher.
    If no artificial alignment can be established, then no word from this system will be marked as used.
    The decoder repeats this process for each of the original translations.
    Since the order in which the
