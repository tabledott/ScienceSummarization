f length i + 1 (i &gt; 2), each of the Si translations of length i can combine with Q - i single words that are sufficiently correlated with the source language collocation, generating Q - i possible translations of length i +1, since Champollion does not consider translations that include repeated words.
    However, there are up to i + 1 different ways that the same set of i +1 words can be generated in this manner; for example, (ABC) can be generated by adding C to (AB), adding B to (AC), or adding A to (BC).
    When the set of translations of length i has been filtered, it is possible that not all of the i + 1 ways to generate a given translation of length i + 1 are available.
    In general, we have and with a similar derivation, for the upper bound (i &gt; 3), .Pi &lt; Hi) 2(Q 01 The sums of the bounds on the values Pi for i = 3 to m, plus the value P1 + P2 = Q + (?
    ), give upper and lower bounds on the total number of candidate translations generated and examined by Champollion.
