 create the emotion lexicon from this master set containing 9892 assignments from about 1000 Turkers who attempted 1 to 450 assignments each.
    About 100 of them provided 20 or more assignments each (more than 7000 assignments in all).
    The master set has, on average, about 4.75 assignments for each of the 2081 target terms.
