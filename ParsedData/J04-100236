 made to search for mappings between randomly selected pairs of domains.
    Table 20 lists a set of arbitrarily selected domain pairs and the strength of the polarization between them.
    In all cases, the polarization is zero.
    This can be interpreted as an encouraging lack of false positives.
    Another perspective is that CorMet should have found mappings between some of these pairs, such as MEDICINE and SOCIETY, on the theory that societies can be said to sicken, die, or heal.
    Although this is certainly a valid conventional metaphor, it seems to be less prominent than those metaphors that CorMet did discover.
  
  
    Two of the most broadly effective computational models of metaphor are Fass (1991) and Martin (1990), in both of which metaphors are detected through selectionalpreference violations and interpreted using an ontology.
    They are distinguished from CorMet in that they work on both novel and conventional metaphors and rely on declarative hand-coded knowledge bases.
