ood, and that this vagueness may not be resolved until a hearer's attention is called to the unresolved decision.
    While we can give only the briefest sketch here (the full story is quite long and complicated), exactly this use of names resolves yet another problem for the deterministic analysis of coordinate structures: To examine enough context (in the buffer) to decide what kind of structure is conjoined with what, a tree-building parser will often have to go out on a limb and posit the existence of nodes which may turn out not to exist after all.
    For example, if a tree-building parser has analyzed the inputs shown in (13.1-2) up to &amp;quot;worms&amp;quot; and has seen &amp;quot;and&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;frogs&amp;quot; in the buffer, it will need to posit that &amp;quot;frogs&amp;quot; is a full NP to check to see if the pattern [conjunction] INN [verb] is fulfilled, and thus if an S should be created with the NP as its head.
    But if the input is not as in (13.1), but as in (13.2), then posi
