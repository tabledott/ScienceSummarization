c structure and a simple dynamic model of attentional state.
    Like the parser, the algorithm is implemented in Prolog.
    The authors have tested it extensively on computer manual texts and conducted a blind test on manual text containing 360 pronoun occurrences.
    The algorithm successfully identifies the antecedent of the pronoun for 86% of these pronoun occurrences.
    The relative contributions of the algorithm's components to its overall success rate in this blind test are examined.
    Experiments were conducted with an enhancement of the algorithm that contributes statistically modelled information concerning semantic and real-world relations to the algorithm's decision procedure.
    Interestingly, this enhancement only marginally improves the algorithm's performance (by 2%).
    The algorithm is compared with other approaches to anaphora resolution that have been proposed in the literature.
    In particular, the search procedure of Hobbs' algorithm was implemented in the Slot Grammar framewor
