NN of implementation year ended 3 1 March 1 9 9 1 *1 &#8212;AA &#8212;A-11--F&#8212;E1 Under the ITG model, word alignment becomes simply the special case of phrasal alignment at the parse tree leaves.
    This gives us an interesting alternative perspective, from the standpoint of algorithms that match the words between parallel sentences.
    By themselves, word alignments are of little use, but they provide potential anchor points for other applications, or for subsequent learning stages to acquire more interesting structures.
    Word alignment is difficult because correct matchings are not usually linearly ordered, i.e., there are crossings.
    Without some additional constraints, any word position in the source sentence can be matched to any position in the target sentence, an assumption that leads to high error rates.
    More sophisticated word alignment algorithms therefore attempt to model the intuition that proximate constituents in close relationships in one language remain proximate in the other
