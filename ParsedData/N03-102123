 it infers an item that covers the multitext space spanned by the input multitext.
    The items composed by naive synchronous parsers are called hyperedges, or hedges for short.
    The 2D hedges composed by Parser R2D2A are shown in Figure 2.
    The particular hedge in the figure represents a constituent between word boundaries i1 ji of the first compoAs we shall see in Section 5, however, bad binarization can worsen recognition complexity.
    The Binarization Rules apply deterministically,' but there are multiple ways to decompose the RHS of a nonbinary DEPEND production into nested joins.11 Some decompositions may give rise to more discontinuities than others.
    Let the cardinality of an RTV be the total number of partitions in all its components, and let the cardinality of a decomposition be the maximum cardinality of the RTVs that it contains.
    A minimizing decomposition for a given production is one of those with lowest cardinality.
    Then, the cardinality of a production is the cardinality of
