f change in the aspectual type of a proposition under the influence of modifiers like tenses, temporal adverbials, and aspectual auxiliaries is of central importance to the present account.
    We shall talk of such modifiers as functions which &amp;quot;coerce&amp;quot; their inputs to the appropriate type, by a loose analogy with type-coercion in programming languages (cf.
    Ait-Kaci 1984).
    Thus the effect on meaning of the combination of the progressive with an expression denoting an atomic punctual event as in Sandra was hiccupping occurs in two stages: first the point proposition is coerced into a process of iteration of that point.
    Only then can this process be defined as ongoing, and hence as a progressive state.
    These two stages might be represented as in the following diagram: Computational Linguistics, Volume 14, Number 2, June 1988 17 13.
    (point (Sandra hiccup)) (process (iteration (point (Sandra hiccup)))) (progressive (process (iteration (point (Sandra hiccup))))) The temporal/a
