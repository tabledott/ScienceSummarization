anslation systems, is the th system weight, is the accumulated confidence for word produced by system between nodes and , and is a weight for the number of NULL links along the hypothesis .
    The word confidences were increased by if the word aligns between nodes and in the network.
    If no word aligns between nodes and , the NULL word confidence at that position was increased by .
    The last term controls the number of NULL words generated in the output and may be viewed as an insertion penalty.
    Each arc in the confusion network carries the word label and scores .
    The decoder outputs the hypothesis with the highest given the current set of weights.
    There are several problems with the previous confusion network decoding approaches.
    First, the decoding can generate ungrammatical hypotheses due to alignment errors and phrases broken by the where is the language model weight, is the LM log-probability and is the number of words in the hypothesis .
    The word posteriors are estimated by sc
