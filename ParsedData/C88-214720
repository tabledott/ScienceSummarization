zed lements and do not need any further devices.
  Note, that any stack based mechanism that might be needed for subeategorization s provided by the TAG formalism itself, in which the tree sets generated by TAGs have context free paths (unlike CFGs which have regular paths).
  This additional power provided by the TAG formalism has been used to an advantage in giving an account of West Germanic verb-raising [Santorini 1986].
  3 A Ca lcu lus  to Represent  FTAG Gram- mars We will now consider a calculus to represent FTAGs by extending on the llogieal formulation oftbature structures given by Rounds and Kasper [Rou Kasper et al.
  Feature structures in this logic (henceforth called lt- !K logic) are represented asformulae.
  The set of well-formed formulae in this logic is recursively defined as follows.
  e::= NIL TOP a I :e l el A e2 e~.
  V e2 {pl ..... P.} where a is an atomic value, el,e2 are well-formed formulae.
  NIL and (TOP cl)nvey "no in(ormation" and "inconsistent information" respec- !~ively.
