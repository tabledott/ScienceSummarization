e initial phrase pair , growth rate has been effectively contained), the hierarchical phrase pair (X1 X2, X1 has been X2) can be formed.13 Each hierarchical phrase pair can also have certain features associated with it that are estimated via maximum likelihood estimation during the extraction process.
    Such phrase pairs can formally be considered the rules of a bilingual synchronous context-free grammar (SCFG).
    Translation with SCFGs is equivalent to parsing the string in the source language using these rules to generate the highest-scoring tree and then reading off the tree in target order.
    For the purposes of this survey, it is sufficient to state that efficient methods to extract such rules, to estimate their features, and to translate with them are now well established.
    For more details on building SCFG-based models and translating with them, we refer the reader to (Chiang 2006, 2007).
    Once a set of bilingual hierarchical rules has been extracted along with associated features, the pivo
