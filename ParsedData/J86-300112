    Discourse structure is a composite of three interacting constituents: a linguistic structure, an intentional structure, and an attentional state.
    These three constituents of discourse structure deal with different aspects of the utterances in a discourse.
    Utterances &#8212; the actual saying or writing of particular sequences of phrases and clauses &#8212; are the linguistic structure's basic elements.
    Intentions of a particular sort and a small number of relationships between them provide the basic elements of the intentional structure.
    Attentional state contains information about the objects, properties, relations, and discourse intentions that are most salient at any given point.
    It is an abstraction of the focus of attention of the discourse participants; it serves to summarize information from previous utterances crucial for processing subsequent ones, thus obviating the need for keeping a complete history of the discourse.
