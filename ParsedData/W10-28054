successfully applied to document-based applications such as the computation of document similarity in information retrieval.
    Mitchell &amp; Lapata (2008) indicate that the various variations of the pointwise-multiplication model perform better than simple additive models in term similarity tasks (variations included combination with simple addition and adding weights to individual vector components).
    Widdows (2008) Obtain results indicating that both the tensor product and the convolution product perform better than the simple additive model.
    For the sake of simplifying the implementation of evaluation methods, in this paper we will compare the first two approaches, vector addition and vector pointwise-multiplication, with regression modelling by partial least squares.
  
  
    We assume that the composition of meaning in DSMs is a function mapping two or more independent vectors in a multidimensional space to a newly composed vector the same space and, further, we assume that semantic compositio
