mentation of the sentence fusion algorithm that we are well aware of.13 Therefore, in our grammaticality evaluation (following the DUC procedure), the judge was asked to ignore punctuation.
    To evaluate our sentence fusion algorithm, we selected 100 themes following the procedure described in the previous section.
    Each set varied from three to seven sentences, with 4.22 sentences on average.
    The generated fusion sentences consisted of 1.91 clauses on average.
    None of the sentences in the test set were fully extracted; on average, each sentence fused fragments from 2.14 theme sentences.
    Out of 100 sentence, 57 sentences produced by the algorithm combined phrases from several sentences, while the rest of the sentences comprised subsequences of one of the theme sentences.
    (Note that compression is different from sentence extraction.)
    We included these sentences in the evaluation, because they reflect both content selection and realization capacities of the algorithm.
