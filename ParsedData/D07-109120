 or additionally verbial (person, tense, and aspect) and prepositional (lemma and case) morphology (27.62% BLEU).
			All these models score well above the baseline of 25.82% BLEU.
			An extended description of these experiments is in the JHU workshop report (Koehn et al, 2006).
			6.2 Morphological Analysis and Generation.
			The next model is the one described in our motivat ing example in Section 4 (see also Figure 2).
			Instead of translating surface forms of words, we translateword lemma and morphology separately, and gener ate the surface form of the word on the output side.
			We carried out experiments for the language pair German?English, using the 52,185 sentence NewsCommentary corpus2.
			We report results on the de velopment test set, which is also the out-of-domain test set of the WMT06 workshop shared task (Koehn and Monz, 2006).
			German morphological analysis and POS tagging was done using LoPar Schmidt and Schulte im Walde (2000), English POS tagging was done with Brill?s tagger (Brill, 1995
