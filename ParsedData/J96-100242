  If house appears within the next three words (e.g., the phrases in the house and in the red house), then dans might be a more likely translation.
    On the other hand, if year appears within the same window of words (as in in the year 1941 or in that fateful year), then au cours de might be more likely.
    Together, the five constraint templates allow the model to condition its assignment of probabilities on a window of six words around eo, the word in question.
    We constructed a maximum entropy model p,n(y1x) by the iterative model-growing method described in Section 4.
    The automatic feature selection algorithm first selected a template 1 constraint for each of the translations of in seen in the sample (12 in Maximum entropy model to predict French translation of in.
    Features shown here were the first features selected not from template 1.
    [verb marker] denotes a morphological marker inserted to indicate the presence of a verb as the next word. all), thus constraining the model's expected
