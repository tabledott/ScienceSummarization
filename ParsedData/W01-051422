e metric.
    The results also showed vocabulary difference between paragraphs is a good feature for training a similarity metric.
    Further investigation into the relationship between ranking, LSA dimensionality and error rate revealed that LSA values become less accurate as more dimensions are incorporated into the feature vectors.
    This implies the training data is noisy.
    However, with ranking, error rate decreases.
    This shows the order of LSA values becomes more accurate when more features are used.
    Future work will focus on document specific LSA and the termination strategy of the new algorithm.
    Test results have shown the termination procedure in C99 works well on LSA similarity values but not on the ranked values.
    We suspect the threshold selection method has to be modified.
    In terms of clustering, dynamic programming approaches (Ponte and Croft, 1997; Utiyama and Isahara, 2001, for example) will be examined.
    Finally, a LSA procedure for computing document specific simi
