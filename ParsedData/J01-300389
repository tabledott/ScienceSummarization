 76% reduction in error rate.
    On 31 verbs that can take the same subcategorization(s) in different classes&#8212;more similar to our situation in that subcategorization alone cannot distinguish the classes&#8212;they achieve 83.9% accuracy compared to a 61.3% baseline, for a 58% reduction in error.
    Aone and McKee (1996), working with a much coarsergrained classification of verbs, present a technique for predicate-argument extraction from multi-lingual texts.
    Like ours, their work goes beyond statistics over subcategorizations to include counts over the more directly semantic feature of animacy.
    No numerical evaluation of their results is provided.
    Schulte im Walde (2000) applies two clustering methods to two types of frequency data for 153 verbs from 30 Levin (1993) classes.
    One set of experiments uses verb subcategorization frequencies, and the other uses subcategorization frequencies plus selectional preferences (a numerical measure based on an adaptation of the relative entropy meth
