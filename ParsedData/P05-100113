d) predict features that have good correlation to the target classes, such as words on text tagging/chunking tasks.
    The second strategy is motivated by co-training.
    We use two (or more) distinct feature maps:-P1 and 'P2.
    First, we train a classifier F1 for the target task, using the feature map -P1 and the labeled data.
    The auxiliary tasks are to predict the behavior of this classifier F1 (such as predicted labels) on the unlabeled data, by using the other feature map P2.
    Note that unlike co-training, we only use the classifier as a means of creating auxiliary problems that meet the relevancy requirement, instead of using it to bootstrap labels.
    Ex 3.2 Predict the top-k choices of the classifier.
    Predict the combination of k (a few) classes to which F1 assigns the highest output (confidence) values.
    For instance, predict whether F1 assigns the highest confidence values to CLASS1 and CLASS2 in this order.
    By setting k = 1, the auxiliary task is simply to predict the label pr
