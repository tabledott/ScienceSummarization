largest confusions between (1) CHECK and QUERY-YN, (2) INSTRUCT and CLARIFY, and (3) ACKNOWLEDGE, READY, and REPLY-Y.
    Combining categories, agreement was also very good (K = .89) for whether a move was an initiation type or a response or ready type.
    For agreed initiations themselves, agreement was very high (K = .95, N = 243, k = 4) on whether the initiation was a command (the INSTRUCT move), a statement (the EXPLAIN move), or one of the question types (QUERY-YN, QUERY-W, CHECK, or ALIGN).
    Coders were also able to agree on the subclass of question (K .82, N = 98, k = 4).
    Coders could also reliably classify agreed responses as ACKNOWLEDGE, CLARIFY, or one of the reply categories (K = .86, N = 236, k = 4).
    However, coders had a little more difficulty (K = .75, N = 132, k = 4) distinguishing between different types of moves that all contribute new, unelicited information (INSTRUCT, EXPLAIN, and CLARIFY). sponsored by the University of Pennsylvania, three non-HCRC computational linguists and o
