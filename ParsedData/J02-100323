RPlural subsumes D&amp;R.
    As before, we assume a nonempty set of distractors; that is, S C D but S =&#65533; D.6 Return Failure {All properties in P have been tested, yet C =&#65533; S} Note that S takes the place of the target object r in the earlier algorithms; the process of expanding L and contracting C continues until C = S. Because this is basically the same algorithm as D&amp;R, it has the same computational complexity of O(na), where na is the cardinality of P. D&amp;RPlural characterizes a set by scrutinizing its elements.
    This does not work for properties like BEING OF THE SAME AGE, which crucially pertain to sets of objects (cf.
    Stone 2000).
    The algorithm can, however, be generalized to cover such cases if we initialize C not to D but to the powerset of D, after which the algorithm selects properties of sets, removing from P(D) all those sets for which the property is false.
    For example, selection of BEING OF THE SAME AGE removes all those sets whose elements are not of the same
