member ship in the crisp sets 3 of positive, negative andneutral words.
			Both approaches have their limi tations: the first approach produces coarse results and requires large amounts of data to be reliable,while the second approach is prohibitively expen sive in terms of annotator time and runs the risk ofintroducing a substantial subjective bias in anno tations.
			In this paper we seek to develop an approachfor semantic annotation of a fuzzy lexical cate gory and apply it to sentiment annotation of allWordNet words.
			The sections that follow (1) describe the proposed approach used to extract sen timent information from WordNet entries usingSTEP (Semantic Tag Extraction Program) algo rithm, (2) discuss the overall performance of STEP on WordNet glosses, (3) outline the method fordefining centrality of a word to the sentiment cate gory, and (4) compare the results of both automatic (STEP) and manual (HM) sentiment annotations to the manually-annotated GI-H4 list, which was used as a gold standard in this
