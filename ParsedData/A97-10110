  A Non-Projective Dependency Parser
  
    We describe a practical parser for unrestricted dependencies.
    The parser creates links between words and names the links according to their syntactic functions.
    We first describe the older Constraint Grammar parser where many of the ideas come from.
    Then we proceed to describe the central ideas of our new parser.
    Finally, the parser is evaluated.
  
  
    We are concerned with surface-syntactic parsing of running text.
    Our main goal is to describe syntactic analyses of sentences using dependency links that show the head-modifier relations between words.
    In addition, these links have labels that refer to the syntactic function of the modifying word.
    A simplified example is in Figure 1, where the link between I and see denotes that I is the modifier of see and its syntactic function is that of subject.
    Similarly, a modifies bird, and it is a determiner.
    First, in this paper, we explain some central concepts of the Constraint Gramm
