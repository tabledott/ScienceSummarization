ses, the assignment of syntactic correlates to frame elements could be mediated by mapping them to the roles of one of the more abstract frames.
    6A detailed study of motion predicates would require a finer-grained analysis of the Path element, separating out Source and Goal, and perhaps Direction and Area, but for a basic study of the transportation predicates such refined analysis is not necessary.
    In any case, our subframes associated with individual words inherit all of these while possibly adding some of their own.
    Fig.
    1 shows some of the subframes, as discussed below.
    The DRIVING frame, for example, specifies a DRIVER (a principal MOVER), a VEHICLE (a particularization of the MEANS element), and potentially CARGO or RIDER as secondary movers.
    In this frame, the DRIVER initiates and controls the movement of the VEHICLE.
    For most verbs in this frame, DRIVER or VEHICLE can be realized as subjects; VEHICLE, RIDER, or CARGO can appear as direct objects; and PATH and VEHICLE can ap
