 are used to encode the relationships among various lexical entries that would typically be thought of as transformations or relation-changing rules (depending on one's ideological outlook).
    Because lexical rules perform these operations, the lexicon need include only a prototype entry for each verb.
    The variant forms can be derived through lexical rules applied in accordance with the morphology actually found on the verb.
    (The morphological analysis in the implementations of PATR-II is performed by a program based on the system of Koskenniemi 1831 and was written by Lauri Karttunen 18314 For instance, given a PATR-II grammar in which the DAGs are used to emulate the f-structures of LFG, we might write a passive lexical rule as follows (following Bresnan [83]):6 &lt;out cat&gt; = &lt;in cat&gt; &lt;out form&gt; = pasaprt &lt;out subj&gt; = &lt;in obj&gt; &lt;out obj&gt; = &lt;in subj&gt; The rule states in effect that the output DAG (the one associated with the passive verb form) marks the lexical
