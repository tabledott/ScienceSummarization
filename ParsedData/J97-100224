Stability can be tested by having a single coder code the same data at different times.
    Reproducibility can be tested by training several coders and comparing their results.
    Accuracy can be tested by comparing the codings produced by these same coders to the standard, if such a standard exists.
    Where the standard is the coding of the scheme's &amp;quot;expert&amp;quot; developer, the test simply shows how well the coding instructions fit the developer's intention.
    Whichever type of reliability is being assessed, most coding schemes involve placing units into one of n mutually exclusive categories.
    This is clearly true for the dialogue structure coding schemes described here, once the dialogues have been segmented into appropriately sized units.
    Less obviously, segmentation also often fits this description.
    If there is a natural set of possible segment boundaries that can be treated as units, one can recast segmentation as classifying possible segment boundaries as either actual seg
