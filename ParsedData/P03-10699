 therefore smooth the observed frequencies using back-off smoothing (Katz, 1987).
    To illustrate with an example consider the text in Figure 1 which has three sentences S1, S2, S3, each represented by their respective features denoted by letters.
    The probability P(S3|S2) will be calculated by taking the product of P(h|e), P(h |f), P(h|g), P(i|e), P(i |f), and P(i|g).
    To obtain P(h|e), we need f(h,e) and f(e) which can be estimated in Figure 1 by counting the number of edges connecting e and h and the number of edges starting from e, respectively.
    So, P(h|e) will be 0.16 given that f(h,e) is one and f(e) is six (see the normalization in (5)).
    Once we have collected the counts for our features we can determine the order for a new text that we haven&#8217;t encountered before, since some of the features representing its sentences will be familiar.
    Given a text with N sentences there are N! possible orders.
    The set of orders can be represented as a complete graph, where the set of verti
