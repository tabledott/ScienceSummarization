our hybrid model.
    Based on extensive comparisons, we showed that our approach is superior to the existing approaches reported in the literature.
    In future work, we plan to apply our framework to other Asian languages, including Thai and Japanese.
  
  
    We would like to thank Tetsuji Nakagawa for his helpful suggestions about the word-character hybrid model, Chen Wenliang for his technical assistance with the Chinese processing, and the anonymous reviewers for their insightful comments.
