 indicators.
    Twelve tokens that are succeeded but not preceded by orthographic markings are discourse and 21 are sentential.
    All of the tokens in RJB86 that are both preceded and succeeded by orthography are discourse usages, although, again, these 25 tokens represent only 8.1% of the discourse tokens in the sample.
    So, the presence of preceding orthographic indicators&#8212;especially in conjunction with succeeding indicators&#8212;appears to be a reliable textual indicator that a potential cue phrase should be interpreted as a discourse use, predicting correctly in 176 (82.6%) cases.
    While we found that discourse uses are not always reliably marked by such indicators in the RJB86 transcription, it is possible to predict the discourse/sentential distinction from orthography alone for this corpus in 675 (80.1%) cases.
    In our study of now, described in Section 4.3, we found that in 51 (85%) cases, cue phrases that were first in intonational phrase were marked orthographically.
    In the cu
