tion over unar ies versus binaries), ?E = 1 (uniform distribution over terminal words), ?u(s) = ?b(s) = 1N(s) , whereN(s) is the number of different unary (binary) righthand sides of rules with left-hand side s in the treebank grammar.
			The two most important hyperpa rameters are ?U and ?B , which govern the sparsity of the right-hand side for unary and binary rules.
			We set ?U = ?B although more performance could probably be gained by tuning these individually.
			It turns out that there is not a single ?B that works for all truncation levels, as shown in Table 1.
			If the top-level distribution ? is uniform, the value of ?B corresponding to a uniform prior over pairs ofchildren subsymbols is K2.
