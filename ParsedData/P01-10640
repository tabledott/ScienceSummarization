  A Statistical Model For Domain-Independent Text Segmentation
  
    We propose a statistical method that finds the maximum-probability segmentation of a given text.
    This method does not require training data because it estimates probabilities from the given text.
    Therefore, it can be applied to any text in any domain.
    An experiment showed that the method is more accurate than or at least as accurate as a state-of-the-art text segmentation system.
  
  
    Documents usually include various topics.
    Identifying and isolating topics by dividing documents, which is called text segmentation, is important for many natural language processing tasks, including information retrieval (Hearst and Plaunt, 1993; Salton et al., 1996) and summarization (Kan et al., 1998; Nakao, 2000).
    In information retrieval, users are often interested in particular topics (parts) of retrieved documents, instead of the documents themselves.
    To meet such needs, documents should be segmented into coherent topics.
