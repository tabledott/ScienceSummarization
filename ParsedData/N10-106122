at differ in their treatment of spurious mentions.
    For Pairwise F1, precision measures how often pairs of predicted coreferent mentions are in the same annotated entity.
    We eliminated any mention pair from this calculation where both mentions were spurious.9
  
  
    Table 1 shows our results.
    We compared to two state-of-the-art supervised coreference systems.
    The Stoyanov et al. (2009) numbers represent their THRESHOLD ESTIMATION setting and the Rahman and Ng (2009) numbers represent their highestperforming cluster ranking model.
    We also compared to the strong deterministic system of Haghighi and Klein (2009).10 Across all data sets, our model, despite being largely unsupervised, consistently outperforms these systems, which are the best previously reported results on end-to-end coreference resolution (i.e. including mention detection).
    Performance on the A05RA dataset is generally lower because it includes articles from blogs and web forums where parser quality is significantly degr
