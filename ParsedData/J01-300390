od of Resnik [1996]).
    The best results achieved are a correct classification of 58 verbs out of 153, with a precision of 61% and recall of 36%, obtained using only subcategorization frequencies.
    We calculate that this corresponds to an F-score of 45% with balanced precision and recall.'
    The use of selectional preference information decreases classification performance under either clustering algorithm.
    The results are somewhat difficult to evaluate further, as there is no description of the classes included.
    Also, the method of counting correctness entails that some &amp;quot;correct&amp;quot; classes may be split across distant clusters (this level of detail is not reported), so it is unclear how coherent the class behaviour actually is.
    McCarthy (2000) proposes a method to identify diathesis alternations.
    After learning subcategorization frames, based on a parsed corpus, selectional preferences are acquired for slots of the subcategorization frames, using probability distribution
