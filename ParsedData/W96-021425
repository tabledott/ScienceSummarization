our algorithm has true runtime 0(Tn3), as shown previously.
    In the DOP model, a sentence cannot be given an exactly correct parse unless all productions in the correct parse occur in the training set.
    Thus, we can get an upper bound on performance by examining the test corpus and finding which parse trees could not be generated using only productions in the training corpus.
    Unfortunately, while Bod provided us with his data, he did not specify which sentences were test and which were training.
    We can however find an upper bound on average case performance, as well as an upper bound on the probability that any particular level of performance could be achieved.
    Bod randomly split his corpus into test and training.
    According to his thesis (Bod, 1995a, page 64), only one of his 75 test sentences had a correct parse which could not be generated from the training data.
    This turns out to be very surprising.
    An analysis of Bod's data shows that at least some of the difference in perfor
