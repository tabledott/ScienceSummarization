ndidates with increasing sentence size.
    The number increases from O(Tn) for the baseline POS tagger to O(2n&#8722;'Tn) for the joint system.
    As a result, for an incremental decoding algorithm, the number of possible candidates increases exponentially with the current word or character index.
    In the POS tagging problem, a new incoming word enlarges the number of possible candidates by a factor of T (the size of the tag set).
    For the joint problem, however, the enlarging factor becomes 2T with each incoming character.
    The speed of search space expansion is much faster, but the number of candidates is still controlled by a single, fixed-size beam at any stage.
    If we assume that the beam is not large enough for all the candidates at at each stage, then, from the newly generated candidates, the baseline POS tagger can keep 1/T for the next processing stage, while the joint model can keep only 1/2T, and has to discard the rest.
    Therefore, even when the candidate comparison standard is ig
