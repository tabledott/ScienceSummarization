entirely different problem area.
    She developed a knowledge representation scheme for use in planners in which events are reified and modeled with an explicit representation of their temporal as well as causal relations.
    In this scheme, a mechanism is provided for structuring events into so-called &amp;quot;locations of activity&amp;quot;, the boundaries of which are boundaries of &amp;quot;causal&amp;quot; access.
    As a result, two events with no causal relation between them cannot belong to the same location of activity&#8212;as in the episodes introduced above.
    Because we follow Lansky in making the contingency relation intransitive, we avoid certain notorious problems in the treatment of when-clauses and perfects, which arise because the search for possible consequences of an event has to be restricted to the first event on the chain of contingencies.
    Thus, when (3) is asserted, repeated here as (63a) and (b), it would be wrong to infer (c): 63. a.
