of course suggestive rather than definitive; it seems likely that there are limitations on how much (if any) backtracking humans will perform during syntactic processing (see also the arguments in [McDonald, 1983]), but there is no hard proof of this (as far as I am aware).
    These modules will not be further examined here, mainly because little information is given in the papers on the details of how morphology and formatting are implemented.
  
  
    I would like to conclude with a perhaps controversial personal opinion.
    There have been many cases where NL generation researchers (including myself) have claimed that a certain linguistic phenomena is best handled by a certain architecture.
    Even if this is true, however, if it turns out that adopting this architecture will substantially complicate the design of the overall generation system, and that the most common cases of the phenomena of interest can be adequately handled by adding a few heuristics to the appropriate stage of a simpler architect
