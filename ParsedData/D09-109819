es in each of the 1500 random copies.
    For sets that contained fewer than 200 items, we only generated trials for seed sizes smaller than the set size.
    The resulting trial dataset consists of 20,220 trials3.
    Set expansion systems consist of an expansion algorithm (such as the one described in Section 4.1) as well as a corpus (such as Wikipedia, a news corpus, or a web crawl).
    For a given system, each of the 20,220 trials described in the previous section are expanded.
    In our work, we limited the total number of system expansions, per trial, to 1000.
    Before judgment of an expanded set, we first collapse each instance that is a variant of another (determined using the variants in our gold standard) into one single instance (keeping the highest system score)4.
    Then, each expanded instance is judged as correct or incorrect automatically against the gold standard described in Section 5.1.
    Our experiments in Section 6 consist of precision vs. recall or precision vs. rank curves, where
