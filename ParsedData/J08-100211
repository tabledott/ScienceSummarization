ortional to the size of Y(x).
    The cost of the parameter estimation algorithms is bound by the computation of model expectation, &#181;i, given as (Malouf 2002): As shown in this definition, the computation of model expectation requires the summation over Y(x) for every x in the training data.
    The complexity of the overall estimation algorithm is O( &#732;|Y |&#732;|F||E|), where &#732;|Y |and &#732;|F |are the average numbers of y and activated features for an event, respectively, and |E |is the number of events.
    When Y(x) grows exponentially, the parameter estimation becomes intractable.
    In PCFGs, the problem of computing probabilities of parse trees is avoided by using a dynamic programming algorithm for computing inside/outside probabilities (Baker 1979).
    With the algorithm, the computation becomes tractable.
    We can expect that the same approach would be effective for maximum entropy models as well.
    This notion yields a novel algorithm for parameter estimation for maximum entrop
