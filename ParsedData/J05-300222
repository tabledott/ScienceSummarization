ed the paraphrasing dictionary from a large comparable news corpus using the co-training method described in Barzilay and McKeown (2001).
    The dictionary contains pairs of word-level paraphrases as well as phrase-level paraphrases.4 Several examples of automatically extracted paraphrases are given in Table 2.
    During alignment, each pair of nonidentical words that do not comprise a synset in WordNet is looked up in the paraphrasing dictionary; in the case of a match, the pair is considered to be a paraphrase.
    We now give an intuitive explanation of how our tree similarity function, denoted by Sim, is computed.
    If the optimal alignment of two trees is known, then the value of the similarity function is the sum of the similarity scores of aligned nodes and aligned edges.
    Since the best alignment of given trees is not known a priori, we select the maximal score among plausible alignments of the trees.
    Instead of exhaustively traversing the space of all possible alignments, we recursively co
