cusatives, and 5 object-drop), the intermediate-frequency group had 25 verbs (5 unergatives, 9 unaccusatives, and 11 object-drops), and the high-frequency group had 10 verbs (1 unergative, 5 unaccusatives, and 4 object-drops).
    We found that verbs with high and low frequency yield better accuracy and agreement among the experts than the verbs with mid frequency.
    Neither the accuracy of the majority classification, nor the accuracy of the expert that had the best agreement with Levin, were linearly affected by frequency.
    For the majority vote, verbs with frequency less than 100 yield an accuracy of 92%, K = .84; verbs with frequency between 100 and 1000, accuracy 80%, K = .69; and for verbs with frequency over 1000, accuracy 90%, K-= .82.
    For the &amp;quot;best&amp;quot; expert, the pattern is similar: verbs with frequency less than 100 yield an accuracy of 87.5%, K ---= .74; verbs with frequency between 100 and 1000, accuracy 84%, K = .76; and verbs with frequency over 1000, accuracy 90%, K =-
