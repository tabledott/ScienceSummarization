  Automatic Retrieval and Clustering of Similar Words
  
    Bootstrapping semantics from text is one of the greatest challenges in natural language learning.
    We first define a word similarity measure based on the distributional pattern of words.
    The similarity measure allows us to construct a thesaurus using a parsed corpus.
    We then present a new evaluation methodology for the automatically constructed thesaurus.
    The evaluation results show that the thesaurus is significantly closer to WordNet than Roget Thesaurus is.
  
  
    The meaning of an unknown word can often be inferred from its context.
    Consider the following (slightly modified) example in (Nida, 1975, p.167): Everyone likes tezgiiino.
    Tezgiiino makes you drunk.
    We make tezgiiino out of corn.
    The contexts in which the word tezgiiino is used suggest that tezgiiino may be a kind of alcoholic beverage made from corn mash.
