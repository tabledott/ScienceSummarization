aching remaining unattached tokens through exhaustive search (not for submitted runs) sequence classifier can label all children of a token together (McDonald et al., 2006).
    Within the third approach, HEAD and DEPREL can be predicted simultaneously, or in two separate steps (potentially using two different learners).
    At the highest level of abstraction, there are two fundamental approaches, which we will call &#8220;all pairs&#8221; and &#8220;stepwise&#8221;.
    In an &#8220;all pairs&#8221; approach, every possible pair of two tokens in a sentence is considered and some score is assigned to the possibility of this pair having a (directed) dependency relation.
    Using that information as building blocks, the parser then searches for the best parse for the sentence.
    This approach is one of those described in Eisner (1996).
    The definition of &#8220;best&#8221; parse depends on the precise model used.
    That model can be one that defines the score of a complete dependency tree as the sum of
