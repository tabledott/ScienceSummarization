esion to the determination of the discourse structure that was proposed by Grosz and Sidner (1986).
    Grosz and Sidner propose a structure common to all discourse, which could be used along with a structurally dependent focus of attention to delineate and constrain referring expressions.
    In this theory there are three interacting components: linguistic structure, intentional structure, and attentional state.
    Linguistic structure is the segmentation of discourse into groups of sentences, each fulfilling a distinct role in the discourse.
    Boundaries of segments can be fuzzy, but some factors aiding in their determination are clue words, changes in intonation (not helpful in written text), and changes in aspect and tense.
    When found, these segments indicate changes in the topics or ideas being discussed, and hence will have an effect on potential referents.
    The second major component of the theory is the intentional structure.
    It is based on the idea that people have definite purposes fo
