easons we have limited ourselves to working with section 15 of the WSJ corpus.
    This section contains 50442 words.
    We have run 5-fold crossvalidation experiments with all combinations of left and right contexts of word/POS tag pairs in the size range 0 to 4.
    A summary of the results can be found in table 2.
    The baseNP recognizer performed best with relatively small word/POS tag pair contexts.
    Different representation formats required different context sizes for optimal performance.
    All formats context sizes for the seven representation formats using 5-fold cross-validation on section 15 of the WSJ corpus. with explicit open bracket information preferred larger left context and most formats with explicit closing bracket information preferred larger right context size.
    The three combinations of partial representations systematically outperformed the four complete representations.
    This is probably caused by the fact that they are able to use two different context sizes for solving
