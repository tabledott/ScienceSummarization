atches made by collation are recorded in the semantic vector shown in Figure 11.

    In Figure 11, the preference violation has been recorded as the 1 in the first array and the relevant analogy is the 1 in the second array.
    Information about the distance between conceptual domains is recorded in the third array.

    Cell matches are recorded in the second and third arrays, which each contain seven columns.
    Those columns record the presence of ancestor, same, sist
