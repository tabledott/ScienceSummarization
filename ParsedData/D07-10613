 of a particle that roams this graph by stochastically following local semantic relational links.
			The particle is biased toward exploring the neighborhood around a target word, and is allowed to roam until the proportion of time it visits each node in the limit converges to a stationarydistribution.
			In this way we can compute distinct, word specific probability distributions over how often a particle visits all other nodes in the graph when ?starting?
			from a specific word.
			We compute the relatedness of two words as the similarity of their stationary distributions.The random walk brings with it two distinct advan tages.
			First, it enables the similarity measure to have a principled means of combination of multiple types of edges from WordNet.
			Second, by traversing all links, thewalk aggregates local similarity statistics across the en tire graph.
			The similarity scores produced by our method are, to our knowledge, the WordNet-based scores most highly correlated with human judgments.
