egular relation if it is allowed to rewrite material that was introduced on a previous application.
    Under those circumstances it would map the regular language {ab} into the context-free language {ab n 1 1 &lt; n}.
    But we would get exactly the same result from an unrestricted cyclic grammar whose ordered sequence consists only of this single rule.
    In effect, cyclic reapplication of the rule also permits it to operate arbitrarily, often on its own output.
    In the worst case, in fact, we know that the computations of an arbitrary Turing machine can be simulated by a rewriting grammar with unrestricted rule reapplication.
    These results seem to create a dilemma for our regularity analysis.
    Many phonological formalisms based on ordered sets of rewriting rules provide for cyclic rule applications.
    The underlying notion is that words have a bracketed structure reflecting their morphological composition.
    For example, unenforceable has the structure [un[[en[forcellable]].
