on with respect to output clusters, through their mutual information I(Clusters; SCFs).
    The relevance information is maximized, while the compression information I(Clusters; Verbs) is minimized.
    This ensures optimal compression of data through clusters.
    The tradeoff between the two constraints is realized nearest neighbour of verbi (36%). through minimizing the cost term: where Q is a parameter that balances the constraints.
    The IB iterative algorithm finds a local minimum of the above cost term.
    It takes three inputs: (i) SCFverb distributions, (ii) the desired number of clusters K, and (iii) the value of Q.
    Starting from a random configuration, the algorithm repeatedly calculates, for each cluster K, verb V and SCF S, the following probabilities: (i) the marginal proportion of the cluster p(K); (ii) the probability p(S|K) for a SCF to occur with members of the cluster; and (iii) the probability p(K|V ) for a verb to be assigned to the cluster.
    These probabilities are used, each i
