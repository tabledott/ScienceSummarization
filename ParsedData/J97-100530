s (80%) fall within the bars for N = 0 (47.8%), N = 1 (23.0%), and N = 2 (10.0%), forming a rapidly descending curve.
    For N = 3 and above, the slope of the curve suddenly becomes linear, and much less steep, corresponding to a much more gradual decrease in frequency as values of N go to 7.
    That there should be any cases where six or seven subjects identify the same boundary is highly improbable, but on average, this happens 4.5 times per narrative.
    Summing the heights of the bars for N = 3 through N = 7 indicates that for an average narrative whose length is 100 phrases, there will be about 20 boundaries identified by three or more subjects.
    3.2.1 Evaluation Metrics.
    Again, our first goal in evaluating the segmentation data from our subjects is to explore the possibility that subjects given as little guidance as possible might yet recognize rather similar segments in the narrative corpus.
    To make this evaluation, we first use a significance test of the null hypothesis that the distribu
