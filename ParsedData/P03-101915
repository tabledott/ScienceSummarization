12; [AA]  |(AA)  |f/e  |f/2  |2/e Here, [AA] denotes a monotone concatenation and (AA) denotes an inverted concatenation.
    Let us now consider the case of a source phrase consisting of two parts f1 and f2.
    Let e denote the corresponding target phrase.
    We add the productions A &#8212; [e/f1 A 2/f2]  |(e/f1 A 2/f2) to the grammar.
    The probabilities of these productions are, dependent on the translation direction, p(e|f1, f2) or p(f1, f2|e), respectively.
    Obviously, these productions are not in the normal form of an ITG, but with the method described in (Wu, 1997), they can be normalized.
  
  
    In the following sections we will present results on two tasks.
    Therefore, in this section we will show the corpus statistics for each of these tasks.
    The first task we will present results on is the Verbmobil task (Wahlster, 2000).
    The domain of this corpus is appointment scheduling, travel planning, and hotel reservation.
    It consists of transcriptions of spontaneous speech.
