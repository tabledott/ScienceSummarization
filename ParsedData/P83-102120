ch derived clauses are no longer needed and space can be reclaimed.
    There is a marked contrast with purely top-down proof procedures, such as Prolog, to which highly effective spare recovery techniques can be applied relatively easily.
    The Earley algorithm pursues all possible parses in parallel, indexed by string position.
    In principle, this permits space to be recovered, as parsing progresses, by deleting information relating to earlier string positions.
    It may be possible to generalize this technique to Earley Deduction, by recognizing, either automatically or manually, certain special properties of the input clauses.
  
  
    It is not at. all obvious that grammar formalisms based on unification can be parsed within reasonable bounds of time and space.
    In fact, unrestricted DCGs have Turing machine power, and LFG, although decidable, seems capable of encoding exponentially hard problems.
    However, we need not give up our interest in the complexity analysis of unification-based pars
