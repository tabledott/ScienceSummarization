riants yield the highest scores (Connolly, Burger, and Day 1994).
    Though still not fully worked out, it is interesting to note that in both studies ML-derived heuristics tend to outperform those that were carefully developed by human experts (similar results are reported by Cardie [1992] with respect to learning resolution heuristics for relative pronouns pertaining to a case-based learning procedure).
    This indicates, at least, that heuristically based methods using simple combinations of features benefit from being exposed to and having to adapt to training data.
    ML-based mechanisms might constitute an interesting perspective for the further tuning of ordering criteria for the forward-looking centers.
    These mixed heuristic approaches, using multidimensional metrics for ranking antecedent candidates, diverge from the assumption that underlies the centering model that a single type of criterion&#8212;the attentional state and its representation in terms of the backward- and forward-looking cent
