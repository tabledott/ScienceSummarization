larly, the propositions Ow s H (RESULT SCAN-1 ?ACT-2)) (DMB S H (08.1 ?ACT-2 oPP-1)) are interpreted as the goal to find some element that could legitimately take the place of ?ACT-2.
    In order to enable the relations to nest recursively, some relations' nucleuses and satellites contain requirements that specify additional relations, such as examples, contrasts, etc.
    Of course, these additional requirements may only be included if such material can coherently follow the content of the nucleus or satellite.
    The question of ordering such additional constituents is still under investigation.
    The question of whether such additional material should be included at all is not addressed; the structurer tries to say everything it is given.
    The structurer produces all coherent paragraphs (that is, coherent as defined by the relations) that satisfy the given goal(s) for any set of input elements.
    For example, paragraph (b) is produced to satisfy the initial goal (BY13 S H (SEQUENCE ASK-1 ?NEM).
