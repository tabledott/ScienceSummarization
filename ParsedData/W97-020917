    Performance of the method explored here is limited at present, though not surprisingly so when taken in the context of previous attempts at unsupervised disambiguation using finegrained senses.
    One main message to take away from this experiment is the observation that, although selectional preferences are widely viewed as an important factor in disambiguation, their practical broad-coverage application appears limited &#8212; at least when disambiguating nouns &#8212; because many verbs and modifiers simply do not select strongly enough to make a significant difference.
    They may provide some evidence, but most likely only as a complement to other sources of information such as frequency-based priors, topical context, and the like.
  
  
    Much of this work was conducted at Sun Microsystems Laboratories in Chelmsford, Massachusetts.
