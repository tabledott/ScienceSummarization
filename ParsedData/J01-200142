t rather pointers to stems and suffixes.
    We do this, in one sense, because our goal is to construct the smallest morphology, and in general a pointer requires less information than an explicit set of letters.
    But in a deeper sense, it is the signatures whose compactness provides the explicit measurement of the conciseness of the entire analysis.
    Note that by construction, each stem is associated with exactly one signature.
    Since stem, suffix, and signature all begin with s, we opt for using t to represent a stem, f to represent a suffix, and a to represent a signature, while the uppercase T, F, E represent the sets of stems, suffixes, and signatures, respectively.
    The number of members of such a set will be represented (T) , (F), etc., while the number of occurrences of a stem, suffix, etc., will be represented as [t], [f], etc.
    The set of all words in the corpus will be represented as W; hence the length of the corpus is [W], and the size of the vocabulary is (W).
