English corpus for which we have art existing set of associated gold-standard sense tags.
    The entire corpus, including the subset, is translated using commercial MT technology, producing an artificial parallel corpus.
    This corpus is then used as described in Section 2, and the quality of sense tagging on the English gold-standard subset is assessed using community-wide evaluation standards, with results suitable for inter-system comparison with other algorithms that have been tested ort the same data.
    The pseudo-translation approach has advantages and disadvantages.
    On the one hand, using commercial MT systems does not necessarily result in performance figures representing what could be obtained with better quality human translations.
    On the other hand, a pseudotranslated corpus is far easier to produce, and this approach to evaluation allows for controlled experimentation using English paired with multiple languages.
    We used the the English &amp;quot;all words&amp;quot; portion of the
