    This section describes the methodology for testing our claim that inferential selectional preferences can be learned to filter incorrect inferences.
    Given a collection of inference rules of the form pi =&gt; pj, our task is to determine whether a particular instance (x, pj, y) holds given that (x, pi, y) holds4.
    In the next sections, we describe our collection of inference rules, the semantic classes used for forming selectional preferences, and evaluation criteria for measuring the filtering quality.
    Our models for learning inferential selectional preferences can be applied to any collection of inference rules between binary semantic relations.
    In this paper, we focus on the inference rules contained in the DIRT resource (Lin and Pantel 2001).
    DIRT consists of over 12 million rules which were extracted from a 1GB newspaper corpus (San Jose Mercury, Wall Street Journal and AP Newswire from the TREC-9 collection).
    For example, here are DIRT&#8217;s top 3 infer
