th the problem of the automatic acquisition of subcategorization frames is a series of papers by Brent (Brent and Berwick 1991, Brent 1991, Brent 1992).
    Brent and Berwick (1991) took the approach of trying to generate very high precision data.2 The input was hand-tagged text from the Penn Treebank, and they used a very simple finite state parser which ignored nearly all the input, but tried to learn from the sentences which seemed least likely to contain false triggers &#8212; mainly sentences with pronouns and proper names.3 This was a consistent strategy which produced promising initial results.
    However, using hand-tagged text is clearly not a solution to the knowledge acquisition problem (as hand-tagging text is more laborious than collecting subcategorization frames), and so, in more recent papers, Brent has attempted learning subcategorizations from untagged text.
    Brent (1991) used a procedure for identifying verbs that was still very accurate, but which resulted in extremely low yields (it g
