versely proportional to the number of occurrences of that particular edge in the scene graph.
    The algorithm then adds the most discriminating edge (i.e., the one removing most distractors) first.
    If there are various equally distinguishing edges, the cheapest one is added.
    This process is then repeated until a distinguishing graph is found.
    In fact, such a greedy strategy could be used to produce a first nonminimal distinguishing graph.
    Subsequently we could call findGraph with this graph as initial value of bestGraph, instead of the null graph &#8869;.
    In this way, we would be able to find minimal graphs more efficiently.
    The characteristic properties of Dale and Reiter&#8217;s (1995) incremental algorithm can be incorporated into the graph framework as follows.
    First, the list of preferred attributes can be modeled in terms of the cost function: All type edges should be cheaper than all other edges.
    In fact, (basic level, see below) type edges could be free.
    Moreover,
