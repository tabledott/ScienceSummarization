on is important enough that the rate of accumulation of translated examples sufficiently exceeds the rate of mutation of the languages involved, there must eventually arise such a corpus.
    The linguistic content of our program thus far is scant indeed.
    It is limited to one set of rules for analyzing a string of characters into a string of words, and another set of rules for analyzing a string of words into a string of sentences.
    Doubtless even these can be recast in terms of some information theoretic objective function.
    But it is not our intention to ignore linguistics, neither to replace it.
    Rather, we hope to enfold it in the embrace of a secure probabilistic framework so that the two together may draw strength from one another and guide us to better natural language processing systems in general and to better machine translation systems in particular.
