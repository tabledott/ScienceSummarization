    Various local classifiers are trained without the knowledge of constraints.
    The predictions are taken as input on the inference procedure which then finds the best global prediction.
    In addition to the conceptual simplicity of this approach, it also seems to perform better experimentally (Tjong Kim Sang and De Meulder, 2003).
    Typically, efficient inference procedures in both frameworks rely on dynamic programming (e.g., Viterbi), which works well in sequential data.
    However, in many important problems, the structure is more general, resulting in computationally intractable inference.
    Problems of these sorts have been studied in computer vision, where inference is generally performed over low level measurements rather than over higher level predictors (Levin et al., 2002; Boykov et al., 2001).
    This work develops a novel inference with classifiers approach.
    Rather than being restricted on sequential data, we study a fairly general setting.
    The problem is defined in terms o
