mbow 1993; Hoffman 1996, 1998).
    Using these proposals as a point of departure, we shall develop our own proposal&#8212;functional centering (Strube and Hahn 1996).
    As far as the centering model is concerned, the first account involving information structure criteria was given by Kameyama (1986) and further refined by Walker, Iida, and Cote (1994) in their study on the use of zero pronouns and topic markers in Japanese.
    This led them to augment the grammatical ranking conditions for the forward-looking centers by additional functional notions.
    A deeper consideration of information structure principles and their relation to the centering model has been proposed in two studies concerned with the analysis of German and Turkish discourse.
    Rambow (1993) was the first to apply the centering methodology to German, aiming at the description of information structure aspects underlying scrambling and topicalization.
    As a side effect, he used centering to define the utterance's theme and rheme in
