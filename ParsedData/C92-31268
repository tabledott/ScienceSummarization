  Fillmores ideas still show the influence of the tradition of formal grammars: the constructions are schemata, and the combinatorics of putting the constructions together looks very much like a context free gramnmr.
  But the way in which Filhnore generalizes the notion of grmnmar resolves the problems we found in the current statistical grammars: if a constrnction-granunar is combined with statistical notions it is perhaps possible to represent all statistical information.
  This is one of the central ideas behind our approach.
  A New Approach: Data Oriented Parsing The starting-point of our approach is the idea indicated above, that when a human language user analyzes sentences, there is a strong preference for the recognition of sentences, constituents and patterns that occurred before in the experience of the language user.
  There is a statistical component in language proce
