 the need for trigrams.
    As for the search problem, we briefly return to this point at the end of the paper.
    Here we simply note that while search requires that a language model provide probabilities in a left to right fashion, one can easily imagine procedures where these probabilities are revised after new information is found (i.e., the head of the constituent).
    Note that already our search procedure needs to revise previous most-likely-word hypotheses when the original guess makes the subsequent words very unlikely.
    Revising the associated language-model probabilities complicates the search procedure, but not unimaginably so.
    Thus it seems to us that it is worth finding out whether the superior parsing performance of immediate-head parsers translates into improved language models.
  
  
    We have taken the immediate-head parser described in [3] as our starting point.
    This parsing model assigns a probability to a parse 7 by a topdown process of considering each constituent c in 7 a
