 concentrated on four subsymbols, which is the true number of symbols in the grammar.
			troduce a right-branching cascade of new nodes with symbol X . The end result is that each node has at most two children.
			To cope with unknown words, we replace any word appearing fewer than 5 timesin the training set with one of 50 unknown word to kens derived from 10 word-form features.
			Our goal is to learn a refined grammar, where eachsymbol in the training set is split into K subsym bols.
			We compare an ordinary PCFG estimated with maximum likelihood (Matsuzaki et al, 2005) andthe HDP-PCFG estimated using the variational in ference algorithm described in Section 2.6.To parse new sentences with a grammar, we com pute the posterior distribution over rules at each spanand extract the tree with the maximum expected cor rect number of rules (Petrov and Klein, 2007).
			3.2.1 HyperparametersThere are six hyperparameters in the HDP-PCFG GR model, which we set in the following manner:?
