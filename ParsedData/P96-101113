te tree.
    The standard CCG theory builds the semantics compositionally, guided by the syntax, according to (11).
    We may therefore regard a syntax tree as a static &amp;quot;recipe&amp;quot; for combining word meanings into a phrase meaning.
    One might choose to say that two parses are semantically equivalent if they derive the same phrase meaning.
    However, such a definition would make spurious ambiguity sensitive to the fine-grained semantics of the lexicon.
    Are the two analyses of VP/VP VP VP \VP semantically equivalent?
    If the lexemes involved are &amp;quot;softly knock twice,&amp;quot; then yes, as softly(twice(knock)) and twice(softly(knock)) arguably denote a common function in the semantic model.
    Yet for &amp;quot;intentionally knock twice&amp;quot; this is not the case: these adverbs do not commute, and the semantics are distinct.
    It would be difficult to make such subtle distinctions rapidly.
    Let us instead use a narrower, &amp;quot;intensional&amp;quot; definition of
