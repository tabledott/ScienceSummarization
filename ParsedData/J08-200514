anged when used for studying the impor- tance of syntactic parsing in SRL, although different information and features are used.
  Throughout this article, when full parsing information is available, we assume that the system is presented with the full phrase-structure parse tree as defined in the Penn Treebank (Marcus, Marcinkiewicz, and Santorini 1993) but without trace and functional tags.
  On the other hand, when only shallow parsing information is available, the full parse tree is reduced to only the chunks and the clause constituents.
  A chunk is a phrase containing syntactically related words.
  Roughly speaking, chunks are obtained by projecting the full parse tree onto a flat tree; hence, they are closely related to the base phrases.
  Chunks were not directly defined as part of the standard annotation of the treebank, but, rather, their definition was introduced in the CoNLL-2000 shared task on text chunking (Tjong Kim Sang and Buchholz 2000), which aimed to discover such phrases in order to facil
