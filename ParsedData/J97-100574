or precision (.44 versus .62).
    This confirms that the tuned algorithm is over calibrated to the training set.
    Using summed deviations as a summary metric, EA's improvement is about 1/3 of the distance between NP and human performance.
    The standard deviations in Tables 6 and 7 are often close to 1/4 or 1/3 of the reported averages.
    This indicates a large amount of variability in the data, reflecting wide differences across narratives (speakers) in the training set with respect to the distinctions recognized by the algorithm.
    Although the high standard deviations show that the tuned algorithm is not well fitted to each narrative, it is likely that it is over specialized to the training sample in the sense that test narratives are likely to exhibit further variation.
    4.3.2 Machine Learning.
    While error analysis is a useful method for refining an existing feature representation, it does not facilitate experimentation with large sets of multiple features simultaneously.
