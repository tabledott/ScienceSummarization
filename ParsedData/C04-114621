t this has on a potential application of distributional similarity methods.
	
	
			In its most general sense, a collocation is a habitual or lexicalised word combination.
			How ever, some collocations such as strong tea arecompositional, i.e., their meaning can be determined from their constituents, whereas oth ers such as hot dog are not.
			Both types areimportant in language generation since a sys tem must choose between alternatives but onlynon-compositional ones are of interest in language understanding since only these colloca tions need to be listed in the dictionary.
			Baldwin et al (2003) explore empiricalmodels of compositionality for noun-noun com pounds and verb-particle constructions.
			Based on the observation (Haspelmath, 2002) that compositional collocations tend to be hyponyms of their head constituent, they propose a model which considers the semantic similarity between a collocation and its constituent words.McCarthy et al (2003) also investigate sev eral tests for compositionality inclu
