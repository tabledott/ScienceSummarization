  Extracting Paraphrases From A Parallel Corpus
  
    While paraphrasing is critical both for interpretation and generation of natural language, current systems use manual or semi-automatic methods to collect paraphrases.
    We present an unsupervised learning algorithm for identification of paraphrases from a corpus of multiple English translations of the same source text.
    Our approach yields phrasal and single word lexical paraphrases as well as syntactic paraphrases.
  
  
    Paraphrases are alternative ways to convey the same information.
    A method for the automatic acquisition of paraphrases has both practical and linguistic interest.
    From a practical point of view, diversity in expression presents a major challenge for many NLP applications.
    In multidocument summarization, identification of paraphrasing is required to find repetitive information in the input documents.
    In generation, paraphrasing is employed to create more varied and fluent text.
    Most current applications use
