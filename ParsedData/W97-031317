9) might not even be known to most users, but they are abundant in the MUC-4 corpus.
    If we consider all the words rated as 3's, 4's, or 5's, then we were able to find about 50-65 words for every category except Energy.
    Many of these words would be useful in a semantic dictionary for the category.
    For example, some of the words rated as 3's for the Vehicle category include: flight, flights, aviation, pilot, airport, and highways.

    Finally, the graphs show that mo
