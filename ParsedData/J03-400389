 important difference&#8212;the ability of models 1, 2, and 3 to generalize to produce context-free rules not seen in training data&#8212;was described in section 7.4.)
    Section 8.2 showed that the parsing models of Ratnaparkhi (1997), Jelinek et al. (1994), and Magerman (1995) can suffer from very similar problems to the &#8220;label bias&#8221; or &#8220;observation bias&#8221; problem observed in tagging models, as described in Lafferty, McCallum, and Pereira (2001) and Klein and Manning (2002).
  
  
    My Ph.D. thesis is the basis of the work in this article; I would like to thank Mitch Marcus for being an excellent Ph.D. thesis adviser, and for contributing in many ways to this research.
    I would like to thank the members of my thesis committee&#8212;Aravind Joshi, Mark Liberman, Fernando Pereira, and Mark Steedman&#8212;for the remarkable breadth and depth of their feedback.
    The work benefited greatly from discussions with Jason Eisner, Dan Melamed, Adwait Ratnaparkhi, and Paola Merlo.
