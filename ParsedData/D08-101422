    We re-ran the second experiment, this time trained on the 3,700 sentences that were classified by the OpinionFinder high-precision classifier as either subjective or objective.
    For Romanian, we obtained an F-measure of 69.05%, while for Spanish we obtained an F-measure of 66.47%.
    Second, we tried to isolate the role played by language-specific clues of subjectivity.
    To this end, we decided to set up an experiment which, by comparison, can suggest the degree to which the languages are able to accommodate specific markers for subjectivity.
    First, we trained an English classifier using the SemCor training data automatically annotated for subjectivity with the OpinionFinder highcoverage tool.
    The classifier was then applied to the English version of the manually labeled test data set (the gold standard described in Section 4).
    Next, we ran a similar experiment on Romanian, using a classifier trained on the Romanian version of the same SemCor training data set, annotated with
