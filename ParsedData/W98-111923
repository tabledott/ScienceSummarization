oth pronoun methods for gender determination.
    To that end, we devised a more objective test, useful only for scoring the subset of referents that are names of people.
    In particular, we assume that any noun-phrase with the honorifics &amp;quot;Mrs.&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Ms.&amp;quot; may be confidently assigned to gender classes HE, SHE, and SHE, respectively.
    Thus we compute precision as follows: precision = r attrib. as HE A Mr. E r I + r attrib. as SHE A Mrs. or Ms. E r I Mr., Mrs., or Ms. E r Here r varies over referent types, not tokens.
    The precision score computed over all phrases containing any of the target honorifics are 66.0% for the last-noun method and 70.3% for the Hobbs method.
    There are several things to note about these results.
    First, as one might expect given the already noted superior performance of the Hobbs scheme over last-noun, Hobbs also performs better at determining gender.
    Secondly, at first glance,the 70.3% accuracy of the Hobbs method is disappointing,
