 LCS with unfilled variable positions).
  Example 2 The RLCS associated with the word go (from Example 1) is [Event GOLoc ([Thing X], [Path TOLoc ([Position ATLoc ([Thing X], [Location Z])])])] 4 The validity of the primitives and their compositional properties i not discussed here.
  The LCS has been studied as the basis of a representation for multiple languages (see, for example, Hale and Keyser 1986a, 1986b, 1989; Hale and Laughren 1983; Levin and Rappaport 1986; Zubizarreta 1982, 1987) and is discussed in the context of machine translation by Dorr (1992b).

  which corresponds to the tree-like representation shown in Figure 4.
  Definition 3 A CLCS (i.e., a composed LCS) is an instantiated LCS that is the result of combining two or more RLCSs by means of unification (roughly).
  This is the interlingua, or language- independent, form that serves as the pivot b
