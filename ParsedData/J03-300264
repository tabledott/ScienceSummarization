f interest are orthogonal in some sense (e.g., Blum and Mitchell 1998; Abney 2002).
    With respect to the generation of candidate pairs, we have described a progression from index-based searches on AltaVista to exhaustive matching of URLs on the Internet Archive.
    The combination of these approaches may be profitable, particularly for languages that are represented only very sparsely on the Web.
    For such languages, index-based searches on words from a language of interest might be used to identify sites potentially containing parallel text.
    Within such sites, it would likely be profitable to look for parallel documents in the full cross product of documents in the two languages of interest, obtained both on the Internet Archive and via crawling all pages on relevant sites.
    Finally, we plan to utilize parallel texts mined from the Web in our work on machine translation and acquisition of bilingual lexicons, and in the creation of resources for new languages via projection of annotations from E
