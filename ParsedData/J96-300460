 often inflated.
    A totally nonstochastic rule-based system such as Wang, Li, and Chang's will generally succeed in such cases, but of course runs the risk of overgeneration wherever the single-hanzi word is really intended.
    Evaluation of Morphological Analysis.
    In Table 5 we present results from small test corpora for the productive affixes handled by the current version of the system; as with names, the segmentation of morphologically derived words is generally either right or wrong.
    The first four affixes are so-called resultative affixes: they denote some property of the resultant state of a verb, as in 1TT wang4-bu4-liao3 (forget-not-attain) 'cannot forget.'
    The last affix in the list is the nominal plural ill men0.'
    In the table are the (typical) classes of words to which the affix attaches, the number found in the test corpus by the method, the number correct (with a precision measure), and the number missed (with a recall measure).
