as machine-readable dictionaries or WordNet (which uses the OALD's senses), because they are widely available.
    The dominant model in these studies is the &amp;quot;bank&amp;quot; model, which attempts to extend the clear delineation between bank-money and bank-riverside to all sense distinctions.
    However, it is clear that this convenient delineation is by no means applicable to all or even most other words.
    Although there is some psychological validity to the notion of senses (Simpson and Burgess 1988; Jorgensen 1990), lexicographers themselves are well aware of the lack of agreement on senses and sense divisions (see, for example, Malakhovski [1987], Robins [1987], Ayto [1983], Stock [19831).
    The problem of sense division has been an object of discussion since antiquity: Aristotle' devoted a section of his Topics to this subject in 350 B.C.
    Since then, philosophers and linguists have continued to discuss the topic at length (see Quine [1960], Asprejan [1974], Lyons [1977], Weinrich [1980]
