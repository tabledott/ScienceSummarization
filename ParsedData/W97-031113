ta.
    Alternatively, when the applications involves human inspection, e.g. for bilingual lexicography, a suitable stopping point can be found by manually inspecting validated NCCs.
  
  
    Sections 3 and 4 describe how to carry out NCC validity tests, but not how to choose which NCCs to test.
    Making this choice at random would make the discovery process too slow, because the vast majority of word sequences are not valid NCCs.
    The discovery process can be greatly accelerated by testing only candidate NCCs for which Equation 4 is likely to be positive.
    This section presents a way to guess whether Axy &gt; 0 for a candidate NCC xy before inducing a translation model that involves this NCC.
    To do so, it is necessary to estimate i'(x), i'(y), and i' (xy), using only the base translation model.
    First, a bit of notation.
    Let LC and RC denote word contexts to the left and to the right.
    Let (x : RC = y) be the set of tokens of x whose right context is y, and vice versa for (y : LC = X).
