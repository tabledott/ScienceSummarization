ond category, with a .05 chance of the second coder also doing so).
    This makes it impossible to interpret raw agreement figures using measure (2).
    This same problem affects all of the possible ways of extending measure (2) to more than two coders.
    Now consider measure (3), which has an advantage over measure (2) when there is a pool of coders, none of whom should be distinguished, in that it produces one figure that sums reliability over all coder pairs.
    Measure (3) still falls foul of the same problem with expected chance agreement as measure (2) because it does not take into account the number of categories occurring in the coding scheme.
    Measure (4) is a different approach to measuring over multiple undifferentiated coders.
    Note that although Passonneau and Litman are looking at the presence or absence of discourse segment boundaries, measure (4) takes into account agreement that a prosodic phrase boundary is not a discourse segment boundary, and therefore treats the problem as a tw
