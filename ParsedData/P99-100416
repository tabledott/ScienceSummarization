ature: we can say Smith's lecture is like a sleeping pill, but &amp;quot;not the other way round&amp;quot;. average error rate Error rates (averages and ranges) definition of commonality is left to the user (several different definitions are proposed for different tasks).
    We view the empirical approach taken in this paper as complementary to Lin's.
    That is, we are working in the context of a particular application, and, while we have no mathematical certainty of the importance of the &amp;quot;common support&amp;quot; information, we did not assume it a priori; rather, we let the performance data guide our thinking.
    Finally, we observe that the skew metric seems quite promising.
    We conjecture that appropriate values for a may inversely correspond to the degree of sparseness in the data, and intend in the future to test this conjecture on larger-scale prediction tasks.
    We also plan to evaluate skewed versions of the Jensen-Shannon divergence proposed by Rao (1982) and J. Lin (1991).
