  265 Computational Linguistics Volume 34, Number 2 The softmax function (Bishop 1995) is used to convert raw activation to conditional probabilities.
  If there are n classes and the raw activation of class i is acti, the posterior estimation for class i is Prob(i) = e acti ?
  1?j?n e actj Note that in training this classifier, unless specified otherwise, the argument can- didates used to generate the training examples are obtained from the output of the argument identifier, not directly from the gold-standard corpus.
  In this case, we au- tomatically obtain the necessary examples to learn for class ?null.?
  3.4 Inference In the previous stages, decisions were always made for each argument independently, ignoring the global information across arguments in the final output.
  The purpose of the inference stage is to incorporate such information, includ
