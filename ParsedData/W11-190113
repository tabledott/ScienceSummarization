    Thus we could coreference United States in &#8220;the United States policy&#8221; with another referent, but not American &#8220;the American policy.&#8221; GPEs and Nationality acronyms (e.g.
    U.S.S.R. or U.S.). are also considered adjectival.
    Pre-modifier acronyms can be coreferenced unless they refer to a nationality.
    Thus in the examples below, FBI can be coreferenced to other mentions, but U.S. cannot.
    Dates and monetary amounts can be considered part of a coreference chain even when they occur as pre-modifiers.
