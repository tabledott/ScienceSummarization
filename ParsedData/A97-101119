gn heads would raise recall but lower precision.
    A similar measure is used in (Eisner, 1996) except that every word has a head, i.e. the precision equals recall, reported as 79.2%.
    We evaluated our parser against the selected dependencies in the test samples.
    The samples being rather small, only the most common dependencies are evaluated: subject, object and predicative.
    These dependencies are usually resolved more reliably than, say, appositions, prepositional attachments etc.
    The results of the test samples are listed in Figure 8.
    It seems the parser leaves some amount of the words unlinked (e.g.
    10-15% of subjects) but what it has recognised is generally correct (precision 95-98% for subjects).
    Dekang Lin (1996) has earlier used this kind of evaluation, where precision and recall were for subjects 87% and 78%, and for complements (including objects) 84% and 72 %, respectively.
    The results are not strictly comparable because the syntactic description is somewhat different
