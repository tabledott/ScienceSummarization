    Held and Karp (1962) presents a DP approach to solve the TSP, an optimization problem that is defined as follows: Given are a set of cities {1, ... , J} and for each pair of cities j,j' the cost djj, &gt; 0 for traveling from city j to city j'.
    We are looking for the shortest tour, starting and ending in city 1, that visits all cities in the set of cities exactly once.
    We are using the notation C for the set of cities, since it corresponds to a coverage set of processed source positions in MT.
    A straightforward way to find the shortest tour is by trying all possible permutations of the J cities.
    The resulting algorithm has a complexity of O(J!).
    DP can be used, however, to find the shortest tour in O(J2 &#183; 2J), which is a much smaller complexity for larger values of J.
    The approach recursively evaluates the quantity D(C, j): D(C, j) := costs of the partial tour starting in city 1, ending in city j, and visiting all cities in
