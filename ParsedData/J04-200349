system trained exclusively on a conventional dictionary are very poor: The SSER jumps over 60%.
    7.5.1 Results on the Verbmobil Task.
    As was pointed out in Section 4, the hierarchical lexicon is expected to be especially useful in cases in which many of the inflected word forms to be accounted for in test do not occur during training.
    To systematically investigate the model&#8217;s generalization capability, it has been applied on the three different setups described in Section 7.4.
    The training procedure was the one proposed in Section 6, which includes restructuring transformations in training and test.
    Table 9 summarizes the improvement achieved for all three setups.
    Training on 58,000 sentences plus conventional dictionary: Compared to the effect of restructuring, the additional improvement achieved with the hierarchical lexicon is relatively small in this setup.
    The combination of all methods results in a relative improvement in terms of SSER of almost 13% and in terms of infor
