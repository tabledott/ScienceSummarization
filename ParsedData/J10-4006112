en TypeDM and DV-10, the second best model from the literature, is highly significant (t = 2.9, df = 43, p &lt; 0.01).
    If we consider how difficult this sort of open-ended task is (see the very low performance of the respectable models at the bottom of the list), matching on average two out of ten speaker-generated properties, as TypeDM does, is an impressive feat.
    The vectors of this space are labeled with binary tuples of type (w1, l) (columns of matrix Cmode-3 in Table 3), and their dimensions are labeled with words w2 (rows of the same matrix).
    We illustrate this space in the task of discriminating verbs participating in different argument alternations.
    However, other uses of the space can also be foreseen.
    For example, the rows of W1LxW2 correspond to the columns of the W1xLW2 space (given the constraints on the tuple structure we adopted in Section 3.1).
    We could use the former space for feature smoothing or selection in the latter space, for example, by merging the features of W
