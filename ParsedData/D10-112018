    Similarly, the updates for q(&#952;) and q(&#966;) are given by: where Cs0z0c(s) is the count of child symbol s being generated by the parent symbol s0 and subsymbol z0 in context c and Cs0z0x is the count of word x being generated by symbol s0 and subsymbol z0. where N is the total number of sentences, len(n) is the length of sentence n, and index h(nj) refers to the head of the jth node of sentence n. Given this q0(z) a gradient search is performed using (6) to find the optimal &#955; and thus the primal solution for updating q(z).
    Finally, we update the degenerate factor q(&#946;s) with the projected gradient search algorithm used by Liang et al. (2009b).
  
  
    Universal Dependency Rules We compile a set of 13 universal dependency rules consistent with various linguistic accounts (Carnie, 2002; Newmeyer, 2005), shown in Table 1.
    These rules are defined over coarse part-of-speech tags: Noun, Verb, Adjective, Adverb, Pronoun, Article, Auxiliary, Preposition, Numeral and Conjunction.
