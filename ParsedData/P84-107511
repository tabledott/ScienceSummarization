quate for any major attempt at building natural-language grammars because of its verbosity and redundancy.
    Efficiency of encoding was 5 But see Pereira and Shieber 184j for arguments in favor of using domain theory even if all the available power is not utilized. temporarily sacrificed in an attempt to keep the underlying formalism simple, general, and semantically well-founded.
    However, given a simple underlying formalism, we can build more efficient, specialized languages on top of it, much as MACLISP might be built on top of pure LISP.
    And just as MACLISP need not be implemented (and is not implemented) directly in pure LISP, specialized formalisms built conceptually on top of pure PATR-II need not be so implemented (although currently we do implement them directly through pure PATR-II).
    The effectiveness of this approach can be seen in the fact that at least a sizable portion of English syntax has been encoded in various experimental PATR-II grammars constructed to date.
