or the Arabic, Aramaic, and English versions, fied by augmenting the model with a pair of &#8220;morphemeidentity&#8221; variables deterministically drawn from each abstract morpheme.
    Thus the identity of the drawn morphemes can be retained even while resampling their generation mechanism. we use the Van Dyke Arabic translation,4 Targum Onkelos,5 and the Revised Standard Version (Nelson, 1952), respectively.
    We obtained gold standard segmentations of the Arabic translation with a hand-crafted Arabic morphological analyzer which utilizes manually constructed word lists and compatibility rules and is further trained on a large corpus of hand-annotated Arabic data (Habash and Rambow, 2005).
    The accuracy of this analyzer is reported to be 94% for full morphological analyses, and 98%-99% when part-of-speech tag accuracy is not included.
    We don&#8217;t have gold standard segmentations for the English and Aramaic portions of the data, and thus restrict our evaluation to Hebrew and Arabic.
