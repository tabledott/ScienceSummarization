eriments with lower thresholds showed that this choice has little effect on the results to our set of test words.
    4 This means that alternative translations of a word were not considered.
    Another approach, as conducted by Fung &amp; Yee (1998), would be to consider all possible translations listed in the lexicon and to give them equal (or possibly descending) weight.
    Our decision was motivated by the observation that many words have a salient first translation and that this translation is listed first in the Collins Gem Dictionary German-English.
    We did not explore this issue further since in a small pocket dictionary only few ambiguities are listed.
  
  
    Table 1 shows the results for 20 of the 100 German test words.
    For each of these test words, the top five translations as automatically generated are listed.
    In addition, for each word its expected English translation from the test set is given together with its position in the ranked lists of computed translations.
