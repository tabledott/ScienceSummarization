ed, METEOR creates a word alignment between the two strings.
    An alignment is mapping between words, such that every word in each string maps to at most one word in the other string.
    This alignment is incrementally produced by a sequence of word-mapping modules.
    The &#8220;exact&#8221; module maps two words if they are exactly the same.
    The &#8220;porter stem&#8221; module maps two words if they are the same after they are stemmed using the Porter stemmer.
    The &#8220;WN synonymy&#8221; module maps two words if they are considered synonyms, based on the fact that they both belong to the same &#8220;synset&amp;quot; in WordNet.
    The word-mapping modules initially identify all Proceedings of the Second Workshop on Statistical Machine Translation, pages 228&#8211;231, Prague, June 2007. c&#65533;2007 Association for Computational Linguistics possible word matches between the pair of strings.
    We then identify the largest subset of these word mappings such that the resulting set constitute
