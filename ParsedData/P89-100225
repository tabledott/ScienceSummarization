quires only that a and s be compatible, that is, unifiable.
    If the logical-form language and semantic interpretation system provide a sound treatment of variable binding and scope, abstraction and application, completeness and coherence will be irrelevant because the logical form of any phrase will not contain free variables.
    However, neither semantic projections in lexical-functional grammar ( LFG) (Halvorsen and Kaplan, 1988) nor definite-clause grammars provide the means for such a sound treatment: logical-form variables or missing arguments of predicates are both encoded as unbound variables (attributes with unspecified values in the LFG semantic projection) at the description level.
    Then completeness and coherence become important.
    For example, suppose a grammar associated the following strings and logical forms. eat(john, X) 'John ate' eat(john, banana) 'John ate a banana' eat(john, nice(yellov(banana))) 'John ate a nice yellow banana' The generator of Section 4.1 would generate any of t
