n it is likely to be the name of a person.
    At this stage the system will also attempt to resolve conjunction problems in names of organisations.
    For example, in &amp;quot;China International Trust and Investment Corp&amp;quot;, the system checks if possible parts of the conjunctions were used in the text on their own and thus are names of different organizations; if not, the system has no reason to assume that more than one company is being talked about.
    In a similar vein, the system resolves the attachment of sentence initial capitalized modifiers, the problem alluded to above with the &amp;quot;Suspended Ceiling Contractors Ltd&amp;quot; example: if the modifier was seen with the organization name elsewhere in the text, then the system has good evidence that the modifier is part of the company name; if the modifier does not occur anywhere else in the text with the company name, it is assumed not to be part of it.
    This strategy is also used for expressions like &amp;quot;Murdoch's News Corp&a
