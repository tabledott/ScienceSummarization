    ZS is a normalising constant which ensures that P(&#57746;|S) is a probability distribution: where &#57740;(S) is the set of possible parses for S. For the dependency model a parse, &#57746;, is a (d, &#57737;) pair (as given in (1)).
    A feature is a count of the number of times some configuration occurs in d or the number of times some dependency occurs in &#57737;.
    Section 6 gives examples of features.
    We follow Riezler et al. (2002) in using a discriminative estimation method by maximising the conditional likelihood of the model given the data.
    For the dependency model, the data consists of sentences S 1, ... , Sm, together with gold standard dependency structures, &#57737;1, ... , &#57737;m.
    The gold standard structures are multisets of dependencies, as described earlier.
    Section 6 explains how the gold standard structures are obtained.
    The objective function of a model A is the conditional log-likelihood, L(A), minus a Gaussian prior term, G(A), used to reduce overfittin
