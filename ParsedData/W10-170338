Weighted by K(RPR)&#8221;) do not remove any data, instead assigning weights to workers based on their agreement with experts and their RPR, respectively.
    Namely, for each worker, the weight assigned by the fourth method is Ke,,p for that worker, and the weight assigned by the fifth method is K(RPR) for that worker.
    Examining the correlation coefficients obtained from those methods (Table 12), we see mixed results, and there is no clear winner among those methods.
    It is also difficult to draw any conclusion as to which method performs best when.
    However, it is encouraging to see that the two RPR-based methods perform well.
    This is noteworthy, since there is no need to use expert data to weight workers, which means that it is possible to evaluate a worker using inherent, &#8216;built-in&#8217; properties of that worker&#8217;s own data, without resorting to making comparisons with other workers or with experts.
