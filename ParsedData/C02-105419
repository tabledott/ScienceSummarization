t BED7  in +-) . However,  is common to all dot products in B?D7   BD 7/ . Therefore, we can implement a faster classifierthat calculates them concurrently.
			TinySVM?s clas sifier prepares a list fi2si Z??
			] that contains all 7  s whose ? -th coordinates are not zero.
			In addition, counters for ?D%7  p ?D%7 / are prepared because dot products of binary vectors are integers.
			Then, for each non-zero G[Z??
			] , the counters are incremented for all 7   fi2si Z???]
			By checking only members of fi2si Z??
			] for non-zero G[Z??
			] , the classifier is not bothered by fruitless cases: G?Z??
			]?*?Q ?8Z???]??*YQ orG[Z???]W?*?Q ? ?Z???]?*yQ . Therefore, TinySVM?s clas sifier is faster than other classifiers.
			This method is applicable to any kernels based on dot products.
			For the training phase, we can build fi2si ? Z???]
			that contains all   s whose ? -th coordinates are notzero.
			Then, B??D   B???D  can be efficiently calculated because ??
