to be smooth throughout the graph, as we discuss in the next section.
  
  
    With the graph defined, there are several algorithms one can use to carry out semi-supervised learning (Zhu et al., 2003; Delalleau et al., 2005; Joachims, 2003; Blum and Chawla, 2001; Belkin et al., 2005).
    The basic idea is the same and is what we use in this paper.
    That is, our rating function f(x) should be smooth with respect to the graph. f(x) is not smooth if there is an edge with large weight w between nodes xi and xj, and the difference between f(xi) and f(xj) is large.
    The (un)smoothness over the particular edge can be defined as w(f(xi) &#8722; f(xj))2.
    A small loss implies that the rating of an unlabeled review is close to its labeled peers as well as its unlabeled peers.
    This is how unlabeled data can participate in learning.
    The optimization problem is minf L(f).
    To understand the role of the parameters, we define &#945; = ak + bk' and Q = a, so that L(f) can be written as Thus Q controls t
