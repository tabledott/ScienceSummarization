nt (which is, however, represented in the POS tags).
    One problem that prevented us from including number agreement is the above-mentioned inability to distinguish NP lists and appositives.
    In the Penn Treebank, all relative clauses are attached at the noun phrase level.
    This is semantically undesirable, because a correct interpretation of restrictive relative clauses can only be obtained if they modify the noun, whereas non-restrictive relative clauses are noun phrase modifiers.
    Because this distinction requires manual inspection on a caseby-case basis, we were unable to modify the Treebank analysis.
    Thus, all CCGbank relative pronouns have categories of the form (NPi\NPi)/(S/NPi), rather than (Ni\Ni)/(S/NPi).
    This will make life difficult for those trying to provide a Montague-style semantics for relative modifiers.
    Like most other problems that we were not able to overcome, this limitation of the Treebank ultimately reflects the sheer difficulty of providing a consistent and reli
