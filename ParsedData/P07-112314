sentences) from the Romanian side of an EnglishRomanian parallel corpus, according to the annotation scheme in (Wiebe et al., 2005).
    Agreement between annotators was measured, and then their differences were adjudicated.
    The baseline on this data set is 54.16%, which can be obtained by assigning a default Subjective label to all sentences.
    (More information about the corpus and annotations are given in Section 4 below, where agreement between English and Romanian aligned sentences is also assessed.)
    As mentioned earlier, due to the lexicon projection process that is performed via a bilingual dictionary, the entries in our Romanian subjectivity lexicon are in a lemmatized form.
    Consequently, we also lemmatize the gold-standard corpus, to allow for the identification of matches with the lexicon.
    For this purpose, we use the Romanian lemmatizer developed by Ion and Tufis&#184; (Ion, 2007), which has an estimated accuracy of 98%.2 Table 3 shows the results of the rule-based classifier.
