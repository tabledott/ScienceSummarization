 regarding morphology, but that is for the simple reason that knowledge of how words divide into subpieces is an area of knowledge which no one would take to be innate in any direct fashion: if sanity is parsed as san + ity in one language, it may perfectly well be parsed as sa + nity in another language.
    That is, while passion may flame disagreements between partisans of Universal Grammar and partisans of statistically grounded empiricism regarding the task of syntax acquisition, the task which we have studied here is a considerably more humble one, which must in some fashion or other be figured out by grunt work by the language learner.
    It thus allows us a much sharper image of how powerful the tools are likely to be that the language acquirer brings to the task.
    And does the human child perform computations at all like the ones proposed here?
    From most practical points of view, nothing hinges on our answer to this question, but it is a question that ultimately we cannot avoid facing.
