only TRANS and its related features, VBN and PASS, we achieve only 55% accuracy, in comparison to 69.8% using the full set of features.
    This can perhaps be seen as support for our hypothesis that argument structure is the right level of representation for verb class distinctions, since it appears that our features that capture thematic differences are useful in classification, while Schulte im Walde's selectional restriction features were not.
    Aone and McKee (1996) also use features that are intended to tap into both subcategorization and thematic role distinctions&#8212;frequencies of the transitive use and animate subject use.
    In our task, we show that subject animacy can be profitably approximated solely with pronoun counts, avoiding the need for reference to external sources of semantic information used by Aone and McKee.
    In addition, our work extends theirs in investigating much finer-grained verb classes, and in classifying verbs that have multiple argument structures.
    While Aone and
