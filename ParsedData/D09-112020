ctic constraints and semantic compatibility components contribute most to the overall final result.
    On the MUC6-TEST dataset, our system outpersion made by the system.
    Each row is a mention type and the column the predicted mention type antecedent.
    The majority of errors are made in the NOMINAL category. forms both Poon and Domingos (2008) (an unsupervised Markov Logic Network system which uses explicit constraints) and Finkel and Manning (2008) (a supervised system which uses ILP inference to reconcile the predictions of a pairwise classifier) on all comparable measures.11 Similarly, on the ACE2004-NWIRE dataset, we also outperform the state-of-the-art unsupervised system of Poon and Domingos (2008).
    Overall, we conclude that our system outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised systems12 and is in the range of the state-of-the art systems of Culotta et al. (2007) and Bengston and Roth (2008).
  
  
    There are several general trends to the errors made by our system.
