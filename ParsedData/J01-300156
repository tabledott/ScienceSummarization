rds and providing annotated test and training examples for just these words, allowing supervised and unsupervised algorithms to be tested on the same vocabulary.
    This model was implemented in SENSEVAL (Kilgarriff 1998).
    However, for the evaluation of the system presented here, there would have been no benefit from using this strategy since it still involves the manual tagging of large amounts of data and this effort could be used to create a gold standard corpus in which all content words are disambiguated.
    It is possible that some computational techniques may evaluate well over a small vocabulary but may not work for a large set of words, and the evaluation strategy proposed by Resnik and Yarowsky will not discriminate between these cases.
    In our evaluation corpus, the most frequent ambiguous type is have, which appears 604 times.
    A large number of words (2407) occur only once, and nearly 95% have 25 occurrences or less.
    Table 6 shows the distribution of ambiguous types by number of c
