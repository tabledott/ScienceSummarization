 are sorted in order of decreasing similarity and, in case of equal similarities, in order of decreasing frequency.
    In terms of Figure 1, we take a rectangle from the right front.
    We place the left boundary as far to the left as possible, because this is where most of the words are.
    Build the SAT.
    In this step, the correspondences in the WAT are used to establish a mapping between sentences of the two texts.
    In general, these new 6 The basis for this graph is an analytic derivation of the probability that a word with a certain frequency in a 300-sentence text matches some random pattern with a particular similarity.
    The analytic formula relies on word-frequency data derived from a large corpus instead of on a stochastic model for word frequency distribution (such as Zipf's law, which states that the frequency with which words occur in a text is indirectly proportional to the number of words with this frequency; for a recent discussion of more accurate models, see also Baayen [19911).
