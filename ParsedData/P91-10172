anguage provides information about its meaning (Wittgenstein, 1953).
    Also, statistical approaches which were popular few decades ago have recently reawakened and were found useful for computational linguistics.
    Consequently, a possible (though partial) alternative to using manually constructed knowledge can be found in the use of statistical data on the occurrence of lexical relations in large corpora.
    The use of such relations (mainly relations between verbs or nouns and their arguments and modifiers) for various purposes has received growing attention in recent research (Church and Hanks, 1990; Zernik and Jacobs, 1990; Hindle, 1990).
    More specifically, two recent works have suggested to use statistical data on lexical relations for resolving ambiguity cases of PP-attachment (Hindle and Rooth, 1990) and pronoun references (Dagen and Rai, I990a; Dagan and Itai, 1990b).
    Clearly, statistical methods can be useful also for target word selection.
    Consider, for example, the Hebrew sentence
