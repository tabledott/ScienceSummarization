ge (even for a document with a moderate number of mentions), it is difficult to estimate a distribution over leaves directly.
    Instead, we choose to model the process from mentions to entities, or in other words, score paths from the root to leaves in the Bell tree.
    A nice property of the Bell tree representation is that the number of linking or starting steps is the same for all the hypotheses.
    This makes it easy to rank them using the &#8220;local&#8221; linking and starting probabilities as the number of factors is the same.
    The Bell tree representation is also incremental in that mentions are added sequentially.
    This makes it easy to design a decoder and search algorithm.
  
  
    We use a binary conditional model to compute the probability that an active mention links with an infocus partial entity.
    The conditions include all the partially-formed entities before, the focus entity index, and the active mention.
    Formally, let be mentions in a document.
