 recall is defined as the percent of words in the hand-segmented text identified by the segmentation algorithm, and precision is defined as the percentage of words returned by the algorithm that also occurred in the hand-segmented text in the same position.
    The component recall and precision scores are then used to calculate an F-measure (Rijsbergen, 1979), where F = (1 + 0)PRI(13P + R).
    In this paper we will report all scores as a balanced F-measure (precision and recall weighted equally) with /3 = 1, such that For our Chinese experiments, the training set consisted of 2000 sentences (60187 words) from a Xinhua news agency corpus; the test set was a separate set of 560 sentences (18783 words) from the same corpus.5 We ran four experiments using this corpus, with four different algorithms providing the starting point for the learning of the segmentation transformations.
    In each case, the rule sequence learned from the training set resulted in a significant improvement in the segmentation of the te
