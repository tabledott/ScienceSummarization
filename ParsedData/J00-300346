y different intonational &amp;quot;tunes&amp;quot; (Kowtko 1996), and has been successfully applied to the classification of move types in the DCIEM Map Task corpus (Wright and Taylor 1997).
    The system detects sequences of distinctive pitch patterns by training one continuousdensity HMM for each DA type.
    Unfortunately, the event classification accuracy on the Switchboard corpus was considerably poorer than in the Map Task domain, and DA recognition results when coupled with a discourse grammar were substantially worse than with decision trees.
    The approach could prove valuable in the future, however, if the intonation event detector can be made more robust to corpora like OUTS.
    Bayes network for discourse HMM incorporating both word recognition and prosodic features.
    As mentioned earlier, we expect improved performance from combining word and prosodic information.
    Combining these knowledge sources requires estimating a combined likelihood P(A1,F1111,) for each utterance.
