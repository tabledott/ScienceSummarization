3), also represents paraphrases by lattices, similarly to our method, although their lattices are derived using parse information.
    Moreover, our algorithm does not employ knowledge resources such as parsers or lexical databases, which may not be available or appropriate for all domains &#8212; a key issue since paraphrasing is typically domain-dependent.
    Nonetheless, our algorithm achieves good performance.
  
  
    Previous work on automated paraphrasing has considered different levels of paraphrase granularity.
    Learning synonyms via distributional similarity has been well-studied (Pereira et al., 1993; Grefenstette, 1994; Lin, 1998).
    Jacquemin (1999) and Barzilay and McKeown (2001) identify phraselevel paraphrases, while Lin and Pantel (2001) and Shinyama et al. (2002) acquire structural paraphrases encoded as templates.
    These latter are the most closely related to the sentence-level paraphrases we desire, and so we focus in this section on template-induction approaches.
