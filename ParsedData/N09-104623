 translation system.
    These segmentation lattices improve translation quality (over an already strong baseline) in three typologically distinct languages (German, Hungarian, Turkish) when translating into English.
    Previous approaches to generating segmentation lattices have been quite laborious, relying either on the existence of multiple segmenters (Dyer et al., 2008; Xu et al., 2005) or hand-crafted rules (DeNeefe et al., 2008).
    Although the segmentation model we propose is discriminative, we have shown that it can be trained using a minimal amount of annotated training data.
    Furthermore, when even this minimal data cannot be acquired for a particular language (as was the situation we faced with Hungarian and Turkish), we have demonstrated that the parameters obtained in one language work surprisingly well for others.
    Thus, with virtually no cost, this model can be used with a variety of diverse languages.
    While these results are already quite satisfying, there are a number of compell
