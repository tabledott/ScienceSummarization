    Thus, the observed pattern of self-correction introduces empirical constraints on the set of features that are available for syntactic rules.
    The self-correction rules impose constraints not only on what linguistic elements must count as the same, but also on what must count as different.
    For example, in sentence be recognized as different sorts of elements in the grammar for the AUX node to be correctly the grammar assigned the words exactly the same part of speech, then the Category C;.7y Editor necessarily apply, incorrectly expunging (14) Kid could-be a brain in school.
    It appears therefore that the pattern of self-corrections that occur represents a potentially rich source of evidence about the nature of syntactic categories. the patterns of self-correction count as about the nature of categories for the linguist, then this data must be equally available to the language learner.
    This would suggest that, far from being an impediment to language learning, non-fluencies may in fact fac
