he sense distinctions (fish and musical instrument) correspond to pronunciation differences ([b~es] and [beIs]).
  Such data is often problematic, as the tagging is potentially subjective and error-filled, and sufficient quantities are difficult o obtain.
  As a solution to the data shortages for the above methods, [Gale, Church and Yarowsky 1992b] proposed the use of "pseudo-words," artificial sense ambiguities created by tak- ing two English words with the same part of speech (such as guerilla and reptile), and replacing each instance of both in a corpus with a new polysemous word guerrilla~reptile.
  As it is entirely possible that the concepts guerrilla nd reptile are represented by the same orthographic string in some foreign language, choosing between these two meanings based on context is a problem a word sense disambiguation algorithm could easily face.
  "Pseudo-words" are very useful for devel- oping and testing disambiguation methods because of their nearly unlimited availability and the known, ful
