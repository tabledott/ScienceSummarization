    There are many ways one could search for the best set of lexicon entries based on these scores.
    We could perform an exhaustive search: construct all possible mappings and find the highest combined score of all entries.
    Since there are O(n!) possible mappings, a brute force approach to this is practically impossible.
    We therefore employed a greedy search: First we search for the highest score for any word pair.
    We add this word pair to the lexicon, and drop word pairs that include either the German and English word from further search.
    Again, we search for the highest score and add the corresponding word pair, drop these words from further search, and so on.
    This is done iteratively, until all words are used up.
    Tables 2 and 3 illustrate this process for the spelling and context similarity clues, when applied separately.
    The results are summarized in Table 5.
    Recall that for each word that we are trying to map to the other language, a thousand possible target words ex
