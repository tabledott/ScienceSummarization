is finished and the intersection result is empty.
    All the sentences in the theme are compared in pairs.
    Then, these intersections are sorted according to their frequencies and all intersections above a given threshold result in theme intersection.
    For the theme in Figure 2, the intersection result is &amp;quot;On Friday, a U.S. F-16 fighter jet was shot down by Bosnian Serb missile.&amp;quot;1 Identification of theme intersection requires collecting paraphrasing patterns which occur in our corpus.
