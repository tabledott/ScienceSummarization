precision whereas rarely occurring patterns have high preci sion.
			From the Information Extraction point of view neither of these patterns is very useful.
			We need to find patterns with relatively high occurrence and high precision.
			We apply the log likeli hood principle (Dunning 1993) to compute this score.
			The top 15 patterns according to this metric are listed in Table 3 (we omit the POS variations for visibility).
			Some of these patterns are similar to the ones discovered by Hearst (1992) while other patterns are similar to the ones used by Fleischman et al (2003).
			4.3 Time complexity.
			To extract hyponym relations, we use a fixed number of patterns across a corpus.
			Since we treat each sentences independently from others, the algorithm runs in linear time O(n) over the corpus size, where n is number of sentences in the corpus.
	
	
			In this section, we empirically compare the pattern-based and co-occurrence-based models pre sented in Section 3 and Section 4.
			The focus is on the pre
