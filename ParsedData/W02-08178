rt needed to build a tagged corpus for a given ambiguous word, Open Mind Word Expert includes an active learning component that has the role of selecting for annotation only those examples that are the most informative.
    According to (Dagan et al., 1995), there are two main types of active learning.
    The first one uses memberships queries, in which the learner constructs examples and asks a user to label them.
    In natural language processing tasks, this approach is not always applicable, since it is hard and not always possible to construct meaningful unlabeled examples for training.
    Instead, a second type of active learning can be applied to these tasks, which is selective sampling.
    In this case, several classifiers examine the unlabeled data and identify only those examples that are the most informative, that is the examples where a certain level of disagreement is measured among the classifiers.
    We use a simplified form of active learning with selective sampling, where the instances to
