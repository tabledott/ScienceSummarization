re marked as nouns while the third is marked as verb.
    This word would be disambiguated if used as a verb but not if used as a noun.
    If we assume that every word of this type is assigned a part of speech which disambiguates it (i.e., verb in the case of beam), then an additional 7% of words in LDOCE could, potentially, be disambiguated.
    Therefore, up to 95% of word types in LDOCE can be disambiguated to the homograph level by part-of-speech information alone.
    However, these figures do not take into account either errors in part-of-speech tagging or the corpus distribution of tokens, since each word type is counted exactly once.
    The next stage in our analysis was to attempt to disambiguate some texts using the information obtained from part-of-speech tags.
    We took five articles from the Wall Street Journal, containing 391 polyhomographic content words.
    These articles were manually tagged with the most appropriate LDOCE homograph by one of the authors.
    The texts were then part-of-
