red to the ENGCG syntactic analyser, the output not only contains more information but it is also more accurate and explicit.
    The ambiguity rate is reduced to a quarter without any compromise in correctness.
    We did not have access to other systems, and care must be taken when interpreting the results which are not strictly comparable.
    However, the comparison to other current systems suggests that our dependency parser is very promising both theoretically and practically.
  
  
    We are using Atro Voutilainen's (1995) improved part-of-speech disambiguation grammar which runs in the CG-2 parser.
    Voutilainen and Juha Heikkild created the original ENGCG lexicon.
