CTB parsing, this type of ambiguity is difficult to resolve; different compound NP parses differ in dependency structure, so the dependency model resolves errors when word frequencies are large enough to be reliable, but this is often not possible.
    We found that the internal distributions of (i) NP modifiers of NPs and (ii) left-modified NPs both differ from the internal distribution of NPs in general; we take advantage of this in the PCFG model by marking both types (i) and (ii), which reduces the bias against NP-NP modification in compound NPs.
    Prenominal modification errors, illustrated in PNM of Figure 4, are rather infrequent, despite the natural parallel with PP attachment ambiguity in English.
    Due to the highly articulated structure of prenominal modifiers, it seems difficult to address this problem directly; one measure we found somewhat successful is to mark IP daughters of prenominal modification.
    Coordination scope errors occured in two major varieties: those where the misattached r
