ble than single words or N-grams.
    Using the (automatically) labeled sentences as training data, we apply an extraction pattern learning algorithm to automatically generate patterns representing subjective expressions.
    The learned patterns can be used to automatically identify more subjective sentences, which grows the training set, and the entire process can then be bootstrapped.
    Our experimental results show that this bootstrapping process increases the recall of the highprecision subjective sentence classifier with little loss in precision.
    We also find that the learned extraction patterns capture subtle connotations that are more expressive than the individual words by themselves.
    This paper is organized as follows.
    Section 2 discusses previous work on subjectivity analysis and extraction pattern learning.
    Section 3 overviews our general approach, describes the high-precision subjectivity classifiers, and explains the algorithm for learning extraction patterns associated with su
