sentence of length n. This explains why the non-projective list-based algorithm, with its quadratic complexity, consistently has longer learning times than the linear stack-based algorithms.
    However, it can also be noted that the projective, listbased algorithm, despite having the same worst-case complexity as the non-projective algorithm, in practice behaves much more like the arc-eager stack-based algorithm and in fact has a slightly lower learning time than the latter on average.
    The arc-standard stack-based algorithm, finally, again shows much more variation than the other algorithms.
    On average, it is slower to train than the arc-eager algorithm, and sometimes very substantially so, but for a few languages (Danish, Japanese, Portuguese, Slovene) it is actually faster (and considerably so for Danish).
    This again shows that learning time depends on other properties of the training sets than sheer size, and that some data sets may be more easily separable for the SVM learner with one parsing
