Figures 5 and 6 are n-partite cliques for n=4,10.
    We clearly expect a clustering algorithm to cut the two cliques apart.
    As we operate on unweighted graphs, however, CW is left with two choices: producing two clusters or grouping all nodes into one cluster.
    This is largely dependent on the random choices in very early iterations - if the same class is assigned to several nodes in both cliques, it will finally cover the whole graph.
    It is clearly a drawback that the outcome of CW is non-deterministic.
    Only half of the experiments with 4-bipartite cliques resulted in separation.
    However, the problem is most dramatic on small graphs and ceases to exist for larger graphs as demonstrated in figure 7.
    A structure that has been reported to occur in an enormous number of natural systems is the small world (SW) graph.
    Space prohibits an in-depth discussion, which can be found in (Watts 1999).
    Here, we restrict ourselves to SW-graphs in language data.
