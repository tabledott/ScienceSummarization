nstruction at different points during grammatical processing.
    In other words, it can be demonstrated that each of these constructions has properties which provide evidence for one particular structure at one stage of processing, while displaying properties which argue for a quite different structure at a later stage of processing.
    But if this reanalysis account is the correct account for any of these constructions, then the deterministic tree building theory must be wrong somewhere, for changing a structural analysis is the one thing that indelible systems cannot do, ex hypothesi.
    One class of examples widely assumed to involve some kind of reanalysis is the class of verb complement structures which have so-called &amp;quot;pseudo-passives&amp;quot;.
    These verbs seem to have two passive forms, one of which has an NP in subject position which serves in the same role as that served by the seeming object of the active form, while the other passive form seems to have an underlying prepositional ob
