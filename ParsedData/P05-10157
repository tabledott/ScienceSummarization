uman accuracy: according to our one-notch results, people may misclassify borderline cases like 2.5 stars).
    Our study also suggests that people could do at least fairly well at distinguishing full stars in a zero- to four-star scheme.
    However, when we began to construct five-category datasets for each of our four authors (see below), we found that in each case, either the most negative or the most positive class (but not both) contained only about 5% of the documents.
    To make the classes more balanced, we folded these minority classes into the adjacent class, thus arriving at a four-class problem (categories 0-3, increasing in positivity).
    Note that the four-class problem seems to offer more possibilities for leveraging class relationship information than the three-class setting, since it involves more class pairs.
    Also, even the two-category version of the rating-inference problem for movie reviews has proven quite challenging for many automated classification techniques (Pang, Lee, and V
