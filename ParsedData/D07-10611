			Several kinds of Natural Language Processing systems need measures of semantic relatedness for arbitrary wordpairs.
			For example, document summarization and ques tion answering systems often use similarity scores to evaluate candidate sentence alignments, and informationretrieval systems use relatedness scores for query expan sion.
			Several popular algorithms calculate scores from information contained in WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998), an electronic dictionary where word senses are explicitly connected by zero or more semantic relationships.
			Thecentral challenge of these algorithms is to compute rea sonable relatedness scores for arbitrary word pairs given that few pairs are directly connected.
			Most pairs in WordNet share no direct semantic link, and for some the shortest connecting path can be surprising?even pairs that seem intuitively related, such ?furnace?
			and ?stove?
