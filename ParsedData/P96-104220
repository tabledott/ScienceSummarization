s in annotation cost.
    This equivalence of the different methods also largely holds with respect to computational efficiency.
    Figure 1(b) plots classification accuracy versus number of words examined, instead of those selected.
    We see that while all selective methods are less efficient in terms of examples examined than complete training, they are comparable to each other.
    Two member selection seems to have a clear, though small, advantage.
    In Figure 2 we investigate further the properties of batch selection.
    Figure 2(a) shows that accuracy increases with batch size only up to a point, and then starts to decrease.
    This result is in line with theoretical difficulties with batch selection (Freund et al., 1993) in that batch selection does not account for the distribution of input examples.
    Hence, once batch size increases past a point, the input distribution has too little influence on which examples are selected, and hence classification accuracy decreases.
    Furthermore, as ba
