d C conditions the auxiliary parameters of Method B on various word classes.
    Whereas Methods A and B and Model 1 were fully specified in Section 4.3.1 and Section 5, the latter section described a variety of features on which Method C might classify links.
    For the purposes of the experiments described in this article, Method C employed the simple classification in Table 4 for both languages in the bitext.
    All classification was performed by table lookup; no context-aware part-of-speech tagger was used.
    In particular, words that were ambiguous between open classes and closed classes were always deemed to be in the closed class.
    The only language-specific knowledge involved in this classification method is the list of function words in class F. Certainly, more sophisticated word classification methods could produce better models, but even the simple classification in Table 4 should suffice to demonstrate the method's potential.
