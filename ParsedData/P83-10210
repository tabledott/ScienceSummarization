  Parsing As Deduction
  
    By exploring the relationship between parsing and deduction, a new and more general view of chart parsing is obtained, which encompasses parsing for grammar formalisms based on unification, and is the basis of the Earley Deduction proof procedure for definite clauses. efficiency of this approach for an interesting class grammars is discussed.
  
  
    The aim of this paper is to explore the relationship between parsing and deduction.
    The basic notion, which goes back to Kowalski (Kowalski, 1980) and Colmerauer (Colmerauer, 1978), has seen a very efficient, if limited, realization in the use of the logic programming language Prolog for parsing (Colmerauer, 1978; Pereira and Warren, 1980).
    The connection between parsing and deduction was developed further in the design of the Earley Deduction proof procedure (Warren, 1975), which will also be discussed at length here.
    Investigation of the connection between parsing and deduction yields several important benefits: (LFG
