ntally to new formal systems.
    Our discussion of two-level rule systems illustrates how we expect such extensions to unfold.
    These techniques may even extend to phonological systems that make use of matched pairs of brackets.
    Clearly, context-free mechanisms are sufficient to enforce dependencies between corresponding brackets, but further research may show that accurate phonological description does not exploit the power needed to maintain the balance between particular pairs, and thus that only regular devices are required for the analysis and interpretation of such systems.
    An important goal for us was to establish a solid basis for computation in the domain of phonological and orthographic systems.
    With that in mind, we developed a well-engineered computer implementation of the calculus of regular languages and relations, and this has made possible the construction of practical language processing systems.
    The common data structures that our programs manipulate are clearly states, t
