sary to change the second rule for 'relative' in Figure 8.1 to relative --&gt; open, rel marker, sentence, close.
    (5) and add the rule With this modified grammar, it is no longer possible to violate the complex-NP constraint, because no constituent can be repositioned from outside into the gap created by the application of rule (6) to the result of applying the rule for relatives (5).
    The non-terminals 'open' and 'close' bracket a subderivation ... open x close ... =&gt; &lt; x &gt; preventing any constituent from being repositioned from outside that subderivation into it.
    Figure 9.2 shows the use of rule (6) in the derivation of the sentence The mouse that the cat that likes fish chased squeaks.
    This is based on the same three simple sentences as the ungrammatical string of Figure 9.1, which the reader can now try to derive in the modified grammar, to see how the bracketing constraint prevents the derivation.
    In the previous sections, I avoided the complication of non-terminal arguments.
