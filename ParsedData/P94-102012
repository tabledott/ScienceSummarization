pus and manually assigned sense tags corresponding to the LDOCE definitions.
    During tagging, 107 usages were removed from the data set due to the authors' inability to classify them in terms of the set of LDOCE senses.
    Of the rejected usages, 43 are metonymic, and the rest are hybrid meanings specific to the domain, such as public interest group.
    Because our sense distinctions are not merely between two or three clearly defined core senses of a word, the task of hand-tagging the tokens of interest required subtle judgments, a point that has also been observed by other researchers disambiguating with respect to the full set of LDOCE senses ([6], [28]).
    Although this undoubtedly degraded the accuracy of the manually assigned sense tags (and thus the accuracy of the study as well), this problem seems unavoidable when making semantic distinctions beyond clearly defined core senses of a word ([17], [11], [14], [15]).
    Of the 2,369 sentences containing the sense-tagged usages of interest, 600 wer
