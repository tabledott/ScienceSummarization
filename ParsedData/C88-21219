truc- tural descriptions in certain cases, such as verbs taking two sentential arguments (e.g.
  "John equates olving this problem with doing the impossible").
  Adding substitution does not change the mathematical properties of TAGs.
  We describe very briefly the Tree Adjoining Grammar formalism with adjunction and substitution.
  A Tree Adjoining Grammar  is a tree-based system that consists of.three finite sets of trees: I, A and L. The trees in I O A tJ L are called e lementary trees.
  The trees in I are called initial trees.
  Initial trees rep- resent basic sententiai structures.
  They are usually con- sidered as projections of the verb and they take nominal 4We chose v as lexical head of the S tree but  we could have chosen n instead (although it is not motivated).
  579 complements.
  Initial trees (see the left tree in Figure 2) are rooted in S and their frontier consists of terminal sym- bols (including the empty string) and non-terminal nodes to be substituted for.
  The trees in A are called au
