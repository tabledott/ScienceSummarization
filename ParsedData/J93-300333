ent or deaccent items, such as accenting to indicate contrastive stress or deaccenting to indicate an item is already given in the discourse, we might expect these findings to be less clear than those for phrasing.
    In fact, although their interpretation is more complicated, the results are equally striking.
    Results of an analysis of the 97 occurrences from this sample for which accent type could be precisely determined are presented in Table 3.
    Of those tokens not included, two discourse tokens were judged either L* or H* with a compressed pitch range, and one discourse token was judged either deaccented or L*.
    Note first that large numbers of discourse and sentential tokens were uttered with a H* or complex accent-16 (26.7%) discourse and 32 (86.5%) sentential tokens.
    The chief similarity here lies in the use of the H* accent type, with 14 discourse uses and 14 sentential; 7 other sentential tokens are ambiguous between H* and complex.
    Note also that discourse now was much more likely
