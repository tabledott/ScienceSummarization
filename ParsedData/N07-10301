    There are two major drawbacks with most systems that make pairwise coreference decisions.
    The first is that identification of anaphora is done implicitly as part of the coreference resolution.
    Two common types of errors with these systems are cases where: (i) the system mistakenly identifies an antecedent for non-anaphoric mentions, and (ii) the system does not try to resolve an actual anaphoric mention.
    To reduce such errors, Ng and Cardie (2002a) and Ng (2004) use an anaphoricity classifier &#8211;which has the sole task of saying whether or not any antecedents should be identified for each mention&#8211; as a filter for their coreference system.
    They achieve higher performance by doing so; however, their setup uses the two classifiers in a cascade.
    This requires careful determination of an anaphoricity threshold in order to not remove too many mentions from consideration (Ng, 2004).
    This sensitivity is unsurprisi
