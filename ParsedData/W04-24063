    This paper also proposes and evaluates several extensions to these techniques.
    We begin with a summary of previous work, and then a discussion of features and two types of context vectors.
    We summarize techniques for clustering in vector versus similarity spaces, and then present our experimental methodology, including a discussion of the data used in our experiments.
    Then we describe our approach to the evaluation of unsupervised word sense discrimination.
    Finally we present an analysis of our experimental results, and conclude with directions for future work.
  
  
    (Pedersen and Bruce, 1997) and (Pedersen and Bruce, 1998) propose a (dis)similarity based discrimination approach that computes (dis)similarity among each pair of instances of the target word.
    This information is recorded in a (dis)similarity matrix whose rows/columns represent the instan
