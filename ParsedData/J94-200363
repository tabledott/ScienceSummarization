2 The number of subjects here are too small to test statistically.
  214 Marilyn Walker et al.
  Japanese Discourse no clear indication of topic is given, the Cf ordering alone is not a strong constraint; (2) the ordering of the Cf should be partly determined by lexical semantics or other knowledge about the situation being described.
  However,  compare example 30 with example 31.
  Example 31 a. Taroo wa Ziroo o minna no mae de tatakimasita.
  SUBJ OBJ all of front in hit.
  Taroo hit Ziroo in front of all the other people.
  Cb: [TARO0] Cf: [TAROO, ZIRO0] b. Itiniti-zyuu, kanzen-ni 0 0 musi-simasita.
  all-day completely ignored (Taroo) ignored (Ziroo) all day.
  Cb: TAROO Cf: [TAROO, ZIROO] 10 Cb: ZIROO Cf: [ZIROO, TAROO] 4 The use of wa in example 31 seems to override the semantic preference that was exhibited in example 30, so that subjects now prefer an interpretation i which Taroo is the Cb.
  23 This shows that Taroo has not been instantiated as the Cb
