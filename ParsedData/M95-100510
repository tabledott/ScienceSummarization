  Let us now consider some more- complex examples where keys and responses dont so neatly overlap .
  To begin with, imagine that the key and response are as follows .
  Key: &lt;B-C C-D D-E E-G G-H H-J&gt; ?
  Response : &lt;A-B B-C D-E E-F G-H-H-I &gt; The key establishes a single equivalence class, while the response defines three : {A B C}, {D E F}, {G H I} .
  In addition, the key contains the element J, which is missin g entirely from the response .
  These are shown in the following figure, where the thic k lines denote the key class, and thin ones denote response classes .
  49 Eyeballing the problem, we note that as there are seven elements in the key, six links must minimally be provi
