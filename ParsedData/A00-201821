7 first guesses the lexical head of a constituent and then, given the head, guesses the PCFG rule used to expand the constituent in question.
    In contrast, the current parser first guesses the head's pre-terminal, then the head, and then the expansion.
    It turns out that usefulness of this process had already been discovered by Collins [10], who in turn notes (personal communication) that it was previously used by Eisner [12].
    However, Collins in [10] does not stress the decision to guess the head's pre-terminal first, and it might be lost on the casual reader.
    Indeed, it was lost on the present author until he went back after the fact and found it there.
    In Figure 2 we show that this one factor improves performance by nearly 2%.
    It may not be obvious why this should make so great a difference, since most words are effectively unambiguous.
    (For example, part-ofspeech tagging using the most probable preterminal for each word is 90% accurate [8].)
    We believe that two factors contri
