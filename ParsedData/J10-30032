se, there is still room for elaboration on how paraphrases may be automatically generated or elicited for use in language processing applications.
    In this survey, we make an attempt at such an elaboration.
    An important outcome of this survey is the discovery that there are a large variety of paraphrase generation methods, each with widely differing sets of characteristics, in terms of performance as well as ease of deployment.
    We also find that although many paraphrase methods are developed with a particular application in mind, all methods share the potential for more general applicability.
    Finally, we observe that the choice of the most appropriate method for an application depends on proper matching of the characteristics of the produced paraphrases with an appropriate method.
    It could be argued that it is premature to survey an area of research that has shown promise but has not yet been tested for a long enough period (and in enough systems).
    However, we believe this argument actu
