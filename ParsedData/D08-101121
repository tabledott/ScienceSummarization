R Java program, TERCOM (Snover et al., 2006).
    Default settings of TERCOM are used in the following experiments.
    On the dev set, the case insensitive BLEU score of the IHMM-based 8-way system combination output is about 5.8 points higher than that of the best single system.
    Compared to the TER-based method, the IHMM-based method is about 1.5 BLEU points better.
    On the MT08 test set, the IHMM-based system combination gave a case sensitive BLEU score of 30.89%.
    It outperformed the best single system by 4.7 BLEU points and the TER-based system combination by 1.0 BLEU points.
    Note that the best single system on the dev set and the test set are different.
    The different single systems are optimized on different tuning sets, so this discrepancy between dev set and test set results is presumably due to differing degrees of mismatch between the dev and test sets and the various tuning sets.
    In order to evaluate how well our method performs when we combine more systems, we collected MT ou
