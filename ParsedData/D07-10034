			These syntactic and semantic variations occur in almost every question-answer pair, and typi cally they cannot be easily captured using shallow representations.
			It is also worth noting that such syntactic and semantic variations are not unique to QA; they can be found in many other closely related NLP tasks, motivating extensive community efforts in syntactic and semantic processing.
			Indeed, in this work, we imagine a generative story for QA in which the question is generatedfrom the answer sentence through a series of syn tactic and semantic transformations.
			The same story has been told for machine translation (Yamada and Knight, 2001, inter alia), in which a target languagesentence (the desired output) has undergone seman tic transformation (word to word translation) and syntactic transformation (syntax divergence acrosslanguages) to gen
