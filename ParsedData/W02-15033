lopment of grammatical resources was carried out in the framework of the Advanced Language Engineering Platform (ALEP).
    The coverage of the grammars implemented in LSGRAM was, however, much smaller than the coverage of the English (Riezler et al., 2002) or German grammar in ParGram.
    An effort which is closer in spirit to ParGram is the implemention of grammar development platforms for HPSG.
    In the Verbmobil project (Wahlster, 2000), HPSG grammars for English, German, and Japanese were developed on two platforms: LKB (Copestake, 2002) and PAGE.
    The PAGE system, developed and maintained in the Language Technology Lab of the German National Research Center on Artificial Intelligence DFKI GmbH, is an advanced NLP core engine that facilitates the development of grammatical and lexical resources, building on typed feature logics.
    To evaluate the HPSG platforms and to compare their merits with those of XLE and the ParGram projects, one would have to organize a special workshop, particularly as th
