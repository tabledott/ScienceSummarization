ng is trivial, but for other parsers the conditions are more complex.
    With the techniques in this paper, all that is necessary is to show that there is a one-to-one correspondence between item derivations and grammar derivations.
    Once that has been shown, any w-continuous semiring can be used.
    The third use of this paper is to separate the computation of infinite sums from the main parsing process.
    Infinite sums can come from several different phenomena, such as loops from productions of the form A A; productions involving c; and left recursion.
    In traditional procedural specifications, the solution to these difficult problems is intermixed with the parser specification, and makes the parser specific to semirings using the same techniques for solving the summations.
    It is important to notice that the algorithms for solving these infinite summations vary fairly widely, depending on the semiring.
    On the one hand, Boolean infinite summations are nearly trivial to compute.
