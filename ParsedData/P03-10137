r baseline against which to test the lexicalized models.
    More specifically, we used a standard probabilistic context-free grammar (PCFG; see Charniak 1993).
    Each context-free rule RHS &#8212;* LHS is annotated with an expansion probability P(RHS|LHS).
    The probabilities for all rules with the same lefthand side have to sum to one, and the probability of a parse tree T is defined as the product of the probabilities of all rules applied in generating T. The head-lexicalized PCFG model of Carroll and Rooth (1998) is a minimal departure from the standard unlexicalized PCFG model, which makes it ideal for a direct comparison.1 A grammar rule LHS &#8212;* RHS can be written as P &#8212;* C1 ...Cn, where P is the mother category, and C1 ...Cn are daughters.
    Let l(C) be the lexical head of the constituent C. The rule probability is then defined as (see also Beil et al. 2002): probability that the (non-head) category C has the lexical head l(C) given that its mother is P with lexical head l(P).
