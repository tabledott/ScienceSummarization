    Word-sense disambiguation is a long-standing problem in computational linguistics (e.g., Kaplan (1950), Yngve (1955), Bar-Hillel (1960), Masterson (1967)), with important implications for a number of practical applications including text-to-speech (TTS), machine translation (MT), information retrieval (IR), and many others.
    The recent interest in computational lexicography has fueled a large body of recent work on this 40-year-old problem, e.g., Black (1988), Brown et al. (1991), Choueka and Lusignan (1985), Clear (1989), Dagan et al.
    (1991), Gale et al. (to appear), Hearst (1991), Lesk (1986), Smadja and McKeown (1990), Walker (1987), Veronis and Ide (1990), Yarowsky (1992), Zernik (1990, 1991).
    Much of this work offers the prospect that a disambiguation system might be able to input unrestricted text and tag each word with the most likely sense with fairly reasonable accuracy and efficiency, j
