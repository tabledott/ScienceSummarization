the meaning of linguistic expressions in terms of their distributional properties.
    The standard view models such properties in terms of two-way structures, that is, matrices coupling target elements (either single words or whatever other linguistic constructions we try to capture distributionally) and contexts.
    In fact, the formal definition of semantic space provided by Pad&#180;o and Lapata (2007) is built around the notion of a matrix M|B|&#215;|T|, with B the set of basis elements representing the contexts used to compare the distributional similarity of the target elements T. This binary structure is inherently suitable for approaches that represent distributional data in terms of unstructured co-occurrence relations between an element and a context.
    The latter can be either documents (Landauer and Dumais 1997; Griffiths, Steyvers, and Tenenbaum 2007) or lexical collocates within a certain distance from the target (Lund and Burgess 1996; Sch&#168;utze 1997; Rapp 2003; Bullinaria and Levy 2007
