tructure constructed with the lexlcal value of the predicate and with all the nodes for its arguments.
  The argument structure for a predicate is its maximal struc- ture.
  An argument is present in the argumefit structure even if it is optional and its optionality is stated in the structure.
  SThe index in "parentheses on a lexical item that produces the structure ncodes the position of the lexical item in the string.
  A simple case of a argument structure is a verb with its subcategorized arguments.
  For example, the verb saw (at position i) generates the following structures (among others): 6 S 8 NPo$ VP V NPI$ V $ I I saw(l) eaw(i) The left structure corresponds to: 0 Jolt.
  1 aaw 2 llary a ( i=  2) and the other to: 0 John  1 saw 2 that  3 Mary  4 le f t  5.
  ( i - - - -2 ) An argument structure can correspond to either one or a set of syntactic surface structures.
  The lexical head will then produce a set of possible trees, one for NP0 saw NP1 and another for whol did  NP 0 see e i ?, for exam- p
