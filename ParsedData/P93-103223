erve in Table 3 that no cues were generated for infrequent verbs or subcategorization patterns).
    In Brent's earlier work (Brent 1991), the error rates reported were for learning from tagged text.
    No error rates for running the system on untagged text were given and no recall figures were given for either system.
    The program doesn't yet have a good way of representing classes of prepositions.
    The applications of this system are fairly obvious.
    For a parsing system, the current subcategorization dictionary could probably be incorporated as is, since the utility of the increase in coverage would almost undoubtedly outweigh problems arising from the incorrect subcategorization frames in the dictionary.
    A lexicographer would want to review the results by hand.
    Nevertheless, the program clearly finds gaps in printed dictionaries (even ones prepared from machine-readable corpora, like Cobuild), as the above example with forbid showed.
    A lexicographer using this program might prefer it
