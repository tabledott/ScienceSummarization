esource conditions, MADA is better than BAMA which is better than REGEX.
    Under large-resource conditions, this difference between techniques is statistically insignificant, though it&#8217;s generally sustained across schemes.
    The baseline for MT05, which is fully in news genre like training data, is considerably higher than MT04 (mix of genres).
    To investigate the effect of different schemes and techniques on different genres, we isolated in MT04 those sentences that come from the editorial and speech genres.
    We performed similar experiments as reported above on this subset of MT04.
    We found that the effect of the choice of the preprocessing technique+scheme was amplified.
    For example, MADA+D2 (with 100% training) on non-news improved the system score 12% over the baseline ST (statistically significant) as compared to 2.4% for news only.
    Further analysis shows that combination of output from all six schemes has a large potential improvement over all of the different systems, sugge
