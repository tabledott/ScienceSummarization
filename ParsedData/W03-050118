    We conducted two evaluations.
    One was an informal human assessment and one was a formal automatic evaluation.
    We compared our current system to a statistical headline generation system we presented at the 2001 DUC Summarization Workshop (Zajic et al., 2002), which we will refer to as HMM Hedge.
    HMM Hedge treats the summarization problem as analogous to statistical machine translation.
    The verbose language, articles, is treated as the result of a concise language, headlines, being transmitted through a noisy channel.
    The result of the transmission is that extra words are added and some morphological variations occur.
    The Viterbi algorithm is used to calculate the most likely unseen headline to have generated the seen article.
    The Viterbi algorithm is biased to favor headline-like characteristics gleaned from observation of human performance of the headline-construction task.
    Since the 2002 Workshop, HMM He
