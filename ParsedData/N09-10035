ke Spanish, Italian, Catalan and Basque), and WordNet version 3.02.
    We used all the relations in MCR (except cooccurrence relations and selectional preference relations) and in WordNet 3.0.
    Given the recent availability of the disambiguated gloss relations for WordNet 3.03, we also used a version which incorporates these relations.
    We will refer to the three versions as MCR16, WN30 and WN30g, respectively.
    Our choice was mainly motivated by the fact that MCR contains tightly aligned wordnets of several languages (see below).
    MCR follows the EuroWordNet design (Vossen, 1998), which specifies an InterLingual Index (ILI) that links the concepts across wordnets of different languages.
    The wordnets for other languages in MCR use the English WordNet synset numbers as ILIs.
    This design allows a decoupling of the relations between concepts (which can be taken to be language independent) and the links from each content word to its corresponding concepts (which is language dependent).
