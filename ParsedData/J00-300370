    Discussion and Issues for Future Research Our approach to dialogue modeling has two major components: statistical dialogue grammars modeling the sequencing of DAs, and DA likelihood models expressing the local cues (both lexical and prosodic) for DAs.
    We made a number of significant simplifications to arrive at a computationally and statistically tractable formulation.
    In this formulation, DAs serve as the hinges that join the various model components, but also decouple these components through statistical independence assumptions.
    Conditional on the DAs, the observations across utterances are assumed to be independent, and evidence of different kinds from the same utterance (e.g., lexical and prosodic) is assumed to be independent.
    Finally, DA types themselves are assumed to be independent beyond a short span (corresponding to the order of the dialogu
