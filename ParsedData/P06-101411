}, and for each sense S E SensesD(w), the sense description of S is disambiguated by applying SSI to dD(S).
    As a result, we obtain a semantic description as a bag of concepts dsem D (S).
    Notice that sense descriptions from both dictionaries are disambiguated with respect to the WordNet sense inventory.
    Second, given a WordNet sense S E SensesWN(w) and an ODE sense S' E SensesODE(w), we define matchSSI(S, S') as a function of the direct relations connecting senses in dsem WN(S) and dsem where c &#8594; c' denotes the existence of a relation edge in the lexical knowledge base between a concept c in the description of S and a concept c' in the description of S'.
    Edges include the WordNet relation set (synonymy, hypernymy, meronymy, antonymy, similarity, nominalization, etc.) and the relatedness edge mentioned above (we adopt only direct relations to maintain a high precision).
    For example, some of the relations found between concepts in dsem contributing to the final value of the function on
