    Figure 6 shows the learning curve.
    A feature set was fixed, while the parameter of the prior was optimized for each model.
    High accuracy was attained even with small data, and the accuracy seemed to be saturated.
    This indicates that we cannot further improve the accuracy simply by increasing training data.
    The exploration of new types of features is necessary for higher accuracy.
    Table 6 shows the accuracy with difference feature sets.
    The accuracy was measured by removing some of the atomic features from the final model.
    The last row denotes the accuracy attained by the preliminary model.
    The numbers in bold type represent that the difference from the final model was significant according to stratified shuffling tests (Cohen, 1995) with p-value &lt; 0.05.
    The results indicate that DIST, COMMA, SPAN, WORD, and POS features contributed to the final accuracy, although the differences were slight.
    In contrast, RULE, SYM, and LE features did not
