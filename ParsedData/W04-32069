    To address the first goal we require as input only a phrasal lexicon of the relevant domain (including single words and multiword expressions).
    Broad coverage lexicons are widely available or may be constructed using known term acquisition techniques, making it a feasible and scalable input requirement.
    We then aim to acquire entailment relations that include any of the lexicon&#8217;s entries.
    The second goal is addressed by a novel algorithm for extracting the most general templates being justified by the data.
    For each lexicon entry, denoted a pivot, our extraction method performs two phases: (a) extract promising anchor sets for that pivot (ASE, Section 3.1), and (b) from sentences containing the anchor sets, extract templates for which an entailment relation holds with the pivot (TE, Section 3.2).
    Examples for verb pivots are: &#8216;acquire&#8217;, &#8216;fall to&#8217;, &#8216;prevent&#8217;.
    We will use the pivot &#8216;prevent&#8217; for examples through this sectio
