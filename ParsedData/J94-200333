ranking for the Cf for Japanese than for English, but this has no effect on the actual algorithm itself since the Cf ranking is a declarative parameter.
  The steps of the algorithm given above can be interleaved to improve computa- tional efficiency.
  A simple implementation is to: ?
  Never propose a Cf that violates linguistic onstraints on contra-indexing.
  (In other words, apply the contra-indexing filter as early as possible to avoid Cb-Cf combinations that will be eliminated by that filter,) ?
  If there are pronouns in an utterance, only propose pronouns as possible Cbs.
  (Collect he pronouns from the proposed Cfs as Cbs, from Rule 1.)
  In addition, it is simple to add additional filters to step (2) of the algorithm.
  For instance, any constraint that is lexically specified such as [?animacy] can be easily applied as a filter.
  It is also possible to pursue a best first strategy by interleaving steps (1), (2), and (3) so that a CONTINUE will be found without extra processing if one exists.
