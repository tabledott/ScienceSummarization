critical to tile success of any [exical acquisition algorithm.
  The Levin-based verbs are already disambiguated by virtue of their membership in different classes.
  The difficulty, then, is to disambiguate and classify verbs that do not occur in Levin.
  Our current direction is to make use of the results of tire first two experiments, i.e., the re- lation t)etween syntactic patterns and semantic lasses, but to use two additional techniques for disambiguation and classification of non-Levin verbs: (1) extraction of synonym sets provided in WordNet (Miller, 1985), an online lexical database containing thesaurus-like rela- tions such as synonymy; and (2) selection of appropri- ate synonyms based on correlations between syntactic information in l ,ongmans Dictionary of Contemporary English (LDOCF,) (Procter, 1978) and semantic lasses in Levin.
  Phe basic idea is to first determine tire most likely candidates for semantic lassification of a verb by examining the verbs synonym sets, many of which in- tersect di
