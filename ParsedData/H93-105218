no information on which to base a decision.
  There are several solutions to both these deficiencies, and they are discussed in Section 7.
  Part of  Speech Differences It is interesting to note the difference in behavior between different parts of speech.
  Verbs, for example, derive more disambiguating information from their objects (.95) than from their subjects (.90).
  Adjectives derive almost all of their disambiguatinginformation fr m the nouns they modify (.98).
  Nouns are best disambiguated bydirectly adjacent adjectives or nouns, with the content word to the left indicating a single sense with 99% precision.
  Verbs appear to be less useful for noun sense disambiguation, although they are relatively better indicators when the noun is their object rather than their subject.
  97% of samples of a given collocation exhibit he same sense, this is the expected precision of a disambiguafion algorithm which assumes one sense per collocation, when applied to new samples of these collocations.
