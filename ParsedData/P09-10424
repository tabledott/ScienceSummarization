roducing a very small number of language-specific constraints that disambiguate arbitrary annotation choices.
    We evaluate our approach by transferring from an English parser trained on the Penn treebank to Bulgarian and Spanish.
    We evaluate our results on the Bulgarian and Spanish corpora from the CoNLL X shared task.
    We see that our transfer approach consistently outperforms unsupervised methods and, given just a few (2 to 7) languagespecific constraints, performs comparably to a supervised parser trained on a very limited corpus (30 - 140 training sentences).
  
  
    At a high level our approach is illustrated in Figure 1(a).
    A parallel corpus is word-level aligned using an alignment toolkit (Gra&#231;a et al., 2009) and the source (English) is parsed using a dependency parser (McDonald et al., 2005).
    Figure 1(b) shows an aligned sentence pair example where dependencies are perfectly conserved across the alignment.
    An edge from English parent p to child c is called conserved if wor
