is is a valuable contribution to systems and algorithms which utilize transformation-based learning at any part of the execution.
  
  
    Much research in natural language processing has gone into the development of rule-based machine learning algorithms.
    These algorithms are attractive because they often capture the linguistic features of a corpus in a small and concise set of rules.
    Transformation-based learning (TBL) (Brill, 1995) is one of the most successful rule-based machine learning algorithms.
    It is a flexible method which is easily extended to various tasks and domains, and it has been applied to a wide variety of NLP tasks, including part of speech tagging (Brill, 1995), noun phrase chunking (Ramshaw and Marcus, 1999), parsing (Brill, 1996), phrase chunking (Florian et al., 2000), spelling correction (Mangu and Brill, 1997), prepositional phrase attachment (Brill and Resnik, 1994), dialog act tagging (Samuel et al., 1998), segmentation and message understanding (Day et al., 1997).
