    This is a 150% improvement over the baseline.
    The number of unique words in opinion pieces is also higher than expected.
    Table 3 compares the precision of the set of unique words to the baseline precision (i.e., the precision of the set of all words that appear in the corpus) in the four WSJ files composing OP1.
    Before this analysis was performed, numbers were removed from the data (we are not interested in the fact that, say, the number 163,213.01 appears just once in the corpus).
    The number of words in each data set and baseline precisions are listed at the bottom of the table.
    The freq columns give total frequencies.
    The +prec columns show the percentage-point improvements in precision over baseline.
    For example, in W9-10, unique words have precision 0.34: 0.18 baseline plus an improveme
