  The patterns fotu~.d for this relation do not tend to uniquely identify it, but can be used to express other relations as well.
  It may be the case that in English the hyponymy relation is especially amenable to this kind of analysis, perhaps due to its "naming" nature.
  However, we have bad some success at iden- tification of more specific relations, such as patterns that indicate certain types of proper nouns.
  We have not implemented an automatic version of this algorithm, primarily because Step 4 is underde- termined.
  2.3 Related Work This section discusses work in acquisition of lexical in- formation from text corpora, although as mentioned earlier, significant work has been done in acquiring lexical information from MRDs.
  (Coates-Stephens 1991) acquires semantic descrip- tions of proper nouns in a system called FUNES.
  FU- NES attempts to fill in frame roles, (e.g., name, age~ origin, position, and works-for, for a person frame) by processing newswire text.
