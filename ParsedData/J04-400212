 set of unknown parameters &#952; that is learned from training data.
    To express the dependence of the model on the parameter set, we use the following notation: A detailed description of different specific statistical alignment models can be found in Brown et al. (1993) and Och and Ney (2003).
    Here, we use the hidden Markov model (HMM) alignment model (Vogel, Ney, and Tillmann 1996) and Model 4 of Brown et al. (1993) to compute the word alignment for the parallel training corpus.
    To train the unknown parameters &#952;, we are given a parallel training corpus consisting of S sentence pairs j(fs, es): s = 1, ... , Sj.
    For each sentence pair (fs, es), the alignment variable is denoted by a = aJ1.
    The unknown parameters &#952; are determined by maximizing the likelihood on the parallel training corpus: This optimization can be performed using the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm (Dempster, Laird, and Rubin 1977).
    For a given sentence pair there are a large number of alignments.
