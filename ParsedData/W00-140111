6;it seems- better than -an alternative such as estimate phase for the second.
    The difference between the two strings is that the first scrambled string, but not the second, can be read off from the dependency tree for the sentence (as shown in Figure 2) without violation of projectivity, i.e., without.
    (roughly 5This shows the importance of the alignment algorithm in the definition of these two metrics: had it. not aligned phase and cost. as a substitution (but each with an empty position in .the other!string-instead),. then time simple string accuracy would have 6 errors instead or 5, but the generation string accuracy would have 3 errors instead of 4. speaking) creating discontinuous constituents.
    It has long been observed (though informally) that the dependency trees of a vast majority of sentences in the languages of the world are projective (see e.g.
    (Mel'auk, 1988)), so that a violation of projectivity is presumably a more severe error than a word order variation that does not violate p
