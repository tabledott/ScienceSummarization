a two-member committee, yields reduction in annotation cost comparable to that of the multi-member committee.
    The two-member version is simpler to implement, has no parameters to tune and is computationally more efficient.
    Second, we generalized the selection scheme giving several alternatives for optimizing the method for a specific task.
    For bigram tagging, comparative evaluation of the different variants of the method showed similar large reductions in annotation cost, suggesting the robustness of the committee-based approach.
    Third, sequential selection, which implicitly models the expected utility of an example relative to the example distribution, worked in general better than batch selection.
    The latter was found to work well only for small batch sizes, where the method mimics sequential selection.
    Increasing batch size (approaching 'pure' batch selection) reduces both accuracy and efficiency.
    Finally, we studied the effect of sample selection on the size of the trained mode
