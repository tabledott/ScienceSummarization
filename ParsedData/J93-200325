n the English string to which the first position in the French string is connected, and so on.
    As we step through the French string, at each point we make our next choice given our complete knowledge of the English string and of all our previous choices as to the details of the French string and its alignment.
    The conditional probabilities on the right-hand side of Equation (4) cannot all be taken as independent parameters because there are too many of them.
    In Model 1, we assume that Pr(mle) is independent of e and m; that Pr(ajlail-1,fil-17 rrt,e), depends only on 1,.the length of the English string, and therefore must be (1 + 1)-1; and that Pr(fin, e) depends only on f and eaj.
    The parameters, then, are &#8364; Pr(m le), I and t(le) E Pr(fi e) , which we call the translation probability of fl given ea,.
    We think of E as some small, fixed number.
    The distribution of M, the length of the French string, is unnormalized but this is a minor technical issue of no significance to our compu
