stively generating and testing all possible groups of k words, with k varying from 1 to some maximum length of the translation in.
    Our concern is whether our algorithm will actually generate all valid translations&#8212; those with final Dice coefficient above the threshold&#8212;while it is clear that the exhaustive algorithm would.'
    Does the filtering process we use sometimes cause our algorithm to omit a valid translation?
    In other words, is there a possibility that a group of words has high similarity with the source collocation (above the threshold) and at the same time one or more of its subgroups have similarity below the threshold?
    In the worst case, as we show below, the answer to this question is affirmative.
    However, if only very few translations are missed in practice, the algorithm is indeed a good choice.
    In this section, we first show why the filtering we use is necessary and how it can miss valid translations, and then present the results of Monte Carlo simulation exper
