onstituent parser into an analysis of the complete utterance.
    It is at this point that the system recognizes whether the sentence was a simple complete sentence, an isolated sentence fragment, a run-on sentence, or a sequence of related fragments.
    Many systems (Carbonell and Hayes, 1983), (Hobbs et al., 1992), (Seneff, 1992), (Stallard and Bobrow, 1992) have added robustness with a similar postprocessing phase.
    The approach taken in Gemini differs in that the utterance grammar uses the same syntactic and semantic rule formalism used by the constituent grammar.
    Thus, the same kinds of logical forms built during constituent parsing are the output of utterance parsing, with the same sortal constraints enforced.
    For example, an utterance consisting of a sequence of modifier, fragments (like on Tuesday at three o'clock on United) is interpreted as a conjoined property of a flight, because the only sort of thing in the ATIS domain that can be on Tuesday at three o'clock on United is a flight.
