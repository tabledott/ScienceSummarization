e accomplished using the IIS algorithm.
    In feature selection, we need to use random sampling to find the initial weight for a candidate feature, and in weight adjustment we need to use random sampling to solve the weight equation.
    The random sampling method that DD&amp;L used is not appropriate for sets of dags, but we can solve that problem by using the Metropolis-Hastings method instead.
    Open questions remain.
    First, random sampling is notorious for being slow, and it remains to be shown whether the approach proposed here will be practicable.
    I expect practicability to be quite sensitive to the choice of grammar&#8212;the more the grammar's
  
  
    in which 71- is the distribution we wish to sample from (q, in our notation) and g(x,y) is the proposal probability: the probability that the input sampler will propose y if the previous configuration was x.
    The case we consider is a special case in which the proposal probability is independent of x: the proposal probability g(x, y) is,
