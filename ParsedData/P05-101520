te this &#8220;flip&#8221; as showing that in the four-class scenario, item and label similarities provide a richer source of information relative to class-specific characteristics, especially since for the non-majority classes there is less data available; whereas in the three-class setting the categories are better modeled as quite distinct entities.
    However, the three-class results for metric labeling on top of OVA and regression (shown in Figure 2 by black versions of the corresponding icons) show that employing explicit similarities always improves results, often to a significant degree, and yields the best overall accuracies.
    Thus, we can in fact effectively exploit similarities in the three-class case.
    Additionally, in both the three- and four- class scenarios, metric labeling often brings the performance of the weaker base method up to that of the stronger one (as indicated by the &#8220;disappearance&#8221; of upward triangles in corresponding table rows), and never hurts performance sign
