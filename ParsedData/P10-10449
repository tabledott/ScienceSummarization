rformed on a set of human-plausibility judgments obtaining impressive results against Keller and Lapata&#8217;s (2003) Web hit-count based system.
    Van Durme and Gildea (2009) proposed applying LDA to general knowledge templates extracted using the KNEXT system (Schubert and Tong, 2003).
    In contrast, our work uses LinkLDA and focuses on modeling multiple arguments of a relation (e.g., the subject and direct object of a verb).
  
  
    We present a series of topic models for the task of computing selectional preferences.
    These models vary in the amount of independence they assume between a1 and a2.
    At one extreme is IndependentLDA, a model which assumes that both a1 and a2 are generated completely independently.
    On the other hand, JointLDA, the model at the other extreme (Figure 1) assumes both arguments of a specific extraction are generated based on a single hidden variable z. LinkLDA (Figure 2) lies between these two extremes, and as demonstrated in Section 4, it is the best model for ou
