and 400 words summaries.
    The relative performance of ROUGE measures followed the pattern of the 100 words multi-document summarization task.
    Comparing the results in Table 3 with Tables 1 and 2, we found that correlation values in the multidocument tasks rarely reached high 90% except in long summary tasks.
    One possible explanation of this outcome is that we did not have large amount of samples for the multi-document tasks.
    In the single document summarization tasks we had over 100 samples; while we only had about 30 samples in the multi-document tasks.
    The only tasks that had over 30 samples was from DUC 2002 and the correlations of ROUGE measures with human judgments on the 100 words summary task were much better and more stable than similar tasks in DUC 2001 and 2003.
    Statistically stable human judgments of system performance might not be obtained due to lack of samples and this in turn caused instability of correlation analyses.
