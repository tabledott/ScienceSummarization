lyzed the effect of a det)endence on c,b_ ~ or .fj.
  As a dependence on all English words wouht result ill a huge mmflmr of aligmnent 1)arameters we use as (Brown et el., 1993) equivalence classes G over tlle English and the French words.
  Here G is a mallping of words to (:lasses.
  This real)ping is trained au- tonmtically using a modification of the method de- scrilled ill (Kneser and Ney, 1991.).
  We use 50 classes in our exlmriments.
  The most general form of align- ment distribution that we consider in the ItMM is p(aj - a.+_, la(%), G(f~), h - Extension:  empty  word In the original formulation of the HMM alignment model there ix no empty word which generates Fren(:h words having no directly aligned English word.
  A direct inchlsion of an eml/ty wor(t ill the HMM model by adding all c o as in (Brown et al., 1.993) is not 1)ossit)le if we want to model the j un lp distances i - i, as the I)osition i = 0 of tim emt)ty word is chosen arbitrarily.
  Therefore, to introduce the eml)ty word we extend th
