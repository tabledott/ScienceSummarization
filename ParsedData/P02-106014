    In this section, we will report the experimental results of our system for English NER on MUC-6 and MUC-7 NE shared tasks, as shown in Table 6, and then for the impact of training data size on performance using MUC-7 training data.
    For each experiment, we have the MUC dry-run data as the held-out development data and the MUC formal test data as the held-out test data.
    For both MUC-6 and MUC-7 NE tasks, Table 7 shows the performance of our system using MUC evaluation while Figure 1 gives the comparisons of our system with others.
    Here, the precision (P) measures the number of correct NEs in the answer file over the total number of NEs in the answer file and the recall (R) measures the number of correct NEs in the answer file over the total number of NEs in the key file while F-measure is the weighted harmonic mean of precision and recall: with &#946;2 =1.
    It shows that the performance is significantly better than reported b
