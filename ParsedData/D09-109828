    We evaluated the impact of the large similarity matrix on a set expansion task and found that the Web similarity matrix gave a large performance boost over a state-of-the-art expansion algorithm using Wikipedia.
    Finally, we release to the community a testbed for experimentally analyzing automatic set expansion, which includes a large collection of nearly random entity sets extracted from Wikipedia and over 22,000 randomly sampled seed expansion trials.
