  Finding all the NPs that might participate in coreference becomes even harder if the annotation scheme is extended to cover event coreference (noted in the &amp;quot;wish list&amp;quot; in Section 1.4 of the TD) since it is often extremely difficult to determine which events can serve as antecedents (Hirschman and Chinchor 1997): Examples of this kind suggest that one markable (e.g., an event) can give rise to another (e.g., the negation of the event).
    A complication of a similarly algebraic flavor arises if &amp;quot;discontinuous elements, including conjoined elements&amp;quot; are covered, as when a plural pronoun corefers with a combination of previously occurring NPs (Hirschman and Chirtchor 1997, section 1.4; see Garside, Leech, and McEriery 11997] for a proposal).
    Note especially that annotators would have to be on guard for the possibility of different combinations of markables coreferring to each other.
    A corpus, for example, can easily contain NPs A, B, C, and D for which Referent(A) U
