998) and Wright (1998) were based on Map Task.
    The VERBMOBIL corpus consists of two-party scheduling dialogues.
    A number of the DA modeling algorithms described below were developed for VERBMOBIL, including those of Mast et al. (1996), Warnke et al.
    (1997), Reithinger et al. (1996), Reithinger and Klesen (1997), and Samuel, Carberry, and Vijay-Shanker (1998).
    The ATR Conference corpus is a subset of a larger ATR Dialogue database consisting of simulated dialogues between a secretary and a questioner at international conferences.

    Table 13 shows the most commonly used versions of the tag sets from those three tasks.

    Their tag sets are also generally smaller, but some of the same problems of balance occur.
    For example, in the Map Task domain, 33% of the words occur in 1 of t
