 not capture syntactic information.
    We believe that higher order n-gram models or class n-gram models can achieve better performance by capturing both semantic and syntactic information.
    This is particularly important for the tasks we are interested in, when the vocabulary (i.e. topic) and grade level are not necessarily well-matched.
  
  
    Our work is currently focused on a corpus obtained from Weekly Reader, an educational newspaper with versions targeted at different grade levels (Weekly Reader, 2004).
    These data include a variety of labeled non-fiction topics, including science, history, and current events.
    Our corpus consists of articles from the second, third, fourth, and fifth grade editions of the newspaper.
    We design classifiers to distinguish each of these four categories.
    This corpus contains just under 2400 articles, distributed as shown in Table 1.
    Additionally, we have two corpora consisting of articles for adults and corresponding simplified versions for children
