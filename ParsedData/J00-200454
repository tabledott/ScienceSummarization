task were lower than their counterparts on the single-best translation task, because it is more difficult for any statistical method to correctly model the less common translations.
    The &amp;quot;best&amp;quot; translations are usually the most common.
    6.1.2 Experiment 2.
    To study how the benefits of the various biases vary with training corpus size, I evaluated Models A, B, C, and 1 on the whole distribution translation task, after training them on three different-size subsets of the Bible bitext.
    The first subset consisted of only the 250 verse pairs in the gold standard.
    The second subset included these 250 plus another random sample of 2,250 for a total of 2,500, an order of magnitude larger than the first subset.
    The third subset contained all 29,614 verse pairs in the Bible bitext, roughly an order of magnitude larger than the second subset.
    All models were compared to the five gold standard annotations, and the scores were averaged over the two directions of translation, as
