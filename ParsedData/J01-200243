l accuracy for the base taggers.
    In addition, we can observe the agreement between the systems, from which we can estimate how much gain we can possibly expect from combination.
    The application of the various combination systems, finally, shows us how much of the projected gain is actually realized.
    An additional benefit of training four popular tagging systems under controlled conditions on several corpora is an experimental comparison of their accuracy.
    Table 2 lists the accuracies as measured on the test set.'
    We see that TBL achieves the lowest accuracy on all data sets.
    MBT is always better than TBL, but is outperformed by both MXP and HMM.
    On two data sets (LOB and Wotan) the Hidden Markov Model system (TnT) is better than the maximum entropy system (MXPOST).
    On the other two (WSJ and WotanLite) MXPOST is the better system.
    In all cases, except the difference between MXP and HMM on LOB, the differences are statistically significant (p &lt; 0.05, McNemar's chi-squared
