 testing step, entities are again identified using the named entity tagger.
    This time, every pair of entities appearing together in a sentence is considered a potential relation instance, and whenever those entities appear together, features are extracted on the sentence and added to a feature vector for that entity pair.
    For example, if a pair of entities occurs in 10 sentences in the test set, and each sentence has 3 features extracted from it, the entity pair will have 30 associated features.
    Each entity pair in each sentence in the test corpus is run through feature extraction, and the regression classifier predicts a relation name for each entity pair based on the features from all of the sentences in which it appeared.
    Consider the location-contains relation, imagining that in Freebase we had two instances of this relation: (Virginia, Richmond) and (France, Nantes).
    As we encountered sentences like &#8216;Richmond, the capital of Virginia&#8217; and &#8216;Henry&#8217;s Edict of Nant
