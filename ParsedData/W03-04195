 an example sentence: Each line contains four fields: the word, its partof-speech tag, its chunk tag and its named entity tag.
    Words tagged with O are outside of named entities and the I-XXX tag is used for words inside a named entity of type XXX.
    Whenever two entities of type XXX are immediately next to each other, the first word of the second entity will be tagged B-XXX in order to show that it starts another entity.
    The data contains entities of four types: persons (PER), organizations (ORG), locations (LOC) and miscellaneous names (MISC).
    This tagging scheme is the IOB scheme originally put forward by Ramshaw and Marcus (1995).
    We assume that named entities are non-recursive and non-overlapping.
    When a named entity is embedded in another named entity, usually only the top level entity has been annotated.
    Table 2 contains an overview of the number of named entities in each data file.
    The performance in this task is measured with F&#946;=1 rate: Table 3: Main features used by
