 its deep and surface syntax, all of which were used as triggers for revision.
    The three steps of the fusion lattice computation are as follows: selection of the basis tree, augmentation of the tree with alternative verbalizations, and pruning of 7 The complexity of our algorithm is polynomial in the number of nodes.
    Let n1 denote the number of nodes in the first tree, and n2 denote the number of nodes in the second tree.
    We assume that the branching factor of a parse tree is bounded above by a constant.
    The function NodeCompare is evaluated only once on each node pair.
    Therefore, it is evaluated n1 &#215; n2 times totally.
    Each evaluation is computed in constant time, assuming that values of the function for node children are known.
    Since we use memoization, the total time of the procedure is O(n1 &#215; n2).
    Two dependency trees and their alignment tree.
    Solid lines represent aligned edges.
    Dotted and dashed lines represent unaligned edges of the theme sentences. the
