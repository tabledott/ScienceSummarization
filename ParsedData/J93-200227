 As before, assume that an occurrence of a -S verb is followed by a cue for S with probability 71-.
    Also as before, assume that for each +S verb V. the probability that an occurrence of V is followed by a cue for S is greater than ir&#8222;.
    It is useful to think of the verbs in the corpus as analogous to a large bag of coins with various biases, or probabilities of coming up heads.
    The only assumption about the distribution of biases is that there is some definite but unknown minimum bias 7r&#8222;.5 Determining whether or not a verb appears in frame S is analogous to determining, for some randomly selected coin, whether its bias is greater than 7r&#8222;.
    The only available evidence comes from selecting a number of coins at random and flipping them.
    The previous section showed how this can be done given an estimate of 7r_s.
    Suppose a series of coins is drawn at random from the bag.
    Each coin is flipped N times.
    It is then assigned to a histogram bin representing the number of
