 inflated precisions: the modified unigram precision is 2/2, and the modified bigram precision is 1/1.
    Traditionally, precision has been paired with recall to overcome such length-related problems.
    However, BLEU considers multiple reference translations, each of which may use a different word choice to translate the same source word.
    Furthermore, a good candidate translation will only use (recall) one of these possible choices, but not all.
    Indeed, recalling all choices leads to a bad translation.
    Here is an example.
    The first candidate recalls more words from the references, but is obviously a poorer translation than the second candidate.
    Thus, naive recall computed over the set of all reference words is not a good measure.
    Admittedly, one could align the reference translations to discover synonymous words and compute recall on concepts rather than words.
    But, given that reference translations vary in length and differ in word order and syntax, such a computation is compli
