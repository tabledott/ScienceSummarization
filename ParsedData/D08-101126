 that the IHMMbased hypothesis alignment method gave superior results on the NIST MT08 C2E test set compared to the TER-based method.
    Moreover, we show that our system combination method can scale up to combining more systems and produce a better output that has a case sensitive BLEU score of 34.82, which is 3.9 BLEU points better than the best official submission of MT08.
