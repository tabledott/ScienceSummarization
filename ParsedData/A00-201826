ificantly better than the tree-bank parser.
  
  
    We have presented a lexicalized Markov grammar parsing model that achieves (using the now standard training/testing/development sections of the Penn treebank) an average precision/recall of 91.1% on sentences of length &lt; 40 and 89.5% on sentences of length &lt; 100.
    This corresponds to an error reduction of 13% over the best previously published single parser results on this test set, those of Collins [9].
    That the previous three best parsers on this test [5,9,17] all perform within a percentage point of each other, despite quite different basic mechanisms, led some researchers to wonder if there might be some maximum level of parsing performance that could be obtained using the treebank for training, and to conjecture that perhaps we were at it.
    The results reported here disprove this conjecture.
    The results of [13] achieved by combining the aforementioned three-best parsers also suggest that the limit on tree-bank trained parsers is mu
