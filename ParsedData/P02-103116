cognizers for various entities, which were then cascaded to form recognizers for higher-level relations, while (Ray and Craven, 2001) used low-level &amp;quot;chunks&amp;quot; from a general-purpose syntactic analyzer as observations in a trained Hidden Markov Model.
    Such an approach has a large advantage in speed, as the extensive search of modern statistical parsers is avoided.
    It is also possible that this approach may be more robust to error than parsers.
    Although we expect the attachment decisions made by a parser to be relevant to determining whether a constituent of a sentence is an argument of a particular predicate, and what its relation to the predicate is, those decisions may be so frequently incorrect that a much simpler system can do just as well.
    In this section we test this hypothesis by comparing a system which is given only a flat, &amp;quot;chunked&amp;quot; representation of the input sentence to the parse-tree-based systems described above.
    In this representation, base-
