l increase.
    More important in our eyes, though, is the flexibility of the maximum-entropy-inspired model.
    Though in some respects not quite as flexible as true maximum entropy, it is much simpler and, in our estimation, has benefits when it comes to smoothing.
    Ultimately it is this flexibility that let us try the various conditioning events, to move on to a Markov grammar approach, and to try several Markov grammars of different orders, without significant programming.
    Indeed, we initiated this line of work in an attempt to create a parser that would be flexible enough to allow modifications for parsing down to more semantic levels of detail.
    It is to this project that our future parsing work will be devoted.
