 no information about the word itself.
    In many languages, including English, word endings give strong indicators of the part of speech.
    Furthermore, capitalization information, when available, can help to indicate whether a word is a proper noun.
    We have developed a novel probabilistic model that takes into account features of the word in determining the likelihood of the word given a part of speech.
    This was used instead of the &amp;quot;word emit&amp;quot; probabilities p(w, I t,) for known words.
    To estimate p(w, I t,) for an unknown word, we first determined the features we thought would distinguish parts of speech.
    There are four independent categories of features: inflectional endings, derivational endings, hyphenation, and capitalization; these are not necessarily independent, though we are treating them as such for our tests.
    Our initial test had 3 inflectional endings (-ed, -s, -ing), and 32 derivational endings (including -ion, -al, -ive, -1y).
    Capitalization has four
