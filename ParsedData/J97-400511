 By contrast, the set of graphs admitted by an attribute-value grammar G is highly constrained.
    If one changes an arbitrary node label in a dag admitted by G, one does not necessarily obtain a new dag admitted by G. Hence, Gibbs sampling is not applicable.
    However, I will show that a more general sampling method, the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm, can be used to compute the maximum-likelihood estimate of the parameters of AV grammars.
  
  
    Let us begin by examining stochastic context-free grammars (SCFGs) and asking why the natural extension of SCFG parameter estimation to attribute-value grammars fails.
    A point of terminology: I will use the term grammar to refer to an unweighted grammar, be it a context-free grammar or attribute-value grammar.
    A grammar equipped with weights (and other periphenalia as necessary) I will refer to as a model.
    Occasionally I will also use model to refer to the weights themselves, or the probability distribution they define.
    Throughout we will use th
