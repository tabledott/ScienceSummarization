piece, forgetting now about all the other aspects such as change of word order, etc.) the main bulk of this kind of work has been achieved, the remainder requiring only some slight additional effort.&amp;quot; (Bar-Hillel, 1960, p. 163) outperform this baseline system, though not all such systems actually do.
    In fact, Yarowsky (1992) falls below the baseline for one of the twelve words (issue), although perhaps, we needn't be too concerned about this one deviation.8 There are, of course, a number of problems with this estimate of the baseline.
    First, the baseline system is not operational, at least as we have defined it.
    Ideally, the baseline system ought to try to estimate the most likely sense for each word in the vocabulary and then assign that sense to each instance of the word in the test set.
    Unfortunately, since it isn't clear just how this estimation should be accomplished, we decided to &amp;quot;cheat&amp;quot; and let the baseline system peek at the test set and &amp;quot;estimate&a
