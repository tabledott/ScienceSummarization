me constituent which dominates the NP until the role of that NP itself has been determined.
    In the specific case of (2), the parser will attach &amp;quot;my aunt&amp;quot; as the object of the verb &amp;quot;drove&amp;quot; so that it can decide where to attach the PP beginning with &amp;quot;from&amp;quot;.
    Only after it is too late will the parser see the genitive marker on &amp;quot;Peoria's&amp;quot; and boggle.
    While one could attempt to overcome this particular motivation for the two-stage parsing of NPs with some variant of the notion of pseudo-attachment (first used in [Church 801), this and related approaches have their problems too, as Church notes.
    Potential pseudo-attachment solutions aside, the upshot is that sentences like (2) will cause deterministic tree building parsers to garden path.
    However, it is our strong intuition that such cases are not &amp;quot;garden paths&amp;quot;; we believe that such cases should be analyzed correctly by a deterministic parser rather than by
