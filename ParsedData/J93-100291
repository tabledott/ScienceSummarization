 given training corpus and predefined category set, following Lan i and Young (1990) and Pereira and Schabes (1992).
    This approach has the advantage that the resulting grammar defines a well-defined set of analyses for which rules of compositional interpretation might be developed.
    However, the technique is limited in several ways; firstly, such grammars are restricted to small (maximum about 15 nonterminal) CNF CFGs because of the computational cost of iterative re-estimation with an algorithm polynomial in sentence length and nonterminal category size; and secondly, because some form of supervised training will be essential if the analyses assigned by the grammar are to be linguistically motivated.
    Immediate prospects for applying such techniques to realistic NL grammars do not seem promising&#8212;the ANLT backbone grammar discussed in Section 4 contains almost 500 categories.
    However, Briscoe and Waegner (1992) describe an experiment in which, firstly, Baum-Welch re-estimation was used in
