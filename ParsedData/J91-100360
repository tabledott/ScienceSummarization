 part of the reader and fit with the role of metonymy shown in Figures 1 and 4.
    Each metonymic inference rule has a left-hand side and a right-hand side.
    The lefthand side is the topmost statement and is of the form metonymic_inference_rule(Source, Target).
    The right-hand side consists of the remaining statements.
    These statements represent the conceptual relationship and the direction of inference, except for the bottom most one, which controls the substitution of the discovered metonym for either the source or target: this statement is always a call to find a new sense-network path.
    This rule represents PROPERTY FOR WHOLE, which is source-driven.
    Statement [1] represents the conceptual relationship and direction of inference.
    The conceptual relationship is that the source is a property possessed by the whole in a propertywhole relation.
    The inference is driven from the source: find_cell searches through the source's list of cells for one referring to a &amp;quot;whole&amp;quo
