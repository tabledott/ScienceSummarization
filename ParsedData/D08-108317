    For brevity, we refer to both variations collectively as CCI-COMPO.
  
  
    The experiments below evaluate our heuristic- and learning-based methods for subsentential sentiment analysis (&#167; 4.1).
    In addition, we explore the role of context by expanding the boundaries of the sentiment-bearing expressions (&#167; 4.2).
    For evaluation, we use the Multi-Perspective Question Answering (MPQA) corpus (Wiebe et al., 2005), which consists of 535 newswire documents manually annotated with phrase-level subjectivity information.
    We evaluate on all strong (i.e., intensity
