orpus consists of a set of concatenated segments randomly sampled from the Brown corpus.
    The length of the segments in this corpus ranges from three to eleven sentences.
    It is important to note that the lexical transitions in these concatenated texts are very sharp, since the segments come from texts written in widely varying language styles on completely different topics.
    We use the Pk and WindowDiff measures to evaluate our system (Beeferman et al., 1999; Pevzner and Hearst, 2002).
    The Pk measure estimates the probability that a randomly chosen pair of words within a window of length k words is inconsistently classified.
    The WindowDiff metric is a variant of the Pk measure, which penalizes false positives on an equal basis with near misses.
    Both of these metrics are defined with respect to the average segment length of texts and exhibit high variability on real data.
    We follow Choi (2000) and compute the mean segment length used in determining the parameter k on each reference te
