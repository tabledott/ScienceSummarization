on is that when Nt,l is very small, the estimation is not accurate.
    The challenge here is that pt(y|xt,u k ; B) is unknown to us, thus we need to estimate it.
    One possibility is to approximate it with a model B&#65533; learned from Ds and Dt,l.
    For example, we can set pt(y|x, B) = p(y|x; B).
    Alternatively, we can also set pt(y|x, B) to 1 if y = arg maxy0 p(y'|x; B) and 0 otherwise.
  
  
    The theoretical analysis we give in Section 2 suggests that one way to solve the domain adaptation problem is through instance weighting.
    We propose a framework that incorporates instance pruning in Section 2.2 and the three approximations in Section 2.3.
    Before we show the formal framework, we first introduce some weighting parameters and explain the intuitions behind these parameters.
    First, for each (xsi , ysi ) E Ds, we introduce a parameter &#945;i to indicate how likely pt(ys i |xsi) is close to ps(ysi |xsi ).
    Large &#945;i means the two probabilities are close, and therefore we can t
