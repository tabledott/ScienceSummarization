 since they are conjugate to multinomials, which simplifies both the mathematical and computational aspects of theproblem.
			The precise form of the model we investi gated is: ?y | ?y ? Dir(?y) ?y | ?x ? Dir(?x) yi | yi?1 = y ? Multi(?y) xi | yi = y ? Multi(?y)Informally, ?y controls the sparsity of the state-to state transition probabilities while ?x controls thesparsity of the state-to-observation emission proba bilities.
			As ?x approaches zero the prior strongly prefers models in which each hidden state emitsas few words as possible.
			This captures the intu ition that most word types only belong to one POS,since the minimum number of non-zero state-toobservation transitions occurs when each observa tion type is emitted from only one state.
			Similarly, as ?y approaches zero the state-to-state transitions become sparser.There are two main techniques for Bayesian esti mation of such models: Markov Chain Monte Carlo(MCMC) and Variational Bayes (VB).
