-class instead of 3-class labeling because it is harder.
    The dataset is divided into four author-specific corpora, containing 1770, 902, 1307, and 1027 documents.
    We ran experiments individually for each author.
    Each document is represented as a 10, 11 word-presence vector, normalized to sum to 1.
    We systematically vary labeled set size |L |E 10.9n, 800, 400, 200,100, 50, 25,12, 6} to observe the effect of semi-supervised learning.
    |L |= 0.9n is included to match 10-fold cross validation used by (Pang and Lee, 2005).
    For each |L |we run 20 trials where we randomly split the corpus into labeled and test (unlabeled) sets.
    We ensure that all four classes are represented in each labeled set.
    The same random splits are used for all methods, allowing paired t-tests for statistical significance.
    All reported results are average test set accuracy.
    We compare our graph-based semi-supervised method with two previously studied methods: regression and metric labeling as in (Pang an
