related with readability is the S-N transition (0.31) in which the subject of one sentence does not appear at all in the following sentence.
    Of course, it is difficult to interpret the entity grid features one by one, since they are interdependent and probably it is the interaction of features (relative proportions of transitions) that capture overall readability patterns.
    Discourse relations are believed to be a major factor in text coherence.
    We computed another language model which is over discourse relations instead of words.
    We treat each text as a bag of relations rather than a bag of words.
    Each relation is annotated for both its sense and how it is realized (implicit or explicit).
    For example, one text might contain {Implicit Comparison, Explicit Temporal, NoRel}.
    We computed the probability of each of our articles according to a multinomial model, where the probability of a text with n relation tokens and k relation types is: P(n) is the probability of an article having le
