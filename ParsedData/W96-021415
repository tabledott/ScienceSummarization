tch for the most probable derivation, versus 96% correct for the most probable parse.
    This is not surprising, since each parse tree can be derived by many different derivations; the most probable parse criterion takes all possible derivations into account.
    Similarly, the Maximum Constituents Parse is also derived from the sum of many different derivations.
    Furthermore, although the Maximum Constituents Parse should not do as well on the exact match criterion, it should perform even better on the percent constituents correct criterion.
    We have previously performed a detailed comparison between the most likely parse, and the Maximum Constituents Parse for Probabilistic Context Free Grammars (Goodman, 1996); we showed that the two have very similar performance on a broad range of measures, with at most a 10% difference in error rate (i.e., a change from 10% error rate to 9% error rate.)
    We therefore think that it is reasonable to use a Maximum Constituents Parser to parse the DOP model.
