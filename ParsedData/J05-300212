to be useful for determining which sentences are important for single-document summarization (Barzilay and Elhadad 1997; Silber and McCoy 2002).
    In the multidocument scenario, lexical chains can be adapted for theme ranking based on the salience of theme sentences within their original documents.
    Specifically, a theme that has many sentences ranked high by lexical chains as important for a single-document summary is, in turn, given a higher salience score for the multidocument summary.
    In our implementation, a salience score for a theme is computed as the sum of lexical chain scores of each sentence in a theme.
    Once we filter out the themes that have a low rank, the next task is to order the selected themes into coherent text.
    Our ordering strategy aims to capture chronological order of the main events and ensure coherence.
    To implement this strategy in MultiGen, we select for each theme the sentence which has the earliest publication time (theme time stamp).
    To increase the cohere
