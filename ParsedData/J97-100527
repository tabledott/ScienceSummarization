r, as shown by the the fact that segments varied in size from 1 to 49 phrases in length (Avg.
    = 5.9).
    The assumption of independence is important for motivating statistical analyses of how probable the observed distributions are.
    Figure 3 shows two bar charts.
    The one on the left gives the results for the full narrative excerpted in Figure 1.
    The x-axis is the number of subjects, from 0 to 7.
    The y-axis, from top to bottom, corresponds to the potential boundary locations, with prosodic phrase locations numbered as in Figure 2.
    Each horizontal bar thus represents the number of subjects assigning a boundary at a particular interphrase location.
    Interestingly, there were 6 segment boundaries identified by at least five subjects, yielding 7 segments that correspond closely to the 7 sequential episodes that Chafe (1980) used to describe the movie.
    The first 5 segments correspond to the first 5 episodes.
    The 6th segment corresponds to the 6th episode plus the beginning of the
