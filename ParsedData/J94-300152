oded in rewriting rules.
    For example, Kenstowicz and Kisseberth give the following rule to describe the devoicing of final obstruents in German and Russian: [+obstruent] -4 [-voiced] / # We will consider the feature notation exemplified here shortly.
    For the moment, it can be taken as equivalent to a set of rules whose effect is to replace any segment that is classified as an obstruent by its unvoiced equivalent before the boundary symbol that marks the end of a word.
    It accounts for the phonological realization of the Russian form xleb 'bread' as xlep.
    The boundary symbol # is special in the rule formalism in that it can only appear in the context parts of a rule, never in the input or output patterns, and it never matches an element that appears explicitly in the string.
    Although boundary-context rules require distinctive mathematical treatment, we show below that they also denote only regular string relations.
    As we have said, we take it that each rule in a grammar will be annotated
