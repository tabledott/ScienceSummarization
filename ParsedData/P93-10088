t in a semantic rule, each of the constituents mentioned in the phrase structure skeleton is associated with a logical form.
    Thus, the semantics for the rule above is Here the semantics of the mother s is just the semantics of the daughter s with the illocutionary force marker whq wrapped around it.
    In addition, the semantics of the s gap's np's gapsem has been unified with the semantics of the wh-phrase.
    Through a succession of unifications this will end up assigning the wh-phrase's semantics to the gap position in the argument structure of the s. Although each semantic rule must be keyed to a preexisting syntactic rule, there is no assumption of rule-to-rule uniqueness.
    Any number of semantic rules may be written for a single syntactic rule.
    We discuss some further details of the semantics in section 2.6 The constituent grammar used in Gemini contains 243 syntactic rules, and 315 semantic rules.
    Syntactic coverage on the 5875-utterance training set was 94.2%, and on the 756-utterance
