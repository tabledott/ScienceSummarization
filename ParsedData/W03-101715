as ADJ and the set of negative seeds as ADJ.
    We then calculate a modified log-likelihood ratio POS for a word with part of speech POS (&#10018;can be adjective, adverb, noun or verb) as the ratio of its collocation frequency with ADJ and ADJ within a sentence, where Freq&#10007;all POS ADJ represents the collocation frequency of all words&#10007;all of part of speech POS with ADJ and is a smoothing constant ( in our case).
    We used Brill&#8217;s tagger (Brill, 1995) to obtain part-of-speech information.
    As our measure of semantic orientation across an entire sentence we used the average per word loglikelihood scores defined in the preceding section.
    To determine the orientation of an opinion sentence, all that remains is to specify cutoffs and so that sentences for which the average log-likelihood score exceeds are classified as positive opinions, sentences with scores lower than are classified as negative opinions, and sentences with in-between scores are treated as neutral opinions.
