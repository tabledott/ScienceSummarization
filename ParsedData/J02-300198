ude multiple frames being invoked by many words, as well as an inheritance hierarchy of frames and a more detailed representation of each frame&#8217;s meaning.
    In this section, we examine the FrameNet data by holding out an entire frame for testing and using other frames from the same general semantic domain for training.
    Recall from Figure 1 that domains like COMMUNICATION include frames like CONVERSATION, QUESTIONING, and STATEMENT.
    Because of the variation in difficulty between different frames and the dependence of the results on which frames are held out for testing, we used a jackknifing methodology.
    Each frame was used in turn as test data, with all other frames used as training data.
    The results in Table 20 show average results over the entire data set.
    Combining the distributions gives a system based on the (very restricted) backoff lattice of Figure 13.
    This system achieves performance of 51.0%, compared to 82.1% for the original system and 79.4% for the within-frame gen
