  Formalism-Independent Parser Evaluation with CCG and DepBank
  
    A key question facing the parsing community is how to compare parsers which use different grammar formalisms and produce different output.
    Evaluating a parser on the same resource used to create it can lead to non-comparable accuracy scores and an over-optimistic view of parser performance. this paper we evaluate a on DepBank, and demonstrate the difficulties in converting the parser output into Dep- Bank grammatical relations.
    In addition we present a method for measuring the effectiveness of the conversion, which provides an upper bound on parsing accuracy.
    The obtains an F-score of 81.9% on labelled dependencies, against an upper of 84.8%.
    We compare the against the outperformover 5% overall and on the majority of dependency types.
  
  
    Parsers have been developed for a variety of grammar formalisms, for example HPSG (Toutanova et al., 2002; Malouf and van Noord, 2004), LFG (Kaplan et al., 2004; Cahill et al., 2004)
