ional level, utterance (a) is a CONDITION for (b), but On one reading of the discourse there is an ENABLEMENT relation at the intentional level between (a) and (b), while on another reading there is a MOTIVATION relation.
    Moreover, the nucleus/satellite structure of the informational level relation is maintained only on one of these readings.
    Utterance (b) is the nucleus of the CONDITION relation, and, similarly, it is the nucleus of the ENABLEMENT relation on the first reading.
    However, on the second reading, it is utterance (a) that is the nucleus of the MOTIVATION relation.
    Just as one cannot always recover intentional relations from informational ones, neither can one always recover informational relations from intentional ones.
    In the second reading of the current example, the intentional level MOTIVATION relation is realized first with a CONDITION relation between (a) and (b), and, later, with an OTHERWISE relation in (f) and (g).
  
  
    We have illustrated that natural language i
