t translations in a target language, this introduces a &#8220;data-oriented&#8221; view to sense distinction and serves to add an element of objectivity to sense definition.
    Secondly, WSD has been criticized as addressing an isolated problem without being grounded to any real application.
    By defining sense distinction in terms of different target translations, the outcome of word sense disambiguation of a source language word is the selection of a target word, which directly corresponds to word selection in machine translation.
    While this use of parallel corpus for word sense disambiguation seems appealing, several practical issues arise in its implementation: (i) What is the size of the parallel corpus needed in order for this approach to be able to disambiguate a source language word accurately?
    (ii) While we can obtain large parallel corpora in the long run, to have them manually wordaligned would be too time-consuming and would defeat the original purpose of getting a sensetagged corpus wi
