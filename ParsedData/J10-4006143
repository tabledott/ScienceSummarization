ach we propose that corpus-based resources for distributional semantics should be relatively stable, multi-purpose, large-scale databases (in the form of weighted tuple structures), only occasionally updated (because a better or larger corpus becomes available, a better parser, etc.).
    Still, given the same underlying DM and a certain task, much work can be done to exploit the DM optimally in the task, with no need to go back to corpus-based resource construction.
    For example, performance on attributional tasks could be raised by dimension reweighting techniques such as recently proposed by Zhitomirsky-Geffet and Dagan (2009).
    For the problem of data sparseness in the W1W2&#215;L space, we could treat the tensor as a graph and explore random walks and other graphical approaches that have been shown to &#8220;scale down&#8221; gracefully to capture relations in sparser data sets (Minkov and Cohen 2007, 2008).
    As in our simple example of smoothing relational pairs with attributional neighbors, mo
