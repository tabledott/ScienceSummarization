int on discontinuity gives a very good fit with the linguistic data.
  
  
    Dependency-based representations have become increasingly popular in syntactic parsing, especially for languages that exhibit free or flexible word order, such as Czech (Collins et al., 1999), Bulgarian (Marinov and Nivre, 2005), and Turkish (Eryi&#728;git and Oflazer, 2006).
    Many practical implementations of dependency parsing are restricted to projective structures, where the projection of a head word has to form a continuous substring of the sentence.
    While this constraint guarantees good parsing complexity, it is well-known that certain syntactic constructions can only be adequately represented by non-projective dependency structures, where the projection of a head can be discontinuous.
    This is especially relevant for languages with free or flexible word order.
    However, recent results in non-projective dependency parsing, especially using data-driven methods, indicate that most non-projective structures required
