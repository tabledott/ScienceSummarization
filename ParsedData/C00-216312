  The P relation is used especially to align words within idiomatic expressions, free translations, and missing function words.
  It is guaranteed that S C P. Figure 1 shows all example of a manually aligned sentence with S and P relations.
  The hunxan-annotated align- ment does not prefer rely translation direction and lnay therefore contain many-to-one and one-to-many relationships.
  The mmotation has been performed by two annotators, producing sets $1, 1~, S2, P2.
  Tile reference aliglunent is produced by forming the intersection of the sure aligmnents (S = $1 rqS2) and the ration of the possible atignumnts (P = P1 U P2).
  Tim quality of an alignment A = { (j, aj) } is mea- sured using the following alignment error rate: AER(S, P; A) = 1 - IA o Sl + IA o Pl IAI + ISl 1088 that  .
