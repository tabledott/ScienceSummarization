patible with a preceding permutation in P. We could, for example, obtain the same result above if we put EZE first, put ewt last, and switch their roles in the 2nd and 3rd permutations.
    However, the normal form requires the 2nd permutation to be [1, 3, 2, 4], not [4, 3, 2, 1], so EZE must be listed last.
    Let Q be an MTG derivation where no more production rules can be applied.
    Let Render(Q) be the result of evaluating all the N's in Q.
    The (formal) language L(G) of an MTG G is the set of multitexts that can be generated by applying z to the start link of G and then evaluating all the joins.
    I.e., L(G) = {Render(Q) : $ z Q}.
    Due to the importance of lexical information in disambiguating syntactic structure, we shall pay special attention to lexicalized MTGs (LMTGs) of the bilexical variety (L2MTGs).
    A bilexical MTG has a set A of &amp;quot;delexicalized&amp;quot; nonterminal labels.
    Intuitively, A corresponds to the nonterminal set of an ordinary CFG.
    Then, every nonterminal
