t set.
    We have since significantly improved the performance of the trigram model by using a larger training set and incorporating smoothing techniques.
    We present a detailed discussion of the model and its performance on a range of corpora in Section 6.5.
    In Section 6.2, we briefly mention the dependency model of supertagging that was reported in the earlier work.
    In an n-gram model for disambiguating supertags, dependencies between supertags that appear beyond the n-word window cannot be incorporated.
    This limitation can be overcome if no a priori bound is set on the size of the window but instead a Bangalore and Joshi Supertagging probability distribution of the distances of the dependent supertags for each supertag is maintained.
    We define dependency between supertags in the obvious way: A supertag is dependent on another supertag if the former substitutes or adjoins into the latter.
    Thus, the substitution and the foot nodes of a supertag can be seen as specifying dependency req
