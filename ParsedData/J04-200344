ble 8 lists the characteristics of the two test sets Test and Develop taken from the end-to-end evaluation in Verbmobil, the development part being meant to tune system parameters on a held-out corpus different from the training as well as the test corpus.
    As no parameters are optimized on the development set for the methods described in this article, most of the experiments were carried out on a joint set containing both test sets.
    7.1.2 Nespole!.
    Nespole! is a research project that ran from January 2000 to June 2002.
    It aimed to provide multimodel support for negotiation (Nespole!
    2000; Lavie et al. 2001).
    Table 5 summarizes the corpus statistics of the Nespole! training set.
    Table 8 provides the corresponding figures for the test set used in this work.
    For testing we used the alignment template translation system, described in Och, Tillmann, and Ney (1999).
    Training the parameters for this system entails training of IBM model 4 parameters in both translation directions a
