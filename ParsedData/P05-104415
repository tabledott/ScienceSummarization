 DEL1WORD(xi ) = {xl&#8722;1xm`+1 1 &lt; ` &lt; m} U {xm1 } This set consists of m + 1 strings and can be compactly represented as a lattice (see Fig.
    1a).
    Another 3Without any hidden variables, Z is globally concave. neighborhood involves transposing any pair of adjacent words: r 1 TRANS1(xi ) = 1 xl&#8212;lx`+1x`xm`+2 1 &lt; ` &lt; mI U {xm1 } This set can also be compactly represented as a lattice (Fig.
    1b).
    We can combine DEL1WORD and TRANS1 by taking their union; this gives a larger neighborhood, DELORTRANS1.4 The DEL1SUBSEQ neighborhood allows the deletion of any contiguous subsequence of words that is strictly smaller than the whole sequence.
    This lattice is similar to that of DEL1WORD, but adds some arcs (Fig.
    1c); the size of this neighborhood is O(m2).
    A final neighborhood we will consider is LENGTH, which consists of Em.
    CE with the LENGTH neighborhood is very similar to EM; it is equivalent to using EM to estimate the parameters of a model defined by Eq.
