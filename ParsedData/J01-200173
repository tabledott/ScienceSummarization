European languages (e.g., alternation between a and a in German, between o and ue in Spanish, between c and &#231; in French).
    However, we do not currently have a satisfactory means of segregating meaningful cases, such as these, from the (typically less frequent and) spurious cases of stems whose forms are parallel but ultimately not related.
  
  
    On the whole, the inclusion of the strategies described in the preceding sections leads to very good, but by no means perfect, results.
    In this section we shall review some of these results qualitatively, some quantitatively, and discuss briefly the origin of the incorrect parses.
    We obtain the most striking result by looking at the top list of signatures in a language, if we have some familiarity with the language: it is almost as if the textbook patterns have been ripped out and placed in a chart.
    As these examples suggest, the large morphological patterns identified tend to be quite accurately depicted.
