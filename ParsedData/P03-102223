hile we were (almost) satisfied with the performance of these features, the major problem for a spoken dialogue pronoun resolution algorithm is the abundance of pronouns without antecedents.
    Previous research could avoid dealing with this phenomenon by either applying the algorithm by hand (Eckert &amp; Strube, 2000) or excluding these cases (Byron, 2002) from the evaluation.
    Because we included these cases in our evaluation we consider our approach at least comparable to Byron&#8217;s system when she uses only domain-independent semantics.
    We believe that our system is more robust than hers and that it can more easily be ported to new domains.
