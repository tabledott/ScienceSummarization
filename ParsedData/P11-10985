    Scripts are sets of reument position, syntax, named entities, semantic lated event words and semantic roles learned by classes, and discourse relations (Maslennikov and linking syntactic functions with coreferring arguChua, 2007).

    While they learn interesting event structure, mented labeled with unlabeled data. the structures are limited to frequent topics in a large Weakly supervised approaches remove some of corpus.
    We borrow ideas from this work as well, but the need for fully labeled data.
    Most still require the our goal is to instead characterize a specific domain templates and their slots.
    One common approach is with limited data.
    Further, we are the first to apply to begin with unlabeled, but clustered event-specific this knowledge to the IE task of filling in template documents, and extract common word patterns as mentions in docu
