label of a node and input features of other argument nodes.
    The features are specified by instantiation of templates and the value of a feature is the number of times a particular pattern occurs in the labeled tree.
    For a tree t, predicate v, and joint assignment L of labels to the nodes of the tree, we define the candidate argument sequence as the sequence of non-NONE labeled nodes [n1, l1, ... , vPRED, ..., nm, lm] (li is the label of node ni).
    A reasonable candidate argument sequence usually contains very few of the nodes in the tree&#8212;about 2 to 7&#8212;as this is the typical number of arguments for a verb.
    To make it more convenient to express our feature templates, we include the predicate node v in the sequence.
    This sequence of labeled nodes is defined with respect to the left-to-right order of constituents in the parse tree.
    Because non-NONE labeled nodes do not overlap, there is a strict left-to-right order among these nodes.
