ules are highly probable.
    In fact, among a total of 138,662 reorder-expanded rules, the most likely 875 rules contribute 95% of the probability mass, so discarding the rules which contribute the lower 5% of the probability mass efficiently eliminates more than 99% of the total rules. zero-fertility words: An English word may be translated into a null (zero-length) foreign word.
    This happens when the fertility , and such English word(called a zero-fertility word) must be inserted during the decoding.
    The decoding parser is modified to allow inserting zero-fertility words, but unlimited insertion easily blows up the memory space.
    Therefore only limited insertion is allowed.
    Observing the Viterbi alignments of the training corpus, the top-20 frequent zero-fertility words5 cover over 70% of the cases, thus only those are allowed to be inserted.
    Also we use syntactic context to limit the insertion.
    For example, a zero-fertility word in is inserted as IN when &#8220;PP IN NP-A&#8221; rul
