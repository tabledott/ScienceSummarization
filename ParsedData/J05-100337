rpreted as a measure of how plausible a parse x is, with higher scores meaning that x is more plausible.
    Competing parses for the same sentence are ranked in order of plausibility by this function.
    We can recover the base ranking function&#8212;the log-likelihood L(x)&#8212;by setting a0 to a positive constant and setting all other parameter values to be zero.
    Our intention is to use the training examples to pick parameter values which improve upon this initial ranking.
    We now discuss how to set these parameters.
    First we discuss loss functions Loss(&#175;a) which can be used to drive the training process.
    We then go on to describe feature selection methods for the different loss functions.
    8 In the event that multiple parses get the (same) highest score, the parse with the highest value of loglikelihood L under the baseline model is taken as xi,1.
    In the event that two parses have the same score and the same log-likelihood&#8212;which occurred rarely if ever in our experiments
