he fact that there are strong associations in both eases.
  Unfortunately, it is not very good at deciding which association is stronger.
  Crucially, it does not make very good use of the off- diagonal cells b and c, which are often better estimated than cell a since the counts in b and c are often larger than those in a.
  In this case, the crucial difference is that cell b is much smaller in Table 2 than in Table 3.
  ~2 picks up this difference; Table 3 has a ~2 of 0.098, signitieantly ess than Table 2% ~2 of 0.62: t = ~2(hch) - ~2(hc?)
  "qvar2(~2(h,ch)) + var2(~2(h,co)) 0.62 - 0.099 = = 88 %/2.5x10 -5 + 9.9?10 -6 Thus, we can very confidently say that house (h)is more associated with chambre (ch) than with communes (co).
  Calculation of Variances The estimate of var(~ 2) is very important o this argument.
  We use the following reasoning: var(~ 2) = vat(a) + vat(b) 2 2 where var(a) = a, var(b) = b, var(c) = c and var(d) = a + b + c. A direct calculation of this is valid when ~2 is small: vatreal(02) =
