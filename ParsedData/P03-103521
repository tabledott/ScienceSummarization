) Initially, we use a greedy word segmentor6 to annotate the corpus, and obtain an initial context model based on the initial annotated corpus; (2) we re-annotate the corpus using the obtained models; and (3) re-train the context model using the re-annotated corpus.
    Steps 2 and 3 are iterated until the performance of the system converges.
    In the above approach, the quality of the context model depends to a large degree upon the quality of the initial annotated corpus, which is however not satisfied due to two problems.
    First, the greedy segmentor cannot deal with the segmentation ambiguities, and even after iterations, these ambiguities can only be partially resolved.
    Second, many factoids and named entities cannot be identified using the greedy word segmentor which is based on the dictionary.
    To solve the first problem, we use two methods to resolve segmentation ambiguities in the initial segmented training data.
    We classify word segmentation ambiguities into two classes: overlap ambi
