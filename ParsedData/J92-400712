    (g) Or else you'll get caught in the storm that's moving in.
    What this example illustrates is that a generation system cannot rely only on informational level analyses of the discourse it produces.
    This is precisely the point that Moore and Paris have noted (1992).
    If the generation system is playing the role of S, then it needs a record of the intentions underlying utterances (a) and (b) in order to determine how to respond to (c) and (d).
    Of course, if the system can recover the intentional relations from the informational ones, then it will suffice for the system to record only the latter.
    However, as Moore and Paris have argued, such recovery is not possible because there is not a one-to-one mapping between intentional and informational relations.
    The current example illustrates this last point.
