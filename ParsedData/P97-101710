ems: An obvious target inventory is the Japanese syllabary itself, written down in katakana (e.g., =-) or a roman equivalent (e.g., ni).
    With this approach, the English sound K corresponds to one of t (ka), (ki), (ku), r (ke), or (ko), depending on its context.
    Unfortunately, because katakana is a syllabary, we would be unable to express an obvious and useful generalization, namely that English K usually corresponds to Japanese k, independent of context.
    Moreover, the correspondence of Japanese katakana writing to Japanese sound sequences is not perfectly one-to-one (see next section), so an independent sound inventory is well-motivated in any case.
    Our Japanese sound inventory includes 39 symbols: 5 vowel sounds, 33 consonant sounds (including doubled consonants like kk), and one special symbol (pause).
    An English sound sequence like (P R OW PAUSE S AA K ER) might map onto a Japanese sound sequence like (p u r o pause s a kk a a).
    Note that long Japanese vowel sounds are written with
