			Thus, we hypothesised that a distributional measure which tends to select more generalterms as neighbours of the phrasal verb (e.g. re call) would do better than measures that tend to select more specific terms (e.g. precision) or measures that tend to select terms of a similar specificity (e.g simlin or the harmonic mean of precision and recall).
			Table 5 shows the results of using different similarity measures with the simplexscore test and data of McCarthy et al (2003).
			We now see significant correlation between compositionality judgements and distributional similarity of thephrasal verb and its head constituent.
