a substantial impact on the efficiency of the parser.
    While several parsers described in the literature have used such techniques, there is little published data on their efficacy, much less attempts to judge their relative merits.
    We propose and evaluate several figures of merit for best-first parsing, and we identify an easily computable figure of merit that provides excellent performance on various measures and two different grammars.
  
  
    Chart parsing is a commonly used algorithm for parsing natural language texts.
    The chart is a data structure that contains all of the constituents for which subtrees have been found, that is, constituents for which a derivation has been found and which may therefore appear in some complete parse of the sentence.
    The agenda is a structure that stores a list of constituents for which a derivation has been found but which have not yet been combined with other constituents.
    Initially, the agenda contains the terminal symbols from the sentence to be p
