			Such extrapolation is notjustified if the category is structured as a lex ical field with fuzzy boundaries: in this casethe precision of both machine and human annotation is expected to fall when more peripheral members of the category are pro cessed.
			In this paper, the sentiment-bearing words identified by the system were stratifiedbased on their Net Overlap Score and evaluated in terms of accuracy of sentiment an notation within each stratum.
			These strata, derived from Net Overlap scores, reflect the degree of centrality of a given word to the semantic category, and, thus, provide greater assurance that system performance on other words with the same Net Overlap Score will be similar to the performance observed on the intersection of system results with the gold standard.?
			The role of the inter-annotator disagree ment.
			The results of the study presented in this paper call for reconsideration of the roleof inter-annotator disagreement in the devel opment of lists of words manually annotated w
