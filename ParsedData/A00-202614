pleted trees that have not generated a necessary attribute are discarded by the search.
    The search terminates when either N complete trees or N trees of the maximum length M are discovered.
    NLG3 chooses the best answer to express the attribute set A as follows: where Tn193 are the completed dependency trees that satisfy the conditions of the NLG3 search described above.
  
  
    The training and test sets used to evaluate NLG1, NLG2 and NLG3 were derived semi-automatically from a pre-existing annotated corpus of user queries in the air travel domain.
    The annotation scheme used a total of 26 attributes to represent flights.
    The training set consisted of 6000 templates describing flights while the test set consisted of 1946 templates describing flights.
    All systems used the same training set, and were tested on the attribute sets extracted from the phrases in the test set.
    For example, if the test set contains the template &amp;quot;flights to $city-to leaving at $time-dep&amp;quot;, th
