 of correct constituents in proposed parse number of constituents in proposed parse number of correct constituents in proposed parse number of constituents in treebank parse Crossing brackets = number of constituents that violate constituent boundaries with a constituent in the treebank parse For a constituent to be &#8220;correct,&#8221; it must span the same set of words (ignoring punctuation, i.e., all tokens tagged as commas, colons, or quotation marks) and have the same label15 as a constituent in the treebank parse.
    Table 2 shows the results for models 1, 2 and 3 and a variety of other models in the literature.
    Two models (Collins 2000; Charniak 2000) outperform models 2 and 3 on section 23 of the treebank.
    Collins (2000) uses a technique based on boosting algorithms for machine learning that reranks n-best output from model 2 in this article.
    Charniak (2000) describes a series of enhancements to the earlier model of Charniak (1997).
