ended to be segmented, and the annotation of its discourse structure.
    In Section 4, we present our text-based segmentation component.
    This component mainly relies on lexical cohesion, particularly term repetition, to detect topic boundaries.
    We evaluated this segmentation against other lexical cohesion segmentation programs and show that the performance is state-of-theart.
    In the subsequent section, we describe conversational features, such as silences, speaker change, and other features like cue phrases.
    We present a machine learning approach for integrating these conversational features with the text-based segmentation module.
    Experimental results show a marked improvement in meeting segmentation with the incorporation of both sets of features.
    We close with discussions and conclusions.
  
  
    Existing approaches to textual segmentation can be broadly divided into two categories.
    On the one hand, many algorithms exploit the fact that topic segments tend to be lexically coh
