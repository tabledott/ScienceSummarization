asks such as base noun phrase chunking (Ramshaw and Marcus, 1994), text chunking (Ramshaw and Marcus, 1995) or named entity recognition (Tjong Kim Sang, 2002), we formulate the mention detection problem as a classification problem, by assigning to each token in the text a label, indicating whether it starts a specific mention, is inside a specific mention, or is outside any mentions.
    Good performance in many natural language processing tasks, such as part-of-speech tagging, shallow parsing and named entity recognition, has been shown to depend heavily on integrating many sources of information (Zhang et al., 2002; Jing et al., 2003; Ittycheriah et al., 2003).
    Given the stated focus of integrating many feature types, we are interested in algorithms that can easily integrate and make effective use of diverse input types.
    We selected two methods which satisfy these criteria: a linear classifier &#8211; the Robust Risk Minimization classifier &#8211; and a log-linear classifier &#8211; the Maximum Ent
