 simple past use (vBN), in a causative or non-causative use (cAus), and with an animate subject or not (ANim).4 Note that, except for the VBN feature, for which we simply extract the POS tag from the corpus, all other counts are approximations to the actual linguistic behaviour of the verb, as we describe in detail below.
    The first three counts (TRANS, PASS, VBN) were performed on the tagged ACL/DCI corpus available from the Linguistic Data Consortium, which includes the Brown Corpus (of one million words) and years 1987-1989 of the Wall Street Journal, a combined corpus in excess of 65 million words.
    The counts for these features proceeded as follows: label within the tagged corpus.
    Each of the above three counts was normalized over all occurrences of the &amp;quot;-ed&amp;quot; form of the verb, yielding a single relative frequency measure for each verb for that feature; i.e., percent transitive (versus intransitive) use, percent active (versus passive) use, and percent VBN (versus VBD) use, res
