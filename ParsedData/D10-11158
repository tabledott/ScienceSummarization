oit corpus evidence about the p vectors that result from composition, despite the fact that it is straightforward (at least for short constructions) to extract direct distributional evidence about the composite items from the corpus (just collect co-occurrence information for the composite item from windows around the contexts in which it occurs).
    The main innovation of Guevara (2010), who focuses on adjective-noun combinations (AN), is to use the cooccurrence vectors of observed ANs to train a supervised composition model (we became aware of Guevara&#8217;s approach after we had developed our own model, that also exploits observed ANs for training).
    Guevara adopts the full additive composition form from Equation (1) and he estimates the A and B weights using partial least squares regression.
    The training data are pairs of adjective-noun vector concatenations, as input, and corpus-derived AN vectors, as output.
    Guevara compares his model to the simplified additive and multiplicative models of
