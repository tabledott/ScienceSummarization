arallel are; so, three of the languages might have one analysis, while three have another.
    Parallelism is not maintained at the cost of misrepresenting the language.
    This is reflected by the fact that the c-structures are not parallel because word order varies widely from language to language, although there are naming conventions for the nodes.
    Instead, the bulk of the parallelism is in the f-structure.
    However, even in the f-structure, situations arise in which what seems to be the same construction in different languages do not have the same analysis.
    An example of this is predicate adjectives, as in (7). it TOP red &#8216;It is red.&#8217; In English, the copular verb is considered the syntactic head of the clause, with the pronoun being the subject and the predicate adjective being an XCOMP.
    However, in Japanese, the adjective is the mainpredicate, with the pronoun being the subject.
    As such, these receive the non-parallel analyses seen in (8a) for Japanese and (8b) for Englis
