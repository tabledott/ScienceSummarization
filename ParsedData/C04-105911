sis list, and the translation lattice built from the translation model.
			After extraction of the information, structured query models are proposed using the structured query language, described in the Section 3.1.
			3.1 Structured Query Language.
			This query language essentially enables the use of proximity operators (ordered and unordered windows) in queries, so that it is possible to model the syntactic and semantic information encoded in phrases, n-grams, and co-occurred word pairs.
			The InQuery implementation (Lemur 2003) is applied.
			So far 16 operators are defined in InQuery to model word proximity (ordered, unordered, phrase level, and passage level).
			Four of these operators are used specially for our language model adaptation: Sum Operator: #sum( 1t ? nt ) The terms or nodes ( 1t ? nt ) are treated as having equal influence on the final retrieval result.
			The belief values provided by the arguments of the sum are averaged to produce the belief value of the #sum node.
			Weighted Sum Oper
