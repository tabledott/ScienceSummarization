1-rules used in the rewriting operation.
    3.
    The lifting conditions contained in the lift multiset of all the newly introduced dependents D should be compatible with D, with the dot advanced appropriately.
    In addition, we require that, when we rewrite a category as a terminal, the lift multiset is empty.
    Let us consider an example.
    Suppose we have have a grammar containing the dependency rules di (rule 2), d2 (rule 3), and d3 (rule 4); the LP rule pi (rule 5) and p2: This rule says that an objective wh-noun with feature top:+ which depends on a verb with no further restrictions (the third V in the lifting path) can raise to any verb that dominates its immediate governor as long as the raising paths contains only verb with feature bridge:+, i.e., bridge verbs.
    A sample derivation is shown in Figure 4, with the sentential form representation on top and the corresponding tree representation below.
    We start our derivation with the start symbol Klause and rewrite it using dependency rule
