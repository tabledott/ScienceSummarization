with the estimated model p(tjT(w)).
    In the experiments, we will empirically compare the following methods in terms of accuracy and estimation time.
    Filtering only: The unigram probability p&#175; is used only for filtering in training.
    Product: The probability is defined as the product of p&#175; and the estimated model p. Reference distribution: p&#175; is used as a reference distribution of p. Feature function: log p&#175; is used as a feature function of p. This method has been shown to be a generalization of the reference distribution method (Johnson and Riezler 2000).
    Feature functions in maximum entropy models are designed to capture the characteristics of (em, el, er).
