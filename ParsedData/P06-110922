ed data but by adding unsupervised or semi-unsupervised techniques (cf.
    McClosky et al. 2006).
    Thus if we modify our question as: does the exclusively supervised approach to parsing come to an end, we believe that the answer is certainly yes.
    Yet we should neither rule out the possibility that entirely unsupervised methods will in fact surpass semi-supervised methods.
    The main problem is how to quantitatively compare these different parsers, as any evaluation on handannotated data (like the Penn treebank) will unreasonably favor semi-supervised parsers.
    There is thus is a quest for designing an annotationindependent evaluation scheme.
    Since parsers are becoming increasingly important in applications like syntax-based machine translation and structural language models for speech recognition, one way to go would be to compare these different parsing methods by isolating their contribution in improving a concrete NLP system, rather than by testing them against gold standard annotations wh
