 often responsible for the lion's share of the noise.
    Reducing this source of noise makes it much easier for SIMR to stay on track.
    Other bitext mapping algorithms mitigate this source of noise either by assigning lower weights to correspondence points associated with frequent word types (Church 1993) or by deleting frequent word types from the bitext altogether (Dagan, Church, and Gale 1993).
    However, a word type that is relatively frequent overall can be rare in some parts of the text.
    In those parts, the word type can provide valuable clues to correspondence.
    On the other hand, many tokens of a relatively rare type can be concentrated in a short segment of the text, resulting in many false correspondence points.
    The varying concentration of identical tokens suggests that more localized noise filters would be more effective.
    SIMR's localized search strategy provides a vehicle for a localized noise filter.
    The filter is based on the maximum point ambiguity level parameter.
