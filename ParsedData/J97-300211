versing them on stream 2, so that C1 = AiBi but C2 = B2A2.
    Since inversion is permitted at any level of rule expansion, a derivation may intermix productions of either orientation within the parse tree.
    For example, if the inverted-orientation production of Figure 1(b) is added to the earlier simple transduction grammar, sentence-pair (3) can then be generated as follows: We can show the common structure of the two sentences more clearly and compactly with the aid of the () notation: Inversion transduction grammar parse tree.
    Alternatively, a graphical parse tree notation is shown in Figure 2, where the () level of bracketing is indicated by a horizontal line.
    The English is read in the usual depthfirst left-to-right order, but for the Chinese, a horizontal line means the right subtree is traversed before the left.
    Parsing, in the case of an ITG, means building matched constituents for input sentence-pairs rather than sentences.
    This means that the adjacency constraints given by the ne
