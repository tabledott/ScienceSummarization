 in the gold standard.
    The results are shown in Table 1, with an additional column giving the category accuracy.
    As an additional experiment, we conditioned the dependency probabilities in 10 on a &#8220;distance measure&#8221; (A).
    Distance has been shown to be a useful feature for context-free treebank style parsers (e.g.
    Collins (1996), Collins (1999)), although our hypothesis was that it would be less useful here, because the CCG grammar provides many of the constraints given by A, and distance measures are biased against long-range dependencies.
    We tried a number of distance measures, and the one used here encodes the relative position of the heads of the argument and functor (left or right), counts the number of verbs between argument and functor (up to 1), and counts the number of punctuation marks (up to 2).
    The results are also given in Table 1, and show that, as expected, adding distance gives no improvement overall.
    An advantage of the dependency-based evaluation is that
