inct for each vi!---n+1 1 is not generally felicitous; z Bahl, Jelinek, and Mercer (1983) suggest partitioning the A-i into buckets according to c(wii=n1+1), i&#8212;n+1 where all in the same bucket are constrained -i-,,+1 to have the same value.
    To yield meaningful results, the data used to estimate the Ai-i need to be disjoint from the data i&#8212;n+1 used to calculate PDAL.2 In held-out interpolation, one reserves a section of the training data for this purpose.
    Alternatively, Jelinek and Mercer describe a technique called deleted interpolation where different parts of the training data rotate in training either PML or the A ; the results are then averaged.
    Wi&#8212;n+1 Several smoothing techniques are motivated within a Bayesian framework, including work by Nadas (1984) and MacKay and Peto (1995).
  
  
    Of the great many novel methods that we have tried, two techniques have performed especially well.
    2 When the same data is used to estimate both, setting all ,-1 to one yields the opti
