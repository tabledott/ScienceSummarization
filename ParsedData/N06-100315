he Bleu scores for each of these conditions.
    We were able to measure a translation improvement for all sizes of training corpora, under both the single word and multi-word conditions, except for the largest Spanish-English corpus.
    For the single word condition, it would have been surprising if we had seen a decrease in Bleu score.
    Because we are translating words that were previously untranslatable it would be unlikely that we could do any worse.
    In the worst case we would be replacing one word that did not occur in the reference translation with another, and thus have no effect on Bleu.
    More interesting is the fact that by paraphrasing unseen multi-word units we get an increase in quality above and beyond the single word paraphrases.
    These multi-word units may not have been observed in the training data as a unit, but each of the component words may have been.
    In this case translating a paraphrase would not be guaranteed to received an improved or identical Bleu score, as in the s
