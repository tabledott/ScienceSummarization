xt is a fairly simple process: The Viterbi search is necessary because simply taking the highest-probability future assigned to each token would result in incompatible assignments.
    For instance, an assignment of [person-start, location_end] to two consecutive tokens would be invalid.
    The Viterbi search finds the highest probability path in which there are no two tokens in which the second one cannot follow the first, as defined by a table of all such invalid transitions (a similar approach to (Sekine et al.. 1998)).
  
  
    MENE's maximum entropy training algorithm gives it reasonable performance with moderate-sized training corpora or few information sources, while allowing it to really shine when more training data and information sources are added.
    Table 2 shows MENE's performance on the MUC-7 &amp;quot;dry run&amp;quot; corpus, which consisted of 25 articles mostly on the topic of aviation disasters.
    All systems shown were trained on 350 articles on the same domain (this training corpus
