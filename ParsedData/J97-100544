ating segment boundaries,6 much less on evaluating the comparative utility of different types of information.
    In this section we present and evaluate a collection of algorithms that identify discourse segment boundaries, where each relies on a different type of linguistic information.
    We first introduce our methodology (Section 4.1), then evaluate three initial algorithms, each based on the use of a single linguistic device frequently proposed in the literature: pauses, cue words and referential noun phrases, respectively (Section 4.2).7 Each algorithm was developed prior to any acquaintance with the narratives in our corpus.
    We evaluate each algorithm by examining its performance in segmenting an initial test set of 10 of our 20 narratives.
    We also evaluate a simple method for combining algorithms.
    These initial evaluations allow us to quantify the performance of existing hypotheses, to compare the utility of three very different types of linguistic knowledge, and to begin investigating t
