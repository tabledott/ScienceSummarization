  Parsing The WSJ Using CCG And Log-Linear Models
  
    This paper describes and evaluates log-linear parsing models for Combinatory Categorial A parallel implementation of algorithm is described, which runs on a Beowulf cluster allowing the complete Penn Treebank to be used for estimation.
    We also develop a new efficient parsing for maximises expected recall of dependencies.
    We compare models use all including nonstandard derivations, with normal-form models.
    The performances of the two models are comparable and the results are competitive with ex
  
  
    A number of statistical parsing models have recently been developed for Combinatory Categorial Grammar (CCG; Steedman, 2000) and used in parsers applied to the WSJ Penn Treebank (Clark et al., 2002; Hockenmaier and Steedman, 2002; Hockenmaier, 2003b).
    In Clark and Curran (2003) we argued for the use of log-linear parsing models for CCG.
    However, estimating a log-linear model for a widecoverage CCG grammar is very computationally expe
