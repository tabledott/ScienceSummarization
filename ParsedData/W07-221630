and horizontal neighbourhoods for an edge in the dependency graph from Figure 1.
    Vertical and horizontal Markovization essentially allow the score of the graph to factor over a larger scope of edges, provided those edges are in the same vertical or horizontal neighbourhood.
    A dth order factorization is one in which the score factors only over the d nearest edges in the neighbourhoods.
    In McDonald and Pereira (2006), it was shown that non-projective dependency parsing with horizontal Markovization is FNP-hard.
    In this study we complete the picture and show that vertical Markovization is also FNP-hard.
    Consider a first-order vertical Markovization in which the score for a dependency graph factors over pairs of vertically adjacent edges2, where k hiwk0 ij is the weight of including both edges (h, i)k and (i, j)k0 in the dependency graph.
    Note that this formulation does not include any contributions from dependencies that have no vertically adjacent neighbours, i.e., any edge (0, i)k such
