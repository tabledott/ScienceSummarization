problem is a variant of the approximate patternmatching problem.
			A major application of approx imate pattern matching in bioinformatics is queryprocessing in protein databases for purposes of se quencing, phylogeny, and motif identification.Current MT models, including hierarchical mod els, translate by breaking the input sentence intosmall pieces and translating them largely independently.
			Using approximate pattern matching algo rithms, we imagine that machine translation could be treated very much like search in a protein database.
			In this scenario, the goal is to select training sentences that match the input sentence as closely as possible, under some evaluation function that accounts for both matching and mismatched sequences, as well as possibly other data features.
			Once we have found the closest sentences we cantranslate the matched portions in their entirety, re placing mismatches with appropriate word, phrase, or hierarchical phrase translations as needed.
			This model would bring statis
