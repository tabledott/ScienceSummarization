Vqr q(V) = EvEvrwqr r(v) + EvEVqr r(v) = 1.
    Table 1 lists these alternative forms in order of performance.
    We see that for the non-combinatorial functions, the groups correspond to the degree to which the measures rely on the verbs in Vqr.
    The Jensen-Shannon divergence and the L1 norm can be computed simply by knowing the values of q and r on Vqr.
    For the cosine and the confusion probability, the distribution values on Vqr are key, but other information is also incorporated.
    The statistic Ta takes into account all verbs, including those that occur neither with The superior performance of Jac(q, r) seems to underscore the importance of the set Vqr.
    Jaccard's coefficient ignores the values of q and r on Vqr; but we see that simply knowing the size of Vqr relative to the supports of q and r leads to good rankings.
    4 The Skew Divergence Based on the results just described, it appears that it is desirable to have a similarity function that focuses on the verbs that cooccur with both of
