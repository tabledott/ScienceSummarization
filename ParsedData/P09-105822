ter than batch learning using shorter training times (McDonald, 2006).
    For example, a perceptron algorithm is used for joint Chinese word segmentation and POS tagging (Zhang and Clark, 2008; Jiang et al., 2008a; Jiang et al., 2008b).
    Another potential algorithm is MIRA, which integrates the notion of the large-margin classifier (Crammer, 2004).
    In this paper, we first introduce MIRA to joint word segmentation and POS tagging and show very encouraging results.
    With regard to error-driven learning, Brill (1995) proposed a transformation-based approach that acquires a set of error-correcting rules by comparing the outputs of an initial tagger with the correct annotations on a training corpus.
    Our approach does not learn the error-correcting rules.
    We only aim to capture the characteristics of unknown words and augment their representatives.
    As for search space representation, Ng and Low (2004) found that for Chinese, the characterbased model yields better results than the wordbased mo
