			6.2 Performance of a Prior-Polarity Classifier.
			An important question is how useful prior polarityalone is for identifying contextual polarity.
			To answer this question, we create a classifier that simply assumes that the contextual polarity of a clue in stance is the same as the clue?s prior polarity, and weexplore the classifier?s performance on the develop ment set.
			This simple classifier has an accuracy of 48%.
			From the confusion matrix given in Table 2, we seethat 76% of the errors result from words with nonneutral prior polarity appearing in phrases with neu tral contextual polarity.
