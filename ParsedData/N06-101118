    In this work, we only consider single word Named Entities.
    A subject of future work is to extend the algorithm to the multi-word setting.
    Many of the multi-word NEs are translated as well as transliterated.
    For example, Mount in Mount Rainier will probably be translated, and Rainier - transliterated.
    If a dictionary exists for the two languages, it can be consulted first, and, if a match is found, transliteration model can be bypassed.
    The algorithm can be naturally extended to comparable corpora of more than two languages.
    Pairwise time sequence scoring and transliteration models should give better confidence in NE matches.
    It seems plausible to suppose that phonetic features (if available) w
