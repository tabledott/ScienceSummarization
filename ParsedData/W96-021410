ability 1/a.
    In other words, rather than using the large, explicit STSG, we can use this small PCFG that generates isomorphic derivations, with identical probabilities.
    The construction is as follows.
    For a node such we will generate the following eight PCFG rules, where the number in parentheses following a rule is its probability.
    Ai -4 BC (11a3) A -4 BC (11a) &#8212;&gt; BkC (bklaj) A &#8212;&gt; BkC (bkla) Ai -4 BC, (cilai) A -4 BC, (cila) BkC, (bkCliaj) A BkC, (bkel /a) We will show that subderivations headed by A with external non-terminals at the roots and leaves, internal non-terminals elsewhere have probability 1/a.
    Subderivations headed by Ai with external non-terminals only at the leaves, internal non-terminals elsewhere, have probability Vai.
    The proof is by induction on the depth of the trees.
    For trees of depth 1, there are two cases: Trivially, these trees have the required probabilities.
    Now, assume that the theorem is true for trees of depth n or less.
