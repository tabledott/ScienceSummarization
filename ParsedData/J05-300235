on process, constituents may be removed, added in, or reordered.
    Wording can also be modified during this process.
    Although the selection of words and phrases which appear in the basis tree is a safe choice, enriching the fusion sentence with alternative verbalizations has several benefits.
    In applications such as summarization, in which the length of the produced sentence is a factor, a shorter alternative is desirable.
    This goal can be achieved by selecting the shortest paraphrase among available alternatives.
    Alternate verbalizations can also be used to replace anaphoric expressions, for instance, A pruned basis lattice. when the basis tree contains a noun phrase with anaphoric expressions (e.g., his visit) and one of the other verbalizations is anaphora-free.
    Substitution of the latter for the anaphoric expression may increase the clarity of the produced sentence, since frequently the antecedent of the anaphoric expression is not present in a summary.
    Moreover, in some cases su
