    First, if we find that it is possible to obtain a sufficient amount of data of good quality, then we might be able to reduce the time commitment expected from the system developers in future evaluations.
    Second, the additional collected labels might enable us to detect significant differences between systems that would otherwise be insignificantly different usi
