ed into a DSyntR, which the sentence planner then attempts to merge with the current DSyntR.
    If none of the clause combination strategies work, or if stylistic heuristics interfere, or if the incoming proposition is a conceptual-break, the current DSyntR is sent to the realizer and the new DSyntR becomes the current one.
    The process of clause combination can be very easily modeled at the DSyntR level: relative clause formation and conjunction reduce to simple tree composition operations.
    (In the case of adjectival attachment only the adjective node is attached.)
    Issues such as word order in relative clauses, the morphological form of the complementizer, and conjunction reduction can be dealt with at further stages of processing.
  
  
    The linguistic component is based on Meaning-Text Theory (MTT) (Mel'euk 1988), and is a reimplementation (in Lisp) of Polguere's Prolog implementation of a Meaning-Text model for English (Iordanskaja et al 1988; Iordanskaja et al 1991).
