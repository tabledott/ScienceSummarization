ng the approaches that outperform TypeDM, BagPack is supervised, and CWO and PMI-IR-03 rely on much larger corpora.
    This leaves us with three unsupervised (and unstructured) models from the literature that outperform TypeDM while being trained on comparable or smaller corpora: LSA-03, GLSA, and PPMIC.
    In all three cases, the authors show that parameter tuning is beneficial in attaining the reported best performance.
    Further work should investigate how we could improve TypeDM by exploring various parameter settings (many of which do not require going back to the corpus: feature selection and reweighting, SVD, etc.).
    6.1.3 Noun Categorization.
    Humans are able to group words into classes or categories depending on their meaning similarities.
    Categorization tasks play a prominent role in cognitive research on concepts and meaning, as a probe into the semantic organization of the lexicon and the ability to arrange concepts hierarchically into taxonomies (Murphy 2002).
