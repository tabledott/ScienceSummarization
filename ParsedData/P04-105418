dy this, we retrain each SVMs for a binary classification task.
    Here, we detect, but do not classify, relations.
    This allows us to combine all positive relation instances into one class, which provides us more training samples to estimate the class boundary.
    We then threshold our output to achieve an optimal operating point.
    As seen in Table 5, this method of relation detection outperforms that of the multi-class classifier.
    We then use these binary classifiers in a cascading scheme as follows: First, we use the binary SVM to detect possible relations.
    Then, we use the SVM trained only on positive relation instances to classify each predicted relation.
    These results are shown in Table 6.
    The first result of interest is that the sparse tree kernel, K0, does not perform as well as the contiguous tree kernel, K1.
    Suspecting that noise was introduced by the non-matching nodes allowed in the sparse tree kernel, we performed the experiment with different values for the decay fact
