ncies, we also define the following margin metric to compute the confidence of the best (most frequent) event type or role: &#8211; WeightedFrequency (second most freq value))/ WeightedFrequency (second most freq value) A large margin indicates greater confidence in the most frequent value.
    We summarize the frequency and confidence metrics in Table 3.
    Based on these confidence metrics, we designed the inference rules in Table 4.
    These rules are applied in the order (1) to (9) based on the principle of improving &#8216;local&#8217; information before global propagation.
    Although the rules may seem complex, they basically serve two functions:
  
  
    In this section we present the results of applying this inference method to improve ACE event extraction.
    We used 10 newswire texts from ACE 2005 training corpora (from March to May of 2003) as our development set, and then conduct blind test on a separate set of 40 ACE 2005 newswire texts.
    For each test text we retrieved 25 related texts
