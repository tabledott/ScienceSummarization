  A Mention-Synchronous Coreference Resolution Algorithm Based On The Bell Tree
  
    This paper proposes a new approach for resolution which uses the tree to represent the search space and casts the coreference resolution problem as finding the best path from the root of the Bell tree to the leaf nodes.
    A Maximum Entropy model is used to rank these paths.
    The coreference performance on the 2002 and 2003 Automatic Content Extraction (ACE) data will be reported.
    We also train a coreference system using the MUC6 data and competitive results are obtained.
  
  
    In this paper, we will adopt the terminologies used in the Automatic Content Extraction (ACE) task (NIST, 2003).
    Coreference resolution in this context is defined as partitioning mentions into entities.
    A mention is an instance of reference to an object, and the collection of mentions referring to the same object in a document form an entity.
    For example, in the following sentence, mentions are underlined: &#8220;The American
