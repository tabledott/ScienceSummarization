 same head-table as Yamada and Matsumoto (2003), using sections 02-21 as training data and section 23 as test data, following (McDonald et al., 2005; Nivre &amp; Scholz, 2004; Yamada &amp; Matsumoto, 2003).
    Dependencies extracted from section 00 were used as held-out data, and section 22 was used as additional development data.
    For constituent parsing, we used the section splits of the Penn Treebank as described above, as has become standard in statistical parsing research.
    Six dependency parsers were used in our combination experiments, as described below.
    The deterministic shift-reduce parsing algorithm of (Nivre &amp; Scholz, 2004) was used to create two parsers2, one that processes the input sentence from left-to-right (LR), and one that goes from right-toleft (RL).
    Because this deterministic algorithm makes a single pass over the input string with no back-tracking, making decisions based on the parser&#8217;s state and history, the order in which input tokens are considered affects th
