associated with a node in a derivation tree in order to describe that node and its realtion to featnres of other nodes in tile derivation tree.
  In a TAG, any node in an elementary tree is related to the other nodes in that trec in two ways.
  Feature structures written in FTAG using the standard matrix notation, describing a node, ~h can be made on the basis of: 1. the relation of I 1 to its supertrce, i.e., tile view of the uode from the top.
  Let us call this feature structure as t,~.
  2. the rclation to its descendants, i.e., the view from below.
  This feature structure is called bo.
  Note that both the t,~ and b,~ feature structure hold of the node r l. In a derivation tree of a CFG based unification system, wc associate one featnre structure with a node (the unification of these two structures) since both the statements, t and b, together hold for the node, and uo further nodes are introduced between the nodes supertrce and subtrec.
  This property is not trne in a TAG.
