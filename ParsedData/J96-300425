on to word-frequency information, include a constraint-satisfication model, so their method is really a hybrid approach.
    Several papers report the use of part-of-speech information to rank segmentations (Lin, Chiang, and Su 1993; Peng and Chang 1993; Chang and Chen 1993); typically, the probability of a segmentation is multiplied by the probability of the tagging(s) for that segmentation to yield an estimate of the total probability for the analysis.
    Statistical methods seem particularly applicable to the problem of unknown-word identification, especially for constructions like names, where the linguistic constraints are minimal, and where one therefore wants to know not only that a particular sequence of hanzi might be a name, but that it is likely to be a name with some probability.
    Several systems propose statistical methods for handling unknown words (Chang et al. 1992; Lin, Chiang, and Su 1993; Peng and Chang 1993).
    Some of these approaches (e.g., Lin, Chiang, and Su [1993]) attempt to id
