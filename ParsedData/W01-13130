  Assigning Time-Stamps To Event-Clauses
  
    We describe a procedure for arranging into a time-line the contents of news stories describing the development of some situation.
    We describe the parts of the system that deal with 1. breaking sentences into event-clauses and 2. resolving both explicit and implicit temporal references.
    Evaluations show a performance of 52%, compared to humans.
  
  
    Linguists who have analyzed news stories (Schokkenbroek,1999; Bell,1997; Ohtsuka and Brewer,1992, etc.) noticed that &#8220;narratives1 are about more than one event and these events are temporally ordered.
    Though it seems most logical to recapitulate events in the order in which they happened, i.e. in chronological order, the events are often presented in a different sequence&#8221;.
    The same paper states that &#8220;it is important to reconstruct the underlying event order2 for narrative analysis to assign meaning to the sequence in which the events are narrated at the level of discourse struct
