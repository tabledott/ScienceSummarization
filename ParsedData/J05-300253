ay not be decomposable into the node-level mappings which our algorithm aims to compute.
    For example, the mapping between the sentences in Table 8 expressed by the rule X denied claims by Y &#8596; X said that Y&#8217;s claim was untrue cannot be decomposed into smaller matching units.
    At least two mistakes resulted from noisy preprocessing (tokenization and parsing).
    In addition to alignment, overcutting during lattice pruning caused the omission of three clauses that were present in the corresponding reference sentences.
    The sentence Conservatives were cheering language is an example of an incomplete sentence derived from the following input sentence: Conservatives were cheering language in the final version Syria denied claims by Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon ...
