r pairs.
    LRA is used as a distance (nearness) measure in a single nearest neighbor supervised learning algorithm.
    The following experiments use the 600 labeled noun-modifier pairs of Nastase and Szpakowicz (2003).
    This data set includes information about the part of speech and WordNet synset (synonym set; i.e., word sense tag) of each word, but our algorithm does not use this information.
    Table 19 lists the 30 classes of semantic relations.
    The table is based on Appendix A of Nastase and Szpakowicz (2003), with some simplifications.
    The original table listed several semantic relations for which there were no instances in the data set.
    These were relations that are typically expressed with longer phrases (three or more words), rather than noun-modifier word pairs.
    For clarity, we decided not to include these relations in Table 19.
    In this table, H represents the head noun and M represents the modifier.
    For example, in flu virus, the head noun (H) is virus and the modifie
