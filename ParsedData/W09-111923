L03 data, and although the Wikipedia gazetteers were constructed based on CoNLL03 annotation guidelines, these features proved extremely good on all datasets.
    Word class models discussed in Section 6.1 are computed offline, are available online1, and provide an alternative to traditional semi-supervised learning.
    It is important to note that the word class models and the gazetteers and independednt and accumulative.
    Furthermore, despite the number and the gigantic size of the extracted gazetteers, the gazeteers alone are not sufficient for adequate performance.
    When we modified the CoNLL03 baseline to include gazetteer matches, the performance went up from 71.91 to 82.3 on the CoNLL03 test set, below our baseline system&#8217;s result of 83.65.
    When we have injected the gazetteers into our system, the performance went up to 87.22.
    Word class model and nonlocal features further improve the performance to 90.57 (see Table 5), by more than 3 F1 points.
  
  
    As a final experiment, we
