			Zhang et al(2006) proposed two composite kernels to integrate a linear kernel and Collins and Duffy?s convolution tree kernel.
			It achieved the Fmeasure of 70.9/57.2 on the 5 relation types/24 rela tion subtypes in the ACE RDC 2003 corpus and the F-measure of 72.1/63.6 on the 7 relation types/23 relation subtypes in the ACE RDC 2004 corpus.
			The above discussion suggests that structured in formation in the parse tree may not be fully utilized in the previous works, regardless of feature-based, tree kernel-based or composite kernel-based methods.
			Compared with the previous works, this paper pro poses a dynamic context-sensitive tree span trying to cover necessary structured information and a context sensitive convolution tree kernel considering both context-free and context-sensitive sub-trees.
			Further more, a composite kernel is applied to combine our tree kernel and a state-of-the-art linear kernel for in tegrating both flat and structured features in relation extraction as well as validating
