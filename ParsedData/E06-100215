e(q; e k) is avail able, the named entity corresponding to query q is defined to be the one with the highest score: e^ = argmax e k score(q; e k ) (1) If e^ = q:e then e^ represents a hit, otherwise e^ is a miss. Disambiguation methods will then differ based on the way they define the scoring function.One ranking function that is evaluated experimen tally in this paper is based on the cosine similarity between the context of the query and the text of the article: score(q; e k ) = cos(q:T; e k :T ) = q:T kq:Tk e k :T ke k :Tk The factors q:T and e k :T are represented in thestandard vector space model, where each compo nent corresponds to a term in the vocabulary, and the term weight is the standard tf  idf score(Baeza-Yates and Ribeiro-Neto, 1999).
