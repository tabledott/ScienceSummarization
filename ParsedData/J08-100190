latter is a good indicator of nominal coreference; it is often included as a feature in machine learning approaches to coreference resolution (Soon, Ng, and Lim 2001; Ng and Cardie 2002) and is relatively robust (i.e., likely to deliver consistent results in the face of different domains and genres).
    It is important to note that, although inspired by entity-based theories of discourse coherence, our approach is not a direct implementation of any theory in particular.
    Rather, we sacrifice linguistic faithfulness for automatic computation and breadth of coverage.
    Despite approximations and unavoidable errors (e.g., in the parser&#8217;s output), our results indicate that entity grids are a useful representational framework across tasks and text genres.
    In agreement with Poesio et al. (2004) we find that pronominalization is a good indicator of document coherence.
    We also find that coherent texts are characterized by transitions with particular properties which do not hold for all discourses.
