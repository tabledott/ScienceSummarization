ect position in the sentence Prices are falling but so does VBG&#57739;VP&#57739;S&#57740;NP in the sentence Sellers regret prices falling.
    Because TAG localizes dependencies, the corresponding values for Supertag path in these sentences would be identical.
    We now experiment with our surface syntax features: Pred HW, Arg HW, Ssubcat, and Srole.
    (Feature set SURFACE.)
    Its performance on SEMTAG is 8.2% whereas its performance on SYNTTAG is 7.6%, a tangible improvement over previous models.
    One reason for the improvement could be that this model is assigning semantic labels with knowledge of the other roles the predicate assigns, unlike previous models.
    Our next experiment involves using deep syntax features: Pred HW, Arg HW, Dsubcat, and Drole.
    (Feature set DEEP.)
    Its performance on both SEMTAG and SYNT-TAG is 6.5%, better than previous models.
    Its performance is better than SURFACE presumably because syntactic transformations are taken to account by deep syntax features.
