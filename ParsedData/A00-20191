age of specific vocabulary words in essays by looking at the local contextual cues around a target word.
    We have developed a statistical system, ALEK (Assessing Lexical Knowledge), that uses statistical analysis for this purpose.
    A major objective of this research is to avoid the laborious and costly process of collecting errors (or negative evidence) for each word that we wish to evaluate.
    Instead, we train ALEK on a general corpus of English and on edited text containing example uses of the target word.
    The system identifies inappropriate usage based on differences between the word's local context cues in an essay and the models of context it has derived from the corpora of well-formed sentences.
    A requirement for ALEK has been that all steps in the process be automated, beyond choosing the words to be tested and assessing the results.
    Once a target word is chosen, preprocessing, building a model of the word's appropriate usage, and identifying usage errors in essays is performed wit
