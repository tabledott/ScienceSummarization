have more possible roles.
    As we have seen with PPs, when more roles are available, the performance of a default role degrades.
    Second, although we achieve the same correctness as the baseline, our algorithm does not simply assign the dominant role in these cases.
    Some subjects are assigned Theme, while some objects are assigned Recipient or Source.
    These roles would never be possible in these slots if a default assignment were followed.
    We also consider our performance given frame matching and chunking errors, which can lead to adjuncts or even &#8220;bad&#8221; constituents being labelled.
    Only arguments should be labelled, while nonarguments should remain unlabelled.
    Of 98 slots judged to be adjuncts, 19 erroneously are given labels.
    Including the adjunct slots, our percent correct goes from 90.1% to 88.7%.
    Of the 20 &#8220;bad&#8221; slots, 12 were labelled.
    Including these, correctness is reduced slightly further, to 87.2%, as shown in the second panel of results in
