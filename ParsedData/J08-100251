= 0.95, and a reference distribution method was applied.
    The unigram model, p0(t|s), for filtering is a maximum entropy model with two feature templates, (WORD, POS, LE) and (POS, LE).
    The model includes 24,847 features.
    Tables 6 and 7 show parsing accuracy for the test set.
    In the tables, &#8220;Syntactic features&#8221; denotes a model with syntactic features, that is, fbinary, funary, and froot introduced in Section 4.5.
    &#8220;Semantic features&#8221; represents a model with features on predicate&#8211; argument structures, that is, fpa given in Table 4.
    &#8220;All&#8221; is a model with both syntactic and semantic features.
    The &#8220;Baseline&#8221; row shows the results for the reference model, p0(t|s), used for lexical entry filtering in the estimation of the other models.
    This model is considered as a simple application of a traditional PCFG-style model; that is, p(r) = 1 for any rule r in the construction rules of the HPSG grammar.
    The results demonstrate that fea
