ee is of interest, but also the operations by which we obtained it from elementary structures.
    This information is encoded in the derivation tree (Vijay-Shanker, 1987).
    However, as Vijay-Shanker (1992) observes, the TAG composition operations are not used uniformly: while substitution is used only to add a (nominal) complement, adjunction is used both for modification and (clausal) complementation.
    Clausal complementation could not be handled uniformly by substitution because of the existence of syntactic phenomena such as long-distance wh-movement in English.
    Furthermore, there is an inconsistency in the directionality of the operations used for complementation in TAG@: nominal complements are substituted into their governing verb's tree, while the governing verb's tree is adjoined into its own clausal complement.
    The fact that adjunction and substitution are used in a linguistically heterogeneous manner means that (standard) TAG derivation trees do not provide a good representation of th
