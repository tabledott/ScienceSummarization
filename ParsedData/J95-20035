dels changes in attentional state within a discourse segment, and the global level models attentional state properties at the intersegmental level.
    Grosz and Sidner argue that global coherence depends on the intentional structure.
    They propose that each discourse has an overall communicative purpose, the discourse purpose (DP); and each discourse segment has an associated intention, its discourse segment purpose (DSP).
    The DP and DSP are speaker intentions; they are correlates at the discourse level of the intentions Grice argued underlay utterance meaning (Grice 1969).
    If a discourse is multi-party (e.g., a dialogue), then the DSP for a given segment is an intention of the conversational participant who initiates that segment.
    Lochbaum (1994) employs collaborative plans (Grosz and Kraus 1993) to model intentional structure, and is thus able to integrate intentions of different participants.
    Satisfaction of the DSPs contributes to the satisfaction of the DP.
