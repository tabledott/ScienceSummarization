    Thus the improved Bleu score is notable.
    Table 3 shows that incorporating the paraphrase probability into the model&#8217;s feature functions plays a critical role.
    Without it, the multi-word paraphrases harm translation performance when compared to the baseline.
    We performed a manual evaluation by judging the accuracy of phrases for 100 paraphrased translations from each of the sets using the manual word alignments.1 Table 4 gives the percentage of time that each of the translations of paraphrases were judged to have the same meaning as the equivalent target phrase.
    In the case of the translations of single word paraphrases for the Spanish accuracy ranged from just below 50% to just below 70%.
    This number is impressive in light of the fact that none of those items are correctly translated in the baseline model, which simply inserts the foreign language word.
    As with the Bleu scores, the translations of multi-word paraphrases were judged to be more accurate than th
