discovered, or if WN,m is computed, the search terminates.
    Any incomplete sequence which does not satisfy condition (3) is discarded and any complete sequence that does not satisfy condition (2) is also discarded.
    When the search terminates, there will be at most N completed sequences, of possibly differing lengths.
    Currently, there is no normalization for different lengths, i.e., all sequences of length n &lt; M are equiprobable: NLG2 chooses the best answer to express the attribute set A as follows: where Wnig2 are the completed word sequences that satisfy the conditions of the NLG2 search described above.
    NLG3 addresses a shortcoming of NLG2, namely that the previous two words are not necessarily the best informants when predicting the next word.
    Instead, NLG3 assumes that conditioning on syntactically related words in the history will result on more accurate surface generation.
    The search procedure in NLG3 generates a syntactic dependency tree from top-to-bottom instead of a word s
