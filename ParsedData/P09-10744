    Our results also confirm that the assumptions adopted in some evaluations dramatically simplify the resolution task, rendering it an unrealistic surrogate for the original problem.
    In Section 4, we quantify the difficulty of a text corpus with respect to coreference resolution by analyzing performance on different resolution classes.
    Our goals are twofold: to measure the level of performance of state-of-the-art coreference resolvers on different types of anaphora, and to develop a quantitative measure for estimating coreference resolution performance on new data sets.
    We introduce a coreference performance prediction (CPP) measure and show that it accurately predicts the performance of our coreference resolver.
    As a side effect of our research, we provide a new set of much-needed benchmark results for coreference resolution under common sets of fully-specified evaluation assumptions.
  
  
    This paper studies the six most commonly used coreference resolution data sets.
