 deterministic and is guaranteed to be correct if the input dependency tree is well-formed.The complete converted treebank contains 6316 sentences and 97623 word tokens, which gives a mean sentence length of 15.5 words.
			The treebank has been divided into three non-overlapping data sets: 80% for train ing 10% for development/validation, and 10% for final testing (random samples).
			The results presented below are all from the validation set.
			(The final test set has not been used at all in the experiments reported in this paper.)
			When talking about test and validation data, we make a distinction between the sentence data, which refers to the original annotated sentences in the treebank, and the transition data, which refers to the transitions derived bysimulating the parser on these sentences.
			While the sen tence data for validation consists of 631 sentences, the corresponding transition data contains 15913 instances.For training, only transition data is relevant and the train ing data set contains
