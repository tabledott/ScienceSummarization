 distinguish shared knowledge that determines discourse salience and derives from the discourse context and the way utterances are expressed (Clark and Haviland 1977; Clark and Marshall 1981; Prince 1981b) from shared knowledge that is part of general background knowledge such as cultural assumptions (Prince 1978a; Joshi 1982) or shared knowledge that might derive from the task context (Grosz 1977).
  197 Computational Linguistics Volume 20, Number 2 Section 2.1 presents the centering rules and constraints.
  Sections 2.2 and 2.3 illus- trate the theory and the definitions with a number of examples.
  Section 2.4 discusses the centering algorithm for the resolution of zeros in Japanese.
  2.1 Rules and Constraints The centering model is very simple.
  Each utterance in a discourse segment has two structures associated with it.
  First, each utterance in a discourse has associated with it a set of discourse ntities called FORWARD-LOOKING CENTERS, Cf.
  Centers are semantic entities that are part of the discour
