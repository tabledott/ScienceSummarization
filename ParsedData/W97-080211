ever, they are neither marked nor put to systematic use nor even exactly defined.
    In contrast, GermaNet enforces the systematic usage of artificial concepts and especially marks them by a &amp;quot;r. Thus they can be cut out on the interface level if the user wishes so.
    We encode two different sorts of artificial concepts: (i) lexical gaps which are of a conceptual nature, meaning that they can be expected to be expressed in other languages (see figure 2) and (ii) proper artificial concepts (see figure 3).2 Advantages of artificial concepts are the avoidance of unmotivated co&#8212;hyponyms and a systematic structuring of the data.

    In figure 3, all concepts except f
