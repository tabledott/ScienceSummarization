 for each of the models in each language, the same set of meta parameters and features were used for all of the ten languages, due to time constraints during system development.
			The features used were7: ? For the subtrees in S(1) and S(2) ? the number of children of the root word of the subtrees; ? the number of children of the root word of the subtree to the right of the root word; ? the number of children of the root word of the subtree to the left of the root word; ? the POS tag and DEPREL of the rightmost and leftmost children; ? The POS tag of the word immediately to the right of the root word of S(2); ? The POS tag of the word immediately to the left of S(1); 6 Each dependency tree is deprojectivized before the combination occurs.
			7 S(n) denotes the nth item from the top of the stack (where S(1) is the item on top of the stack), and Q(n) denotes the nth item in the queue.
			For a description of the features names in capital letters, see the shared task description (Nivre et al, 2007).
