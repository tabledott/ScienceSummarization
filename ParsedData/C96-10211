imarily on syntactic in- formation ahme, this also turns out to be a limiting factor for its wide use: current state-of-the-art of prac- tically applicable parsing technology still falls short of robust and reliable delivery of syntactic analysis of real texts to the level of detail and precision that the filters a nd constraints described by I ,appin and l ,eass assume.
			We are particularly interested in a class of text pro- cessing applications, capable of delivery of content analysis to a depth inw~lving non-trivial amount of discourse processing, including anaphora resolution.
			The operational context prohibits us from making any assumptions concerning domain, style, and genre of input; as a result, we have developed a text processing framework which builds its capabilities entirely on the basis of a considerably shallower linguistic analysis of the input stream, thus trading off depth of base level analysis for breadth of cown:age.
