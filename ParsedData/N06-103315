 to tackle a few technical problems in the actual system.
    First, we are dealing with tree-to-string transducer rules.
    We view each left-hand side subtree as a monolithic nonterminal symbol and factor each transducer rule into two SCFG rules: one from the root nonterminal to the subtree, and the other from the subtree to the leaves.
    In this way we can uniquely reconstruct the tree-to-string derivation using the two-step SCFG deri vation.
    For example, Algorithm 1 The Linear-time Binarization Algorithm consider the following tree-to-string rule: DT x2:NN the We create a specific nonterminal, say, T859, which is a unique identifier for the left-hand side subtree and generate the following two SCFG rules: Second, besides synchronous nonterminals, terminals in the two languages can also be present, as in the above example.
    It turns out we can attach the terminals to the skeleton parse for the synchronous nonterminal strings quite freely as long as we can uniquely reconstruct the original rule fr
