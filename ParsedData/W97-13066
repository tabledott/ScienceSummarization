se kinds of resolutions happen quite often in text.
    CogNIAC recognizes knowledge intensive coreference and does not attempt to resolve such instances.
    I The named entity task at MUC-6 used a similar classification task and the best system performance was 96% precision/97% recall.
    Fortunately not all instances of pronominal anaphora require world knowledge for successful resolution.
    In lieu of full world knowledge, CogNIAC uses regularities of English usage in an attempt to mimic strategies used by humans when resolving pronouns.
    For example, the syntax of a sentence highly constrains a reflexive pronoun's antecedent.
    Also if there is just one possible antecedent in entire the prior discourse, then that entity is nearly always the correct antecedent.
    CogNIAC consists of a set of such observations implemented in Perl.
    CogNIAC has been used with a range of linguistic resources, ranging from scenarios where almost no linguistic processing of the text is done at all to partial parse
