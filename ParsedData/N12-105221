ized baseline model of McDonald et al. (2011), which only has features derived from universal part-of-speech tags, projected from English with the method of Das and Petrov (2011), to the same model when adding features derived from cross-lingual clusters.
    In both cases the feature models are the same as those used in Section 3.1, except that they are delexicalized by removing all lexical word-identity features.
    We evaluate both the PROJECTED CLUSTERS and the X-LINGUAL CLUSTERS.
    For these experiments we train the perceptron for only five epochs in order to prevent over-fitting, which is an acute problem due to the divergence between the training and testing data sets in this setting.
    Furthermore, in accordance to standard practices we only evaluate unlabeled attachment score (UAS) due to the fact that each treebank uses a different &#8211; possibly non-overlapping &#8211; label set.
    In our second set of experiments, we evaluate direct transfer of a NER system trained on EN to DE, ES and NL.
