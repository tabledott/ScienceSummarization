 then these phrases are further translated into the target language (French).
    In the example, four different target phrases are obtained, all of which are useful phrase-table entries.
    We argue that the redundancy introduced by a large suite of other languages can correct for errors in the word alignments and also provide greater generalisation, since the translation distribution is estimated from a richer set of data-points.
    For example, instances of the Danish en varm kartoffel may be used to translate several English phrases, not only a hot potato.
    In general we expect that a wider range of possible translations are found for any source phrase, simply due to the extra layer of indirection.
    So, if a source phrase tends to align with two different target phrases, then we would also expect it to align with two phrases in the &#8216;intermediate&#8217; language.
    These intermediate phrases should then each align with two target phrases, yielding up to four target phrases.
