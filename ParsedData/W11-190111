not marked.
    In the following example, the pronoun you and it would not be marked.
    (In this and following examples, an asterisk (*) before a boldface phrase identifies entity/event mentions that would not be tagged as coreferent.)
    Generic nominal mentions can be linked with referring pronouns and other definite mentions, but are not linked to other generic nominal mentions.
    This would allow linking of the bracketed mentions in (6) and (7), but not (8). sell the PhacoFlex intraocular lens, the first foldable silicone lens available for *cataract surgery.
    The lens&#8217; foldability enables it to be inserted in smaller incisions than are now possible for *cataract surgery.
    Bare plurals, as in (6) and (7), are always considered generic.
    In example (9) below, there are two generic instances of parents.
    These are marked as distinct IDENT chains (with separate chains distinguished by subscripts X, Y and Z), each containing a generic and the related referring pronouns.
