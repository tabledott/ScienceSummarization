ainst the inherited cells of carl (see Figure 7).
    A sister match is found between [animall, drinkl, drinkl] and [carl, use2, gasoline1] from carl.
    The sister match is composed of two sister paths found in the sense-network.
    The first sister path is between the verb senses drinkl and use2, which are both types of expending (Figure 8).
    The second path is between the noun senses drinkl and gasolinel, which are both types of liquid (Figure 9).
    The effect of the network paths is to establish correspondences between the two cells such that an analogy is &amp;quot;discovered&amp;quot; that animals drink potable liquids as cars use gasoline.
    Note that, like Gentner's (1983) systematicity principle, the correspondences found are structural and independent of the content of the word senses they connect.
    Note also that the two cells have an underlying similarity or &amp;quot;ground&amp;quot; (Richards 1936) in that both refer to the expenditure of liquids.
