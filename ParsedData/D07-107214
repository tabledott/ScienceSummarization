as the base distribution for generating the binary production distribution from a DP centered on ??T (c).centrated in the upper left, just like the top-level dis tribution ??T . Note that we have replaced the general 691 G0 and F (?Ezi) pair with Dirichlet(?
			E) and Multinomial(?Ezi) to specialize to natural language, but there is no difficulty in working with parse trees with arbitrary non-multinomial observations or more sophisticated word models.
			In many natural language applications, there is a hard distinction between pre-terminal symbols(those that only emit a word) and non-terminal sym bols (those that only rewrite as two non-terminal or pre-terminal symbols).
			This can be accomplished by letting ?T = (0, 0), which forces a draw ?Tz to assign probability 1 to one rule type.
			An alternative definition of an HDP-PCFG would be as follows: for each symbol z, draw a distributionover left child symbols lz ? DP(?)
			and an inde pendent distribution over right child symbols rz ?DP(?).
			Then define
