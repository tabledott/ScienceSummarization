 on the test set.
    We present results in three different formats.
    For analyzing our binary classifiers, we use Detection Error Tradeoff (DET) curves and precision/recall corpus as divided into training, development and test sets.
    The dev and test sets are the same size and each consist of approximately 5% of the data for each grade level. measures.
    For comparison to other methods, e.g.
    Flesch-Kincaid and Lexile, which are not binary classifiers, we consider the percentage of articles which are misclassified by more than one grade level.
    Detection Error Tradeoff curves show the tradeoff between misses and false alarms for different threshold values for the classifiers.
    &#8220;Misses&#8221; are positive examples of a class that are misclassified as negative examples; &#8220;false alarms&#8221; are negative examples misclassified as positive.
    DET curves have been used in other detection tasks in language processing, e.g.
    Martin et al. (1997).
    We use these curves to visualiz
