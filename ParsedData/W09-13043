    Contrary to current practice to only detect modality, our system also determines the part of the sentence that is hedged.
    We are not aware of other systems that perform this task.
    The system is based on a similar system that finds the scope of negation cues (Morante and Daelemans, 2009).
    We show that the system performs well for this task and that the same scope finding approach can be applied to both negation and hedging.
    To investigate the robustness of the approach, the system is tested on three subcorpora of the BioScope corpus that represent diff
