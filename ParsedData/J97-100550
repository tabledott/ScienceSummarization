s and numbers, but which were otherwise identical to Chafe's (1980) original transcriptions.
    Boundary data, which had been collected but not analyzed, was not available.
    Comprehensive operational definitions for recognition of reference features (coref and infer) are documented in Passonneau (1994).
    The last NP feature, global.pro, is computed from the coding of other features and of previously occurring boundaries.
    All three NP features are applied in the context of FICUs (Passonneau 1994).
    An FICU contains a single tensed clause that is neither a verb argument nor a restrictive relative clause, potentially with sentence fragments or repairs.
    If a new FICU (c) begins in prosodic phrase P,&#177;1, then NPs in CI are compared with NPs in previous FICUs and the feature values assigned as follows:I&#176; Note that the global.pro feature is defined in a manner that depends on incremental assignment of boundaries and coding of features.
    To evaluate global.pro for an utterance C1 require
