ure (or past) lexical decisions, others are purely local, in the sense that they do not affect the lexicalization of other semantic roles.
    Consider the case of time adjuncts that express a single point in time, and assume that the generator has already decided to use a prepositional phrase for one of them.
    There are several forms of such adjuncts, e.g., { at five.
    She left on Monday. in February.
    In terms of their interactions with the rest of the sentence, these manifestations of the adjunct are identical.
    The use of different prepositions is an interlexical constraint between the semantic and syntactic heads of the PP that does not propagate outside the PP.
    Consequently, the selection of the preposition can be postponed until the very end.
    Existing generation models however select the preposition according to defaults or randomly among possible alternatives or by explicitly encoding the lexical constraints.
    The PENMAN generation system (Penman, 1989) defaults the preposition
