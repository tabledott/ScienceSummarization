    One ANLT entry covers two COMLEX entries given the different treatment of the relevant complements but the classifier keeps them distinct.
    The corpus for examples of further classes we judge valid, in which take a and infinitive complement, as in seems to to be insane, a passive participle, as in depressed. comparison illustrates the problem of errors of omission common to computational lexicons constructed manually and also from dictionaries.
    All classes for exemplified in the corpus data, but for example, eight classes (out of a possible 27 in the merged entry) are not present, so comparison only to the merged entry would give an unreasonably low estimate of recall.
