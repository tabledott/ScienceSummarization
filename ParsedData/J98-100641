within 1% or 2% of manually tagged training.
    Line and work, however, showed a substantial decrease in performance.
    In the case of line, this might be due to overly specific training contexts.
    Almost half of the training examples for the 'formation' sense of line come from one relative, picket line.
    In fact, all of the monosemous relatives, except for rivet line and trap line, are human formations.
    This may have skewed training so that the classifier performs poorly on other uses of line as formation.
    In order to compare our results with those reported in Yarowsky (1992), we trained and tested on the same two senses of the noun duty that Yarowsky had tested ('obligation' and 'tax').
    He reported that his thesaurus-based approach yielded 96% precision with 100% recall.
    TLC used training examples based on monosemous WordNet relatives and correctly identified the senses with 93.5% precision at 100% recall.
    Table 6 shows TLC's performance on the other eight words after training w
