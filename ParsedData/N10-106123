    While Bengston and Roth (2008) do not report on the full system mention task, they do report on the more optimistic setting where mention detection is performed but non-gold mentions are removed for evaluation using an oracle.
    On this more lenient setting, they report 78.4 B3 on the A04CU test set.
    Our model yields 80.3.
  
  
    We now discuss errors and improvements made by our system.
    One frequent source of error is the merging of mentions with explicitly contrasting modifiers, such as new president and old president.
    While it is not unusual for a single entity to admit multiple modifiers, the particular modifiers new and old are incompatible in a way that new and popular 9Note that we are still penalized for marking a spurious mention coreferent with an annotated one.

    Our model does not represent the negative covariance between these modifiers.
