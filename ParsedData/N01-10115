 a 2 x 2 contingency table.
    The value of n11 shows how many times the bigram big cat occurs in the corpus.
    The value of n12 shows how often bigrams occur where big is the first word and cat is not the second.
    The counts in n+1 and n1+ indicate how often words big and cat occur as the first and second words of any bigram in the corpus.
    The total number of bigrams in the corpus is represented by n++.
    (Cressie and Read, 1984) introduce the power divergence family of goodness of fit statistics.
    A number of well known statistics belong to this family, including the likelihood ratio statistic G2 and Pearson's X2 statistic.
    These measure the divergence of the observed (nij) and expected (mij) bigram counts, where mij is estimated based on the assumption that the component words in the bigram occur together strictly by chance: data distributions.
    However, (Cressie and Read, 1984) suggest that there are cases where Pearson's statistic is more reliable than the likelihood ratio and that
