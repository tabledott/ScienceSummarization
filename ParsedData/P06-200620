t type, could be computed from the derivation tree.
  
  
    We selected the same 560 sentences as test data as Kaplan et al., and all modifications that we made to our system (see &#167;2.4) were made on the basis of (very limited) information from other sections of WSJ text.3 We have made no use of the further 140 held out sentences in DepBank.
    The results we report below are derived by choosing the most probable tag for each word returned by the PoS tagger and by choosing the unweighted GR set returned for the most probable parse with no lexical information guiding parse ranking.
  
  
    Our parser produced rooted sentential analyses for 84% of the test items; actual coverage is higher croaverages.
    The macroaverage is calculated by taking the average of each measure for each individual relation and feature; the microaverage measures are calculated from the counts for all relations and features.4 Indentation of GRs shows degree of specificity of the relation.
    Thus, mod scores are microaverage
