crementally as a sum of various y terms, which are computed in some order and accumulated to finally yield the value of x.8 (2) Transitions are denoted by , with predecessor states on the left and successor states on the right.
    (3) The forward and inner probabilities of states are notated in brackets after each state, e.g., kX A.Ytt [a,7] is shorthand for a = a,(kX ).Yu), 7 = -y,(kX i: kX &#8212;+ A.Yft [a, 7] &gt; i: ,Y .v [a',-y'] for all productions Y v. The new probabilities can be computed as a' += a &#8226; P(Y v) = P(Y v) Note that only the forward probability is accumulated; 7 is not used in this step.
    Rationale, a' is the sum of all path probabilities leading up to kX A.Yit, times the probability of choosing production Y v. The value -y' is just a special case of the definition. i: kX A.ap, [a, 7] i +1 : kX&#8212;&gt; Aa.P, [a',71 for all states with terminal a matching input at position i.
    Then =-- a 7 Rationale.
    Scanning does not involve any new choices, since the terminal was alrea
