  I~ cau bc shown that aualyses~ that require ex tensions of TA($s using multi-component adjoining (simultaneous adjunc lion of a set of trees in distinct nodes of an dementary tree) ~ defined in []oshi 1987, Kroeh 1987], can be easily stated iu FTAGs.
  It is possible to parse an I,"]?A(I grammar using the Earley-style parsel given by [Sehabes t aL 1988].
  This l,;arley-style parser can extended in the same way that Sheiber extended the Earley parser lee PAI3I: II [Slfieber 1985b].
  The reason this extensi,~lt of the TAll parser to one fl)t I:FAG is po,~;sible fi)llows from the lact that the treatment of haviJ,g the t and b feature structures fl)r every node in FI)A(~ is compatible with the I characterization, adopted in the parsing algorithm in [Schabes t al.
  :19881, of a node in le.rms of two subs[rings.
