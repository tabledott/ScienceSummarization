    For example, a compositional phrase would typically be excluded from a hard-copy dictionary since its constituent words would already be listed.
    These strategies allow hard-copy dictionaries to remain compact.
    As mentioned, we wish to find MWU headwords for machine-readable dictionaries (MRDs).
    Although space is not an issue in MRDs, we desire to follow the lexicographic practice of reducing redundancy.
    As Sproat indicated, &amp;quot;simply expanding the dictionary to encompass every word one is ever likely to encounter is wrong: it fails to take advantage of regularities&amp;quot; (1992, p. xiii).
    Our goal is to identify an automatic, knowledge-free algorithm that finds all and only those collocations where it is necessary to supply a definition.
    &#8220;Knowledge-free&#8221; means that the process should proceed without human input (other than, perhaps, indicating whitespace and punctuation).
    This seems like a solved problem.
    Many collocation-finders exist, so one mig
