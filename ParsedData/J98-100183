n Vitro.
    In vitro evaluation, despite its artificiality, enables close examination of the problems plaguing a given task.
    In its most basic form, this type of evaluation (also called variously performance evaluation: Hirschman and Thompson [1996]; assessment: Bimbot, Chollet, and Paoloni [1994]; or declarative evaluation: Arnold, Sadler, and Humphreys [1993]) involves comparison of the output of a system for a given input, using measures such as precision and recall.
    SENSEVAL currently envisages this type of evaluation for WSD results.
    Alternatively, in vitro evaluation can focus on study of the behavior and performance of systems on a series of test suites representing the range of linguistic problems likely to arise in attempting WSD (diagnostic evaluation: Hirschman and Thompson [1996]; or typological evaluation: Arnold, Sadler, and Humphreys 1993).
    Considerably deeper understanding of the factors involved in the disambiguation task is required before appropriate test suites for typolog
