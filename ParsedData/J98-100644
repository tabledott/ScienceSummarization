any different domains of discourse.
    The existence of nontopical senses also limits the applicability of the &amp;quot;one sense per discourse&amp;quot; generalization of Gale, Church, and Yarowsky (1992b), who observed that, within a document, a repeated word is almost always used in the same sense.
    Future work should be directed toward developing methods for determining when a word has a nontopical sense.
    One approach to this problem is to look for a word that appears in many more topical domains than its total number of senses.
    Because the supply of manually tagged training data will always be limited, we propose a method to obtain training data automatically using commonly available materials: exploiting WordNet's lexical relations to harvest training examples from LDC corpora or even the World Wide Web.
    We found this method to be effective, although not as effective as using manually tagged training.
    We have presented the components of a system for acquiring unsupervised training m
