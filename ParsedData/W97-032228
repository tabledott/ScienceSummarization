 discussed for automatically selecting seeds; one is to identify collocations that uniquely distinguish between senses.
    For plant, the collocations manufacturing plant and living plant make such a distinction.
    Based on 106 examples of manufacturing plant and 82 examples of living plant this algorithm is able to distinguish between two senses of plant for 7,350 examples with 97 percent accuracy.
    Experiments with 11 other words using collocation seeds result in an average accuracy of 96 percent.
    While (Yarowsky, 1995) does not discuss distinguishing more than 2 senses of a word, there is no immediate reason to doubt that the &amp;quot;one sense per collocation&amp;quot; rule (Yarowsky, 1993) would still hold for a larger number of senses.
    In future work we will evaluate using the &amp;quot;one sense per collocation&amp;quot; rule to seed our various methods.
    This may help in dealing with very skewed distributions of senses since we currently select collocations based simply on frequency.
