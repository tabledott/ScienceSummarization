even though this construction is often described as &#8220;nonconstituent coordination.&#8221; In this example, the fund reached and investors disagreed with have the same type, allowing them to be coordinated, resulting in the fund reached but investors disagreed with having the type S[dcl]/NP.
    Note also that it is this flexible notion of constituency which leads to so-called spurious ambiguity, because even the simple sentence the fund reached an agreement will have more than one derivation, with each derivation leading to the same set of predicate&#8211;argument dependencies.
    Forward composition is generalized to allow additional arguments to the right of the Z category in (5).
    For example, the following combination allows analysis of sentences such as I offered, and may give, a flower to a policeman (Steedman 2000): may give ((S\NP)/PP)/NP This example shows how the categories for may and give combine, resulting in a category of the same type as offered, which can then be coordinated.
