pairs in the question and their corre sponding, aligned words in the answer.
			The hidden variable treatment lets us avoid commitment to any one x mapping, making the method more robust tonoisy parses (after all, the parser is not 100% ac curate) and any wrong assumptions imposed by the model (that |x(i)| = 1, for example, or that syntactic transformations can explain the connection between q and a at all).4 Our model, then, defines p(q, ?q | a, ?a) = ? x p(q, ?q, x | a, ?a) (2) where ?q and ?a are the question tree and answer tree, respectively.
			The stochastic process defined by our model factors cleanly into recursive steps thatderive the question from the top down.
			The QG defines a grammar for this derivation; the grammar de pends on the specific answer.
			Let ? iw refer to the subtree of ?w rooted at wi.
			The model is defined by: p(?
			iq | qi, ?q(i), x(i), ?a) = (3) p#kids(|{j : ?q(j) = i, j &lt; i}| | qi, left) ?p#kids(|{j : ?q(j) = i, j &gt; i}| | qi, right) ? ?
			j:?q(j)=i m?
			x(j)=0 pki
