es a string of French words, he has actually conceived of a string of English words, which he translated mentally.
    Given a French string f, the job of our translation system is to find the string e that the native speaker had in mind when he produced f. We minimize our chance of error by choosing that English string e for which Pr (e If ) is greatest.
    Using Bayes' theorem, we can write Since the denominator here is independent of e, finding &#234; is the same as finding e so as to make the product Pr(e) Pr(fl e) as large as possible.
    We arrive, then, at the Fundamental Equation of Machine Translation: As a representation of the process by which a human being translates a passage from French to English, this equation is fanciful at best.
    One can hardly imagine someone rifling mentally through the list of all English passages computing the product of the a priori probability of the passage, Pr(e), and the conditional probability of the French passage given the English passage, POI e).
