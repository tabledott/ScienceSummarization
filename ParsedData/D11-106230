l remark, considering that in the creation of a TE dataset the manual check of the annotated pairs represents a minor cost, even the involvement of experts to filter out wrong annotations would not decrease the cost-effectiveness of the proposed methodology.
  
  
    There is an increasing need of annotated data to develop new solutions to the Textual Entailment problem, explore new entailment-related tasks, and set up experimental frameworks targeting real-world applications.
    Following the recent trends promoting annotation efforts that go beyond the established RTE Challenge framework (unidirectional entailment between monolingual T-H pairs), in this paper we addressed the multilingual dimension of the problem.
    Our primary goal was the creation of large-scale collections of entailment pairs for different language combinations.
    Besides that, we considered cost effectiveness and replicability as additional requirements.
    To achieve our objectives, we developed a &#8220;divide and conquer&#8221
