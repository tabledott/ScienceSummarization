   These tools can then be used by other systems to address more complex tasks.
    For example, previous work has addressed low-level tasks such as tagging a free-style corpus with part-of-speech information (Church 1988), aligning a bilingual corpus (Gale and Church 1991b; Brown, Lai, and Mercer 1991), and producing a list of collocations (Smadja 1993).
    While each of these tools is based on simple statistics and tackles elementary tasks, we have demonstrated with our work on Champollion that by combining them, one can reach new levels of complexity in the automatic treatment of natural languages.
