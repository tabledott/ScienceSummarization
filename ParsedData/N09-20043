 by leveraging the predictions of semantic parsers.
    We would like to exploit automatic semantic parsers to identify inconsistent semantic frame and role mappings between the input source sentences and their output translations.
    However, we take note of the difficult experience in making syntactic and semantic models conBoulder, Colorado, June 2009. c&#65533;2009 Association for Computational Linguistics tribute to improving SMT accuracy.
    On the one hand, there is reason to be optimistic.
    Over the past decade, we have seen an accumulation of evidence that SMT accuracy can be improved via tree-structured and syntactic models (e.g., Wu 1997; Wu and Chiang 2009), and more recently, work from lexical semantics has also at long last been successfully applied to increasing SMT accuracy, in the form of techniques adapted from word sense disambiguation models (Chan et al. 2007; Gimenez and M&#710;rquez 2007b; Carpuat and Wu 2007).
    On the other hand, both directions saw unexpected disappointments al
