 used by the third filter.
    We denote by N the total number of nouns and verbs in the search space.
    C represents the number of nouns and verbs that can be reached by both nominals.
    In addition rirtotal is the number of concepts along all paths established, whereas (Riloff and Jones 1999) note that the performance of the mutual bootstrapping algorithm can deteriorate rapidly if erroneous rules are entered.
    To make the algorithm more robust we use the same solution by introducing a second level of bootrapping.
    The outer level, called meta-bootstrapping identifies the most reliable k rules based on semantic consistency and discard all the others before restarting the mutual bootstrapping loop again.
    In our experiments we have retained only those rules for which the new performance, given by the F-measure was larger than the median of the past four loops.
    The formula for the van Rijsbergen's F-measure combines the precision P with the recall R in F =
