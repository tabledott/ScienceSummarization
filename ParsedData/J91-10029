    Each segment purpose specifies how the segment contributes to the overall discourse purpose.
    There are two structural relationships between these segments.
    The first is called a dominance relation, which occurs when the satisfaction (i.e., successful completion) of one segment's intention contributes to the satisfaction of another segment's intention.
