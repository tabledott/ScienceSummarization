uch as the independence of grammar productions in the case of the PCFG model, or the independence of the composition operations in the case of the LTAG model, and we would argue that these assumptions are no less reasonable for the Chinese grammar than they are for that of English.
    While results for the two languages are far from equal, we believe that further tuning of the head rules, and analysis of development test set errors will yield significant performance gains on Chinese to close the gap.
    Finally, we fully expect that absolute performance will increase greatly as additional highquality Chinese parse data becomes available.

    We would greatly like to acknowledge the researchers at BBN who allowed us to use their model: Ralph Weischedel, Scott Miller, Lance Ramshaw, Heidi Fox and Sean Boisen.
    We would also like to thank Mike Collins and our advisors Aravind Joshi and Mitch Marcus.
