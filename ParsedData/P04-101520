 the already built part of the tree.
    All of the labels that we will include in our feature sets are i levels above the current node in the tree, and j nodes to the left, which we will denote Lij.
    Hence, L00 is the node label itself; L10 is the label of parent of the current node; L01 is the label of the sibling of the node, immediately to its left; L11 is the label of the sibling of the parent node, etc.
    We also include: the lexical head of the current constituent (CL); the c-commanding lexical head (CC) and its POS (CCP); and the look-ahead word (LK) and its POS (LKP).
    All of these features are discussed at more length in the citations above.
    Table 2 presents the baseline feature set.
    In addition to the baseline feature set, we will also present results using features that would be more difficult to embed in a generative model.
    We included some punctuation-oriented features, which included (i) a Boolean feature indicating whether the final punctuation is a question mark or not; (i
