d on the set of non-projective structures only (22.93%).
    However, this is still very far from the well-nestedness constraint, which has almost perfect coverage on both data sets.
    As a general result, our experiments confirm previous studies on non-projective dependency parsing (Nivre and Nilsson, 2005; Hall and Nov&#225;k, 2005; McDonald and Pereira, 2006): The phenomenon of non-projectivity cannot be ignored without also ignoring a significant portion of real-world data (around 15% for DDT, and 23% for PDT).
    At the same time, already a small step beyond projectivity accounts for almost all of the structures occurring in these treebanks.
    More specifically, we find that already an edge degree restriction of d &lt; 1 covers 98.24% of DDT and 99.54% of PDT, while the same restriction on the gap degree scale achieves a coverage of 99.84% (DDT) and 99.57% (PDT).
    Together with the previous evidence that both measures also have computational advantages, this provides a strong indication for the u
