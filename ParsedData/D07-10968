es and that a deeper analysis of the factors involved in this variation was an important problem for future research.
			In order to provide an extended empirical foundation for such research, we tried to select the languages and data sets for this year?s task based on the following desiderata:?
			The selection of languages should be typolog ically varied and include both new languages and old languages (compared to 2006).
			The creation of the data sets should involve as little conversion as possible from the original treebank annotation, meaning that preference should be given to treebanks with dependency annotation.
			The training data sets should include at least 50,000 tokens and at most 500,000 tokens.2 The final selection included data from Arabic, Basque, Catalan, Chinese, Czech, English, Greek, Hungarian, Italian, and Turkish.
			The treebanks from 2The reason for having an upper bound on the training set size was the fact that, in 2006, some participants could not train on all the data for some l
