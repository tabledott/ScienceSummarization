 topic and style (and hence vocabulary) usually stays the same over many sentences in sequence.
    When we collect only 300 sentences in sequence, certain Therefore, better test sets of 300 sentences may be constructed by sampling these sentences from different parts of the corpus.
    In an effort to collect better test sets, we now place into test set the sentences .
    Let us call this a broad sample.
    Again, we measure translation quality on each of these 100 broad samples.
    Figure 3 shows that the BLEU scores are now closer together &#8212; ranging from 27% to 31%.
    Obtaining a BLEU score for a translation system on a given test set is not very meaningful by itself.
    We want to use the metric to compare different translation systems.
    In a third preliminary experiment, we compared for each of the 300 broad samples, the BLEU score for the Spanish system against the BLEU score for the Danish system.
    Results are in Figure 4.
    The Spanish system is better by up to 4%.
