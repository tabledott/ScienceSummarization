ll, Minnen, and Briscoe (1999) in regarding them as a fairer, and ultimately more useful, standard against which to evaluate the output of parsers trained on CCGbank than the syntactic derivations themselves.
  
  
    The Wall Street Journal subcorpus of the Penn Treebank contains about 50,000 sentences, or 1 million words, annotated with part-of-speech tags and phrase-structure trees: These trees are relatively flat: modals and auxiliaries introduce a new VP level, whereas verb modifiers and arguments typically appear all at the same level, as sisters of the main verb.
    A similarly flat annotation style is adopted at the sentence level.
    NPs are flat as well, with all complex modifiers appearing at the same NP level, and compound nouns typically lacking any internal structure.
    The translation algorithm needs to identify syntactic heads, and has to distinguish between complements and modifiers.
    In the Treebank, this information is not explicit.
