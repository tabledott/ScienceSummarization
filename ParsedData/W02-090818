for possible synonyms, and the other modifiers provide finer grain distinctions used to rank possible synonyms.
    Figure 4 shows the 5 canonical attributes for pants.
    This canonical vector is a better general description of the term pants, since similar terms are likely to appear as the direct object of wear, even though it still contains the idiomatic attributes (direct-obj, wet) and (direct-obj, scare).
    One final difficulty this example shows is that attributes like (direct-obj, get) are not informative.
    We know this because (direct-obj, get) appears with 8769 different terms, which means the algorithm may perform a large number of unnecessary full comparisons since (direct-obj, get) could be a canonical attribute for many terms.
    To avoid this problem, we apply a maximum cutoff on the number of terms the attribute appears with.
    With limited experimentation, we have found that TTESTLOG is the best weight function for selecting canonical attributes.
    This may be because the extra log2
