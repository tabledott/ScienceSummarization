metric grows in a roughly linear fashion with the difference between the reference and the experimental segmentations.
    In addition, we feel that WD is a more meaningful metric than Pk.
    Comparing two stretches of text to see how many discrepancies occur between the reference and the algorithm&#8217;s result seems more intuitive than determining how often two text units are incorrectly labeled as being in different segments.
