tion is introduced by the use of a multinomial model, which presupposes the following: The events T, are mutually disjoint.
    This assumption is not entirely valid, since sometimes it is possible to translate a source language word to several target language words, such that all the translations are valid.
    For example, consider the Hebrew sentence (from the Ha-Aretz daily newspaper, November 27, 1990) whose English translation is (11) The resignation of Thatcher is not {related connected} to the negotiations with Damascus.
    In this sentence (but not in others), the ambiguous word qshura can equally well be translated to either 'related' or 'connected.'
    In terms of the probabilistic model, the two corresponding events, i.e., the two alternative English tuples that contain these words, = (verb&#8211;comp: relate to negotiation) and T2 = (verb&#8211;comp: connect to negotiation) are both correct, thus the events T1 and T2 both occur (they are not disjoint).
    However, we have to make this assumpti
