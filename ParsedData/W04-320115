nstituent loss function does not exactly correspond to the standard scoring metrics, such as F1 or crossing brackets, but shares the sensitivity to the number of differences between trees.
    We have not thoroughly investigated the exact interplay between the various loss choices and the various parsing metrics.
    We used the constituent loss in our experiments. marginals as Qm(&#181;(&#945;)), where &#181;(&#945;) is the vector with components &#181;i,r(&#945;i), and Qm(&#181;) is defined as: where li,r = l(xi, yi, r), &#966;i,r = &#966;(xi, r) and Ii,r = I(xi, yi, r).
    This follows from substituting the factored definitions of the feature representation &#934; and loss function L together with definition of marginals.
    Having expressed the objective in terms of a polynomial number of variables, we now turn to the constraints on these variables.
    The feasible set for &#945; is Now let &#916;m be the space of marginal vectors which are feasible: Then our original optimization problem can be refram
