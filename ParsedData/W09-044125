logy.
    The cost of shifts is also increased in HTER, strongly penalizing the movement of phrases within the hypothesis, while Adequacy and Fluency give a much lower cost to such errors.
    Some of the differences between HTER and both fluency and adequacy can be attributed to the different systems used.
    The MT systems evaluated with HTER are all highly performing state of the art systems, while the systems used for adequacy and fluency are older MT systems.
    The differences between Adequacy and Fluency are smaller, but there are still significant differences.
    In particular, the cost of shifts is over twice as high for the fluency optimized system than the adequacy optimized system, indicating that the movement of phrases, as expected, is only slightly penalized when judging meaning, but can be much more harmful to the fluency of a translation.
    Fluency however favors paraphrases more strongly than the edit costs optimized for adequacy.
    This might indicate that paraphrases are used to gen
