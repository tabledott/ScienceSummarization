dicators have faced a knowledge acquisition bottleneck, characterized byeither substantial human involvement for each word, and/or incomplete vocalmlary coverage.
  The AI community has enjoyed some success hand- coding detailed "word experts" (Small and Rieger, 1982; HirsL 1987), but this labor intensive process has severely limited coverage beyond small vocabularies.
  Others such as Lesk (1986), Walker (1987), Veronis and Ide (1990), and Guthrie et al.
  (1991) have turned to machine readable dictionaries (MRDs) in an effort to achieve broad vocabulary coverage.
  MRDs have the useful property that some indicative words for each sense are directly available in numbered definitions and examples.
  However, definitions arc often too short to provide an adequate set of indicators, and those words which are found lack significance weights to identify which are crucial and which are merely chaff.
  Dictionaries provide well structured but incomplete information.
  Recently, many have turned to text corpora to b
