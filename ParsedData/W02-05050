  Machine Transliteration Of Names In Arabic Texts
  
    We present a transliteration algorithm based on sound and spelling mappings using finite state machines.
    The transliteration models can be trained on relatively small lists of names.
    We introduce a new spelling-based model that is much more accurate than state-of-the-art phonetic-based models and can be trained on easier-toobtain training data.
    We apply our transliteration algorithm to the transliteration of names from Arabic into English.
    We report on the accuracy of our algorithm based on exact-matching criterion and based on human-subjective evaluation.
    We also compare the accuracy of our system to the accuracy of human translators.
  
  
    Human translators and machine translation systems are often faced with the task of transliterating phrases like person names and locations.
    Transliteration is the process of replacing words in the source language with their approximate phonetic or spelling equivalents in the target lang
