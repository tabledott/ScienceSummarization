    The external lexicons we used for the lexicon-based features come from various sources including named entities collected from Wikipedia and the Chinese section of the UN website, named entities collected by Harbin Institute of Technology, the ADSO dictionary, EMM News Explorer, Online Chinese Tools, Online Dictionary from Peking University and HowNet.
    There are 423,224 distinct entries in all the external lexicons.
