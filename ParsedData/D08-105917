he correct parent) and by the percentage of complete matches, in which all words excluding punctuation have been assigned the correct parent.
    Since the beam size affects all three parsers, we study its influence first; here we show the effect on the transition-based parser.
    Figure 6 shows different accuracy curves using the development data, each with a different beam size B.
    The X-axis represents the number of training iterations, and the Y-axis the precision of lexical heads.
    The parsing accuracy generally increases as the beam size increases, while the quantity of increase becomes very small when B becomes large enough.
    The decoding times after the first training iteration are 10.2s, 27.3s, 45.5s, 79.0s, 145.4s, 261.3s and 469.5s, respectively, when B = 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64.
    In the rest of the experiments, we set B = 64 in order to obtain the highest possible accuracy.
    When B = 1, the transition-based parser becomes a deterministic parser.
    By comparing the curves when B =
