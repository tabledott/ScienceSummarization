rresponding adjective and noun vectors after normalizing them (non-normalized addition was also tried, but it did not work nearly as well as the normalized variant).
    Multiplicative vectors (mult method) were obtained by componentwise multiplication of the adjective and noun vectors (normalization does not matter here since it amounts to multiplying the composite vector by a scalar, and the cosine similarity measure we use is scale-invariant).
    Finally, the adj and noun baselines use the adjective and noun vectors, respectively, as surrogates of the AN vector.
    For the add, mult, adj and noun methods, we ran the tests of Section 6 not only in the SVD-reduced space, but also in the original 10K-dimensional cooccurrence space.
    Only the mult method achieved better performance in the original space.
    We conjecture that this is because the SVD dimensions can have negative values, leading to counter-intuitive results with component-wise multiplication (multiplying large opposite-sign values results
