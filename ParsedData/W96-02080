  Comparative Experiments On Disambiguating Word Senses: An Illustration Of The Role Of Bias In Machine Learning
  
    This paper describes an experimental comparison of seven different learning algorithms on the problem of learning to disambiguate the meaning of a word from context.
    The algorithms tested include statistical, neural-network, decision-tree, rule-based, and case-based classification techniques.
    The specific problem tested involves disambiguating six senses of the word &amp;quot;line&amp;quot; using the words in the current and proceeding sentence as context.
    The statistical and neural-network methods perform the best on this particular problem and we discuss a potential reason for this obdifference.
    We also discuss the role of in machine learning and its importance in explaining performance differences observed on specific problems.
