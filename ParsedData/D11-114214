ith the Devil,&#8221; would result in the relation phrase made a deal with, instead of the uninformative made.
    Finally, we require the relation phrase to appear between its two arguments in the sentence.
    This is a common constraint that has been implicitly enforced in other open extractors. terms of dependency parse features that would capture the non-contiguous relation phrases in Table 3.
    Previous work has shown that dependency paths do indeed boost the recall of relation extraction systems (Wu and Weld, 2010; Mintz et al., 2009).
    While using dependency path features allows for a more flexible model of relations, it significantly increases processing time, which is problematic for Web-scale extraction.
    Further, we have found that this increased recall comes at the cost of lower precision on Web text (see Section 5).
    The results in Table 3 are similar to Banko and Etzioni&#8217;s findings that a set of eight POS patterns cover a large fraction of binary verbal relation phrases.
