bbs sampler can be constructed, where only assignments z need to be sampled, whereas the dependency on distributions &#952; and &#981; can be integrated out analytically.
    In the case of MAS we also use maximum aposteriori estimates of the sentiment predictor parameters bay, Jy,f and Jay,f.
    The MAP estimates for parameters bay, Jy,f and Jay,f are obtained by using stochastic gradient ascent.
    The direction of the gradient is computed simultaneously with running a chain by generating several assignments at each step and averaging over the corresponding gradient estimates.
    For details on computing gradients for loglinear graphical models with Gibbs sampling we refer the reader to (Neal, 1992).
    Space constraints do not allow us to present either the derivation or a detailed description of the sampling algorithm.
    However, note that the conditional distribution used in sampling decomposes into two parts: where v&#8217;, r&#8217; and z&#8217; are vectors of assignments of sliding windows, cont
