ce in the text) by counting pairs of verbs that share coreferring arguments within documents and computing the pointwise mutual information (PMI) between these verb-argument pairs.
    The algorithm creates chains by clustering event slots using their PMI scores, and we showed this use of co-referring arguments improves event relatedness.
    Our previous work, however, has two major limitations.
    First, the model did not express any information about the protagonist, such as its type or role.
    Role information (such as knowing whether a filler is a location, a person, a particular class of people, or even an inanimate object) could crucially inform learning and inference.
    Second, the model only represents one participant (the protagonist).
    Representing the other entities involved in all event slots in the narrative could potentially provide valuable information.
    We discuss both of these extensions next.
    The Chambers and Jurafsky (2008) narrative chains do not specify what type of argume
