urrent token is outside of any chunk.
    Examples of these five representations are shown in Table 1.
    If we have to identify the grammatical class of each chunk, we represent them by a pair of an I/O/B/E/S label and a class label.
    For example, in IOB2 representation, B-VP label is given to a token which represents the beginning of a verb base phrase (VP).
    Basically, SVMs are binary classifiers, thus we must extend SVMs to multi-class classifiers in order to classify three (B,I,O) or more (B,I,O,E,S) classes.
    There are two popular methods to extend a binary classification task to that of classes.
    One is one class vs. all others.
    The idea is to build classifiers so as to separate one class from all others.
    The other is pairwise classification.
    The idea is to build classifiers considering all pairs of classes, and final decision is given by their weighted voting.
    There are a number of other methods to extend SVMs to multiclass classifiers.
    For example, Dietterich and Baki
