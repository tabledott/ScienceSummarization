h-space for antecedents.
    Their major drawback is that they require a great deal of skilled hand-crafting that, unfortunately, usually does not scale in broader application domains.
    Hence, proposals were made to replace these high-level &amp;quot;symbolic&amp;quot; categories by statistically interpreted occurrence patterns derived from large text corpora (Dagan and Itai 1990).
    Preferences then reflect patterns of statistically significant lexical usage rather than introspective abstractions of linguistic patterns such as syntactic parallelism or pragmatic alignment.
    Among the heuristic approaches to anaphora resolution, those which consider the identification of heuristics a machine learning (ML) problem are particularly interesting, since their heuristics dynamically adapt to the textual data.
    Furthermore, ML procedures operate on incomplete parses (hence, they accept noisy data), which distinguishes them from the requirements of perfect information and high data fidelity imposed by almos
