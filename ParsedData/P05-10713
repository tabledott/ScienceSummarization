 &#8216;my&#8217;).
    In our approach, tokenizing and morphologically tagging (including part-of-speech tagging) are the same operation, which consists of three phases.
    First, we obtain from our morphological analyzer a list of all possible analyses for the words of a given sentence.
    We discuss the data and our lexicon in more detail in Section 4.
    Second, we apply classifiers for ten morphological features to the words of the text.
    The full list of features is shown in Figure 2, which also identifies possible values and which word classes (POS) can express these features.
    We discuss the training and decoding of these classifiers in Section 5.
    Third, we choose among the analyses returned by the morphological analyzer by using the output of the classifiers.
    This is a non-trivial task, as the classifiers may not fully disambiguate the options, or they may be contradictory, with none of them fully matching any one choice.
    We investigate different ways of making this choice in Sec
