    Each language pair had two test sets drawn from the proceedings of the European parliament, or from newspaper articles.1 The test data for this year&#8217;s task differed from previous years&#8217; data.
    Instead of only reserving a portion of the training data as the test set, we hired people to translate news articles that were drawn from a variety of sources during November and December of 2007.
    We refer to this as the News test set.
    A total of 90 articles were selected, 15 each from a variety of Czech-, English-, French-, German-, Hungarianand Spanish-language news sites:2 Hungarian: Napi (3 documents), Index (2), Origo (5), N&#180;epszabads&#180;ag (2), HVG (2), Uniospez (1) The translations were created by the members of EuroMatrix consortium who hired a mix of professional and non-professional translators.
