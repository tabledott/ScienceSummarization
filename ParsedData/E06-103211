es and without reducing the Bleu score.
    Thus: which will  |he was  |,  |when  |taken | Appeared calm  |to the American plane |to Miami , Florida. receives an identical score to the hypothesis translation in Table 1.
    If b is the number of bigram matches in a hypothesis translation, and k is its length, then there are (k &#8722; b)!
    (1) possible ways to generate similarly scored items using only the words in the hypothesis translation.2 Thus for the example hypothesis translation there are at least 40,320 different ways of permuting the sentence and receiving a similar Bleu score.
    The number of permutations varies with respect to sentence length and number of bigram mismatches.
    Therefore as a hypothesis translation approaches being an identical match to one of the reference translations, the amount of variance decreases significantly.
    So, as translations improve spurious variation goes down.
    However, at today&#8217;s levels the amount of variation that Bleu admits is unacceptably hig
