ambiguation is a potent module.
  The Swedish morphological analyzer was applied to a text containing some 840,000 word-form tokens.
  The following table shows cohort size N(r) in the first column.
  The second and third columns sllow the number of cohorts with the respective number of readings before (a) and after (b) local disambigua- tion.
  E.g., before local disambiguation there were 3830 word-forms with 6 readings but after local disambiguation only 312.
  Here, disambiguation refers to reduction of mor- phological ambiguities, optimally down to cohort size = 1.
  Sense disambiguation is not included (presently our lexical items have no sense descriptions).
  The subproblems of morphosyntactic mapping, morphological disambiguation, clause boundary lo- cation, and syntactic function determination are in- terrelated.
  E.g., for disambiguation it is useful to know the boundaries of the current clause, and to know as much as possible about its syntactic struc- ture.
  An important aspect of the general pr
