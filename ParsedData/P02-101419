mportant challenges for coreference resolution systems.
    Somewhat disappointingly, only four of the new grammatical features corresponding to linguistic constraints and preferences are selected by the symbolic learning algorithms investigated: AGREEMENT, ANIMACY, BINDING, and MAXIMALNP.
    Discussion.
    In an attempt to gain additional insight into the difference in performance between our system and the original Soon system, we compare the decision tree induced by each for the MUC-6 data set.8 For our system, we use the tree induced on the hand-selected features (Figure 1).
    The two trees are fairly different.
    In particular, our tree makes use of many of the features that are not present in the original Soon feature set.
    The root feature for Soon, for example, is the general string match feature (SOON STR); splitting the SOON STR feature into three primitive features promotes the ALIAS feature to the root of our tree, on the other hand.
    In addition, given two non-pronominal, matching NPs
