1 if C = NG.
    This metric is closely related to the Bracketed Tree Rate.
    In the case where the parses are binary branching, the two metrics are the same.
    This criterion is also called the Zero Crossing Brackets Rate.
    The preceding six metrics each correspond to cells in the following table: Despite this long list of possible metrics, there is only one metric most parsing algorithms attempt to maximize, namely the Labelled Tree Rate.
    That is, most parsing algorithms assume that the test corpus was generated by the model, and then attempt to evaluate the following expression, where E denotes the expected value operator: TG arg mTaxE( 1 if = Nc) (1) This is true of the Labelled Tree Algorithm and stochastic versions of Earley's Algorithm (Stolcke, 1993), and variations such as those used in Picky parsing (Magerman and Weir, 1992).
    Even in probabilistic models not closely related to PCFGs, such as Spatter parsing (Magerman, 1994), expression (1) is still computed.
