urse structure is marked intonationally in read speech.
    For example, pauses tended to precede phrases that initiated segments (independent of hierarchical structure) and to follow phrases that ended segments.
    Similar results are reported in Nakatani, Hirschberg, and Grosz (1995) and Hirschberg and Nakatani (1996) for spontaneous speech as well.
    Grosz and Hirschberg (1992) also use the classification and regression tree system CART (Brieman et al. 1984) to automatically construct and evaluate decision trees for classifying aspects of discourse structure from intonational feature values.
    The studies of Swerts (1995) and Swerts and Ostendorf (1995) also investigate the prosodic structuring of discourse.
    In Swerts (1995), paragraph boundaries are empirically obtained as described above.
    The prosodic features pitch range, pause duration, and number of low boundary tones are claimed to increase continuously with boundary strength (the proportion of subjects identifying a boundary).
