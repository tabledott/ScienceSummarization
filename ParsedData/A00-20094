biguous word is represented by the classification variable (S).
    In this paper, all feature variables Fi are binary and represent whether or not a particular word occurs within some number of words to the left or right of an ambiguous word, i.e., a window of context.
    For a Naive Bayesian classifier, the joint probability of observing a certain combination of contextual features with a particular sense is expressed as: The parameters of this model are p(S) and FilS)&#8226; The sufficient statistics, i.e., the summaries of the data needed for parameter estimation, are the frequency counts of the events described by the interdependent variables (Fi, S).
    In this paper, these counts are the number of sentences in the sensetagged text where the word represented by Fi occurs within some specified window of context of the ambiguous word when it is used in sense S. Any parameter that has a value of zero indicates that the associated word never occurs with the specified sense value.
    These zero values are
