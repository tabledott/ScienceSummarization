um-entropy models, this simplifies the model significantly.
    Naturally, the distributions required by Equation 7 cannot be used without smoothing.
    In a pure maximum-entropy model this is done by feature selection, as in Ratnaparkhi's maximum-entropy parser [17].
    While we could have smoothed in the same fashion, we choose instead to use standard deleted interpolation.
    (Actually, we use a minor variant described in [4].)
  
  
    We created a parser based upon the maximumentropy-inspired model of the last section, smoothed using standard deleted interpolation.
    As the generative model is top-down and we use a standard bottom-up best-first probabilistic chart parser [2,7], we use the chart parser as a first pass to generate candidate possible parses to be evaluated in the second pass by our probabilistic model.
    For runs with the generative model based upon Markov grammar statistics, the first pass uses the same statistics, but conditioned only on standard PCFG information.
    This allows
