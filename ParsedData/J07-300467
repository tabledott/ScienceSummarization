 CCGbank.
    Although the grammar of CCG is usually thought of as consisting only of the combinatory rule schemata such as (3) and (5), we are interested here in the instantiation of these rules, in which the variables X and Y are bound to values such as S and NP, because statistical parsers such as Hockenmaier and Steedman&#8217;s (2002) or Clark and Curran&#8217;s (2004) are trained on counts of such instantiations.
    We report our results on sections 02&#8211;21, the standard training set for Penn Treebank parsers, and use section 00 to evaluate coverage of the training set on unseen data.
    Sections 02&#8211;21 contains 39,604 sentences (929,552 words/tokens), whereas section 00 consists of 1,913 sentences (45,422 words/tokens).
    CCGbank contains 48,934 (99.44%) of the 49,208 sentences in the entire Penn Treebank.
    The missing 274 sentences could not be automatically translated to CCG.
    This includes 107 instances of sentential gapping, a construction our algorithm does not cover (see Sectio
