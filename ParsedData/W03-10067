s a set of features that relate TAG structures on both the surface-syntax as well as the deep-syntax level.
    Finally, because a TAG is extracted from the PropBank, we have a set of semantic features derived indirectly from the PropBank through TAG.
    The second stage of our methodology entails using these features to predict semantic roles.
    We first experiment with prediction of semantic roles given gold-standard parses from the test corpus.
    We subsequently experiment with their prediction given raw text fed through a deterministic dependency parser.
  
  
    Our experiments depend upon automatically extracting TAGs from the PropBank.
    In doing so, we follow the work of others in extracting grammars of various kinds from the PTB, whether it be TAG (Xia, 1999; Chen and Vijay-Shanker, 2000; Chiang, 2000), combinatory categorial grammar (Hockenmaier and Steedman, 2002), or constraint dependency grammar (Wang and Harper, 2002).
    We will discuss TAGs and an important principle guiding their for
