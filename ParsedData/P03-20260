  Automatic Error Detection In The Japanese Learners' English Spoken Data
  
    This paper describes a method of detecting grammatical and lexical errors made by Japanese learners of English and other techniques that improve the accuracy of error detection with a limited amount of training data.
    In this paper, we demonstrate to what extent the proposed methods hold promise by conducting experiments using our learner corpus, which contains information on learners&#8217; errors.
