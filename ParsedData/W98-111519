 hypothesis is also consistent with the observation that average precision and recall sharply falls off when 77 is increased beyond its theoretically optimal value, since then the parser is presumably focusing on relatively larger constituents and ignoring other, strictly more plausible, smaller ones.
  
  
    It is worth noting that while we have presented the use of edge-based best-first chart parsing in the service of a rather pure form of PCFG parsing, there is no particular reason to assume that the technique is so limited in its domain of applicability.
    One can imagine the same techniques coupled with more informative probability distributions, such as lexicalized PCFGs (Charniak, 1997), or even grammars not based upon literal rules, but probability distributions that describe how rules are built up from smaller components (Magerman, 1995; Collins, 1997).
    Clearly further research is warranted.
    Be this as it may, the take-home lesson from this paper is simple: combining an edge-based agenda
