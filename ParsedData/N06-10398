o articles is too small, we do not bring them together into the same cluster (i.e. table).
    We exclude names from the similarity calculation at this stage because we want to link articles about the same type of event, not the same instance.
    In addition, we use the frequency of each basic pattern to compute the similarity of relations, since basic patterns like &#8220;say&#8221; or &#8220;have&#8221; appear in almost every article and it is dangerous to rely on such expressions.
    In the above explanation, we have assumed that we can obtain enough basic patterns from an article.
    However, the actual number of basic patterns that one can find from a single article is usually not enough, because the number of sentences is rather small in comparison to the variation of expressions.
    So having two articles that have multiple basic patterns in common is very unlikely.
    We extend the number of articles for obtaining basic patterns by using a cluster of comparable articles that report the same event
