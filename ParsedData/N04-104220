 we used are summarized in Table 5.
    The results of using different features are shown in Table 6.
    The layout feature dramatically increases the performance, raising the F1 measure from 88.8% to 93.9%, whole sentence accuracy from 40.1% to 72.4%.
    Adding lexicon features alone improves the performance.
    However, when combing lexicon features and layout features, the performance is worse than using layout features alone.
    The lexicons were gathered from a large collection of BibTeX files, and upon examination had difficult to remove noise, for example words in the author lexicon that were also affiliations.
    In previous work, we have gained significant benefits by dividing each lexicon into sections based on point-wise information gain with respect to the lexicon&#8217;s class.
  
  
    errors happen at the boundaries between two fields.
    Especially the transition from author to affiliation, from abstract to keyword.
    The note field is the one most confused with others, and upon inspe
