ab name is converted into its phonetic Roman representation using a parser and table lookup.
    The phonetic representation is then used in a table lookup to produce the spelling in the desired language.
    The vowelization rules described by Arbabi et al. (1994) apply only to Arab names that conform to strict Arabic morphological rules.
    Any name that does not conform to the morphological rules is ignored and hence no transliteration will be attempted.
    This restriction limits the applicability of this approach since many person and organization names do not conform to morphological rules, especially loan words and foreign names.
    Stalls and Knight (1998) present an Arabic-toEnglish back-transliteration system based on the source-channel framework.
    The transliteration process is based on a generative model of how an English name is transliterated into Arabic.
    It consists of several steps, each defined as a probabilistic model represented as a finite state machine.
    First, an English wor
