ble these days, a number of statistical parsing techniques which estimate the dependency probabilities using such tagged corpora have been developed(Collins, 1996; Fujio and Matsumoto, 1998).
    These approaches have overcome the systems based on the rule-based approaches.
    Decision Trees(Haruno et al., 1998) and Maximum Entropy models(Ratnaparkhi, 1997; Uchimoto et al., 1999; Charniak, 2000) have been applied to dependency or syntactic structure analysis.
    However, these models require an appropriate feature selection in order to achieve a high performance.
    In addition, acquisition of an efficient combination of features is difficult in these models.
    In recent years, new statistical learning techniques such as Support Vector Machines (SVMs) (Cortes and Vapnik, 1995; Vapnik, 1998) and Boosting(Freund and Schapire, 1996) are proposed.
    These techniques take a strategy that maximize the margin between critical examples and the separating hyperplane.
    In particular, compared with other conve
