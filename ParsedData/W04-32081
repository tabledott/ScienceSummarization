the baseline set.
    Experimental results show that our proposed method is nearly 50% more effective than the baseline method without iteration.
    We also show that our method is effective in boosting the performance of the IBM Model 4 EM lexical learner as the latter, though stronger than Model 1 used in previous work, does not perform well on data from very-non-parallel corpus.
  
  
    Parallel sentences are important resources for training and improving statistical machine translation and cross-lingual information retrieval systems.
    Various methods have been previously proposed to extract parallel sentences from multilingual corpora.
    Some of them are described in detail in (Manning and Sch&#369;tze, 1999, Wu, 2001, Veronis 2001).
    The challenge of these tasks varies by the degree of parallel-ness of the input multilingual documents.
