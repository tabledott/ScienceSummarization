ible to fit the six parameters in the model with language-specific values, though, thus far, we have not found it necessary to do so.
    We have examined a number of variations.
    In particular, we found that it is better to use characters rather than words in counting sentence length.
    Apparently, the performance is better with characters because there is less variability in the differences of sentence lengths so measured.
    Using words as units increases the error rate by half, from 4.2% to 6.5%.
    In the future, we would hope to extend the method to make use of lexical constraints.
    However, it is remarkable just how well we can do without such constraints.
    We might advocate our simple character alignment procedure as a first pass, even to those who advocate the use of lexical constraints.
    Our procedure would complement a lexical approach quite well.
    Our method is quick but makes a few percent errors; a lexical approach is probably slower, though possibly more accurate.
