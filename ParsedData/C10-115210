			father; father ? father.father; end while return constituent; In our model, one complex sentence can be split into two or more sentences.
			Since many splitting operations are possible, we need to select the mostlikely one.
			The probability of a segmentation op eration is calculated as: P (seg|c) = ? w:c SFT (w|c) (1) where w is a word in the complex sentence c and SFT (w|c) is the probability of the word w in the Segmentation Feature Table (SFT); Fig.
			2 shows a possible segmentation result of our example.

			In this step, we try to make the split sentences complete and grammatical.
			In our example, to make the second sentence ?which started in 735BC?
			complete and grammatical we should first drop the border word ?which?
			and then copy the dependent NP ?the ancient Roman calendar?
			to the l
