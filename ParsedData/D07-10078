ebased WSD models into decoding.
			However, although they reported that incorporating these predic tions via the Pharaoh XML markup scheme yielded a small improvement in BLEU score over a Pharaoh baseline on a single Spanish-English translation data set, we have determined empirically that applyingtheir single-word based model to several ChineseEnglish datasets does not yield systematic improve ments on most MT evaluation metrics (Carpuat andWu, 2007).
			The single-word model has the disad vantage of forcing the decoder to choose between the baseline phrasal translation probabilities versusthe WSD model predictions for single words.
			In ad dition, the single-word model does not generalize to WSD for phrasal lexical choice, as overlapping spans cannot be specified with the XML markup scheme.
			Providing WSD predictions for phraseswould require committing to a phrase segmenta tion of the input sentence before decoding, which is likely to hurt translation quality.
			It is also necessary to focus directly o
