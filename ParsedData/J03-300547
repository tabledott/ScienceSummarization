ich we were able to treat as unseen by removing all instances of the bigrams from the training corpus.
    To test the claim that Web frequencies can be used to overcome data sparseness, we correlated the frequencies re-created using class-based smoothing on the BNC with the frequencies obtained from the Web.
    The correlation coefficients for both seen and unseen bigrams are shown in Table 12.
    In all cases, a significant correlation between Web counts and re-created counts is obtained.
    For seen bigrams, the correlation coefficient ranged from .344 to .362 for AltaVista counts and from .330 to .349 for Google counts.
    For unseen bigrams, the correlations were somewhat higher, ranging from .386 to .439 for AltaVista counts and from .397 to .444 for Google counts.
    For both seen and unseen bigrams, there was only a very small difference between the correlation coefficients obtained with the two search engines.
    It is also interesting to compare the performance of class-based smoothing and Web
