e details of the BLEU scores.
    We obtain an average of 0.3770 BLEU score for normalized messages against 0.1926 for raw messages.
    The significant performance improvement suggests that preprocessing of normalizing SMS text using our method before MT is an effective way to adapt a general MT system to SMS domain.
  
  
    In this paper, we study the differences among SMS normalization, general text normalization, spelling check and text paraphrasing, and investigate the different phenomena of SMS messages.
    We propose a phrase-based statistical method to normalize SMS messages.
    The method produces messages that collate well with manually normalized messages, achieving 0.8070 BLEU score against 0.6958 baseline score.
    It also significantly improves SMS translation accuracy from 0.1926 to 0.3770 in BLEU score without adjusting the MT model.
    This experiment results provide us with a good indication on the feasibility of using this method in performing the normalization task.
    We plan to ex
