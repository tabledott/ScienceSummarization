rred to Della Pietra et al. (1995) for a more thorough discussion of constrained optimization as applied to maximum entropy.
    We call W(A) the dual function.
    The functions pA and (A) may be calculated explicitly using simple calculus.
    We find At first glance it is not clear what these machinations achieve.
    However, a fundamental principle in the theory of Lagrange multipliers, called generically the KuhnTucker theorem, asserts that under suitable assumptions, the primal and dual problems are, in fact, closely related.
    This is the case in the present situation.
    Although a detailed account of this relationship is beyond the scope of this paper, it is easy to state the final result: Suppose that A* is the solution of the dual problem.
    Then px. is the solution of the primal problem; that is pA.
    In other words, The maximum entropy model subject to the constraints C has the parametric form' pk, of (10), where the parameter values A* can be determined by maximizing the dual function W(
