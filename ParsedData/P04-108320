 are certainly possible.
    For example, we could project a part-of-speech tagger (Yarowsky &amp; Ngai, 2001) to improve our estimates in Equation 6.
    Yet, despite their relative simplicity, the above methods for estimating production rule probabilities use all of the available information in a consistent manner, without double-counting.
    This kind of synchronizer stands in contrast to more ad-hoc approaches (e.g., Matsumoto, 1993; Meyers, 1996; Wu, 1998; Hwa et al., 2002).
    Some of these previous works fix the word alignments first, and then infer compatible parse structures.
    Others do the opposite.
    Information about syntactic structure can be inferred more accurately given information about translational equivalence, and vice versa.
    Commitment to either kind of information without consideration of the other increases the potential for compounded errors.
  
  
    Multitree-based statistical machine translation (MTSMT) is an architecture for SMT that revolves around multitrees.
