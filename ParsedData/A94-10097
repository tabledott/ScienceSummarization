    The kind of biasing Cutting et a/. describe reflects linguistic insights combined with an understanding of the predictions a tagger could reasonably be expected to make and the ones it could not.
    The aim of this paper is to examine the role that training plays in the tagging process, by an experimental evaluation of how the accuracy of the tagger varies with the initial conditions.
    The results suggest that a completely unconstrained initial model does not produce good quality results, and that one 'The technique was originally developed by Kupiec (Kupiec, 1989). accurately trained from a hand-tagged corpus will generally do better than using an approach based on re-estimation, even when the training comes from a different source.
    A second experiment shows that there are different patterns of re-estimation, and that these patterns vary more or less regularly with a broad characterisation of the initial conditions.
    The outcome of the two experiments to
