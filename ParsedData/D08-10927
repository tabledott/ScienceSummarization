atures, we need to define some additional variables.
    For any node n E t (n' E t'), the inside span i(n) (i(n')) comprises the input tokens of s (s') dominated by that node.
    Similarly, the complement, the outside span, will be denoted o(n) (o(n')), and comprises the tokens not dominated by that node.
    See Figure 2b,c for examples of the resulting regions.
    Hard alignment features: We also define the hard versions of these features, which take counts from the word aligner&#8217;s hard top-1 alignment output S: Scaled alignment features: Finally, undesirable larger bispans can be relatively sparse at the word alignment level, yet still contain many good word alignments simply by virtue of being large.
    We therefore define a scaled count which measures density rather than totals.
    The geometric mean of span lengths was a superior measure of bispan &#8220;area&#8221; than the true area because word-level alignments tend to be broadly one-to-one in our word alignment model.
