ry close in this metric.
    Hence, several questions arise: To answer these questions, we divided the test corpus into 20 blocks of 25 sentences each, and computed the BLEU metric on these blocks individually.
    We thus have 20 samples of the BLEU metric for each system.
    We computed the means, variances, and paired t-statistics which are displayed in Table 2.
    The t-statistic compares each system with its left neighbor in the table.
    For example, t = 6 for the pair S1 and S2.
    Note that the numbers in Table 1 are the BLEU metric on an aggregate of 500 sentences, but the means in Table 2 are averages of the BLEU metric on aggregates of 25 sentences.
    As expected, these two sets of results are close for each system and differ only by small finite block size effects.
    Since a paired t-statistic of 1.7 or above is 95% significant, the differences between the systems&#8217; scores are statistically very significant.
    The reported variance on 25-sentence blocks serves as an upper bound to t
