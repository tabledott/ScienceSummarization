ms (Magerman, 1994; Collins, 1999; Yamada and Matsumoto, 2003) is that head&#8211;dependent pairs are created from constituents by selecting one word in each phrase as the head and setting all other as its dependents.
    The dependency labels are then inferred from the phrase&#8211;subphrase or phrase&#8211;word relations.
    Our conversion procedure (Johansson and Nugues, 2007) differs from this basic approach by exploiting the rich structure of the constituent format used in Penn Treebank 3: Of the grammatical function tags available in the Treebank, we removed the HLN, NOM, TPC, and TTL tags since they represent structural properties of single phrases rather than binary relations.
    For compatibility between the WSJ and Brown corpora, we removed the ETC, UNF, and IMP tags from Brown and the CLR tag from WSJ.
    Algorithms 1 and 2 show the constituent-todependency conversion algorithm and function labeling, respectively.
    The first steps apply structural transformations to the constituent trees.
