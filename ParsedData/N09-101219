e set R&#8242; = (&#8746;N&#8712;N&#8242;R&#8242;N) where for all N &#8712; B rule set R&#8242;N = IN &#8594; Nb&#8467;  |E &#8712; {1, 2}}, meaning at N in G&#8242; we decide which distribution P1, P2 to use; and for N &#8712; B and E &#8712; {1, 2} , R&#8242;Nb&#8467; = {Nb&#8467; &#8594; Q  |N &#8594; Q &#8712; RN} indicating a draw from distribution P&#8467;.
    For nonterminals N &#8712;6 B, R&#8242;N = RN.
    Finally, for each N, M &#8712; B we specify a tying relation between the rules inR&#8242;Nb2 and R&#8242;Mb2 , grouping together analogous rules.
    This has the effect of making an independence assumption about P2, namely that it ignores the conditioning event N(k), drawing from a common distribution each time a nonterminal Nb2 is rewritten.
    For example, in EVG to smooth P(A = DT | d = left, H = NN, v = 0) with P2(A = DT | d = left, v = 0) we define the backoff set to be {LH  |H &#8712; V&#964;}.
    In the extended grammar we define the tying relation to form rule equivalence classes by th
