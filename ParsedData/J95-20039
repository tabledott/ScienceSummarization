ch was greatly reduced and the use of inference could be restricted to determining whether a particular candidate was appropriate given the embedding utterance interpretation.
    Joshi, Kuhn, and Weinstein were concerned with reducing the inferences required to integrate utterance meaning into discourse meaning.
    They used centering to determine an almost monadic predicate representation of an utterance in discourse; they then used this representation to reduce the complexity of inference.
    In this paper, we generalize and clarify certain of Sidner's results, but adopt the &amp;quot;centering&amp;quot; terminology.
    We also abstract from Sidner's focusing algorithm to specify constraints on the centering process.
    We consider the relationship between coherence and inference load and examine how both interact with attentional state and choices in linguistic expression.
    The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: in Section 2, we briefly describe the phenomena motivating the developmen
