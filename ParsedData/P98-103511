he derivation(W,T).
    Let an elementary event in the derivation(W,T) = (word-to-tag, ho.tag , h_i.tag).
    The probability associated with each model action is determined as described in section 3.1, based on counts C(m)(y(m), x(m)), one set for each model component.
    Assuming that the deleted interpolation coefficients and the count ranges used for tying them stay fixed, these counts are the only parameters to be re-estimated in an eventual re-estimation procedure; indeed, once a set of counts C(m)(y(m), x(m)) is specified for a given model m, we can easily calculate: in ky /Xn ) for all context orders n = 0. .
    .maximum-order (mode/ (m)); This is all we need for calculating the probability of an elementary event and then the probability of an entire derivation.
    One training iteration of the re-estimation procedure we propose is described by the following algorithm: N-best parse development data; // counts.Ei // prepare counts.E(i+1) for each model component c{ gather_counts development model_c;
