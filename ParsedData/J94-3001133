vel grammars rather than as a single one.
    As another option, an entire two-level grammar can be embedded in place of a single rule in an ordered rewriting system.
    As long as care is taken to avoid inappropriate complementations and intersections, all such arrangements will denote regular relations and can be implemented by a uniform finite-state transducer mechanism.
  
  
    Our aim in this paper has been to provide the core of a mathematical framework for phonology.
    We used systems of rewriting rules, particularly as formulated in SPE, to give concreteness to our work and to the paper.
    However, we continually sought solutions in terms of algebraic abstractions of sufficiently high level to free them from any necessary attachment to that or any other specific theory.
    If our approach proves useful, it will only be because it is broad enough to encompass new theories and new variations on old ones.
    If we have chosen our abstractions well, our techniques will extend smoothly and increme
