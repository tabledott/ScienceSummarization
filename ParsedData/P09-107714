Since relations are created by removing connectives, if an unambiguous connective remains, its presence is a reliable indicator that the example should be classified as Other.
    Such features might work well and lead to high accuracy results in identifying synthetic implicit relations, but are unlikely to be useful in a realistic setting of actual implicits. the-but s-but the-in of-but for-but but-but in-but was-but it-but to-but that-but the-it* and-and the-the in-in to-the of-and a-of said-but they-but of-in in-and in-of s-and Also note that the only two features predictive of the comparison class (indicated by * in Table 1): the-it and to-it, contain only function words rather than semantically related nonfunction words.
    This ranking explains the observations reported in Blair-Goldensohn et al. (2007) where removing stopwords degraded classifier performance and why using only nouns, verbs or adjectives (Marcu and Echihabi, 2001; Lapata and Lascarides, 2004) is not the best option2.
