ation of such processes as ellipsis and conjunction, they are without doubt fully productive grammatical processes.
    Without an understanding of the differences in the kinds of non-fluencies that occur, we are left with a kind cf grab bag of grammatical deviation that can never be analyzed except by some sort of general purpose mechanisms.
    In this paper, I want to characterize the subset of spoken non-fluencies that can be treated as self-corrections, and to describe how they are handled in the context of a deterministic parser.
    I assume that a system for dealing with self-corrections similar to the one I describe roust be a part of the competence of any natural language user.
    I will begin by discussing the range of non-fluencies that occur in speech.
    Then, after reviewing the notion of deterministic parsing, I will describe the model of parsing self-corrections in detail, and report results from a sample of 1500 sentences.
    Finally, I discuss some implications of this theory of self-cor
