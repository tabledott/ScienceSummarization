  Stanford&#226;&#8364;&#8482;s Multi-Pass Sieve Coreference Resolution System at the CoNLL-2011 Shared Task
  
    This paper details the coreference resolution system submitted by Stanford at the CoNLL- 2011 shared task.
    Our system is a collection of deterministic coreference resolution models that incorporate lexical, syntactic, semantic, and discourse information.
    All these models use global document-level information by sharing mention attributes, such as gender and number, across mentions in the same cluster.
    We participated in both the open and closed tracks and submitted results using both predicted and gold mentions.
    Our system was ranked first in both tracks, with a score of 57.8 in the closed track and 58.3 in the open track.
  
  
    This paper describes the coreference resolution system used by Stanford at the CoNLL-2011 shared task (Pradhan et al., 2011).
    Our system extends the multi-pass sieve system of Raghunathan et al. (2010), which applies tiers of deterministic corefe
