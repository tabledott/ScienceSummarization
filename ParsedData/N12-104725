y, Chiang et al.&#8217;s (2008) more complex solution may perform better.
    There may be settings where an explicit regularization parameter is desirable, thus we also make a recommendation among the direct optimizers (PRO, MR and SVM).
    Though these systems all tend to show a fair amount of variance across language and feature sets (likely due to their use sentence-level BLEU), MR performs the most consistently, and is always within 0.2 of batch lattice MIRA.
    The SVM&#8217;s performance on Big Zh-En is an intriguing outlier in our results.
    Note that it not only performs best on the test set, but also achieves the best tuning score by a large margin.
    We suspect we have simply found a setting where interpolated BLEU and our choice of A work particularly well.
    We intend to investigate this case to see if this level of success can be replicated consistently, perhaps through improved sentence BLEU approximation or improved oracle selection.
    One main difference between MIRA and the direct
