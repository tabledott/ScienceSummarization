duction in size when using the Eisner normal-form constraints.
			Even with the CCGbank rule constraints, theparser still builds many non-normal-form derivations, since CCGbank does contain cases of compo sition and type-raising.
			(These are used to analysesome coordination and extraction cases, for example.)
			The combination of the two types of normal form constraints reduces the memory requirements by 48% over the original approach.
			In Clark andCurran (2004) we show that the parsing model re sulting from training data generated in this way produces state-of-the-art CCG dependency recovery: 84.6 F-score over labelled dependencies.
			The final row corresponds to a more restrictive setting on the supertagger, in which a value of ? = 0.05 is used initially and ? = 0.1 is used if thenode limit is exceeded.
			The two types of normal form constraints are also used.
			In Clark and Curran(2004) we show that using this more restrictive set ting has a small negative impact on the accuracy of the resulting pa
