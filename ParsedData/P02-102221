    The annotations associated with each document are a structure central to GATE, because they encode the language data read and produced by each processing module.
    The GATE framework also provides persistent storage of language resources.
    It currently offers three storage mechanisms: one uses relational databases (e.g.
    Oracle) and the other two are file- based, using Java serialisation or an XML-based internal format.
    GATE documents can also be exported back to their original format (e.g.
    SGML/XML for the British National Corpus (BNC)) and the user can choose whether some additional annotations (e.g. named entity information) are added to it or not.
    To summarise, the existence of a unified data structure ensures a smooth communication between components, while the provision of import and export capabiliti
