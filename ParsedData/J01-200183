ditionally be treated as comprising parts of the signature NULL.ine along with bernard, gerald, eng, capitol, elephant, def, and sup (although that would involve permitting a single stem to participate in two distinct signatures).
    Our MDL-based measure tests the goodness of a signature by testing each signature o- to see if the analysis is better when that signature is deleted.
    This deletion entails treating the signature's words as members of the signature of unanalyzed words (which is the largest signature, and hence such signature pointers are relatively short).
    Each word member of the signature, however, now becomes a separate stem, with all of the increase in pointer length that that entails, as well as increase in letter content for the stem component.
    One may draw the following conclusions, I believe, from the straightforward application of such a measure.
    On the whole, the effects are quite good, but by no means as close as one would like to a human's decisions in a certain number
