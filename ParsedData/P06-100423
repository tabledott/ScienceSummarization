ange of mask-sizes and different parameter settings described in (Choi, 2000) on a heldout development set of three lectures.
    To control for segmentation granularity, we specify the number of segments in the reference (&#8220;O&#8221;) segmentation for both our system and the baseline.
    Table 5 shows that the Minimum Cut algorithm consistently outperforms the similarity-based baseline on all the lecture datasets.
    We attribute this gain to the presence of more attenuated topic transitions in spoken language.
    Since spoken language is more spontaneous and less structured than written language, the speaker needs to keep the listener abreast of the changes in topic content by introducing subtle cues and references to prior topics in the course of topical transitions.
    Non-local dependencies help to elucidate shifts in focus, because the strength of a particular transition is measured with respect to other local and long-distance contextual discourse relationships.
    Our system does not outperfo
