    A word alignment between two sentences in different languages specifies which words in one sentence are translations of which words in the other.
    Word alignments were first introduced in the context of statistical MT, where they are used to estimate the parameters of a translation model (Brown et al. 1990).
    Since then, they were found useful in many other NLP applications (e.g., word sense tagging [Diab and Resnik 2002] and question answering [Echihabi and Marcu 2003]).
    Figures 3 and 4 give examples of word alignments between two English-Arabic sentence pairs from our comparable corpus.
    Each figure contains two alignments.
    The one on the left is a correct alignment, produced by a human, while the one on the right Alignments between two parallel sentences. was computed automatically.
    As can be seen from the gloss next to the Arabic words, the sentences in Figure 3 are parallel while the sentences in Figure 4 are not.
    In a correct alignment between two non-parallel sentences, mo
