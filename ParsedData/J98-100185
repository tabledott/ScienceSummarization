has the merit of being immediately usable, but in view of the types of problems cited in the previous section, systematic study of interlanguage relations will be required to determine its viability and generality.
    At present, the apparent best source of sense distinctions is assumed to be on-line resources such as LDOCE or WordNet, although the problems of utilizing such resources are well known, and their use does not address issues of more complex semantic tagging that goes beyond the typical distinctions made in dictionaries and thesauri.
    Resnik and Yarowsky (1997b) also point out that a binary evaluation (correct/incorrect) for WSD is not sufficient, and propose that errors be penalized according to a distance matrix among senses based on a hierarchical organization.
    For example, failure to identify homographs of bank (which would appear higher in the hierarchy) would be penalized more severely than failure to distinguish bank as an institution from bank as a building (which would appear lowe
