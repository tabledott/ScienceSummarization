ll these paths in the label propagation algorithm, whereas only the single path from a seed will influence the polarity of a node in our proposed propagation algorithm &#8211; namely the path with highest weight.
    The intuition behind label propagation seems justified.
    That is, if a node has multiple paths to a seed, it should be reflected in a higher score.
    This is certainly true when the graph is of high quality and all paths trustworthy.
    However, in a graph constructed from web cooccurrence statistics, this is rarely the case.
    Our graph consisted of many dense subgraphs, each representing some semantic entity class, such as actors, authors, tech companies, etc.
    Problems arose when polarity flowed into these dense subgraphs with the label propagation algorithm.
    Ultimately, this flow would amplify since the dense subgraph provided exponentially many paths from each node to the source of the flow, which caused a reinforcement effect.
    As a result, the lexicon would consist of lar
