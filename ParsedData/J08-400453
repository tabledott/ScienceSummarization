    4.1.2 Establishing Significance.
    In hypothesis testing, it is common to test for the significance of a result against a null hypothesis of chance behavior; for an agreement coefficient this would mean rejecting the possibility that a positive value of agreement is nevertheless due to random coding.
    We can rely on the statement by Siegel and Castellan (1988, Section 9.8.2) that when sample sizes are large, the sampling distribution of K (Fleiss&#8217;s multi-7c) is approximately normal and centered around zero&#8212;this allows testing the obtained value of K against the null hypothesis of chance agreement by using the z statistic.
    It is also easy to test Krippendorff&#8217;s &#945; with the interval distance metric against the null hypothesis of chance agreement, because the hypothesis &#945; = 0 is identical to the hypothesis F = 1 in an analysis of variance.
    However, a null hypothesis of chance agreement is not very interesting, and demonstrating that agreement is significantly better
