Lin, 1998), and jcn (Jiang and Conrath, 1997).
    The lin and jcn measures augment the information content of the LCS with the sum of the information content of concepts A and B themselves.
    The lin measure scales the information content of the LCS by this sum, while jcn takes the difference of this sum and the information content of the LCS.
    The default source for information content for concepts is the sense&#8211;tagged corpus SemCor.
    However, there are also utility programs available with WordNet::Similarity that allow a user to compute information content values from the Brown Corpus, the Penn Treebank, the British National Corpus, or any given corpus of raw text.
    Three similarity measures are based on path lengths between a pair of concepts: lch (Leacock and Chodorow, 1998), wup (Wu and Palmer, 1994), and path. lch finds the shortest path between two concepts, and scales that value by the maximum path length found in the is&#8211;a hierarchy in which they occur. wup finds the depth of th
