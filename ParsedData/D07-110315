			Different pruning thresholds were considered: no pruning, 14, 16, 18, 20, and 25.
			In addition, another more aggressive method of pruning was attempted.Moore points out, correctly, that phrase pairs that oc cur in only one sentence pair, (C(s?, t?)
			= 1 ), are less reliable and might require more special treatment.
			These are all pruned automatically at thresholds of16 and above but not at threshold of 14.
			A spe cial series of runs was done for threshold 14 with all of these singletons removed to see whether at thesethresholds it was the significance level or the prun ing of phrase pairs with (C(s?, t?)
			= 1 ) that was more important.
			This is identified as 14?
			in the results.
