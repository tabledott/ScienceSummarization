			Table 7: Information about participating systems (SC = SemCor, DSO = Defence Science Organisation Corpus, SE = Senseval corpora, OMWE = Open Mind Word Expert, XWN = eXtended WordNet, WN = WordNet glosses and/or relations, WND = WordNet Domains, UC = use of unannotated corpora, TR = use of training, MFS = most frequent sense backoff strategy, CS = use of coarse senses from the organizers, ?: system from one of the task organizers).proposed the adoption of a coarse-grained sense inventory.
			We found the results of participating sys tems interesting and stimulating.
			However, some questions arise.
			First, it is unclear whether, given the novelty of the task, systems really achieved the state of the art or can still improve their performancebased on a heavier exploitation of coarse- and finegrained information from the adopted sense inven tory.
