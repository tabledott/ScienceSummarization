    Intuitively, however, many of the patterns discovered seem to be good candidates for conventions of general English.
    A future step would be to examine other more balanced corpora and test how well the patterns hold up.
  
  
    We began this paper with the psycholinguistic notion of word association norm, and extended that concept toward the information theoretic definition of mutual information.
    This provided a precise statistical calculation that could be applied to a very large corpus of text to produce a table of associations for tens of thousands of words.
    We were then able to show that the table encoded a number of very interesting patterns ranging from doctor .
    .
    . nurse to save .
    .
    . from.
    We finally concluded by showing how the patterns in the association ratio table might help a lexicographer organize a concordance.
    In point of fact, we actually developed these results in basically the reverse order.
    Concordance analysis is still extremely labor-inten
