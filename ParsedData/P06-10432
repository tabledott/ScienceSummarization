different domain.
    Unfortunately, the state of the art in parser portability (i.e. using a parser trained on one domain to parse a different domain) is not good.
    The &#8220;Charniak parser&#8221; has a labeled precision-recall f-measure of 89.7% on WSJ but a lowly 82.9% on the test set from the Brown corpus treebank.
    Furthermore, the treebanked Brown data is mostly general non-fiction and much closer to WSJ than, e.g., medical corpora would be.
    Thus, most work on parser adaptation resorts to using some labeled in-domain data to fortify the larger quantity of outof-domain data.
    In this paper, we present some encouraging results on parser adaptation without any in-domain data.
    (Though we also present results with indomain data as a reference point.)
    In particular we note the effects of two comparatively recent techniques for parser improvement.
    The first of these, parse-reranking (Collins, 2000; Charniak and Johnson, 2005) starts with a &#8220;standard&#8221; generative parser, bu
