word reorderings that are explored by the search algorithm are controlled by two parameters s and w as described in (Tillmann and Ney, 2003).
    The first parameter s denotes the number of source words that are temporarily skipped (i.e., temporarily left uncovered) during the search to cover a source word to the right of the skipped words.
    The second parameter is the window width w, which is defined as the distance (in number of source words) between the left-most uncovered source word and the right-most covered source word.
    To illustrate these restrictions, let us assume the input sentence consists of the following sequence (f1, f2, f3, f4).
    For s=1 and w=2, the permissible permutations are (f1,f2, f3, f4), (f2, f1, f3, f4), The experiments reported in this section are in the context of SMT from Arabic into English.
    The training data is a 500K sentence-pairs subsample of the 2005 Large Track Arabic-English Data for NIST MT Evaluation.
    The language model used is an interpolated trigram mo
