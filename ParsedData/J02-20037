    There are around 66,000 different concepts in the noun hierarchy of WordNet version 1.6.
    A concept in WordNet is represented by a &#8220;synset,&#8221; which is the set of synonymous words that can be used to denote that concept.
    For example, the synset for the concept (cocaine)2 is { cocaine, cocain, coke, snow, C }.
    Let syn(c) be the synset for concept c, and let cn(n) = { c  |n E syn(c) } be the set of concepts that can be denoted by noun n. The hierarchy has the structure of a directed acyclic graph (although only around 1% of the nodes have more than one parent), where the edges of the graph constitute what we call the &#8220;direct&#8211;isa&#8221; relation.
    Let isa be the transitive, reflexive closure of direct&#8211;isa; then c' isa c implies c' is a kind of c. If c' isa c, then c is a hype
