aracterize the concept of distributional similarity: words or phrases that share the same distribution&#8212;the same set of words in the same context in a corpus&#8212;tend to have similar meanings.
    Figure 1 shows the basic idea behind phrasal paraphrase generation techniques that leverage distributional similarity.
    The input corpus is usually a single or set of monolingual corpora (parallel or non-parallel).
    After preprocessing&#8212;which may include tagging the parts of speech, generating parse trees, and other transformations&#8212;the next step is to extract pairs of words or phrases (or patterns) that occur in the same context in the corpora and hence may be considered (approximately) semantically equivalent.
    This extraction may be accomplished by several means (e.g., by using a classifier employing contextual features or by finding similar paths in dependency trees).
    Although it is possible to stop at this point and consider this list as the final output, the list usually contains
