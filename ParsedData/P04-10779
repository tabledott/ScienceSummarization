 by Papineni et al. (2001) that calculates co-occurrence statistics based on n-gram overlaps have shown great potential.
    A variant of BLEU developed by NIST (2002) has been used in two recent large-scale machine translation evaluations.
    Recently, Turian et al. (2003) indicated that standard accuracy measures such as recall, precision, and the F-measure can also be used in evaluation of machine translation.
    However, results based on their method, General Text Matcher (GTM), showed that unigram F-measure correlated best with human judgments while assigning more weight to higher n-gram (n &gt; 1) matches achieved similar performance as Bleu.
    Since unigram matches do not distinguish words in consecutive positions from words in the wrong order, measures based on position-independent unigram matches are not sensitive to word order and sentence level structure.
    Therefore, systems optimized for these unigram-based measures might generate adequate but not fluent target language.
    Since BLEU has
