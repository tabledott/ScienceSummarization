an be internal nodes.
    To solve the problem (b), a study on different tree substructure spaces should be carried out to derive the tree kernel that provide the highest accuracy.
    On the one hand, SSTs provide learning algorithms with richer information which may be critical to capture syntactic properties of parse trees as shown, for example, in (Zelenko et al., 2003; Moschitti, 2004).
    On the other hand, if the SST space contains too many irrelevant features, overfitting may occur and decrease the classification accuracy (Cumby and Roth, 2003).
    As a consequence, the fewer features of the ST approach may be more appropriate.
    In this paper, we aim to solve the above problems.
    We present (a) an algorithm for the evaluation of the ST and SST kernels which runs in linear average time and (b) a study of the impact of diverse tree kernels on the accuracy of Support Vector Machines (SVMs).
    Our fast algorithm computes the kernels between two syntactic parse trees in O(m + n) average time, whe
