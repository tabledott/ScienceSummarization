			In the equation above, the s represents the Arabic word that is being linked from the English word ti.When ? is set to 1.0 there is no smoothing per formed and performance degrades to F=84.0 from the best system performance (F=87.8).
			When ? isset to 0, the model uses only the IBM Model 1 distri bution and the resulting aligner is similar to an HMM aligner with the transition shape discussed above and yields performance of F=73.2.
