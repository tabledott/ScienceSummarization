 Pereira (2006): a factor consists of a main labeleddependency and the head child closest to the modifier (ch).
			The third model incorporates the modifier child outside the main dependency in the factorization (cmo).
			Finally, the last model incorpo rates the modifier child inside the dependency span(cmi), thus corresponding to the complete higher order model presented in the previous section.
			Table 2 shows the accuracies of the models on validation data.
			Each model was trained for up to 10 epochs, and evaluated at the end of each epoch; we report the best accuracy of these evaluations.Clearly, the accuracy increases as the factors in clude richer information in terms of second-orderrelations.
			The richest model obtains the best accu racy in the three languages, being much better than that of the first-order model.
			The table also reportsthe accuracy of an unaveraged first-order model, il lustrating the benefits of parameter averaging.
