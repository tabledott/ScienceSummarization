osition), or a given verb occurs in a transitive use and is associated with a preposition immediately following the object of the verb.
    We use the following notation: f(w,p) is the frequency count for the pair consisting of the verb or noun w and the preposition p. The unigram frequency count for the word w (either a verb, noun, or preposition) can be viewed as a sum of bigram frequencies, and is written f (w).
    For instance, if p is a preposition, f (p) = Ew f (w, p).
    Our object is to develop a procedure to guess whether a preposition is attached to the verb or its object when a verb and its object are followed by a preposition.
    We assume that in each case of attachment ambiguity, there is a forced choice between two outcomes: the preposition attaches either to the verb or to the noun.'
    For example, in Example 6, we want to choose between two possibilities: either into is attached to the verb send or it is attached to the noun soldier.
