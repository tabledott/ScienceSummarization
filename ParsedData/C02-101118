s transformed with Major Translation.
			Our experimental results indicate that both EM-NBC-Ensemble and EM-TF-IDF significantly outperform Prior and MT-TF-IDF, when appropriate window sizes are chosen.
			The p-values of the sign tests are 0.00056 and 0.00133 for EM-NBC-Ensemble, 0.00002 and 0.00901 for EM-TF-IDF, respectively.
			We next removed each of the key components of EM-NBC-Ensemble and used the remaining components as a variant of it to perform translation selection.
			The key components are (1) distance calculation by KL divergence (2) EM, (3) prior probability, and (4) ensemble.
			The variants, thus, respectively make use of (1) the baseline method ?Prior?, (2) an ensemble of Na?ve Bayesian Classifiers based on Major Translation (MT-NBC-Ensemble), (3) an ensemble of EM-based KL divergence calculations (EM-KL-Ensemble), and (4) EM-NBC.
			Figure 7 and Table 1 show the results.
			We see that EM-NBC-Ensemble outperforms all of the variants, indicating that all the components within EM-NBC-Ensembl
