    For many languages, it is not difficult to construct an approximate mapping from the orthography to its underlying phonological form.
    Given such a mapping for Ll and L2, it is possible to identify cognates despite incomparable orthographies.
    Knight and Graehl (1997) have shown that it is possible to find phonetic cognates even between languages whose writing systems are as different as those of English and Japanese.
    They have built a weighted finite-state automaton (WFSA), based on empirically estimated probability distributions, for back-transliterating English loan words written in katakana into their original English form.
    The WFSA efficiently represents a large number of transliteration probabilities between words written in the katakana and Roman alphabets.
    Standard finite-state techniques can efficiently find the most likely path through the WFSA from a Japanese word written in katakana to an English word.
    The weight of the most likely path is an estimate of the
