he grammar if R(rule) 0.
    We will say that a semiring parser works correctly if, for any grammar, input, and semiring, the value of the input according to the grammar equals the value of the input using the parser.
    In this subsection, we will define the value of an input according to the grammar, define the value of an input using the parser, and give a sufficient condition for a semiring parser to work correctly.
    From this point onwards, unless we specifically mention otherwise, we will assume that some fixed semiring, item-based description, and grammar have been given, without specifically mentioning which ones.
    2.4.1 Value According to Grammar.
    Consider a derivation E, consisting of grammar rules el, e2, .
    .
    ,em.
    We define the value of the derivation according to the grammar to be simply the product (in the semiring) of the values of the rules used in E: Then we can define the value of a sentence that can be derived using grammar derivations El, E2, , Ek to be: where k is po
