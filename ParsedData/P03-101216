00 manually aligned sentences.
    Both the training and testing sentences are from the Hansard corpus.
    We parsed the training |A&#8745;S| |S| and testing corpora with Minipar.5 We then ran the training procedure in Section 4 for three iterations.
    We conducted three experiments using this methodology.
    The goal of the first experiment is to compare the algorithm in Section 3 to a state-of-theart alignment system.
    The second will determine the contributions of the features.
    The third experiment aims to keep all factors constant except for the model, in an attempt to determine its performance when compared to an obvious alternative.
    Table 2 compares the results of our algorithm with the results in (Och and Ney, 2000), where an HMM model is used to bootstrap IBM Model 4.
    The rows IBM-4 F&#8594;E and IBM-4 E&#8594;F are the results obtained by IBM Model 4 when treating French as the source and English as the target or vice versa.
    The row IBM-4 Intersect shows the results obtained by
