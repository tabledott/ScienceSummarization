    Empirical estimation statistical translation models is typically based on texts of texts that are translations of each other.
    As with all statistical models, the best translation models are those whose parameters correspond best with the sources of variance in the data.
    Probabilistic translation models whose parameters reflect universal properties of translational equivalence and/or existing knowledge about particular * D1-66F, 610 Opperman Drive, Eagan, MN 55123.
