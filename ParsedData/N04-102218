nterest such as BLEU, PER or WER, we can use this metric as a loss function within the MBR framework to design decoders optimized for the evaluation criterion.
    In particular, the MBR decoding under the BLEU loss function can yield further improvements on top of MAP decoding.
    Suppose we are interested in improving syntactic structure of automatic translations and would like to use an existing statistical MT system that is trained without any linguistic features.
    We have shown in such a situation how MBR decoding can be applied to the MT system.
    This can be done by the design of translation loss functions from varied linguistic analyzes.
    We have shown the construction of a Bitree loss function to compare parsetrees of any two translations using alignments with respect to a parse-tree for the source sentence.
    The loss function therefore avoids the problem of unconstrained tree-to-tree alignment.
    Using an example, we have shown that this loss function can measure qualities of translati
