 (Neumann, 1998) describes an experiment similar to ours, although the grammar he extracts only arrives at a complete parse for 10% of unseen sentences.
    (Xia, 1999) describes a grammar extraction process similar to ours, and describes some techniques for automatically filtering out invalid elementary trees.
    Our work has a great deal in common with independent work by Chen and VijayShanker (2000).
    They present a more detailed discussion of various grammar extraction processes and the performance of supertagging models (B. Srinivas, 1997) based on the extracted grammars.
    They do not report parsing results, though their intention is to evaluate how the various grammars affect parsing accuracy and how k-best supertagging afffects parsing speed.
    Srinivas's work on supertags (B. Srinivas, 1997) also uses TAG for statistical parsing, but with a rather different strategy: tree templates are thought of as extended parts-ofspeech, and these are assigned to words based on local (e.g., n-gram) context
