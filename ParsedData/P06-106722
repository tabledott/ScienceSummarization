 Our results on the 2004 and 2005 NIST MT Evaluation test sets using the distortion model are 0.4497 and 0.464610, respectively.
    Table 6 shows some Arabic-English translation examples using our decoder with and without the distortion model.
  
  
    We presented a new distortion model that can be integrated with existing phrase-based SMT decoders.
    The proposed model shows statistically significant improvement over a state-of-the-art phrase-based SMT decoder.
    We also showed that n-gram language modlations.
    Output 1 is decoding without the distortion model and (s=4, w=8), which corresponds to 0.4104 BLEU score.
    Output 2 is decoding with the distortion model and (s=3, w=8), which corresponds to 0.4792 BLEU score.
    The sentences presented here are much shorter than the average in our test set.
    The average length of the arabic sentence in the MT03 test set is &#8212; 24.7. els are not sufficient to model word movement in translation.
    Our proposed distortion model addresses this weak
