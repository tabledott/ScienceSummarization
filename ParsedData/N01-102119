was told about the buy-back resigned.&#8221; Now a comparison of two conditions is possible.
    RC only the banker who was told about the buyback resigned The words who was cancel the main verb reading, and should make that condition easier to process.
    This asymmetry is borne out in graphs 4 and 5.
    At &#8220;resigned&#8221; the probabilistic Earley parser predicts less reading time in the subject relative condition than in the reduced relative condition.
    This comparison verifies that the same sorts of phenomena treated in reanalysis and bounded parallelism parsing theories fall out as cases of the present, total parallelism theory.
    Although they used frequency estimates provided by corpus data, the previous two grammars were partially hand-built.
    They used a subset of the rules found in the sample of parsed text.
    A grammar including all rules observed in the entire sample supports the same sort of reasoning.
    In this grammar, instead of just 2 NP rules there are 532, along with 120
