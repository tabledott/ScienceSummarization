(Yangarber and Jokipii, 2005; Yangarber, 2006; Yangarber et al., 2007) applied cross-document inference to correct local extraction results for disease name, location and start/end time.
    Mann (2007) encoded specific inference rules to improve extraction of CEO (name, start year, end year) in the MUC management succession task.
    In addition, Patwardhan and Riloff (2007) also demonstrated that selectively applying event patterns to relevant regions can improve MUC event extraction.
    We expand the idea to more general event types and use information retrieval techniques to obtain wider background knowledge from related documents.
  
  
    One of the initial goals for IE was to create a database of relations and events from the entire input corpus, and allow further logical reasoning on the database.
    The artificial constraint that extraction should be done independently for each document was introduced in part to simplify the task and its evaluation.
    In this paper we propose a new approach to b
