t; and the word &amp;quot;the&amp;quot; often comes after &amp;quot;save,&amp;quot; it is hard to say from examination of a concordance alone whether either or both of these co-occurrences have any significance.
    Two examples will illustrate how the association ratio measure helps make the analysis both quicker and more accurate.
    The association ratios in Table 7 show that association norms apply to function words as well as content words.
    For example, one of the words significantly associated with save is from.
    Many dictionaries, for example Webster's Ninth New Collegiate Dictionary (Merriam Webster), make no explicit mention of from in the entry for save, although British learners' dictionaries do make specific mention of from in connection with save.
    These learners' dictionaries pay more attention to language structure and collocation than do American collegiate dictionaries, and lexicographers trained in the British tradition are often fairly skilled at spotting these generalizations.
