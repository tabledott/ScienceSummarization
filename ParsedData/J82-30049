en noticed for a long time that these sorts of very ambiguous constructions are very difficult for most parsing algorithms, but (apparently) not for people.
    This observation has led some researchers to hypothesize additional parsing mechanisms, such as pseudo-attachment (Church 1980, pp.
    65-71)2 and permanent predictable ambiguity (Sager 1973), so that the parser could &amp;quot;attach all ways&amp;quot; in a single step.
    However, these mechanisms have always lacked a precise interpretation; we will present a much more formal way of coping with &amp;quot;every way ambiguous&amp;quot; grammars, defined in terms of Catalan numbers (Knuth 1975, pp.
    388-389, 531-533).
    Sentences are far more ambiguous than one might have thought.
    Our experience with the EQSP parser (Martin, Church, and Patil 1981) indicates that there may be hundreds, perhaps thousands, of syntactic parse trees for certain very natural sentences of English.
    For example, consider the following sentence with two prepositi
