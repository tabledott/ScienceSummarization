			They show that our tree kernel-based system outperforms previous tree kernel-based systems.
			This is largely due to the con text-sensitive nature of our tree kernel which resolves the limitations of the previous tree kernels.
			They also show that our tree kernel-based system outperforms the state-of-the-art feature-based system.
			This proves the great potential inherent in the parse tree structure
