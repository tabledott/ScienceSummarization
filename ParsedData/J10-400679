    Class examples include land mammals (dog, elephant... ), tools (screwdriver, hammer) and fruit (orange, plum).
    See Baroni et al. (2010) for the full list.
    Finally, the ESSLLI 2008 set was used for one of the Distributional Semantic Workshop shared tasks (Baroni, Evert, and Lenci 2008).
    It is also based on concrete nouns, but it includes fewer prototypical members of categories (rocket as vehicle or snail as land animal).
    The 44 target concepts are organized into a hierarchy of classes of increasing abstraction.
    There are 6 lower level classes, with maximally 13 concepts per class (birds, land animals, fruit, greens, tools, vehicles).
