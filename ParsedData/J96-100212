with which it translated to either dans or au cours de was 1/2; and so on.
    These particular statistics were independent of the context, but we could also consider statistics that depend on the conditioning information x.
    For instance, we might notice that, in the training sample, if April is the word following in, then the translation of in is en with frequency 9/10.
    To express the fact that in translates as en when April is the following word, we can introduce the indicator function: The expected value off with respect to the empirical distribution /3(x, y) is exactly the statistic we are interested in.
    We denote this expected value by We can express any statistic of the sample as the expected value of an appropriate binary-valued indicator function f. We call such function a feature function or feature for short.
    (As with probability distributions, we will sometimes abuse notation and use f (x, y) to denote both the value of f at a particular pair (x, y) as well as the entire function f.
