est definitions; the maximum out degree is 56 and the average out-degree is 6.2.
			For the edges linking TokenPOS nodes to the Synsets in which they participate, TokenPOS nodes with many senses are the most connected; ?break#v? with 59 outgoing edges and ?make#v? with 49 outgoing edges have the highest out-degrees, with the average out-degree being 1.3.
			3.2 Computing the stationary distribution.
			Each of the K edge types presented above can be repre sented as separate transition matrix Ek ? RN?N where 583N is the total number of nodes.
			For each matrix, column j contains contains a normalized outgoing proba bility distribution,1 so the weight in cell (i, j) contains PK(ni | nj), the conditional probability of moving from node nj to node ni in edge type K. For many of the edge types, this is either 0 or 1, but for the weighted edges, these are real valued.
			The full transition matrixM is then the column normalized sum of all of the edge types: M?
			= ? k Ek M = (?
