 i to i + n in a parse tree P. It generates three complex syntactic labels for the non-syntactic constituent phrase create equal in the parse tree given in Figure 2: We can use these complex labels instead of atomic non-terminal symbols to handle non-constituent phrases.
    For example, Table 4 shows the paraphrases and syntactic labels that are generated for the non-constituent phrase create equal.
    The paraphrases are significantly better than the paraphrases generated for the phrase by the baseline method (refer back to Table 2).
    The labels shown in the figure are a fraction of those that can be derived for the phrase in the parallel corpus.
    Each of these corresponds to a different syntactic context, and each has its own set of associated paraphrases.
    We increase the number of phrases that are paraphrasable from the 90,000 in our initial definition of SBP to 250,000 when we use complex CCG labels.
    The number of unique paraphrases increases from 800,000 to 3.5 million, which is nearly as
