asic numerical method.
    Two informal pilot studies indicated that it gave better results than linear discrimination and linear regression.
    LR is a statistical technique for modeling a binary response variable by a linear combination of one or more predictor variables, using a logit link function: and modeling variance with a binomial random variable, i.e., the dependent variable log(r 1(1 &#8212; 7r)) is modeled as a linear combination of the independent variables.
    The model has the form g(r) = xi,3 where r is the estimated response probability (in our case the probability of a particular facet value), xi is the feature vector for text i, and ,3 is the weight vector which is estimated from the matrix of feature vectors.
    The optimal value of i3 is derived via maximum likelihood estimation (McCullagh and Nelder, 1989), using SPlus (Statistical Sciences, 1991).
    For binary decisions, the application of LR was straightforward.
    For the polytomous facets GENRE and BROW, we computed a predictor
