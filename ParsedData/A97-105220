l predicates; the existing grammar distinguishes nominal and adjectival arguments from adjuncts structurally, so all that is required is extension of the classifier.
    Developing an analogous system for another language would be harder but not infeasible; similar taggers and parsers have been developed for a number of languages, but no extant subcategorization dictionaries exist to our knowledge, therefore the lexical statistics we utilize for statistical filtering would need to be estimated, perhaps using the technique described by Brent (1993).
    However, the entire approach to filtering needs improvement, as evaluation of our results demonstrates that it is the weakest link in our current system.
    Our system needs further refinement to narrow some subcategorization classes, for example, to choose between differing control options with predicative complements.
    It also needs supplementing with information about diathesis alternation possibilities (e.g.
    Levin, 1993) and semantic selection prefe
