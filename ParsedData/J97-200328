    String-toweight transducers clearly realize functions mapping E* to 12.&#177;.
    Since the operations we need to consider are addition and min, and since (74 U { oo }, min, +, oo, 0) is a semiring, we call these functions formal power series.'
    We adopt the terminology and notation used in formal language theory (Berstel and Reutenauer 1988; Kuich and Salomaa 1986; Salomaa and Soittola 1978): The fundamental theorem of Schutzenberger (1961), analogous to Kleene's theorem for formal languages, states that a formal power series S is rational iff it is recognizable, that is, realizable by a string-to-weight transducer.
    The semiring (R.+ U { &#176;e}, min, +, 00, 0) used in many optimization problems is called the tropical semiring.3 So, the functions we consider here are more precisely rational power series over the tropical semiring.
    A string-to-weight transducer T is said to be unambiguous if for any given string w there exists at most one successful path labeled with w. In the fol
