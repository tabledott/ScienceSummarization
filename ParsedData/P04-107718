ng S1 as its reference, LCS counts either &#8220;the gunman&#8221; or &#8220;police killed&#8221;, but not both; therefore, S4 has the same ROUGE-L score as S3.
    BLEU-2 would prefer S4 over S3.
    In Section 4, we will introduce skip-bigram co-occurrence statistics that do not have this problem while still keeping the advantage of in-sequence (not necessary consecutive) matching that reflects sentence level word order.
    So far, we only demonstrated how to compute ROUGE-L using a single reference.
    When multiple references are used, we take the maximum LCS matches between a candidate translation, c, of n words and a set of u reference translations of mj words.
    The LCS-based F-measure can be computed as follows: where ,B = Plcs-multi/Rlcs-multi when aFlcs-multi/aRlcsmulti=aFlcs-multi/aPlcs-multi.
    This procedure is also applied to computation of ROUGE-S when multiple references are used.
    In the next section, we introduce the skip-bigram cooccurrence statistics.
    In the next section, we d
