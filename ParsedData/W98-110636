   Currently, we are assuming that each semantic category will be uniquely associated with a conceptual role, which may be an unrealistic assumption for some domains.
    One avenue for future work is to develop more sophisticated methods for mapping semantic preferences to conceptual roles.
    One could also have a human review the case frames and manually remove inappropriate slots.
    For now, we chose to avoid additional human interaction and used the case frames exactly as they were generated.
  
  
    The purpose of the selectional restrictions is to constrain the types of information that can be instantiated by each slot.
    Consequently, we hoped that the case frames would be more reliably instantiated than the extraction patterns, thereby producing fewer false hits.
    To evaluate the case frames, we used the same corpus and evaluation metrics as previous experiments with AutoSlog and AutoSlogTS (Riloff, 1996b) so that we can draw comparisons between them.
    For training, we used the 1500 MUC4
