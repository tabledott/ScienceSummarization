    The term experimental must be taken quite seriously here though, if my view of machine translation were more generally held, it would be redundant.
    I believe that all machine translation of natural languages is experimental and that he who claims otherwise does his more serious colleagues a serious disservice.
    I should not wish any thing that I say in this paper as a claim to have solved any of the miriad problems that stand between us and working machine translation systems worthy of the name.
