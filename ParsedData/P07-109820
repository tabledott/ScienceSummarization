d PASN when combined with the question&#8217;s BOW feature alone, i.e. no PT is used.
    The results, reported in Figure 6, show that this time PASN performs better than PAS.
    This suggests that the dependencies between the nested PASs are in some way captured by the PT information.
    Indeed, it should be noted that we join predicates only in case one is subordinate to the other, thus considering only a restricted set of all possible predicate dependencies.
    However, the improvement over PAS confirms that PASN is the right direction to encode shallow semantics from different sentence predicates.
    The output of the answer classifier can be used to re-rank the list of candidate answers of a QA system.
    Starting from the top answer, each instance can be classified based on its correctness with respect to the question.
    If it is classified as correct its rank is unchanged; otherwise it is pushed down, until a lower ranked incorrect answer is found.
    We used the answer classifier with the high
