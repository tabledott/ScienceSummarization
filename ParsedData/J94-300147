 abababababa At least three different outcomes are possible, namely: Result (1) is obtained if the first application is at the leftmost eligible position in the string; each successive application applies to the output of any preceding one, and further to the right in the string.
    We call this the left-to-right strategy.
    The corresponding right-to-left strategy gives rise to (2).
    Result (3) comes from identifying all possible rule applications in the original string and carrying them out simultaneously.
    All three strategies have been advocated by phonologists.
    We shall assume that each rule is marked individually to show which strategy is to be employed for it.
    We shall concentrate on these three strategies, but other less obvious ones can also be treated by simple rearrangements of our techniques.
    Optional rules and most obligatory rules will produce at least one output string, perhaps just a copy of the input if the conditions for application are nowhere satisfied.
