    Subjective evaluation of generation output is 2Measuring word overlap or edit distance between the system's output and a &amp;quot;reference&amp;quot; set would be an automatic scoring method.
    We believe that such a method does not accurately measure the correctness or grammaticality of the text. not ideal, but is arguably superior than an automatic evaluation that fails to correlate with human linguistic judgement.
    The results of the manual evaluation, as well as the values of the search and feature selection parameters for all systems, are shown in Tables 5, 6, 7, and 8.
    (The values for N, M, and K were determined by manually evaluating the output of the 4 or 5 most common attribute sets in the training data).
    The weighted results in Tables 5 and 6 account for multiple occurrences of attribute sets, whereas the unweighted results in Tables 7 and 8 count each unique attribute set once, i.e., { $city-fr Scity-to } is counted 741 times in the weighted r
