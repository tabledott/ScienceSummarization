edicates, but semantic relations can involve words of any part of speech.
  
  
    This section examines past work on measuring attributional and relational similarity using the VSM.
    The VSM was first developed for information retrieval (Salton and McGill 1983; Salton and Buckley 1988; Salton 1989) and it is at the core of most modern search engines (Baeza-Yates and Ribeiro-Neto 1999).
    In the VSM approach to information retrieval, queries and documents are represented by vectors.
    Elements in these vectors are based on the frequencies of words in the corresponding queries and documents.
    The frequencies are usually transformed by various formulas and weights, tailored to improve the effectiveness of the search engine (Salton 1989).
    The attributional similarity between a query and a document is measured by the cosine of the angle between their corresponding vectors.
    For a given query, the search engine sorts the matching documents in order of decreasing cosine.
    The VSM approach has a
