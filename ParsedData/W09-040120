d doing oracle experiments where the contributions of individual systems are weighted according to human judgments of their quality.
    Understandability Our hope is that judging the acceptability of edited output as discussed in Section 3 gives some indication of how often a system&#8217;s output was understandable.
    Figure 6 gives the percentage of times that each system&#8217;s edited output was judged to be acceptable (the percentage also factors in instances when judges were unable to improve the output because it was incomprehensible).
    The edited output of the best performing systems under this evaluation model were deemed acceptable around 50% of the time for French-English, English-French, EnglishSpanish, German-English, and English-German.
    For Spanish-English the edited output of the best system was acceptable around 40% of the time, for English-Czech it was 30% and for Czech-English and Hungarian-English it was around 20%.
