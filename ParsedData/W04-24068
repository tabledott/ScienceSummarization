ering algorithm.
    The context group discrimination method used by Sch&#168;utze, on the other hand, operates on the vector representations of instances and thus works in vector space.
    Also he employs a hybrid clustering approach which uses both an agglomerative and the Estimation Maximization (EM) algorithm.
  
  
    First order context vectors directly indicate which features make up a context.
    In all of our experiments, the context of the target word is limited to 20 surrounding content words on either side.
    This is true both when we are selecting features from a set of training data, or when we are converting test instances into vectors for clustering.
    The particular features we are interested in are bigrams and co&#8211;occurrences.
    Co-occurrences are words that occur within five positions of the target word (i.e., up to three intervening words are allowed).
    Bigrams are ordered pairs of words that co&#8211;occur within five positions of each other.
    Thus, co&#8211;occurrence
