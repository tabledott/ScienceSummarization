			We have described a number of ways of calculating distributional similarity.
			We now con sider whether there is substantial variation ina word?s distributionally nearest neighbours ac cording to the chosen measure.
			We do this by calculating the overlap between neighbour setsfor 2000 nouns generated using different mea sures from direct-object data extracted from the British National Co
