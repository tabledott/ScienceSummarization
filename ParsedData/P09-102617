connectives (ARG1 and ARG2 in Penn Discourse Treebank terms).
    If the connective is mid-sentence, the part of the sentence prior to the connective is considered conceded, and the part that follows the connective is considered nonconceded.
    An example is the second sentence of Example 3.
    If, on the other hand, the connective is sentence-initial, the sentence is split at the first comma that occurs mid sentence.
    The first part is considered conceded, and the second part is considered non-conceded.
    An example is the first sentence of Example 1.
    The opinions occurring in the conceded part are interpreted in reverse.
    That is, the weights corresponding to the sides wj and uj are interchanged in equation 4.
    Thus, conceded opinions are effectively made to count towards the opposing side.
