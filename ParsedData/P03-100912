of different strategies have been proposed for evaluation of clustering.
    We concentrate here on those which deliver a numerical value which is easy to interpret, and do not introduce biases towards specific numbers of classes or class sizes.
    As we currently assign a single sense to each polysemic verb (sec.
    5.4) the measures we use are also applicable for evaluation against a polysemous gold standard.
    Our first measure, the adjusted pairwise precision (APP), evaluates clusters in terms of verb pairs (Schulte im Walde and Brew, 2002) 9: num. of correct pairs in ki |ki|&#8722;1 &#183; num. of pairs in ki |ki|+1 .
    APP is the average proportion of all within-cluster pairs that are correctly co-assigned.
    It is multiplied by a factor that increases with cluster size.
    This factor compensates for a bias towards small clusters.
    Our second measure is derived from purity, a global measure which evaluates the mean precision of the clusters, weighted according to the cluster size (Stevenson
