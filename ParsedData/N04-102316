llel by sharing the same weight vector .
    The margin is defined on the distance between the top items and the bottom items in each cluster, as shown in Figure 1.
    Let be the feature vector of the translation of the sentence, and be the rank for this translation among all the translations for the sentence.
    Then the set of training samples is: where is the number of clusters and is the length of ranks for each cluster.
    Let be a linear function, where is the feature vector of a translation, and is a weight vector.
    We construct a hypothesis function with as follows. where is a function that takes a list of scores for the candidate translations computed according to the evaluation metric and returns the rank in that list.
    For example .
    The splitting algorithm searches a linear function that successfully splits the top -ranked and bottom -ranked translations for each sentence, where .
    Formally, let for any linear function .
    We look for the function such that which means that can su
