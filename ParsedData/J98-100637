    It remains to be seen whether a statistical classifier trained on a topically organized corpus such as an encyclopedia will perform in the same way when tested on general unrestricted text, such as newspapers, periodicals, and books.
    One of our goals is to determine whether automatic extraction of training examples is feasible using general corpora.
    In his experiment, Yarowsky uses an updated on-line version of Roget's Thesaurus that is not generally available to the research community.
    The only generally available version of Roget's is the 1912 edition, which contains many lexical gaps.
    We are using WordNet, which can be obtained via anonymous ftp.
    Yarowsky's classifier is purely topical, but we also examine local context.
    Finally, we hope to avoid inclusion of spurious senses by using monosemous relatives.
    In this experiment we collected monosemous relatives of senses of 14 nouns.
    Training sets are created in the following manner.
