 refers to the same input index in all states, all nonterminals Xi, X2, ..., X, have been expanded into the same substring of the input between ki and the current position.
    By assumption the grammar contains no nonterminals that generate 6,12 therefore we must have Ai = A2 = &#8226; &#8226; &#8226; = A, = &#8364;, q.e.d.
    0 We now formally define the relation between nonterminals mediated by unit productions, analogous to the left-corner relation.
  
  
    The following definitions are relative to a given SCFG G. As before, a matrix inversion can compute the relation Ru in closed form: The existence of Ru is shown in Appendix A.
    The modified completion loop in the probabilistic Earley parser can now use the Ru matrix to collapse all unit completions into a single step.
    Note that we still have to do iterative completion on non-unit productions.
