ltilingual track and the development set and the two test sets of the domain adaptation track.
			920results for the CHILDES data was considered op tional.
			Like the chemical data set, this data set was only used for final testing.
			Finally, a large corpus of unlabeled in-domaindata was provided for each data set and made avail able for training.
			This data was drawn from theWSJ, PubMed.com (specific to biomedical and chemical research literature), and the CHILDES data base.The data was tokenized to be as consistent as pos sible with the WSJ training set.
			3.3 Overview.
			Table 1 describes the characteristics of the data sets.
			For the multilingual track, we provide statistics over the training and test sets; for the domain adaptationtrack, the statistics were extracted from the develop ment set.
			Following last year?s shared task practice (Buchholz and Marsi, 2006), we use the following definition of projectivity: An arc (i, j) is projective iff all nodes occurring between i and j are dominated
