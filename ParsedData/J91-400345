    But 1 maintain that there are only a finite number of default interpretations available in such constructions.
    These form part of the lexical semantics of the noun.
    Additional evidence for this distinction is given in Pustejovsky and Anick (1988) and Briscoe et al. (1990).
    22 Partee and Rooth (1983) suggest that all expressions in the language can be assigned a base type, while also being associated with a type ladder.
    Pustejovsky (1989a) extends this proposal, and argues that each expression a may have available to it, a set of shifting operators, which we call Ea, which operate over an expression, changing its type and denotation.
    By making reference to these operators directly in the rule of function application, we can treat the functor polymorphically, as illustr
