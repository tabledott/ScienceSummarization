  We will probably have to tie some parameters to solve the insufficient data problem.
  Moreover, we have to study the method to adapt he system to a new domain.
  To develop an m~supervised learning method, like the forward-backward algorithm for IIMM, is an urgent goal, since we cant always ex- pect the availability of manually segmented and tagged data.
  We can think of an EM algorithm by replacing maximization with summation in the extended Viterbi algorithm, but we dont know how to handle unknown words in this algorithm.
