a relation example, the one with larger margin will be selected as the final answer.
    The ACE RDR training data contains 348 documents, 125K words and 4400 relations.
    It consists of both nwire and bnews documents.
    Evaluation of kernels was done on the training data using 5-fold cross-validation.
    We also evaluated the full kernel setup with SVM on the official test data, which is about half the size of the training data.
    All the data is preprocessed by the Charniak parser and GLARF dependency analyzer.
    Then relation examples are generated based these results.
    Table 2 shows the performance of the SVM on different kernel setups.
    The kernel setups in this experiment are incremental.
    From this table we can see that adding kernels continuously improves the performance, which indicates they provide additional clues to the previous setup.
    The argument kernel treats the two arguments as independent entities.
    The link sequence kernel introduces the syntactic connection between
