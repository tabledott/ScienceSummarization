ientation&#8212;having particular semantic orientation or not (evaluative) or not (non-evaluative).
    For each target term&#8211;emotion pair, we convert the fourlevel semantic orientation annotations into two-level ones, just as we did for the emotions.
    Table 8 gives percent of target terms considered to be evaluative.
    The last row in the table gives the percentage of terms evaluative with respect to some semantic orientation (positive or negative).
    Table 9 shows how many terms in each category are positively and negatively evaluative.
    Observe in Table 9 that, across the board, a sizable number of terms are evaluative with respect to some semantic orientation.
    Interestingly unigram nouns have a markedly lower proportion of negative terms, and a much higher proportion of positive terms.
    It may be argued that the default semantic orientation of noun concepts is positive, and that usually it takes a negative adjective to make the phrase negative.
