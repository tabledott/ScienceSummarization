e same high score even if the total number of occurrences of desert and dessert in the training corpus were 50 and 5, respectively - in which case arid's performance of 10/11 would be exactly what one would expect by chance, and therefore hardly impressive.
    Besides the reliability metric, therefore, we also considered an alternative metric: the uncertainty coefficient of x, denoted U(xly) [Press et al., 1988, p.501].
    U(xly) measures how much additional information we get about the presence of the feature by knowing the choice of word in the confusion set.6 U(xly) is calculated as follows: The probabilities are calculated for the population consisting of all occurrences in the training corpus of any w. For instance, p(f) is the probability of feature f being present within this words learned for {peace, piece} with k = 24.
    Each line gives a context word, and the number of peace and piece occurrences for which that context word occurred within +k words., The last line of the table gives the total nu
