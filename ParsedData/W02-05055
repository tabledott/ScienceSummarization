d w is generated according to its unigram probabilities Pe).
    Then, the English word w is pronounced (i.e., converted to sound sequence c) with probability P (61w) which is collected directly from an English pronunciation dictionary.
    Finally, the English phoneme sequence is converted into Arabic writing with probability P (a lc), which we discuss in details in Section 4.
    The pronunciation model P(e I w) converts English letter sequences into English sound sequences.
    The model proposed by Stalls and Knight (1998) uses a pronunciation dictionary to do this conversion.
    Therefore, only words with known pronunciations in the dictionary can be transliterated.
    One way to overcome this limitation is to train a model that can map any given English letter sequence into its corresponding English sound sequence.
    This mapping is a complex task because of the mismatch between English spelling and English pronunciation.
    This difficulty, coupled with the difficulty of mapping Arabic letter sequ
