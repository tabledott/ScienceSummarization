			We also develop a maximum entropy binary classifier for opinion-source link relation classification.
			Given an opinion-source pair, Oi-Sj , the re lation classifier decides whether the pair exhibits a valid link relation, Li,j . The relation classifier focuses only on the syntactic structure and lexical properties between the two entities of a given pair, without knowing whether the proposed entities are correct.
