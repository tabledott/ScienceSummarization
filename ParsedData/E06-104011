ext shown in Table 1 is a typical example), which resulted in a set of about 500 wind forecasts.
    We excluded several forecasts for which we had no input data (numerical weather predictions) or an incomplete set of system outputs; this left 465 texts, which we used in our evaluation.
    The inputs to the generators were tuples composed of an index, timestamp, wind direction, wind speed range, and gust speed range (see examples at top of Table 1).
    We randomly selected a subset of 21 forecast dates for use in human evaluations.
    For these 21 forecast dates, we also asked two meteorologists who had not contributed to the original SUMTIME corpus to write new forecasts texts; we used these as reference texts for the automatic metrics.
    The forecasters created these texts by rewriting the corpus texts, as this was a more natural task for them than writing texts based on tuples.
    500 wind descriptions may seem like a small corpus, but in fact provides very good coverage as the domain language is ext
