s the number of subjects agreeing on a boundary increases.
    A conservative means for estimating a lower bound for the reliability of our method, using Krippendorff's a as a metric, suggests that the method is reliable.
    The reliability evaluation is conservative in part because it uses fewer subjects to derive boundaries.
    Note that it is conservative also because it is based on the proportion of identical matches between two data sets.
    This type of metric ignores the inherent fuzziness of segment location, as discussed in Passonneau and Litman (1996).
    We conclude that boundaries identified by at least three of seven subjects most likely reflect the validity of the underlying notion that utterances in discourse can be grouped into more-orless coherent segments.
    What remains is the question of whether linguistic features correlate at all well with these segments.
  
  
    As discussed in Section 2, there has been little work on examining the use of linguistic cues for recognizing or gener
