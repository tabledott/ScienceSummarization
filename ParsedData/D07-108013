			Algorithm 1 is our generic online training algo rithm.
			The algorithm is slightly different from other online training algorithms (Tillmann and Zhang,2006; Liang et al, 2006) in that we keep and update oracle translations, which is a set of good translations reachable by a decoder according to a met ric, i.e. BLEU (Papineni et al, 2002).
			In line 3,a k-best list is generated by bestk(?)
			using the cur rent weight vector wi for the training instance of( f t, et).
			Each training instance has multiple (or, pos sibly one) reference translations et for the source sentence f t. Using the k-best list, m-best oracletranslations Ot is updated by oraclem(?)
			for every it eration (line 4).
			Usually, a decoder cannot generatetranslations that exactly match the reference transla tions due to its beam search pruning and OOV.
			Thus, we cannot always assign scores for each reference translation.
			Therefore, possible oracle translations are maintained accor
