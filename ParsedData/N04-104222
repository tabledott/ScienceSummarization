n new state-of-the-art performance in extracting standard fields from research papers, with a significant error reduction by several metrics.
    We also suggest better evaluation metrics to facilitate future research in this task&#8212;especially field-F1, rather than word accuracy.
    We have provided an empirical exploration of a few previously-published priors for conditionally-trained loglinear models.
    Fundamental advances in regularization for CRFs remains a significant open research area.
