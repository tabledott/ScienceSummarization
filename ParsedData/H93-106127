  In order to take advantage of this aspect of universal seman- tic concordances, it is necessary to be able to query the tex- tual component for associated concepts.
  Data on sense co- occurrences build up slowly, of course, but they will be a valuable by-product of this line of work.
  Testing We are developing a version of the ConText interface that can be used for psychometric testing.
  The taggers task in using ConText resembles an extended multiple-choice examination, and we believe that that feature can be adapted to test reading comprehension.
  Given a text that has already been tagged, readers comprehension can be tested by seeing whether they are able to choose correct senses on the basis of the contexts of use.
  No doubt here are other, even better uses for semantic on- cordances.
  As the variety of potential applications grows, however, the need to automate the process of semantic tag- ging will become ever more pressing.
  But we must begin with what we have.
  We are now f
