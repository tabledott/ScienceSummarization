ver, it cannot be used for discontiguous substrings.
			Consider the rule aXbXc.
			If we search for this rule in the followinglogical suffix array fragment, we will find the bold faced matches.
			... a c a c b a d c a d ... a c a d b a a d b d ... a d d b a a d a b c ... a d d b d a a b b a ... a d d b d d c a a a ...
			Even though these suffixes are in lexicographicalorder, matching suffixes are interspersed with non matching suffixes.
			We will need another algorithmto find the source rules containing at least oneX surrounded by nonempty sequences of terminal sym bols.
			4.1 Baseline Approach.
			In the pattern-matching literature, words spanned by the nonterminal symbols of Chiang?s grammar are called don?t cares and a nonterminal symbol in a query pattern that matches a sequence of don?t caresis called a variable length gap.
			The search prob lem for patterns containing these gaps is a variant of approximate pattern matching, which has receivedsubstantial attention (Navarro, 2001).
