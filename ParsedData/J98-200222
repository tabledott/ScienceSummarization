ACT, the same if-clause evaluates to false since L'( [VEHICLE, AIRPLANE]) = 40.97, L' ([ARTIFACT]) = 41.09, and hence [VEHICLE, AIRPLANE] is returned.
    Concerning the above algorithm, we show that the following proposition holds: The algorithm Find-MDL terminates in time 0(N x Si),I where N denotes the number of leaf nodes in the input thesaurus tree T and IS I denotes the input sample size, and outputs a tree cut model of T with the minimum description length (with respect to the encoding scheme described in Section 3.1).
    Here we will give an intuitive explanation of why the proposition holds, and give the formal proof in Appendix A.
    The MLE of each node (class) is obtained simply by dividing the frequency of nouns within that class by the total sample size.
    Thus, the parameter estimation for each subtree can be done independently from the estimation of the parameters outside the subtree.
    The data description length for a subtree thus depends solely on the tree cut within that subtree, and
