As an example, figure 2 shows an input dependency structure, and three different lexicalized trees with this dependency structure.
    The choice of tree structure is crucial in determining the independence assumptions that the parsing model makes.
    There are at least 3 degrees of freedom when deciding on the tree structures: To provide a baseline result we implemented what is probably the simplest possible conversion scheme: The baseline approach gave a result of 71.9% accuracy on the development test set.
    While the baseline approach is reasonably successful, there are some linguistic phenomena that lead to clear problems.
    This section describes some tree transformations that are linguistically motivated, and lead to improvements in parsing accuracy.
    In the PDT the verb is taken to be the head of both sentences and relative clauses.
    Figure 4 illustrates how the baseline transformation method can lead to parsing errors in relative clause cases.
    Figure 4(c) shows the solution to the prob
