f 18.75%, while picking at random would have resulted in an error rate of 37%, for an improvement by a factor of 2.
    This suggests that probabilistic modeling can be a powerful tool for controlling the high degree of ambiguity in efforts to automatically acquire lexical data.
    We have also begun to explore heuristics for combining lexical data for a single word acquired from a number of partial parses.
    There are some cases in which the best approach is to unify the two learned sets of lexical features, so that the derived sense becomes the sum of the information learned from the two examples.
    For instance, the verb subcategorization information learned from one example could be thus combined with agreement information learned from another.
    On the other hand, there are many cases, including alternative subcategorization frames, where each of the encountered options needs to be included as a separate alternative.
    Traditionally, natural language processing (NLP) has focused on obtaining com
