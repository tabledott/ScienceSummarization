 we describe the statistical alignment models used to obtain a word alignment and techniques for learning phrase translations from word alignments.
    Here, the term phrase just refers to a consecutive sequence of words occurring in text and has to be distinguished from the use of the term in a linguistic sense.
    The learned bilingual phrases are not constrained by linguistic phrase boundaries.
    Compared to the word-based statistical translation models in Brown et al. (1993), this model is based on a (statistical) phrase lexicon instead of a single-word-based lexicon.
    Looking at the results of the recent machine translation evaluations, this approach seems currently to give the best results, and an increasing number of researchers are working on different methods for learning phrase translation lexica for machine translation purposes (Marcu and Wong 2002; Venugopal, Vogel, and Waibel 2003; Tillmann 2003; Koehn, Och, and Marcu 2003).
    Our approach to learning a phrase translation lexicon works in
