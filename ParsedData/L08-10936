			Two alternatives including change of temporal mutual information and relative change of temporal mutual information are employed to detect unusual events.
			Given timestamps t1 and t2 with temporal mutual information MI1 and MI2, the change of temporal mutual information is calculated by (MI2-MI1).
			The relative change of temporal mutual information is calculated by (MI2 MI1)/MI1.
			For each plausible event, there is a seed collocation, e.g., ?Typhoon Chanchu?.
			In the event description retrieval phase, we try to select the collocations with the highest mutual information with the word w in a seed collocation.
			They will form a collocation network for the event.
			Initially, the seed collocation is placed into the network.
			When a new collocation is added, we compute the mutual information of the multiword collocations by the following formula, where n is the number of collocations in the network up to now.
			?= n iMInInformatioMutualMultiwo If the multiword mutual information is lower than a t
