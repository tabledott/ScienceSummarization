grammar for a surface realization component can be fully specified by hand.
    Moreover, in many cases it is very important not to deviate from very specific output in generation (e.g., maritime weather reports), in which case hand-crafted grammars give excellent control.
    In these cases, evaluations of the generator that rely on human judgments (Lester and Porter, 1997) or on human annotation of the test corpora (Kukich, 1983) are quite sufficient.
    However, in other NLG applications the variety of the output is much larger. and the demands on the quality of the output are somewhat less stringent.
    A typical example is NLG in the context of (interlingua- or transfer-based) machine translation.
    Another reason for relaxing the quality of the output may be that not enough time is available to develop a full grammar. for a new target language in NLG.
    In all these cases, stochastic methods provide an alternative to hand-crafted approaches to NLG.
    To our knowledge, the first to use stochastic
