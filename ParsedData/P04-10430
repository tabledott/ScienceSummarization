  A Study On Convolution Kernels For Shallow Statistic Parsing
  
    In this paper we have designed and experimented novel convolution kernels for automatic classification of predicate arguments.
    Their main property is the ability to process structured representations.
    Support Vector Machines (SVMs), using a combination of such kernels and the flat feature kernel, classify Prop- Bank predicate arguments with accuracy higher the current argument classification state- Additionally, experiments on FrameNet data have shown that SVMs are appealing for the classification of semantic roles even if the proposed kernels do not produce any improvement.
  
  
    Several linguistic theories, e.g.
    (Jackendoff, 1990) claim that semantic information in natural language texts is connected to syntactic structures.
    Hence, to deal with natural language semantics, the learning algorithm should be able to represent and process structured data.
    The classical solution adopted for such tasks is to convert synt
