on of the two, averaged across three runs for each training set.
    To the extent that the words used are representative, some clear differences appear as a function of syntactic category.
    With the verb serve, local context was more reliable than topical context at all levels of training (78% versus 68% with 200 training examples for the least frequent sense).
    The combination of local and topical context showed improvement (83%) over either form alone (see Figure 1).
    With the adjective hard, local context was much more reliable as an indicator of sense than topical context for all training sizes (83% versus 60% with 200 training examples) and the combined classifier's performance (at 83%) was the same as for local (see Figure 2).
    In the case of the noun line, topical was slightly better than local at all set sizes, but with 200 training examples, their combination yielded 84% accuracy, greater than either topical (78%) or local (67%) alone (see Figure 3).
    To summarize, local context was m
