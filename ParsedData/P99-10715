Barzilay and Elhadakl, 1997).
    Extraction techniques can work only if summary sentences already appear in the article.
    Extraction cannot handle the task we address, because summarization of multiple documents requires information about similarities and differences across articles.
    While most of the summarization work has focused on single articles, a few initial projects have started to study multi-document summarization documents.
    In constrained domains, e.g., terrorism, a coherent summary of several articles can be generated, when a detailed semantic representation of the source text is available.
    For example, information extraction systems can be used to interpret the source text.
    In this framework, (Radev and McKeown, 1998) use generation techniques to highlight changes over time across input articles about the same event.
    In an arbitrary domain, statistical techniques are used to identify similarities and differences across documents.
    Some approaches directly exploit word d
