    For instance, the word fragile correctly translates into Romanian as fragil, yet this word is frequently used to refer to breakable objects, and it loses its subjective meaning of delicate.
    Other words, such as one-sided, completely lose subjectivity once translated, as it becomes in Romanian cu o singura latur&#728;a, meaning with only one side (as of objects).
    Interestingly, the reliability of clues in the English lexicon seems to help preserve subjectivity.
    Out of the 77 entries marked as strong, 11 were judged to be objective in Romanian (14.3%), compared to 14 objective Romanian entries obtained from the 36 weak English clues (39.0%).
    Starting with the Romanian lexicon, we developed a lexical classifier similar to the one introduced by (Riloff and Wiebe, 2003).
    At the core of this method is a high-precision subjectivity and objectivity classifier that can label large amounts of raw text using only a subjectivity lexicon.
    Their method is further improved with a boo
