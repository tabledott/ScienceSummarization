ord graphs for a bottom-top search with the IBM constraints is described in (Ueffing et al., 2002).
    These methods cannot be applied to the CYK-style search for the ITG constraints.
    Here, the idea for the generation of word graphs is the following: assuming we already have word graphs for the source sequences fkjl and fjr in monotone or inverted order.
    Now, we describe this idea in a more formal way.
    A word graph is a directed acyclic graph (dag) with one start and one end node.
    The edges are annotated with target language words or phrases.
    We also allow 2-transitions.
    These are edges annotated with the empty word.
    Additionally, edges may be annotated with probabilities of the language or translation model.
    Each path from start node to end node represents one translation hypothesis.
    The probability of this hypothesis is calculated by multiplying the probabilities along the path.
    During the search, we have to combine two word graphs in either monotone or inverted orde
