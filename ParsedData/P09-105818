n and baseline policies.
    The third and fourth columns indicate the numbers of known and artificial unknown words in the training phase.
    The total number of words is the same, but the different policies yield different balances between the known and artificial unknown words for learning the hybrid model.
    Optimal balances were selected using the development set.
    The error-driven policy provides additional artificial unknown words in the training set.
    The error-driven policy can improve ROOV as well as maintain good RIV, resulting in overall F1 improvements.
    In this section, we attempt to make meaningful comparison with the best prior approaches reported in the literature.
    Although most previous studies used CTB, their versions of CTB and experimental settings are different, which complicates comparison.
    Ng and Low (2004) (N&amp;L04) used CTB 3.0.
    However, they just showed POS tagging results on a per character basis, not on a per word basis.
