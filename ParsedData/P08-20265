icism of the work.
    The results are completely in line with what one would expect given the base parser and the relatively small size of the Brown treebank. the parser of Bikel (2004).
    The other parsers were not close.
    However, several very good current parsers were not available when this paper was written (e.g., the Berkeley Parser (Petrov et al., 2006)).
    However, since the newer parsers do not perform quite as well as the C/J parser on WSJ data, it is probably the case that they would not significantly alter the landscape.
  
  
    We used as the base parser the standardly available C/J parser.
    We then self-trained the parser on approximately 270,000 sentences &#8212; a random selection of abstracts from Medline.3 Medline is a large database of abstracts and citations from a wide variety of biomedical literature.
    As we note in the next section, the number 270,000 was selected by observing performance on a development set.
    We weighted the original WSJ hand annotated sentences equ
