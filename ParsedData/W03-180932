ed amounts of data and relatively simplistic models of a cognitively intensive task.
    We interpret them as very positive indicators of the viability of using empirical methods to analyse VPC semantics.
  
  
    This paper has described the implementation and evaluation of four corpus-based approaches to the semantics of verb-particle constructions.
    We created a set of gold-standard data, based on non-expert judgements acquired via a web-based experiment.
    We then implemented four different techniques and showed that they offer a significant improvement over a naive approach.
