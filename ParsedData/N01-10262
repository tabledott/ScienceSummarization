gnments rather than the induction of stand-alone monolingual analyzers via cross-language projection.
    For example, Kupiec (1993) began with existing Xerox monolingual bracketers to improve translation alignments, rather than the converse.
    The primary exception has been in the area of parallel bilingual parsing.
    Wu (1995, 1997) proposed a framework for inversion transduction grammars, where parallel corpora in languages such as English and Chinese are parsed concurrently, with crosslanguage order differences captured via mobile-like CFG production reordering.
    Structural relationships in one language help constrain structural relationships in the second language.
    Evaluation on noun-phrase bracketing showed 78% precision for Chinese, and 80% precision for English.
    Thus, while remarkably effective for learning without humanannotated training data, the algorithm does assume the existence of a parallel second-language mirror for all sentences to be parsed.
    Also, Wu observed significant p
