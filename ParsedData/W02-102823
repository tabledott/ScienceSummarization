    The recall results range from 40-60%, which indicates that a good percentage of the category words are being found, although there are clearly more category words lurking in the corpus.
  
  
    Basilisk&#8217;s bootstrapping algorithm exploits two ideas: (1) collective evidence from extraction patterns can be used to infer semantic category associations, and (2) learning multiple semantic categories simultaneously can help constrain the bootstrapping process.
    The accuracy achieved by Basilisk is substantially higher than that of previous techniques for semantic lexicon induction on the MUC-4 corpus, and empirical results show that both of Basilisk&#8217;s ideas contribute to its performance.
