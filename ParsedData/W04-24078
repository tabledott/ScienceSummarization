			Figure 3: Parser transitions 2.3 Guided Parsing.
			One way of turning a nondeterministic parser into a deter ministic one is to use a guide (or oracle) that can inform the parser at each nondeterministic choice point; cf.
			Kay (2000), Boullier (2003).
			Guided parsing is normally used to improve the efficiency of a nondeterministic parser,e.g. by letting a simpler (but more efficient) parser con struct a first analysis that can be used to guide the choice of the more complex (but less efficient) parser.
			This is the approach taken, for example, in Boullier (2003).In our case, we rather want to use the guide to im prove the accuracy of a deterministic parser, starting from a baseline of randomized choice.
			One way of doing this is to use a treebank, i.e. a corpus of analyzed sentences, to train a classifier that can predict the next transition (and dependency type) given the current configura
