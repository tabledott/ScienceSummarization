ible to choose freely the lexical item that plays the role of the head for each structure.
  Consider the following example: S ~ NP  VP VP  "-~ adv VP VP  --+ v NP  --+ n The grammar can be qexicalized as follows: S NP VP / adv VP VP VP NP A I I adv VP v n However, in this lexiealization one is forced to choose adv as the head of the structure given in the first tree.
  It is not possible to choose the verb v as the head of this struc- ture.
  If one tried to do so, recursion on the substitution of the VP node would be inhibited.
  2"his example shows that although it is possible to lexi- calize CFGs, substitution alone does not allow us to freely choose the lexical heads.
  Substitution alone forces us to make choices that might not be syntactically and seman- tically justified.
  Tree adjoining grammars (TAGs) are also a tree-based system, ltowever, the major composition operation in TAGs is adjoining or adjunct ion.
  I t  builds a new tree from an auxiliary tree # and a tree c~ (a is any tree, initial, au
