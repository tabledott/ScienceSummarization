rable, we can assume a word that occurs in a certain context should have a translation that occurs in a similar context.
    Context, as we understand it here, is defined by the frequencies of context words in surrounding positions.
    This local context has to be translated into the other language, and we can search the word with the most similar context.
    This idea has already been investigated in earlier work.
    Rapp [1995, 1999] proposes to collect counts over words occurring in a four word window around the target word.
    For each occurrence of a target word, counts are collected over how often certain context words occur in the two positions directly ahead of the target word and the two following positions.
    The counts are collected separately for each position and then entered into in a context vector with an dimension for each context word in each position.
    Finally, the raw counts are normalized, so that for each of the four word positions the vector values add up to one.
