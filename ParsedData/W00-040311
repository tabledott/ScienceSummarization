E = 0, it should get no credit for the second sentence as it is subsumed by the first sentence.
    By varying E between 0 and I, the evaluation may favor or ignore subsumption.
  
  
    We ran two user experiments.
    First, six judges were each given six clusters and asked to ascribe an importance score from 0 to 10 to each sentence within a particular cluster.
    Next, five judges had to indicate for each sentence which other sentence(s), if any, it subsumes 8.
    Using the techniques described in Section 0, we computed the cross-judge agreement (J) for the 6 clusters for various r (Figure 3).
    Overall, interjudge agreement was quite high.
    An interesting drop in interjudge agreement occurs for 20-30% summaries.
    The drop most likely results from the fact that 10% summaries are typically easier to produce because the few most important sentences in a cluster are easier to identify.
    8 We should note that both annotation tasks were quite time consuming and frustrating for the users who took
