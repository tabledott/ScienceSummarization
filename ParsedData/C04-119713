e headword of an NP phrase is the right-most noun.
			Similarly, the left-most verb/proposition of a VP/PP phrase is extracted as the headword ? Sparse collocation picks one word/tag from the two words before the argument, the first word/tag, the last word/tag of the argument, and one word/tag from the two words after the argument to join as features.
			Although the predictions of the second-phaseclassifier can be used directly, the labels of argu ments in a sentence often violate some constraints.
			Therefore, we rely on the inference procedure to make the final predictions.
	
	
			Ideally, if the learned classifiers are perfect, arguments can be labeled correctly according to the classifiers?
			predictions.
			In reality, labels assigned to ar guments in a sentence often contradict each other,and violate the constraints arising from the struc tural and linguistic information.
			In order to resolve the conflicts, we design an inference procedure thattakes the confidence scores of each individual argument
