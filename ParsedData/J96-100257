s to choose, among all the models consistent with the constraints, the model with the greatest entropy.
    We observed that this model was a member of an exponential family with one adjustable parameter for each constraint.
    The optimal values of these parameters are obtained by maximizing the likelihood of the training data.
    Thus two different philosophical approaches&#8212; maximum entropy and maximum likelihood&#8212;yield the same result: the model with the greatest entropy consistent with the constraints is the same as the exponential model which best predicts the sample of data.
    We next discussed algorithms for constructing maximum entropy models, concentrating our attention on the two main problems facing would-be modelers: selecting a set of features to include in a model, and computing the parameters of a model containing these features.
    The general feature-selection process is too slow in practice, and we presented several techniques for making the algorithm feasible.
