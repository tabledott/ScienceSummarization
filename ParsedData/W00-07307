ied our proposed method to the test data of CoNLL-2000 shared task, while training with the complete training data.
    For the kernel function, we use the 2-nd polynomial function.
    We set the beam width N to 5 tentatively.
    SVMs training is carried out with the Slight package, which is designed and optimized to handle large sparse feature vector and large numbers of training examples (Joachims, 2000; Joachims, 1999a).
    It took about 1 day to train 231 classifiers with PC-Linux (Celeron 500Mhz, 512MB).
    Figure 1 shows the results of our experiments.
    The all the values of the chunking F-measure are almost 93.5.
    Especially, our method performs well for the chunk types of high frequency, such as NP, VP and PP.
  
  
    In this paper, we propose Chunk identification analysis based on Support Vector Machines.
    Although we select features for learning in very straight way &#8212; using all available features such as the words their POS tags without any cut-off threshold for the number of oc
