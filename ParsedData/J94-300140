these operations preserve both regularity and string length.
    An additional path-language argument shows that they are also closed under relative difference.
    Let T1 and T2 be E-free acceptors for R1 and R2 and construct an fsm P that accepts the regular pairsymbol language Paths(Ti) - Paths(T2).
    A string-pair belongs to the regular relation Rel(P) if and only if it has an accepting path in Ti but not in T2.
    Thus Rel(P) is R1 - R2.
    Being a subset of R1, it is also same-length.
    Let us summarize the results to this point.
    If L1, L2, and L are regular languages and R1, R2, and R are regular relations, then we know that the following relations are regular: R1 U R2 R1 &#8226; R2 R* R-1 R1 0 R2 Id(L) L1 X L2 Rev(R) We know also that the following languages are regular (x is a string): Furthermore, if R1, R2, and R are in the same-length subclass, then the following also belong to that restricted subclass: Ri U R2 Ri &#8226; R2 R* R-1 RI 0 R2 Rev(R) RI n R2 R1 - R2 Id(L) is also same-length
