gory.2 MetaBoot then re-scores the extraction patterns, using the original seed words as well as the newly labeled words, and the process repeats.
    This procedure is called mutual bootstrapping.
    A second level of bootstrapping (the &#8220;meta-&#8221; bootstrapping part) makes the algorithm more robust.
    When the mutual bootstrapping process is finished, all nouns that were put into the semantic dictionary are reevaluated.
    Each noun is assigned a score based on how many different patterns extracted it.
    Only the five best nouns are allowed to remain in the dictionary.
    The other entries are discarded, and the mutual bootstrapping process starts over again using the revised semantic dictionary.
    Basilisk (Thelen and Riloff, 2002) is a more recent bootstrapping algorithm that also utilizes extraction patterns to create a semantic dictionary.
    Similarly, Basilisk begins with an unannotated text corpus and a small set of seed words for a semantic category.
