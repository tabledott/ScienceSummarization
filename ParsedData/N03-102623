by stochastic selection.
    In contrast, a comparison between transfer runs with and without perfect disambiguation of the original string shows a decrease of about 5% in F-score, and of only .1 points for summarization quality when transferring from packed parses instead of from the manually selected parse.
    This shows that it is more important to learn what a good transferred f-structure looks like than to have a perfect f-structure to transfer from.
    The compression rates associated with the systems that used stochastic selection is around 60%, which is acceptable, but not as aggressive as human-written condensations.
    Note that in our current implementation, in some cases the transfer component was unable to operate on the packed representation.
    In those cases a parse was chosen at random as a conservative estimate of transfer from all parses.
    This fall-back mechanism explains the drop in F-score for the upper bound in comparing Figs.
    5 and 6.
