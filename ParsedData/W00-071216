of correct (C), inserted (I) , and deleted (D) words it predicts for each hypothesized conflation set.
    If Xu, represents word w's conflation set according to the algorithm, and if Yw represents its CELEX-based conflation set, then However, in making these computations, we disregard any CELEX words that are not in the algorithm's data set and vice versa.
    For example, suppose two algorithms were being compared on a data set where all the words from Figure 3 were available except &amp;quot;concerting&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;concertos.&amp;quot; Suppose further that one algorithm proposed that { a,b,c,d,e,f,g,i} formed a single conflation set whereas the other algorithm proposed the three sets { a,b,c,d},{e,g,i}, and {f}.
    Then Table 3 illustrates how the two algorithms would be scored.
    To explain Table 3, consider algorithm one's entries for 'a.'
    Algorithm one had proposed that Xa=fa,b,c,d,e,f,g,il when in reality, = Ya={ a,b,c,d}.
    Since IX,, n Ya I = 4 and IYak4, then CA=4/ 4.
