rs to a question from a very large set of documents can be addressed by creating a context for the question and a knowledge representation of each document and then match the question context against each document representation.
    This approach is not practical yet since it involves advanced techniques in knowledge representation of open text, reasoning, natural language processing, and indexing that currently are beyond the technology state of the art.
    On the other hand, traditional information retrieval and extraction techniques alone can not be used for question answering due to the need to pinpoint exactly an answer in large collections of open domain texts.
    Thus, a mixture of natural language processing and information retrieval methods may be the solution for now.
    In order to better understand the nature of the QA task and put this into perspective, we offer in Table 6 a taxonomy of question answering systems.
    It is not sufficient to classify only the types of questions alone, since f
