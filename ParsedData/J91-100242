nters such as the exchange of words between a client at a post office and a postal worker.
    Ventola's chain-building rule was that each lexical item is &amp;quot;taken back once to the nearest preceding lexically cohesive item regardless of distance&amp;quot; (p. 131).
    In our work the related words in a chain are seen as indicating structural units of text, and hence distance between words is relevant.
    Ventola did not have the concept of chain returns, and transitivity was allowed up to any level.
    Her research was specific to the domain used.
    She does not discuss a computational method of determining the lexical chains.
    Hahn (1985) developed a text parsing system that considers lexical cohesion.
    Nouns in the text are mapped directly to the underlying model of the domain, which was implemented as a frame-structured knowledge base.
    Hahn viewed lexical cohesion as a local phenomenon between words in a sentence and the preceding one.
    There was also an extended recognizer that wo
