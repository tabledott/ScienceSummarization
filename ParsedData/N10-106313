notated articles are disjoint from the sentence-aligned articles described in Section 4.
    The following features are used in the lexicon model: Translation probability.
    This is the translation probability p(wtlws) from the HMM word alignment model trained on the seed parallel data.
    We also use the probability in the other direction, as well as the log-probabilities in the two directions.
    Position difference.
    This is the absolute value of the difference in relative position of words ws and wt in the articles 5 and T. Orthographic similarity.
    This is a function of the edit distance between source and target words.
    The edit distance between words written in different alphabets is computed by first performing a deterministic phonetic translation of the words to a common alphabet.
    The translation is inexact and this is a promising area for improvement.
    A similar source of information has been used to create seed lexicons in (Koehn and Knight, 2002) and as part of the feature spac
