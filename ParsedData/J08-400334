lt; k &lt; j, (i, l, k) E Acp, and cp&#8722;1 = (6|i|k, j|P, Acp ).
    Because &#8710;(p &#8722; 1) &lt; q, we can again use the inductive hypothesis to infer &#928;(p &#8722; 1, k, j) and &#928;(p, k, j).
    Moreover, there must be an earlier configuration cp&#8722;r (r &lt; O(p)) such that cp&#8722;r = (&#963;Ji,kJ&#946;,Acp&#8722;r) and O(p &#8722; r) &lt; q, which entails II(p &#8722; r, i, k) and II(p, i, k).
    As before, II(p, i, k), II(p, k,j) and (i, l, k) E Acp together entail II(p, i, j).
    For completeness, we need to show that for any sentence x and projective dependency forest Gx = (Vx, Ax) for x, there is a transition sequence C0,m such that Gcm = Gx.
    Using the same idea as in Proof 1, we prove this by induction on the length JxJ of x = (w0,w1,...,wn).
    Basis: If JxJ = 1, then the only projective dependency forest for x is G = ({0},0) and Gcm = Gx for C0,m = (cs(x)).
    Inductive step: Assume that the claim holds if JxJ &lt; p (for some p &gt; 1) and assume that JxJ = p + 1 and Gx
