aware of the fact that &#8220;achievements&#8221; and &#8220;succesele&#8221; are in fact translations of each other, because &#8220;succesele&#8221; is a morphologically inflected form which does not cooccur with &#8220;achievements&#8221; in our initial parallel corpus).
    The rest of the sentences are mostly not underlined, although we do have occasional connections, some correct and some wrong.
    The best we can do in this case is to infer that these two phrases are parallel, and discard the rest.
    Doing this gains us some new knowledge: the lexicon entry (achievements, succesele).
    We need to quantify more precisely the notions of &#8220;mostly translated&#8221; and &#8220;mostly not translated&#8221;.
    Our approach is to consider the target sentence as a numeric signal, where translated words correspond to positive values (coming from the distribution described in the previous Section), and the others to negative ones (coming from the distribution).
    We want to retain the parts of the se
