			Treebankshave been enormously influential in the develop ment of robust, state-of-the-art parsing technology:grammars (or grammatical information) automat ically extracted from treebank resources providethe backbone of many state-of-the-art probabilis tic parsing approaches (Charniak, 1996; Collins, 1999; Charniak, 1999; Hockenmaier, 2003; Kleinand Manning, 2003).
			Such approaches are attractive as they achieve robustness, coverage and performance while incurring very low grammar devel opment cost.
