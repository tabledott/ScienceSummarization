 al. (2008) followed the same method but they also implemented separate domain constraints for inference for the two models.
  
  
    The previous four CoNLL shared tasks popularized and, without a doubt, boosted research in semantic role labeling and dependency parsing.
    This year&#8217;s shared task introduces a new task that essentially unifies the problems addressed in the past four years under a unique, dependency-based formalism.
    This novel task is attractive both from a research perspective and an application-oriented perspective: &#8226; We believe that the proposed dependencybased representation is a better fit for many applications (e.g., Information Retrieval, Information Extraction) where it is often sufficient to identify the dependency between the predicate and the head of the argument constituent rather than extracting the complete argument constituent.
    &#8226; It was shown that the extraction of syntactic and semantic dependencies can be performed with state-of-the-art performance
