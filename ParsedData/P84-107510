t formalism [Kaplan and Bresnan, 83].
    Off-line parsability requires that the context-free &amp;quot;skeleton&amp;quot; of the grammar allows no trivial cyclic derivations of the form fl One reason for maintaining the simplicity of the bare PATR-I1 formalism is to permit a clean semantics for the language.
    We have provided a denotational semantics for PATR-11 [Pereira and Shieber, 841 based on the information systems domain theory of Dana Scott [Scott, 82).
    Insofar as more complex formalisms, such as GPSG and LFG, can be modeled as appropriate notations for PATR-II grammars, PATR-11's denotational semantics constitutes a framework in which the semantics of these formalisms can also be defined, discussed, and compared.
    As it appears that not all the power of domain theory is needed for the semantics of PATR-II, we are currently pursuing the possibility of building a semantics based on a less powerful mode1.3 Clearly, the bare PATR-II formalism, as it was presented in Section 2.1, is sorely inade
