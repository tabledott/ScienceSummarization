n the NP by quite often in the VP; instead it must delete the former and insert the latter.
    Thus we have the alignments (beaucoup d&#8217;, e) and (e, quite often).
    These require innovations.
    The tree-internal deletion of beaucoup d&#8217; is handled by an empty elementary tree in which the root is itself a frontier node.
    (The subject frontier node of kiss is replaced with this frontier node, which is then replaced with kids.)
    The tree-peripheral insertion of quite often requires an English frontier node that is paired with a French null.
    We also formulate STSGs flexibly enough that they can handle both phrase-structure trees and dependency trees.
    The latter are small and simple (Alshawi et al., 2000): tree nodes are words, and there need be no other structure to recover or align.
    Selectional preferences and other interactions can be accommodated by enriching the states.
    Any STSG has a weakly equivalent SCFG that generates the same string pairs.
    So STSG (unlike STAG) ha
