  Of course it is well-know that sense disambiguation is important for many natural language applications (including MT as well as many others).
  In the past, this fact has been seen as a serious obstacle blocking progress in natural language research since sense disambiguation is a very tricky unsolved problem, and it is unlikely that it will be solved in the near future.
  However, we prefer to view these same facts in a more optimistic light.
  In many cases, the French text can be used to disambiguate the English text, so that the French can be used to generate a corpus of (partially) sense-disambiguated English text.
  Such a sense- disambiguated corpus would be a valuable resource for all kinds of natural language applications.
  In particular, the corpus could be used to develop and test sense- disambiguation algorithms.
  For example, if you have an algorithm that is intended to distinguish the 6   money" sense of bank from the "place" sense of ban
