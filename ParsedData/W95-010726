lity of the resulting learned rule sequence.
  
  
    The automatic derivation of training and testing data from the Treebank analyses allowed for fully automatic scoring, though the scores are naturally subject to any remaining systematic errors in the data derivation process as well as to bona fide parsing errors in the Treebank source.
    Table 3 shows the results for the baseNP tests, and Table 4 shows the results for the partitioning chunks task.
    Since training set size has a significant effect on the results, values are shown for three different training set sizes.
    (The test set in all cases was 50K words.
    Training runs were halted after the first 500 rules; rules learned after that point affect relatively few locations in the training set and have only a very slight effect for good or ill on test set performance.)
    The first line in each table gives the performance of the baseline system, which assigned a baseNP or chunk tag to each word on the basis of the POS tag assigned in the prep
