gated morphology-based paraphrasing in the context of a term recognition task.
    However, there is no general algorithm capable of identifying a sentence as a paraphrase of another.
    In our case, such a comparison is less difficult since theme sentences are a priori close semantically, which significantly constrains the kinds of paraphrasing we need to check.
    In order to verify this assumption, we analyzed paraphrasing patterns through themes of our training corpus derived from the Topic Detection and Tracking corpus (Allan et al., 1998).
    Overall, 200 pairs of sentences conveying the same information were analyzed.
    We found that 85% of the paraphrasing is achieved by syntactic and lexical transformations.
    Examples of paraphrasing that require world knowledge are presented below: 'To be exact, the result of the algorithm is a DSYNT that linearizes as this sentence. last week at Zvornik&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Bosnian Serb leaders freed about one-third of the U.N. personnel&amp;quot; 2.
