    On the other hand, a very specific preference usually pinpoints the expected entity, i.e., the dead giveaway pairings of role and filler.
    Thus, it is quite common for these preferences to overspecify the underlying constraint; for example, cut may expect a tool as an INSTRUMENT, but almost any physical object will suffice.
    When a slight relaxation of the preference is satisfiable, a system should take the cautious route, and assume it has a case of overspecification and is at worst a weak failure.
    Again, the specificity function returns a negative value with magnitude equivalent to the specificity of the complement of the concept, but this time the result will be a negative number whose absolute value is less than it would be by default.
    When this approach fails, a system can safely assume that the entity under consideration is &amp;quot;obviously inappropriate&amp;quot; for a relatively strong expectation, and return the default value.
    The default value for a concept that is
