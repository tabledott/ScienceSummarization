aps package in R to find the best subset of features for linear regression, for subsets of size one to eight.
    We use the squared multiple correlation coefficient (R2) to assess the effectiveness of predictions.
    R2 is the proportion of variance in readability ratings explained by the model.
    If the model predicts readability perfectly, R2 = 1, and if the model has no predictive capability, R2 = 0.
    The linear regression results confirm the expectation that the combination of different factors is a rather complex issue.
    As expected, discourse, vocabulary and length which were the significant individual factors appear in the best model for each feature set size.
    Their combination gives the best result for regression with three predictors, and they explain half of the variance in readability ratings, R2 = 0.5029.
    But the other individually significant feature, average number of verb phrases per sentence (F3) never appears in the best models.
    Instead, F1&#8212;the depth of the parse t
