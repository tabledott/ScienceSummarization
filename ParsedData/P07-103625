    This labeling violates C1, the minimal hamming distance is 2, and our approximation gives 1, (since there is only one transition that violates the constraint.)
    For constraints which cannot be validated based on prefix information, our approximation resorts to binary violation count.
    For instance, the constraint C2 cannot be implemented with prefix information when the assignment is not complete.
    Otherwise, it would mean that the field TITLE should appear as early as possible in the assignment.
    While (Roth and Yih, 2005) showed the significance of using hard constraints, our experiments show that using soft constraints is a superior option.
    For example, in the advertisements domain, C1 holds for the large majority of the gold-labeled instances, but is sometimes violated.
    In supervised training with 100 labeled examples on this domain, sup gave 76.3% accuracy.
    When the constraint violation penalty p was infinity (equivalent to hard constraint), the accuracy improved to 78.7%, bu
