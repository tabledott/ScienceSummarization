    The instructions given to the RFA included several examples of themes with fusion sentences generated by the authors.
    Even though the RFA was not instructed to use phrases from input sentences, the sentences presented as examples reused many phrases from the input sentences.
    We believe that phrase reuse elucidates the connection between input sentences and a resulting fusion sentence.
    Two examples of themes, reference sentences, and system outputs are shown in Table 5.
    Examples from the test set.
    Each example contains a theme, a reference sentence generated by the RFA, and a sentence generated by the system.
    Subscripts in the system-generated sentence represent a theme sentence from which a word was extracted. additional filters.
    First, we excluded themes that contained identical or nearly identical sentences (with cosine similarity higher than 0.8).
    When processing such sentences, our algorithm reduces to sentence extraction, which does not allow us to evaluat
