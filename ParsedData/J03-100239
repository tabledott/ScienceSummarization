    We present in this section results of experiments involving the Verbmobil and Hansards tasks.
    The Verbmobil task (Wahlster 2000) is a (German-English) speech translation task in the domain of appointment scheduling, travel planning, and hotel reservation.
    The bilingual sentences used in training are correct transcriptions of spoken dialogues.
    However, they include spontaneous speech effects such as hesitations, false starts, and ungrammatical phrases.
    The French-English Hansards task consists of the debates in the Canadian parliament.
    This task has a very large vocabulary of about 100,000 French words and 80,000 English words.4 Statistics for the two corpora are shown in Tables 2 and 3.
    The number of running words and the vocabularies are based on full-form words and the punctuation marks.
    We produced smaller training corpora by randomly choosing 500, 2,000 and 8,000 sentences from the Verbmobil task and 500, 8,000, and 128,
