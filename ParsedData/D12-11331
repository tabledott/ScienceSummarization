erence (McDonald et al., 2005; McDonald and Pereira, 2006; Carreras, 2007; Koo and Collins, 2010; Bohnet, 2010), but other inference methods have been explored especially for non-projective parsing (Riedel and Clarke, 2006; Smith and Eisner, 2008; Martins et al., 2009; Martins et al., 2010; Koo et al., 2010).
    Transitionbased models parameterize the problem by elementary parsing actions and typically use incremental beam search (Titov and Henderson, 2007; Zhang and Clark, 2008; Zhang and Clark, 2011).
    Despite notable differences in model structure, graph-based and transition-based parsers both give state-of-theart accuracy with proper feature selection and optimization (Koo and Collins, 2010; Zhang and Nivre, 2011; Bohnet, 2011).
    It is noteworthy, however, that almost all dependency parsers presuppose that the words of an input sentence have been morphologically disambiguated using (at least) a part-of-speech tagger.
    This is in stark contrast to the best parsers based on PCFG models, such as th
