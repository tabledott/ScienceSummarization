			The labels-only matching was similar to previousshared tasks, but the dependency structure evaluation deserves further explanation: The XML seman tic dependency structure was produced by a program called fttosem, implemented in Perl, which goes sentence by sentence through a FrameNet full-text XML file, taking LU, FE, and other labels and using them to structure a syntactically unparsed piece of a sentence into a syntactic-semantic tree.
			Two basic principles allow us to produce this tree: (1) LUs are the sole syntactic head of a phrase whose semantics is expressed by thei
