 we omit the details, which the interested reader can check in (Langville and Meyer, 2003).
  
  
    In this section we present the application of PageRank to WSD.
    If we were to apply the traditional PageRank over the whole WordNet we would get a context-independent ranking of word senses, which is not what we want.
    Given an input piece of text (typically one sentence, or a small set of contiguous sentences), we want to disambiguate all open-class words in the input taken the rest as context.
    In this framework, we need to rank the senses of the target words according to the other words in the context.
    Theare two main alternatives to achieve this: The first method has been explored in the literature (cf.
    Section 5), and we also presented a variant in (Agirre and Soroa, 2008) but the second method is novel in WSD.
    In both cases, the algorithms return a list of ranked senses for each target word in the context.
    We will see each of them in turn, but first we will present some notation
