eralization task.
    The results show that generalizing across frames, even within a domain, is more difficult than generalizing across target words within a frame.
    There are several factors that may account for this: the FrameNet domains were intended primarily as a way of organizing the project, and their semantics have not been formalized.
    Thus, it may not be surprising that they do not correspond to significant generalizations about argument structure.
    The domains are fairly broad, as indicated by the fact that always choosing the most common role for a given domain (the baseline for cross-frame, within-domain generalization, given as P(r  |d) in Table 20, classifies 28.4% of frame elements correctly) does not do better than the cross-domain baseline of always choosing the most common role from the entire database regardless of domain (P(r) in Table 20, which yields 28.7% correct).
    This contrasts with a 40.9% baseline for P(r  |t), that is, always choosing the most common role for a parti
