			In (b), bi is not recognized as a swap by the word-based model.
			In (c), bi is recognized as a swap only by the hierarchical model.greater than zero only if one of the following con ditions is true: ? oi = M and ai ?ai?1 = 1 ? oi = S and ai ?ai?1 = ?1 ? oi = D and |ai ?ai?1| 6= 1At decoding time, rather than using the log probability of Eq.
