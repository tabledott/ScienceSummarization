 number of sentences per target word is only 34, and the number of sentences per frame is 732 &#8212; both relatively small amounts of data on which to train frame element classifiers.
    Although we expect our features to interact in various ways, the data are too sparse to calculate probabilities directly on the full set of features.
    For this reason, we built our classifier by combining probabilities from distributions conditioned on a variety of combinations of features.
    An important caveat in using the FrameNet database is that sentences are not chosen for annotation at random, and therefore are not necessarily statistically representative of the corpus as a whole.
    Rather, examples are chosen to illustrate typical usage patterns for each word.
    We intend to remedy this in future versions of this work by bootstrapping our statistics using unannotated text.
    Table 2 shows the probability distributions used in the final version of the system.
