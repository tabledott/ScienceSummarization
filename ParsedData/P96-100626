 No local collocation knowledge is used.
    A probabilistic classifier is used in (Bruce and Wiebe, 1994).
    That local collocation knowledge provides important clues to WSD is pointed out in (Yarowsky, 1993), although it was demonstrated only on performing binary (or very coarse) sense disambiguation.
    The work of (Yarowsky, 1994) is perhaps the most similar to our present work.
    However, his work used decision list to perform classification, in which only the single best disambiguating evidence that matched a target context is used.
    In contrast, we used exemplar-based learning, where the contributions of all features are summed up and taken into account in coming up with a classification.
    We also include verb-object syntactic relation as a feature, which is not used in (Yarowsky, 1994).
    Although the work of (Yarowsky, 1994) can be applied to WSD, the results reported in (Yarowsky, 1994) only dealt with accent restoration, which is a much simpler problem.
    It is unclear how Yarowsky's
