inear models, as with most probability estimation methods, require that there be a finite set of features on which the probability is conditioned.
    The standard way to handle this problem is to hand-craft a finite set of features which provides a sufficient summary of the history (Ratnaparkhi, 1999; Collins, 1999; Charniak, 2000).
    The probabilities are then assumed to be independent of all the information about the history which is not captured by the chosen features.
    The difficulty with this approach is that the choice of features can have a large impact on the performance of the system, but it is not feasible to search the space of possible feature sets by hand.
    In this work we use a method for automatically inducing a finite representation of the derivation history.
    The method is a form of multi-layered neural network called Simple Synchrony Networks (Lane and Henderson, 2001; Henderson, 2000).
    The output layer of this network is the log-linear model which computes the function , dis
