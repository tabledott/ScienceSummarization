		To evaluate the effectiveness of time information, we made the experiments based on mutual information (Definition 1) and temporal mutual information (Definition 2).
			The former called the incremental approach measures the mutual information at each time point based on all available temporal information at that time.
			The latter called the interval-based approach considers the temporal mutual information in different time stamps.
			Figures 3 and 4 show the comparisons between interval-based approach and incremental approach, respectively, in the event of Da Vinci Code.
			We find that ?Tom Hanks?
			has higher change of temporal mutual information compared to ?Da Vinci Code?.
			Compared to the incremental approach in Figure 4, the interval-based approach can reflect the exact release date of ?Da Vinci Code.?

			Evaluation of Event Detection We consider the events of May 2006 listed in wikipedia1 as gold standard.
			On the one hand, the events posted in wikipedia are not always complet
