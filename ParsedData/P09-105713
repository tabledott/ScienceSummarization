and taggings.
    We run EM for multiple passes, and in each pass we alternately constrain either the grammar model or the dictionary model.
    The procedure is simple and proceeds as follows: We notice significant gains in tagging performance when applying this technique.
    The tagging accuracy increases at each step and finally settles at a high of 91.6%, which outperforms the existing state-of-the-art systems for the 45-tag set.
    The system achieves a better accuracy than the 88.6% from Smith and Eisner (2005), and even surpasses the 91.4% achieved by Goldberg et al. (2008) without using any additional linguistic constraints or manual cleaning of the dictionary.
    Figure 5 shows the tagging performance achieved at each step.
    We found that it is the elimination of incorrect entries from the dictionary (and grammar) and not necessarily the initialization weights from previous EM training, that results in the tagging improvements.
