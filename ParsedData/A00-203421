n, were filtered using the log-likelihood ratio test.
    The semantic cues were obtained by manual analysis.
    The relative frequency of a SCF for a verb, compared to the total frequency of the verb, was used for filtering out erroneous scFs.
    Lapata does not report recall and precision figures against a gold standard.
    The emphasis is on the phenomena actually evident in the corpus data.
    Many of the verbs listed in Levin as taking the alternation were not observed with this alternation in the corpus data.
    This amounted to 44% of the verbs for the benefactive, and 52% for the dative.
    These figures only take into account the verbs for which at least one of the scFs were observed.
    54% of the verbs listed for the dative and benefactive by Levin were not acquired with either of the target scFs.
    Conversely, many verbs not listed in Levin were identified as taking the benefactive or dative alternation using Lapata's criteria.
    Manual analysis of these verbs revealed 18 false positive
