ngs (T in [1, 2,4,..., 48] and W in [1, 10, 20, ... , 490]) on each of the SE data sets.
    To find good parameter settings, the results for each data set were sorted into five-point precision intervals and then sorted by frequency within each interval.
    Information for the top three precision intervals for each data set are shown in Table 10, specifically, the parameter values (i.e., T and W) and the frequency and precision of the most frequent result in each interval.
    The intervals are in the rows labeled Range.
    For example, the top three precision intervals for WSJ-SE1-M, 0.87-0.92, 0.82-0.87, and 0.77-0.82 (no parameter values yield higher precision than 0.92).
    The top of Table 10 gives baseline frequencies and precisions, which are IPSEinstsl and prec(PSEinsts), respectively, in line 8 of Figure 3.
    The parameter values exhibit a range of frequencies and precisions, with the expected trade-off between precision and frequency.
    We choose the following parameters to test in Section 4.
