: The fixed number of clusters Nc Compute initial clustering while clustering changed in last iteration do forall w &#8712; V do forall c &#8712; C do move word w tentatively to cluster c compute updated optimization criterion move word w to cluster maximizing optimization criterion the number of occurrences of the word v followed by some word in class c. Then the following optimization criterion can be derived, with F(C) being the log likelihood function of the predictive class bigram model given a clustering C: the average case complexity can be reduced by updating only the counts which are actually affected by moving a word from one cluster to another.
    This can be done by considering only those sets of clusters for which N(w, c) &gt; 0 or N(c, w) &gt; 0 for a word w about to be exchanged, both of which can be calculated efficiently when exchanging a word.
    The algorithm scales linearly in the size of the vocabulary.
