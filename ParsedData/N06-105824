phrasing and we believe that this method can similarly benefit other approaches that use lexicosemantic resources to obtain paraphrases.
    Our ultimate goal is to develop a contextual filtering method that does not require candidate selection based on a lexico-semantic resource.
    One source of possible improvement lies in exploring more powerful learning frameworks and more sophisticated linguistic representations.
    Incorporating syntactic dependencies and class-based features into the context representation could also increase the accuracy and the coverage of the method.
    Our current method only implements rewriting at the word level.
    In the future, we would like to incorporate substitutions at the level of phrases and syntactic trees.
