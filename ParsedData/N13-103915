al 8Frequencies came from the Wall Street Journal and Brown corpus sections of the Penn Treebank.
    If a word has multiple PTB tags, each tag is a feature with value for the frequency rank; e.g. for three different tags in the PTB, this feature gives a value of 1 for the most frequent tag, 2/3 for the second, etc.
    Coarse versions of the PTB tags are used (Petrov et al., 2011).
    While 88% of words in the dictionary have only one tag, using rank information seemed to give a small but consistent gain over only using the most common tag, or using binary features conjoined with rank as in Gimpel et al. words (e.g. no:-d,yes should parse as four tokens), and internally may contain alphanumeric symbols that could be mistaken for words: a naive split(/[^azA-Z0-9]+/) tokenizer thinks the words &#8220;p&#8221; and &#8220;d&#8221; are among the top 100 most common words on Twitter, due to misanalysis of :p and :d. Traditional Penn Treebank&#8211;style tokenizers are hardly better, often breaking a string of pun
