r more private discussions that our methods were coming up with substantially different probability estimates for quite a number of words.
  It is not clear that the maximum likelihood methods are robust enough to produce estimates that can be reliably replicated in other laboratories.
  Contingency Tables Because of the memory and robustness questions, we decided to explore an alternative to the EM algorithm.
  Table 2 illustrates a two-by-two contingency table for the English word house and the French word chambre.
  Cell a (upper-left) counts the number of sentences (aligned regions) that contain both house and chambre.
  Cell b (upper-right) counts the number of regions that contain house but not chambre.
  Cells c and d fill out the pattern in the obvious way.
  The table can be computed from freq(house, chambre), freq(house) and freq(chambre), the number of aligned regions that contain one or both these words, and from N = 897,077, the total number of regions.
  a = freq(house, chambre) b = freq(house)
