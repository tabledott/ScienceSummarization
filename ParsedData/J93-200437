ection is shown in Figure 5.
  The fragments are now connected together into one rooted tree structure.
  The result is a skeletal analysis in that much syntactic detail is left unannotated.
  Most prominently, all internal structure of the NP up through the head and including any single-word post-head modifiers is left unannotated.
  As noted above in connection with POS tagging, a major goal of the Treebank project is to allow annotators only to indicate structure of which they were certain.
  The Treebank provides two notational devices to ensure this goal: the X constituent label and so-called "pseudo-attachment."
  The X constituent label is used if an annotator is sure that a sequence of words is a major constituent but is unsure of its syntactic category; in such cases, the annotator simply brackets the sequence and labels it X.
  The second notational device, pseudo-attachment, hastwo primary uses.
