 remaining three columns show precision, recall and f-measure, respectively.
    Table 4 gives the results for 3mf pronouns.
    The baseline model performs very well on this data set (the low recall figure is due to the fact that the 3mf data set contains only a small subset of the coreference links expected by the evaluation).
    The results are comparable to any pronoun resolution algorithm dealing with written text.
    This shows that our pronoun resolution system could be ported to the spoken dialogue domain without sacrificing performance.
    Table 5 shows the results for 3n pronouns.
    The baseline model does not perform very well.
    As mentioned above, for evaluating the performance of the baseline model we removed all potential non-NPantecedents from the data.
    This corresponds to a naive application of a model developed for written text to spoken dialogue.
    First, we applied the same model to the data set containing all kinds of antecedents.
    The performance drops somewhat as the cla
