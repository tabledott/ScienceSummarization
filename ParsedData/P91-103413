    The results in Figure 5 show that the algorithm has discovered this, and in so doing has reduced the entropy of the translation of cent by .378 bits. to a word, and thus can extract no more than one bit of information about the translation of that, word.
    Since the entropy of the translation of a. common word can be as high as five bits, there is reason to hope that using more senses will further improve the performance of our system.
    Our method asks a. single question about a single word of context.
    We can think of this as the first question in a decision tree which can be extended to additional levels [Lucassen, 1983, Lucassen and Mercer, 1984, Breiman et al., 1984, Bahl et a/., 1989].
    We are working on these and other improvements and hope to report better results in the future.
  
  
    Pleased with these results, we incorporated sense-assignment questions for the 500 most common English words and 200 most common French words into our translation system.
