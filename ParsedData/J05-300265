l mapping between tree nodes and is derived from a bilingual dictionary.
    The search procedure is greedy and is subject to a number of constraints needed for alignment of parallel sentences.
    This algorithm has several features in common with our method: It operates over syntactic dependency representations and employs recursive computation to find an optimal solution.
    However, our method is different in two key aspects.
    First, our algorithm looks for local regions with high similarity in nonparallel data, rather than for full alignment, expected in the case of parallel trees.
    The change in optimization criteria introduces differences in the similarity measure&#8212;specifically, the relaxation of certain constraints&#8212;and the search procedure, which in our work uses dynamic programming.
    Second, our method is an instance of a multisequence alignment,15 in contrast to the pairwise alignment described in Meyers, Yangarber, and Grishman (1996).
