aw and Marcus, 1995): WSJ sections 15-18 of the Penn Treebank as training material and section 20 as test materia13.
    The chunks in the data were selected to match the descriptions in the previous section.
    An overview of the chunk types in the training data can be found in table 1.
    De data sets contain tokens (words and punctuation marks), information about the location of sentence boundaries and information about chunk boundaries.
    Additionally, a partof-speech (POS) tag was assigned to each token by a standard POS tagger (Brill (1994) trained on the Penn Treebank).
    We used these POS tags rather than the Treebank ones in order to make sure that the performance rates obtained for this data are realistic estimates for data for which no treebank POS tags are available.
    In our example sentence in section 2, we have used brackets for encoding text chunks.
    In the data sets we have represented chunks with three types of tags: B-X first word of a chunk of type X I-X non-initial word in an X
