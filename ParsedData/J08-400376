ation, based on the Prague school tradition of dependency grammar, which not only allows multiple dependents of the root but also uses several different labels for these dependents, which means that they will be analyzed correctly only if a RIGHT-ARC transition is performed with the right label at exactly the right point in time.
    This is in contrast to annotation schemes that use a default label ROOT, for dependents of the root, where such dependents can often be correctly recovered in post-processing by attaching all remaining roots to the special root node with the default label.
    We can see the effect of this by comparing the two stack-based parsers (in their pseudoprojective versions) with respect to precision and recall for the dependency type PRED (predicate), which is the most important label for dependents of the root in the data sets for Arabic, Czech, and Slovene.
    While the arc-standard parser has 78.02% precision and 70.22% recall, averaged over the three languages, the corresponding fig
