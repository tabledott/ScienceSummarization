rallel corpus, and that its performance can be boosted by our Multilevel Bootstrapping method, whereas using parallel corpus for adaptation is not nearly as useful.
    In contrast, Figure 3 shows that when we apply Bootstrapping to the EM lexical learner, the bilingual lexicon extraction accuracy is improved by 20% on the average, evaluated on top-N translation candidates of the same source words, showing that our proposed method can boost a weak EM lexical learner even on data from very-non-parallel corpus.
    In addition, we compare and contrast a number of bilingual corpora, ranging from the parallel, to comparable, and to very-non-parallel corpora.
    The parallel-ness of each type of corpus is quantified by a lexical matching score calculated for the bi-lexicon pair distributed in the aligned bilingual sentence pairs.
    We show that this scores increases as the parallel-ness or comparability of the corpus increases.
    Finally, we would like to suggest that Bootstrapping can in the future be used i
