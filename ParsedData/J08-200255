candidate argument sequences in the top n complete assignments are rarely more than 7 nodes long).
    Additionally, the nodes in the candidate argument sequences are in general not in the same local tree in the syntactic analysis and a tree-CRF model (Cohn and Blunsom 2005) would not be able to encode these dependencies.
    Joint Syntactic&#8211;Semantic Features.
    This class of features is similar to the whole label sequence features, but in addition to labels of argument nodes, it includes syntactic features of the nodes.
    These features can capture the joint mapping from the syntactic realization of the predicate&#8217;s arguments to its semantic frame.
    The idea of these features is to capture knowledge about the label of a constituent given the syntactic realization and labels of all other arguments of the verb.
    This is helpful in capturing syntactic alternations, such as the dative alternation.
    For example, consider the sentence (i) [Shaw Publishing]ARG0 [offered]PRED [Mr. Smith]ARG2
