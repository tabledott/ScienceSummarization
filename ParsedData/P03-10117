een the two trees may require further relaxation of this constraint, and in practice we expect such divergences to be frequent.
    For example, a nominal modifier in one language may show up as an adverbial in the other, or, due to choices such as which information is represented by a main verb, the syntactic correspondence between the two In order to provide some flexibility, we modify the model in order to allow for a copy of a (translated) subtree from the English sentences to occur, with some cost, at any point in the resulting French sentence.
    For example, in the case of the input tree This operation, combined with the deletion of the original node Z, produces the alignment (XZY) that was disallowed by the original tree reordering model.
    Figure 1 shows an example from our Korean-English corpus where the clone operation allows the model to handle a case of wh-movement in the English sentence that could not be realized by any reordering of subtrees of the Korean parse.
