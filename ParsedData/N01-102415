    The N here represents the N-1 most-frequent words as well as a glob position to account for all other words not in the top N-1.
    The matrix is structured such that for a given word w&#8217;s row, the first N columns denote words that precede w by up to 50 words, and the second N &#65533; columns represent those words that follow by up to &#57735;NCS(&#181;,&#57736;) =f NCS exp[ ((x-&#181;)/&#57736;)2]dx 50 words.
    Since SVDs are more designed to work then, if there were nR items in the ruleset, the with normally-distributed data (Manning and probability that a NCS is non-random is Sch&#252;tze, 1999, p. 565), we fill each entry with a Pr(NCS)_ nT&#57735;NCS(&#181;T,&#57736;T) normalized count (or Z-score) rather than straight frequency.
    We then compute the SVD and keep the (nR-nT)&#57735;NCS(0,1) &#57735; nT&#57735;NCS(&#181;T,&#57736;T) . top 300 singular values to form semantic vectors for We define Pr (w &#8212;w )=Pr(NCS(w ,w )).
