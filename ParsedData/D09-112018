nts are variants of traditional appositives and predicatenominatives with some of the structure of the NPs specified.
    However there are some tree fragments which correspond to the novel coreference patterns (see Figure 5) of parenthetical alias as well as conjunctions of roles in NPs.
    We apply our extracted tree fragments to our BLIPP and WIKI data sets and extract a set of compatible word pairs which match these fragments; these words pairs will be used to relax the semantic compatibility filter (see the start of the section); mentions are compatible with prior mentions with the same head or with a semantically compatible head word.
    This yields 58.5 pairwise F1 (see SEMCOMPAT in Table 2) as well as similar improvements across other metrics.
    By and large the word pairs extracted in this way are correct (in particular we now have coverage for over two-thirds of the head pair recall errors from Table 1.)
    There are however wordpairs which introduce errors.
