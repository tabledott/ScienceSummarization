n K(9i, 9j) is defined as folKc is the kernel function over Ri and Rj&#8217;s children.
    Denote a is a continuous subsequence of indices a, a + 1, &#183; &#183; &#183; a + l (a) for Ri&#8217;s children where l(a) is its length, as is the s-th element in a.
    And likewise b for Rj. where the constant 0 &lt; A &lt; 1 normalizes the effects of children subsequences&#8217; length.
    Compared with the definitions in (Culotta and Sorensen, 2004), we add term Kin to handle the internal nodes of a pharse, and make this extension still satisfy the kernel function requirements (composition of kernels is still a kernel (Joachims et al., 2001)).
    The consideration is that the local words should have limited effects on whole tree structures.
    So the kernel is defined on external children (Kc) and internal nodes (Kin) separately, annotator extracted 3595 relations, while the other annotator A2 extracted 3745 relations, an A1 d 3217 cases of them matched.
    In order to measure the annotation quality, we use t
