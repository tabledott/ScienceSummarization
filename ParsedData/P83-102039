e type can be dominated by the same node if they are in a coordinate structure (given the analysis of coordinate structures we assume) and if they are string adjacent.
    NI, n2 and n3 are string adjacent (given only (12)), so the fact that the nodes named npl, np2 and np3 dominate nouns which may turn out to be different does not make the descriptions of the NPs incompatible.
    (Indeed, if the nouns are viewed as a coordinate structure, then the structure of the nouns is the same as that of (11.1).)
    Furthermore, adjl is immediately to the left of and pp 1 is immediately to the right of all the nouns, so these constituents could be dominated by the same single NP that might dominate nl, n2 and n3 as well.
    Thus there is no information here that can distinguish npl from np2 from np3.
    The fact that the conjunction &amp;quot;and&amp;quot; is dominated by np3 does not block the above analysis.
    The addition of one domination predicate leaves it dominated by n3 (as well as np3, of course), thereby
