arbitrary features such as language model (LM) scores.
    The LM scores should increase the total log-posterior of more grammatical hypotheses.
    Powell&#8217;s method (Brent, 1973) is used to tune the system and feature weights simultaneously so as to optimize various automatic evaluation metrics on a development set.
    Tuning is fully automatic, as opposed to (Matusov et al., 2006) where global system weights were set manually.
    This paper is organized as follows.
    Three evaluation metrics used in weights tuning and reporting the test set results are reviewed in Section 2.
    Section 3 describes confusion network decoding for MT system combination.
    The extensions to add features log-linearly and improve the skeleton selection are presented in Sections 4 and 5, respectively.
    Section 6 details the weights optimization algorithm and the experimental results are reported in Section 7.
    Conclusions and future work are discussed in Section 8.
