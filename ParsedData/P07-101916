 search errors.
    However, the hope is that by choosing the right value of i, these estimates will be accurate enough to affect the search quality only slightly, which is analogous to &#8220;almost admissible&#8221; heuristics in A* search (Soricut, 2006).
  
  
    We test our methods on two large-scale English-toChinese translation systems: a phrase-based system and our tree-to-string system (Huang et al., 2006).
    We implemented Cubit, a Python clone of the Pharaoh decoder (Koehn, 2004),3 and adapted cube pruning to it as follows.
    As in Pharaoh, each bin i contains hypotheses (i.e., +LM items) covering i words on the source-side.
    But at each bin (see Figure 5), all +LM items from previous bins are first partitioned into &#8722;LM items; then the hyperedges leading from those &#8722;LM items are further grouped into hyperedge bundles (Figure 6), which are placed into the priority queue of the current bin.
    Our data preparation follows Huang et al. (2006): the training data is a parallel corpu
