 These methods make use of information about the relative positions of the sentences in the text (Kupiec, Pedersen, and Chen 1995; Chen and Withgott 1992).
    However, these methods do not use subtopic structure to guide their choices, focusing more on the beginning and ending of the document and on position within paragraphs.
    Paice (1990) recognizes the need for taking topical structure into account but does not suggest a method for determining such structure.
