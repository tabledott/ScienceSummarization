			In contrast, we begin with a lexicon of words with established prior polarities, and identify the contextual polarity of phrases inwhich instances of those words appear in the cor pus.
			To make the relationship between that task and ours clearer, note that some word lists used to evaluate methods for recognizing prior polarity areincluded in our prior-polarity lexicon (General Inquirer lists (General-Inquirer, 2000) used for evaluation by Turney, and lists of manually identified pos itive and negative adjectives, used for evaluation by Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown).Some research classifies the sentiments of sen tences.
			Yu and Hatzivassiloglou (2003), Kim and Hovy (2004), Hu and Liu (2004), and Grefenstette et al.
			(2001)4 all begin by first creating prior-polaritylexicons.
			Yu and Hatzivassiloglou then assign a sen timent to a sentence by averaging the prior semanticorientations of instances of lexicon words in the sentence.
			Thus, they do not
