			The first row shows the performanceof the individual CRF-OP, CRF-SRC, and CRF LINK classifiers before the ILP phase.
			Without the ILP phase, the 1-best sequence generates the best scores.
			However, we also present the performance with merged 10-best entity sequences19 in orderto demonstrate that using 10-best sequences with out ILP will only hurt performance.
			The precision of the merged 10-best sequences system is very low, however the recall level is above 95% for both 18Statistically significant by paired-t test, where p &lt; 0.001.19If an entity Ei extracted by the ith-best sequence over laps with an entity Ej extracted by the jth-best sequence,where i &lt; j, then we discard Ej . If Ei and Ej do not over lap, then we extract both entities.

			The third row presentsresults after the ILP phase is applied for the 10 best sequences, and we see that, in addition to the improved link
