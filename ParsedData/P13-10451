    Syntactic parsing is a central task in natural language processing because of its importance in mediating between linguistic expression and meaning.
    For example, much work has shown the usefulness of syntactic representations for subsequent tasks such as relation extraction, semantic role labeling (Gildea and Palmer, 2002) and paraphrase detection (Callison-Burch, 2008).
    Syntactic descriptions standardly use coarse discrete categories such as NP for noun phrases or PP for prepositional phrases.
    However, recent work has shown that parsing results can be greatly improved by defining more fine-grained syntactic gory,vector) representations at each node.
    The vectors for nonterminals are computed via a new type of recursive neural network which is conditioned on syntactic categories from a PCFG. categories, which better capture phrases with similar behavior, whether through manual feature engineering (Klein and Manning, 2003a) or automatic learning (Petrov et al., 2006).
