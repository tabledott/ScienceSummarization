 order 9.
    Now, for each pair of summaries (sum1, sum2), we can say whether they are roughly the same when evaluated against a pyramid of order n and we will denote this as |sum1 |==n |sum2|, (scores differ by less than 0.06 for some pyramid of order n) or different (scores differ by more than 0.06 for all pyramids of order n) and we will use the notation |sum1 |&lt;n |sum2 |if the score for sum2 is higher.
    When pyramids of lower order are used, the following errors can happen, with the associated probabilities: E1: |sum1 |==9 |sum2 |but |sum1 |&lt;n |sum2 |or |sum1 |&gt;n |sum2 |at some lower order n pyramid.
    The conditional probability of this type of error is E2: |sum1 |&lt;9 |sum2 |but at a lower order |sum1 |==n |sum2|.
    This error corresponds to &#8221;losing ability to discern&#8221;, which means one can tolerate it, as long as the goal is not be able to make fine grained distinctions between the summaries.
    Here, |sum2||sum1 |&gt;n |sum2|).
    This is the most severe kind of mistake
