			2.1 Probabilistic context-free grammars.
			Let G = (T,N, S,R) be a Context-Free Grammarin Chomsky normal form with no useless produc tions, where T is a finite set of terminal symbols, N is a finite set of nonterminal symbols (disjoint from T ), S ? N is a distinguished nonterminal called the start symbol, and R is a finite set of productions of the form A ? BC or A ? w, where A,B,C ? N and w ? T . In what follows we use ? as a variable ranging over (N ?N) ? T . A Probabilistic Context-Free Grammar (G, ?) is a pair consisting of a context-free grammar G anda real-valued vector ? of length |R| indexed by pro ductions, where ?A??
			is the production probability associated with the production A ? ?
			R. We require that ?A??
			0 and that for all nonterminals A ? N , ?A???R ?A??
			= 1.
			A PCFG (G, ?) defines a probability distribution over trees t as follows: PG(t|?)
			= ? r?R ?fr(t)r wher
