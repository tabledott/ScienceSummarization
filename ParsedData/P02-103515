 treebank.
    As a first step, all sections were parsed, and the packed parse forests unpacked and stored.
    For discriminative estimation, this data set was restricted to sentences which receive a full parse (in contrast to a FRAGMENT or SKIMMED parse) for both its partially labeled and its unlabeled variant.
    Furthermore, only sentences 2An alternative numerical method would be a combination of iterative scaling techniques with a conditional EM algorithm (Jebara and Pentland, 1998).
    However, it has been shown experimentally that conjugate gradient techniques can outperform iterative scaling techniques by far in running time (Minka, 2001). which received at most 1,000 parses were used.
    From this set, sentences of which a discriminative learner cannot possibly take advantage, i.e. sentences where the set of parses assigned to the partially labeled string was not a proper subset of the parses assigned the unlabeled string, were removed.
    These successive selection steps resulted in a final tra
