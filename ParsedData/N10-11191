    Polarity lexicons are large lists of phrases that encode the polarity of each phrase within it &#8211; either positive or negative &#8211; often with some score representing the magnitude of the polarity (Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown, 1997; Wiebe, 2000; Turney, 2002).
    Though classifiers built with machine learning algorithms have become commonplace in the sentiment analysis literature, e.g., Pang et al. (2002), the core of many academic and commercial sentiment analysis systems remains the polarity lexicon, which can be constructed manually (Das and Chen, 2007), through heuristics (Kim and Hovy, 2004; Esuli and Sabastiani, 2009) or using machine learning (Turney, 2002; Rao and Ravichandran, 2009).
    Often lexicons are combined with machine learning for improved results (Wilson et al., 2005).
    The pervasiveness and sustained use of lexicons can be ascribed to a number of reasons, including their interpretability in
