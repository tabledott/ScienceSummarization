 them.
    For example, we want to characterize the treatment-for-disease relationship between the words of migraine treatment versus the method-of-treatment relationship between the words of aerosol treatment.
    These relations are intended to be combined to produce larger propositions that can then be used in a variety of interpretation paradigms, such as abductive reasoning (Hobbs et al., 1993) or inductive logic programming (Ng and Zelle, 1997).
    Note that because we are concerned with the semantic relations that hold between the concepts, as opposed to the more standard, syntax-driven computational goal of determining left versus right association, this has the fortuitous effect of changing the problem into one of classification, amenable to standard machine learning classification techniques.
    We have found that we can use such algorithms to classify relationships between two-word noun compounds with a surprising degree of accuracy.
