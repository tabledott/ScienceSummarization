second or third.
    Position: This feature simply indicates whether the constituent to be labeled occurs before or after the predicate defining the semantic frame.
    We expected this feature to be highly correlated with grammatical function, since subjects will generally appear before a verb, and objects after.
    Moreover, this feature may overcome the shortcomings of reading grammatical function from a constituent's ancestors in the parse tree, as well as errors in the parser output.
    Voice: The distinction between active and passive verbs plays an important role in the connection between semantic role and grammatical function, since direct objects of active verbs correspond to subjects of passive verbs.
    From the parser output, verbs were classified as active or passive by building a set of 10 passiveidentifying patterns.
    Each of the patterns requires both a passive auxiliary (some form of &amp;quot;to be&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;to get&amp;quot;) and a past participle.
