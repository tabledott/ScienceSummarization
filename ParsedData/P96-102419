that can be used to improve performance.
    In particular, the Labelled Recall Algorithm can improve performance versus the Labelled Tree Algorithm on the Consistent Brackets, Labelled Recall, and Bracketed Recall criteria.
    Similarly, the Bracketed Recall Algorithm improves performance (versus Labelled Tree) on Consistent Brackets and Bracketed Recall criteria.
    Thus, these algorithms improve performance not only on the measures that they were designed for, but also on related criteria.
    Furthermore, in some cases these techniques can make parsing fast when it was previously impractical.
    We have used the technique outlined in this paper in other work (Goodman, 1996) to efficiently parse the DOP model; in that model, the only previously known algorithm which summed over all the possible derivations was a slow Monte Carlo algorithm (Bod, 1993).
    However, by maximizing the Labelled Recall criterion, rather than the Labelled Tree criterion, it was possible to use a much simpler algorithm, a vari
