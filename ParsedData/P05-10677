vation process for the two syntactic structures of both languages suggests the level of cross-lingual isomorphism between the two trees (e.g.
    Synchronous Tree Adjoining Grammars (Shieber and Schabes, 1990)).
    Apart from other details, a DIG can be viewed as a tree substitution grammar defined on dependency trees (as opposed to phrasal structure trees).
    The basic units of the grammar are elementary trees (ET), which are sub-sentential dependency structures containing one or more lexical items.
    The synchronous version, SDIG, assumes that the isomorphism of the two syntactic structures is at the ET level, rather than at the word level, hence allowing non-isomorphic tree to tree mapping.
    We illustrate how the SDIG works using the following pseudo-translation example: Almost any tree-transduction operations defined on a single node will fail to generate the target sentence from the source sentence without using insertion/deletion operations.
    However, if we view each dependency tree as an ass
