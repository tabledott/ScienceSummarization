    During the course of this bakeoff, a number of inconsistencies in segmentation were noted in the CTB corpus by one of the participants.
    This was done early enough so that it was possible for the CTB developers to correct some of the more common cases, both in the training and the test data.
    The revised training data was posted for participants, and the revised test data was used during the testing phase.
    Inconsistencies were also noted by another participant for the AS corpus.
    Unfortunately this came too late in the process to correct the data.
    However, some informal tests on the revised testing data indicated that the differences were minor.
    The contest followed a strict set of guidelines and a rigid timetable.
