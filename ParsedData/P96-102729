 c are (variables representing) the first, or distinguished indices associated with B and C. By analogy with parsing charts, an inactive edge labeled B(b ...) can be thought of as incident from vertex b, which means simply that it is efficiently accessible through the index b.
    An active edge A(...)IC(c ...) should be thought of as incident from, or accessible through, the index c. The key property of this scheme is that active and inactive edges interact by virtue of indices that they share and, by letting vertices correspond to indices, we collect together sets of edges that could interact.
    We illustrate the modified procedure with the sentence The procedure will be reminiscent of left-corner parsing.
    Arguments have been made in favor of a head-driven strategy which would, however, have been marginally more complex (e.g. in Kay (1989), Shieber, et el.
    (1989)) and the differences are, in any case, not germane to our current concerns.
    The initial agenda, including active edges, and collecti
