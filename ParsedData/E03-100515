    Most DOP models, such as in Bod (1993), Goodman (1996), Bonnema et al. (1997), Sima'an (2000) and Collins &amp; Duffy (2002), use a likelihood criterion in defining the best parse tree: they take (some notion of) the most likely (i.e. most probable) tree as a candidate for the best tree of a sentence.
    We will refer to these models as Likelihood-DOP models, but in this paper we will specifically mean by &amp;quot;Likelihood-DOP&amp;quot; the PCFG-reduction of Bod (2001) given in Section 2.2.
    In Bod (2000b), an alternative notion for the best parse tree was proposed based on a simplicity criterion: instead of producing the most probable tree, this model produced the tree generated by the shortest derivation with the fewest training subtrees.
    We will refer to this model as Simplicity-DOP.
    In case the shortest derivation is not unique, Bod (2000b) proposes to back off to a frequency ordering of the subtrees.
    That is, all subtrees of each root label a
