 for example, will be analyzed as the sum of its senses, or in flow graph terminology (Oppenheim and Schafer 1975) as a parallel connection of its senses.
    Structural ambiguity, on the other hand, will be analyzed as the product of its components, or in flow graph terminology as a series connection.
  
  
    This section will make the linear systems analogy more precise by relating context-free grammars to formal power series (polynominals).
    Formal power series are a well-known device in the formal language literature (e.g., Salomaa 1973) for developing the algebraic properties of context-free grammars.
    We introduce them here to establish a formal basis for our upcoming discussion of processing issues.
    The power series for grammar (5a) is (5b).
    Each term consists of a sentence generated by the grammar and an ambiguity coefficient3 which counts how many ways the sentence can be generated.
    For example, the sentence &amp;quot;John&amp;quot; has one parse tree and so on.
