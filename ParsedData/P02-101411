g framework modifications are shown in Table 2 (third block of results).
    When used in combination, the modifications consistently provide statistically significant gains in precision over the Baseline system 5This new method of training set creation slightly alters the class value distribution in the training data: for the MUC-6 corpus, there are now 27654 training instances of which 5.2% are positive; for the MUC-7 corpus, there are now 37870 training instances of which 4.2% are positive. without any loss in recall.6 As a result, we observe reasonable increases in F-measure for both classifiers and both data sets.
    When using RIPPER, for example, performance increases from 64.3 to 67.2 for the MUC-6 data set and from 60.8 to 63.2 for MUC-7.
    Similar, but weaker, effects occur when applying each of the learning framework modifications to the Baseline system in isolation.

    Our results provide direct evidence for the claim (Mitkov, 1997)
