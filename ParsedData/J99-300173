ring tricky retuning when new evidence is added (Rich and LuperFoy 1988).
    On the other hand, many of these systems work in a real-world environment (Rich and LuperFoy 1988; Lappin and Leass 1994; Kennedy and Boguraev 1996) in which noisy data and incomplete, sometimes even faulty, analysis results have to be accounted for.
    The centering model differs from these considerations in that it aims at unfolding a unified theory of discourse coherence at the linguistic, attentional, and intentional level (Grosz and Sidner 1986); hence, the search for a more principled, theory-based solution, but also the need for (almost) perfect linguistic analyses in terms of parsing and semantic interpretation.
  
  
    In this paper, we provided a novel account for ordering the forward-looking center list, a major construct of the centering model.
    The new formulation is entirely based on functional notions, grounded in the information structure of utterances in a discourse.
    We motivated our proposal by the constr
