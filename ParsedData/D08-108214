ntiguous NL substring, where the MR substructure rooted by MR production mv will correspond to (i.e., hierarchically generate) the NL substring wv.
    The symbol h is used to denote a hybrid sequence, and the function Parent(h) gives the unique MR substructure-NL subsequence pair which can be decomposed as h. Parent(nv) returns the set of all possible hybrid sequences under which the pair nv can be generated.
    Similarly, Children(h) gives the NL-MR pairs that appear directly below the hybrid sequence h in a hybrid tree, and Children(n) returns the set of all possible hybrid sequences that n can be decomposed as.
    Figure 4 gives a packed tree structure representing the relations between the entities.
    The formulas for computing inside and outside probabilities as well as the equations for updating parameters are given in Figure 5.
    We use a CKYstyle parse chart for tracking the probabilities.
    It is reasonable to believe that different MR productions that share identical function symbols are li
