ng readings with one another.
    The method proposed here takes advantage of these facts in order to disambiguate dictionary entries.
    Figure 2 sketches the procedure for the disambiguation of a conventional dictionary D. In addition to D, a bilingual corpus C1 of the same language pair is required to train the probability model for tag sequence translations.
    The word forms in C1 need not match those in D. C1 is not necessarily the training corpus for the translation task in which the disambiguated version of D will be used.
    It does not even have to be taken from the same domain.
    A word alignment between the sentences in C1 is trained with some automatic alignment algorithm.
    Then the words in the bilingual corpus are replaced by a reduced form of their lemma-tag representation, in which only a subset of their morpho-syntactic tags is retained&#8212;even the base form is dropped.
    The remaining subset of tags, in the following denoted by Tf for the source language and Te for the target l
