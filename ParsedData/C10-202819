r feature selection and con struction of labeled vectors and the remaining part is used as a test set.
			The process was repeated tentimes.
			To avoid utilization of labels as strong fea tures in the test set, we removed all instances of involved label hashtags/smileys from the tweets used as the test set.

			The table shows averaged harmonic f-score for 10 fold cross validation.
			51 (16) sentiment classes were used for hashtags (smileys).
			Multi-class classification.
			Under multi-class classification we attempt to assign a single label (51 labels in case of hashtags and 16 labels in case of smileys) to each of vectors in the test set.
			Note that the random baseline for this task is 0.02 (0.06)for hashtags (smileys).
			Table 2 shows the perfor mance of our framework for these tasks.
