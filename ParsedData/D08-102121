ect grammar is the percent of time that it was given a 4 or 5, using the scales from Table 5. than the baseline.
    They retain the correct meaning more often (ranging from 4% to up to 15%).
    They are judged to be grammatical far more frequently (up to 26% more often without the language model, and 24% with the language model) .
    They perform nearly 20% better when both meaning and grammaticality are used as criteria.3 Another trend that can be observed is that incorporating a language model probability tends to result in more grammatical output (a 7&#8211;9% increase), but meaning suffers as a result in some cases.
    When the LM is applied there is a drop of 12% in correct meaning for the baseline, but only a slight dip of 12% for the syntactically-constrained phrases.
    Note that for the conditions where the paraphrases were required to have the same syntactic type as the phrase in the parse tree, there was a reduction in the number of paraphrases that could be applied.
