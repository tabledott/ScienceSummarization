 the bracketed string c by Given a string w = w1 &#8226; &#8226;WIWI, a span of w is a pair of integers (i, j) with 0 &lt; i &lt; j &lt; lw I, which delimits a substring iwi = wi+i &#8226; &#8226; wj of w. The abbreviation iw will stand for iw1&#8222;1.
    A bracketing B of a string w is a finite set of spans on w (that is, a finite set of pairs or integers (i, j) with 0 &lt; i &lt; j &lt; lwl) satisfying a consistency condition that ensures that each span (i, j) can be seen as delimiting a string iwi consisting of a sequence of one of more.
    The consistency condition is simply that no two spans in a bracketing may overlap, where two spans (i, j) and (k, 1) overlap if eitheri&lt;k&lt;j&lt;lork&lt;i&lt;1&lt;j.
    Two bracketings of the same string are said to be compatible if their union is consistent.
    A span s is valid for a bracketing B if {s} is compatible with B.
    Note that there is no requirement that a bracketing of w describe fully a constituent structure of w. In fact, some or all sentences
