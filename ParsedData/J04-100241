e nodes supporting structure and theory, among whose common descendants are (for example) framework, foundation, and base.
    Peters and Peters&#8217; system found many metaphoric relationships between node pairs that were descendants of the unique beginners artifact and cognition.
    Goatly (1997) describes a set of linguistic cues of metaphoricality beyond selectional-preference violations, such as metaphorically speaking and, surprisingly, literally.
    These cues are generally ambiguous (except for metaphorically speaking) but could usefully be incorporated into computational approaches to metaphor.
  
  
    CorMet embodies a method for semiautomatically finding metaphoric mappings between concepts, which can then be used to infer conventionally metaphoric relationships between domains.
    It can sometimes identify metaphoric language, if it manifests as a common selectional-preference gradient between domains, but is far from being able to recognize metaphoric language in general.
