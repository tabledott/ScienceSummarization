  file vs. sense.
  WordNct groups noun senses in 24 lexicographers files.
  The algorithm assigns a noun both an specific sense and a file label.
  Both file matches and sense matches are interesting to count.
  Whilc the sense level gives a fine graded measure of the algorithm, the file level gives an indication of the perlormance if we were interested in a less sharp level of disambiguation.
  The granularity of the sense distinctions made in [Hearst, 91], [Yarowsky 92] and [Gale t al.
  93] also called homographs in [Guthrie t al.
  931], can be compared to that of the file level in WordNct.
  For instance, in [Yarowsky 92] two homographs of tile noun }liNg are  considered, one characterised as MUSIC and the other as ANIMAL, INSECT.
  In WordNet, the 6 senses of I~t~s related to music appear in the following files: ARTIFACT, ATTRIBUTE, COMMUNICATION and PERSON.
