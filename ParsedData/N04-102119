    Second, it inserts an optional word at each node.
    Third, it translates the leaf English words into Chinese words.
    These operations are stochastic and their probabilities are assumed to depend only on the node, and are independent of other operations on the node, or other nodes.
    The probability of each operation is automatically obtained by a training algorithm, using about 780,000 English parse tree-Chinese sentence pairs.
    The probability of these operations &#952;(ek,) is assumed to depend on the edge of the tree being modified, eke, but independent of everything else, giving the following equation, where O varies over the possible alignments between the f and e and &#952;(ekj) is the particular operations (in O) for the edge eke.
    The model is further extended to incorporate phrasal translations performed at each node of the input parse tree (Yamada and Knight, 2002).
    An English phrase covered by a node can be directly translated into a Ch
