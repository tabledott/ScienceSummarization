sion(Ci, Lj) = |Ci ? Lj | |Ci|Inverse Purity focuses on the cluster with maximum recall for each category, rewarding the clus tering solutions that gathers more elements of each category in a corresponding single cluster.
			Inverse Purity is defined as: 67 Inverse Purity = ? i |Li| n max Precision(Li, Cj)For the final ranking of systems we used the har monic mean of purity and inverse purity F?=0,5 . The F measure is defined as follows: F = 1 ? 1Purity + (1?
			?) 1 Inverse PurityF?=0,2 is included as an additional measure giv ing more importance to the inverse purity aspect.
			The rationale is that, for a search engine user, it should be easier to discard a few incorrect web pages in a cluster containing all the informationneeded, than having to collect the relevant infor mation across many different clusters.
			Therefore, achieving a high inverse purity should be rewarded more than having high purity.

			Two simple baseline approaches were applied to the test data.
