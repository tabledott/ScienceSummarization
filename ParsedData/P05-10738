 will talk about maximizing the sum of the logs of local probabilities rather than the product of local probabilities, which is equivalent.
    The dynamic program works from the leaves of the tree up and finds a best assignment for each tree, using already computed assignments for its children.
    Suppose we want the most likely consistent assignment for subtree t with children trees t1, ... , tk each storing the most likely consistent assignment of nodes it dominates as well as the log-probability of the assignment of all nodes it dominates to NONE.
    The most likely assignment for t is the one that corresponds to the maximum of: Propagating this procedure from the leaves to the root of t, we have our most likely non-overlapping assignment.
    By slightly modifying this procedure, we obtain the most likely assignment according to and classification models can be chained in a principled way, as in Equation 1.
    The features we used for local identification and classification models are outlined in Tabl
