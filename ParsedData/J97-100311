retrieval results be improved if the query is compared against only a passage or subpart of the text, as opposed to the text as a whole?
    And if so, what size unit should be used?
    In this context, &amp;quot;passage&amp;quot; refers to any segment of text isolated from the full text.
    This includes author-determined segments, marked orthographically (paragraphs, sections, and chapters) (Hearst and Plaunt 1993; Salton, Allan, and Buckley 1993; Moffat et al. 1994) and/or automatically derived units of text, including fixed-length blocks (Hearst and Flaunt 1993; Callan 1994), segments motivated by subtopic structure (TextTiles) (Hearst and Plaunt 1993), or segments motivated by properties of the query (Mittendorf and Schaible 1994).
    Hearst and Plaunt (1993), in some early passage-based retrieval experiments, report improved results using passages over full-text documents, but do not find a significant difference between using motivated subtopic segments and arbitrarily chosen block lengths that appr
