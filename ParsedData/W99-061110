o NPs not be coreferent if they are incompatible w.r.t. that term's feature.
    As will be explained below, however, two such NPs can be merged into the same equivalence class by the clustering algorithm if there is enough other evidence that they are similar (i.e. there are other, coreferent noun phrase(s) sufficiently close to both).
    All other terms obtain weights selected using the development corpus.
    Although additional testing is required, our current results indicate that these weights are sensitive to the distance metric, but probably not to the corpus.
    When computing a sum that involves both oo and &#8212;oo, we choose, the more conservative route, and the oo distance takes precedence (i.e. the two noun phrases are not Considered coreferent).
    An example of where this might occur is in the following sentence: [i Reardon Steel Co.] manufactures several thousand tons of [2 steel] each week.
    Here, NPi subsumes NP2, giving them a distance of &#8212;oo via the word substring term; howev
