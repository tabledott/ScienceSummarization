est selecting pivots based not only on their common frequency but also according to their mutual information with the source labels.
    For data as diverse as product reviews, SCL can sometimes misalign features, resulting in degradation when we adapt between domains.
    In our second extension we show how to correct misalignments using a very small number of labeled instances.
    Second, we evaluate the A-distance (Ben-David et al., 2006) between domains as measure of the loss due to adaptation from one to the other.
    The Adistance can be measured from unlabeled data, and it was designed to take into account only divergences which affect classification accuracy.
    We show that it correlates well with adaptation loss, indicating that we can use the A-distance to select a subset of domains to label as sources.
    In the next section we briefly review SCL and introduce our new pivot selection method.
    Section 3 describes datasets and experimental method.
    Section 4 gives results for SCL and the m
