sed by these structures for the centering model is how to decompose a complex sentence into center-updating units and how to process complex utterances consisting of multiple clauses.
    A first proposal is due to Kameyama (1998) who breaks a complex sentence into a hierarchy of center-updating units.
    Furthermore, she distinguishes several types of constructions in order to decide which part of the sentence is relevant for the resolution of an intersentential anaphor in the following sentence.
    Strube (1996b) (with respect to centering) and Suri and McCoy (1994) (with respect to the focus model) describe similar approaches and provide algorithms for the interaction of the resolution of inter- and intrasentential anaphora, but the topic has certainly not been dealt with exhaustively.
    The problem of complex NPs was pointed out by Walker and Prince (1996).
    Since the grammatical functions in a sentence may be realized by a complex NP, it is not clear how to rank these phrases in the Cf list.
