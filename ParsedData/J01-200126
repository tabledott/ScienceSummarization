o that employed in the present paper, referring to the structured set of four suffixes that appear in the two windows (in the case above, the suffixes are -ion, -ed; NULL, -tic).
    He notes that incorrect signatures arise in a large number of cases (e.g., good: optical control &#8212; optimal control; adoptive transfer &#8212; adoptively tranfer, paralleled by bad: ear disease early disease), and suggests a quality function along the following lines: Stems are linked in pairs (adopt-transfer, ear-disease); compute then the average length of the shorter stem in each pair (that is, create a set of the shorter member of each pair, and find the average length of that set).
    The quality function is defined as that average divided by the length of the largest suffix in the signature; reject any signature class for which that ratio is less than 1.0.
    This formula, and the threshold, is purely empirical, in the sense that there is no larger perspective that bears on determining the appropriateness of the form
