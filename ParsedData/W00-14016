    The XTAG grammar analyzes these as being headed by the noun,rather-than,by.the copula, and we follow the XTAG analysis.
    However, it would of course also be possible to use a grammar that allows for the copula-headed analysis.
    2In the system that we used in the experiments described in Section 3. all words (including function words) need to be present in the input representation, fully inflected.
    Furthermore, there is no indication of syntactic role at all.
    This is of course unrealistic for applications &#8226; see Section 5 for further remarks.
    3This wa.s constructed from the Penn 'Free I3ank using some heuristics. since the Penn Tree Bank does not contain full head-dependent information; as a result of the use of heuristics, the Tree Model is not fully correct. estimate there was no cost for phase /\ the second model (n-gram).
    The lattice output from the Unraveler encodes all possible word sequences permitted by the supertagged dependency structure.
    We rank these word sequenc
