the data.
    A new data set was created by taking every fifth pair of the original 1.3 million pairs.
    A test set of 3,000 triples was created from this new data set, as before, but this time only verbs that occurred between 100 and 1,000 times were considered.
    The results using these test and training data are given in Table 6.
    These results show a variation in performance across values for &#945;, with an optimal performance when &#945; is around 0.75.
    (Of course, in practice, the value for &#945; would need to be optimized on a held-out set.)
    But even with this variation, similarity class is still outperforming MDL and Assoc across the whole range of &#945; values.
    Note that the &#945; values corresponding to the lowest scores lead to a significant amount of generalization, which provides additional evidence that MDL and Assoc are overgeneralizing for this task.
    The low-class method scores highly for this data set also, but given that the task is one that apparently favors a low
