amp;quot; parse tree) and attempts to find algorithms that, given unlabelled text from the treebank, produce as similar a parse as possible to the one in the treebank.
    Various methods can be used for finding these parses.
    Some of the most common involve inducing Probabilistic Context-Free Grammars (PCFGs), and then parsing with an algorithm such as the Labelled Tree (Viterbi) Algorithm, which maximizes the probability that the output of the parser (the &amp;quot;guessed&amp;quot; tree) is the one that the PCFG produced.
    This implicitly assumes that the induced PCFG does a good job modeling the corpus.
    There are many different ways to evaluate these parses.
    The most common include the Labelled Tree Rate (also called the Viterbi Criterion or Exact Match Rate), Consistent Brackets Recall Rate (also called the Crossing Brackets Rate), Consistent Brackets Tree Rate (also called the Zero Crossing Brackets Rate), and Precision and Recall.
    Despite the variety of evaluation metrics, nearly all
