e bclm hn`im3, which contains two words.
    The word bclm has several possible morpheme segmentations and analyses as described in Table 1.
    In wordbased HMM, we consider such a phrase to be generated by a Markov process, based on the wordoriented tagset of N = 1934 tags/states and about M = 175K word types.
    Line W of Table 2 describes the size of a first-order word-based HMM, built over our corpus.
    In this model, we found 834 entries for the II vector (which models the distribution of tags in first position in sentences) out of possibly N = 1934, about 250K entries for the A matrix (which models the transition probabilities from tag to tag) out of possibly N2 ;::Li 3.7M, and about 300K entries for the B matrix (which models the emission probabilities from tag to word) out of possibly M &#183; N ;::Li 350M.
    For the case of a secondorder HMM, the size of the A2 matrix (which models the transition probabilities from two tags to the third one), grows to about 7M entries, where the size of the B2
