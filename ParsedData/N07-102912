he phrase table entry is increased if several systems agree on the target words.
    The agreement is measured by four levels of similarity: represents the similarity of a given phrase to all the hypotheses in the system at the similarity level .
    Basically, if there is a similar phrase in a given hypothesis in the system to the phrase , the similarity score is increased by .
    Note that each phrase in one hypothesis is similar to another hypothesis at only one similarity level, so one hypothesis can contribute to at only one similarity level.
    The final confidence of the phrase table entry is defined as (7) where are system weights and are similarity score weights.
    The parameters through interpolate between the sum, average and maximum of the similarity scores.
    These interpolation weights and 1.
    Merge individual -best lists to form a large -best list with unique hypotheses; the system weights are constrained to sum to one.
    The number of tunable combination weights, in addition to norm
