 Word lattices have been used to represent ambiguous input to machine translation systems for a variety of tasks, including translating automatic speech recognition transcriptions and translating from morphologically complex languages (Bertoldi et al., 2007; Dyer et al., 2008).
    The intuition behind using lattices in both approaches is to avoid the error propagation effects that are found when a one-best guess is used.
    By carrying a certain amount of uncertainty forward in the processing pipeline, information contained in the translation models can be leveraged to help resolve the upstream ambiguity.
    In our case, we want to propagate uncertainty about the proper segmentation of a compound forward to the decoder, which can use its full translation model to select proper segmentation for translation.
    Mathematically, this can be understood as follows: whereas the goal in conventional machine translation is to find the sentence &#710;eI1 that maximizes Pr(eI1|fJ1 ), the lattice adds a latent variab
