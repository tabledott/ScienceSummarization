ounter facts related to texts extracted from an existing RTE corpus annotated with named entities.
    Taking a step beyond the task of annotating existing datasets, and showing the feasibility of involving non-experts also in the generation of TE pairs, this approach is more relevant to our objectives.
    However, at least two major differences with our work have to be remarked.
    First, they still use available RTE data to obtain a monolingual TE corpus, whereas we pursue the more ambitious goal of generating from scratch aligned CLTE corpora for different language combinations.
    To this aim, we do not resort to already annotated data, nor languagespecific preprocessing tools.
    Second, their approach involves qualitative analysis of the collected data only a posteriori, after manual removal of invalid and trivial generated hypotheses.
    In contrast, our approach integrates quality control mechanisms at all stages of the data collection/annotation process, thus minimizing the recourse to experts t
