; Sutton and McCallum, 2006) constitute a widely-used and effective approach for supervised structure learning tasks involving the mapping between complex objects such as strings and trees.
    An important property of CRFs is their ability to handle large and redundant feature sets and to integrate structural dependency between output labels.
    However, even for simple linear chain CRFs, the complexity of learning and inference This work was partly supported by ANR projects CroTaL (ANR-07-MDCO-003) and MGA (ANR-07-BLAN-031102). grows quadratically with respect to the number of output labels and so does the number of structural features, ie. features testing adjacent pairs of labels.
    Most empirical studies on CRFs thus either consider tasks with a restricted output space (typically in the order of few dozens of output labels), heuristically reduce the use of features, especially of features that test pairs of adjacent labels1, and/or propose heuristics to simulate contextual dependencies, via extended t
