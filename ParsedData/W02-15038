port on it at the next meeting.
    The discussion of such issues may be reopened at successive meetings until a concensus is reached.
    Even within a given linguistic formalism, LFG for ParGram, there is usually more than one way to analyze a construction.
    Moreover, the same theoretical analysis may have different possible implementations in XLE.
    These solutions often differ in efficiency or conceptual simplicity and one of the tasks within the ParGram project is to make design decisions which favor one theoretical analysis and concomitant implementation over another.
    Whenever possible, the ParGram grammars choose the same analysis and the same technical solution for equivalent constructions.
    This was done, for example, with imperatives.
    Imperatives are always assigned a null pronominal subject within the fstructure and a feature indicating that they are imperatives, as in (2).
    Another example of this type comes from the analysis of specifiers.
    Specifiers include many different
