 distribution, though as in Naive Bayes, it can be an excellent estimator for the purpose of ranking alignments.
    If we have an aligned training corpus, the probabilities needed for the above equation are quite easy to obtain.
    Link probabilities can be determined directly from |lk |(link counts) and |eik, fj,k| (co-occurrence counts).
    For any co-occurring pair of words (eik, fjk), we check whether it has the feature ft.
    If it does, we increment the count of |ft, eik, fjk|.
    If this pair is also linked, then we increment the count of |ft, lk|.
    Note that our definition of FTk allows for features that depend on previous links.
    For this reason, when determining whether or not a feature is present in a given context, one must impose an ordering on the links.
    This ordering can be arbitrary as long as the same ordering is used in training1 and probability evaluation.
    A simple solution would be to order links according their French words.
    We choose to order links according to the
