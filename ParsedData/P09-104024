l dependency trees.
    There are also affinities to the system of Attardi (2006), which combines non-adjacent nodes on the stack instead of swapping nodes and is equivalent to a restricted version of our system, where no more than two consecutive SWAP transitions are permitted.
    This restriction preserves linear worstcase complexity at the expense of completeness.
    Finally, the algorithm first described by Covington (2001) and used for data-driven parsing by Nivre (2007), is complete but has quadratic complexity even in the best case.
  
  
    We have presented a novel transition system for dependency parsing that can handle unrestricted non-projective trees.
    The system reuses standard techniques for building projective trees by combining adjacent nodes (representing subtrees with adjacent yields), but adds a simple mechanism for swapping the order of nodes on the stack, which gives a system that is sound and complete for the set of all dependency trees over a given label set but behaves exactly l
