   The program achieved a success rate of 81.3%, meaning that 81.3% of reduction decisions made by the system agreed with those of humans.
    Sentence reduction improves the conciseness of automatically generated summaries, making it concise and on target.
    It can also improve the coherence of generated summaries, since extraneous phrases that can potentially introduce incoherece are removed.
    We collected 500 sentences and their corresponding reduced forms written by humans, and found that humans reduced the length of these 500 sentences by 44.2% on average.
    This indicates that a good sentence reduction system can improve the conciseness of generated summaries significantly.
    In the next section, we describe the sentence reduction algorithm in details.
    In Section 3, we introduce the evaluation scheme used to access the performance of the system and present evaluation results.
    In Section 4, we discuss other applications of sentence reduction, the interaction between reduction and other m
