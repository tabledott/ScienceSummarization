rd alignment and phrase alignment of a German&#8211;English sentence pair.
    We describe our model using a log-linear modeling approach.
    Hence, all knowledge sources are described as feature functions that include the given source language string f J1, the target language string eI1, and the above-stated hidden variables.
    Hence, we have the following functional form of all feature functions: Figure 6 gives an overview of the decisions made in the alignment template model.
    First, the source sentence words fJ1 are grouped into phrases f&#732;1K.
    For each phrase f&#732; an alignment template z is chosen and the sequence of chosen alignment templates is reordered (according to &#960;K1 ).
    Then, every phrase f&#732; produces its translation e&#732; (using the corresponding alignment template z).
    Finally, the sequence of phrases &#732;eK1 constitutes the sequence of words eI1.
