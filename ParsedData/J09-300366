 to contend with the noise from neutral instances is dramatic.
    Although Table 20 shows that there is room for improvement across all the contextual polarity classes, Figure 3 shows us that perhaps the best way to achieve these improvements is to improve the ability to discriminate the neutral class from the others.
  
  
    Other researchers who have worked on classifying the contextual polarity of sentiment expressions are Yi et al. (2003), Popescu and Etzioni (2005), and Suzuki, Takamura, and Okumura (2006).
    Yi et al. use a lexicon and manually developed patterns to classify contextual polarity.
    Their patterns are high-quality, yielding quite high precision over the set of expressions that they evaluate.
    Popescu and Etzioni use an unsupervised classification technique called relaxation labeling (Hummel and Zucker 1983) to recognize the contextual polarity of words that are at the heads of select opinion phrases.
    They take an iterative approach, using relaxation labeling first to determi
