, i.e., that there exists some context where tokens u and v are generated from the same concept.
    The relationship between score(u, v) and trans (u, v) can be more or less direct, depending on the model and its estimation method.
    Each of the models presented below uses a different score formulation.
    All my methods for estimating the translation parameters trans (u, v) share the following general outline: Under certain conditions, a parameter estimation process of this sort is an instance of the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm (Dempster, Laird, and Rubin 1977).
    As explained below, meeting these conditions is computationally too expensive for my models.'
    Therefore, I employ some approximations, which lack the EM algorithm's convergence guarantee.
    The maximum likelihood approach to estimating the unknown parameters is to find the set of parameters 6 that maximize the probability of the training bitext (U, V).
    The probability of the bitext is a sum over the distribution A of pos
