  Note that we may also treat the individual systems differently by applying different priors (i.e., weights) on the estimated probabilities of the argument candidates.
  For example, if the performance of system A is much better than system B, then we may want to trust system A?s output more by multiplying the output probabilities by a larger weight.
  Table 11 reports the performance of two individual systems based on Collins?s parser and Charniak?s parser, as well as the joint system, where the two individual systems are equally weighted.
  The joint system based on this straightforward strategy significantly improves the performance compared to the two original SRL systems in both recall and precision, and thus achieves a much higher F1.
