AvgSentLen*1.3; low if length(S) &lt; AvgSentLen/1.3; and medium otherwise.
    We conducted experiments to evaluate the performance of the feature sets, both individually and in various combinations.
    Unless otherwise noted, all experiments involved training a Naive Bayes classifier using a particular set of features.
    We evaluated each classifier using 25fold cross validation on the experiment corpus and used paired t-tests to measure significance at the 95% confidence level.
    As our evaluation metrics, we computed accuracy (Acc) as the percentage of the system&#8217;s classifications that match the gold-standard, and precision (Prec) and recall (Rec) with respect to subjective sentences. represents the common baseline of assigning every sentence to the most frequent class.
    The Most-Frequent baseline achieves 59% accuracy because 59% of the sentences in the gold-standard are subjective.
    Row (2) is a Naive Bayes classifier that uses the WBO features, which performed well in prior research on
