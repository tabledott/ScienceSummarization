    For many NLP classification tasks, we do not have a good parametric model for p(x).
    We thus need to resort to non-parametric density estimation methods.
    However, for many NLP tasks, x resides in a high dimensional space, which makes it hard to apply standard non-parametri c density estimation meth268 ods.
    We have not explored this direction, and in our experiments, we set to 1 for all source instan and control the balance among the three sets of instances.
