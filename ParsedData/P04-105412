zed, symmetric similarity score in the range (0, 1) for two trees T1 and T2.
    We define a slightly more general version of the kernel described by Zelenko et al. (2003).
    We first define two functions over the features of tree nodes: a matching function m(ti, tj) E I0, 1} and a similarity function s(ti, tj) E (0, oc].
    Let the feature vector 0(ti) = Iv1 ... vd} consist of two possibly overlapping subsets 0m(ti) C_ 0(ti) and 0s(ti) C_ 0(ti).
    We use 0m(ti) in the matching function and 0s(ti) in the similarity function.
    We define and where C(vq, vr) is some compatibility function between two feature values.
    For example, in the simplest case where s(ti, tj) returns the number of feature values in common between feature vectors 0s(ti) and 0s(tj).
    We can think of the distinction between functions m(ti, tj) and s(ti, tj) as a way to discretize the similarity between two nodes.
    If 0m(ti) =&#65533; 0m(tj), then we declare the two nodes completely dissimilar.
    However, if 0m(ti) = 0m(tj)
