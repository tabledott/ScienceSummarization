s which should not have one.
    Only a small fraction of these pronouns are true expletives (i.e., they precede a &#8220;weather&#8221; verb or are in constructions like &#8220;It seems that... &#8221;.
    The majority of these cases are referential, but have no antecedent in the data (i.e., they are vague pronouns).
    The overall numbers for precision, recall and fmeasure are fairly low.
    One reason is that we did not attempt to resolve anaphoric definite NPs and proper names though these coreference links are contained in the evaluation key list.
    If we removed them from there, the recall of our experiments would approach the 51% Byron (2002) mentioned for her system using only domain-independent semantic restrictions.
  
  
    Our approach for determining the feature set for pronoun resolution resembles the so-called wrapper approach for feature selection (Kohavi &amp; John, 1997).
    This is in contrast to the majority of other work on feature selection for anaphora resolution, which was hardl
