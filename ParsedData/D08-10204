to approximate readability more robustly than using a predefined word frequency list.
    Standard indices were developed based on the link between word frequency/length and readability, such as Flesch-Kincaid (Kincaid, 1975), Automated Readability Index (Kincaid, 1975), Gunning Fog (Gunning, 1952), SMOG (McLaughlin, 1969), and Coleman-Liau (Coleman and Liau, 1975).
    They use only a few simple factors that are designed to be easy to calculate and are rough approximations to the linguistic factors that determine readability.
    For example, Flesch-Kincaid uses the average number of syllables per word to approximate vocabulary difficulty and the average number of words per sentence to approximate syntactic difficulty.
    In recent work, the idea of linking word frequency and text readability has been explored for making medical information more accessible to the general public.
    (Elhadad and Sutaria, 2007) classified words in medical texts as familiar or unfamiliar to a general audience based on their f
