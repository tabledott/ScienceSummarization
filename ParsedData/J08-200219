gold-standard parse trees and parse trees produced by Charniak&#8217;s automatic parser (Charniak 2000).
    For gold-standard parse trees, we preprocess the trees to discard empty constituents and strip functional tags.
    Using the trace information provided by empty constituents is very useful for improving performance (Palmer, Gildea, and Kingsbury 2005; Pradhan, Ward et al. 2005), but we have not used this information so that we can compare our results to previous work and since automatic systems that recover it are not widely available.
    Since 2004, there has been a precise, standard evaluation measure for semantic role labeling, formulated by the organizers of the CoNLL shared tasks (Carreras and M`arquez 2004, 2005).
    An evaluation script is also distributed as part of the provided software for the shared task and can be used to evaluate systems on Propbank I data.
    For papers published between 2000 and 2005, there are several details of the evaluation measures for semantic role labeling tha
