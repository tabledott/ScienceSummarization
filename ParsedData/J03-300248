the Internet Archive and provides both the desired page and the time stamp indicating which snapshot to retrieve.14 The Archive also provides researchers with free, direct access to its data via accounts on their cluster.
    The data are stored on the disk drives of approximately 300 machines, each running some variety of UNIX, creating what is in essence one huge file system.
    This provides a researcher with the remarkable sensation of having the entire Web on his or her hard drive.
    Mining terabytes on the Archive presents a number of challenges: The last of these, the cluster computing tools,15 is turned out to reduce drastically the time needed to port STRAND to the Archive, as well as the size of the STRAND code base.
    The centerpiece in Archive cluster computing is a parallelization tool called p2, which offers a UNIX command-line interface that allows one to specify (1) a parallelizable task, (2) a way to split it up, (3) a way to combine the results, and (4) a set of processors among which t
