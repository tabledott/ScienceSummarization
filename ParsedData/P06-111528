s on the CLANG corpus with in creasing amounts of noise in the test sentences.
			ulate this type of noise by substituting a word in the corpus by another word, w, with probability ped(w)?P (w), where p is a parameter, ed(w) isw?s edit distance (Levenshtein, 1966) from the original word and P (w) is w?s probability proportional toits word frequency.
			The edit distance which calcu lates closeness between words is character-based rather than based on phonetics, but this should not make a significant difference in the experimental results.Figure 9 shows the results on the CLANG cor pus with increasing amounts of noise, from level 0 to level 4.
			The noise level 0 corresponds to no noise.
			The noise parameters, Padd and Pdrop, were varied uniformly from being 0 at level 0 and 0.1 at level 4, and the parameter p was varied uniformly from being 0 at level 0 and 0.01 at level 4.
			We are showing the best F-measure (harmonic meanof precision and recall) for each system at different noise levels.
