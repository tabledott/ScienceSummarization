t of labeled data, it is always better to draw from electronics as a source than use some combination of all three other domains.
    Domain adaptation alone is a generally wellstudied area, and we cannot possibly hope to cover all of it here.
    As we noted in Section 5, we are able to significantly outperform basic structural correspondence learning (Blitzer et al., 2006).
    We also note that while Florian et al. (2004) and Blitzer et al.
    (2006) observe that including the label of a source classifier as a feature on small amounts of target data tends to improve over using either the source alone or the target alone, we did not observe that for our data.
    We believe the most important reason for this is that they explore structured prediction problems, where labels of surrounding words from the source classifier may be very informative, even if the current label is not.
    In contrast our simple binary prediction problem does not exhibit such behavior.
    This may also be the reason that the mode
