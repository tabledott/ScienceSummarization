 resolution.
    However, it would be incorrect to say that our framework ignores pronominal coreference in the first six passes.
    In fact, the previous models prepare the stage for pronominal coreference by constructing precise clusters with shared mention attributes.
    These are crucial factors for pronominal coreference.
    Like previous work, we implement pronominal coreference resolution by enforcing agreement constraints between the coreferent mentions.
    We use the following attributes for these constraints: Number &#8211; we assign number attributes based on: (a) a static list for pronouns; (b) NER labels: mentions marked as a named entity are considered singular with the exception of organizations, which can be both singular or plural; (c) part of speech tags: NN*S tags are plural and all other NN* tags are singular; and (d) a static dictionary from (Bergsma and Lin, 2006).
    Gender &#8211; we assign gender attributes from static lexicons from (Bergsma and Lin, 2006; Ji and Lin, 2009).
