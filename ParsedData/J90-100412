x in the sorting.
    For example, the &amp;quot;complements&amp;quot; rule given by Shieber (1985a) in the PATR-II formalism can be encoded as the DCG rule: Top-down generation using this rule will be forced to expand the lower VP before its complement, since LF is uninstantiated initially.
    Any of the reordering methods must choose to expand the child VP node first.
    But in that case, application of the rule can recur indefinitely, leading to nontermination.
    Thus, no matter what ordering of subgoals is chosen, nontermination results.
    Of course, if one knew ahead of time that the subcategorizat ion list being built up as the value for Syncat was bounded in size, then an ad hoc solution would be to limit recursive use of this rule when that limit had been reached.
    But even this ad hoc solution is problematic, as there may be no principled bound on the size of the subcategorization list.
    For instance, in analyses of Dutch cross-serial verb constructions (Evers 1975; Huybrechts 1984), subc
