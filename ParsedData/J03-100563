 the GE reordering constraint, the average computing time is about seven seconds per sentence without any loss in translation performance as measured in terms of mWER.
    For the S3 reordering constraint, the average computing time per sentence is 27 seconds.
    Again, the combination of coverage and cardinality pruning works more efficiently for the GE constraint.
    The memory requirement for the algorithm is about 100 MB.
    4.2.6 English-to-German Translation Experiments.
    A series of translation experiments for the translation direction English to German are also carried out.
    The results, given Demonstration of the combination of the two pruning thresholds tc = 5.0 and t, = 12.5 to speed up the search process for the two reordering constraints GE and S3 (no = 50).
    The translation performance is shown in terms of mWER on the TEST-331 test set. in terms of WER and PER, are shown in Table 12.
    For the English-to-German translation direction, a single reference translation for each test sen
