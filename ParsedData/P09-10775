ing application that needs to identify causal relations (i.e. as in Girju (2003)), must not only differentiate causal relations from comparison relations, but also from expansions, temporal relations, and possibly no relation at all.
    In addition, using equal numbers of examples of each type can be misleading because the distribution of relations is known to be skewed, with expansions occurring most frequently.
    Causal and comparison relations, which are most useful for applications, are less frequent.
    Because of this, the recall of the classification should be the primary metric of success, while the Marcu and Echihabi (2001) experiments report only accuracy.
    Later work (Blair-Goldensohn et al., 2007; Sporleder and Lascarides, 2008) has discovered that the models learned do not perform as well on implicit relations as one might expect from the test accuracies on synthetic data.
  
  
    For our experiments, we use the Penn Discourse Treebank (PDTB; Prasad et al., 2008), the largest available a
