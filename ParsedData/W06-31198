m the K-Best extraction beam during the expansion process.
  
  
    We present results that compare our system against the baseline Pharaoh implementation (Koehn et al., 2003a) and MER training scripts provided for this workshop.
    Our results represent work done before the submission due date as well as after with the following generalized phrase systems. extended-category scheme, but with rules only containing up to 2 nonterminal abstraction sites.
    We also explored the impact of longer initial phrases by training another phrase table with phrases up to length 12.
    Our results are presented in Table 1.
    While our submission time system (Syn using LM for rescoring only) shows no improvement over the baseline, we clearly see the impact of integrating the language model into the K-Best list extraction process.
    Our final system shows at statistically significant improvement over the baseline (0.78 BLEU points is the 95 confidence level).
    We also see a trend towards improving translation qual
