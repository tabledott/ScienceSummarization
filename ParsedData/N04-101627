Countability is the semantic property that determines whether a noun can occur in singular and plural forms, and affects the range of permissible modifiers.
    In English, nouns are typically either countable (e.g., one dog, two dogs) or uncountable (e.g., some peace, *one peace, *two peaces).
    Baldwin and Bond (2003) propose a method for automatically learning the countability of English nouns from the BNC.
    They obtain information about noun countability by merging lexical entries from COMLEX (Grishman et al., 1994) and the ALTJ/E Japanese-to-English semantic transfer dictionary (Ikehara et al., 1991).
    Words are classified into four classes: countable, uncountable, bipartite (e.g., trousers), and plural only (e.g., goods).
    A memory-based classifier is used to learn the four-way distinction on the basis of several linguistically motivated features such as: number of the head noun, number of the modifier, subject-verb agreement, plural determiners.
