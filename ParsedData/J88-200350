elevance to the time of speech must therefore have to do with the relation between modals and the time of speech.
    We make the following tentative suggestion about this relation.
    Palmer 1974 pointed out a systematic ambiguity within the epistemic modals as between a futurate and a strictly present meaning, and Steedman 1977 related this to the similar ambiguity of a present-tensed sentence.
    What needs to be added seems to be the idea that these (suspiciously untensed looking) modals define properties of the time of speech (as is implied by the speech-act theoretic analysis of Boyd and Thorne 1969) and do not of themselves have anything to do with reference time and event time, unlike the true tensed and aspectual auxiliaries.
    More specifically, will says of the time of speech that it leads the speaker to infer a proposition (possibly but not necessarily one concerning the future).
    Must says something very similar but seems to leave the speaker out of it and says that the proposition follows
