99; Utiyama and Isahara, 2001) to detect cohesion.
    These methods are typically applied in information retrieval (Hearst, 1994; Reynar, 1998) to segment written text.
    Multi-source methods use cue phrases, prosodic features, ellipsis, anaphora, syntactic features, language models and lexical cohesion metrics to detect topic boundaries.
    Features are combined using decision trees (Miike et al., 1994; Kurohashi and Nagao, 1994; Litman and Passonneau, 1995), probabilistic models (Hajime et al., 1998) and maximum entropy models (Beeferman et al., 1997; Reynar, 1998).
    The aim is to improve segmentation accuracy by combining multiple indicators of topic shift.
    These methods are typically applied in topic detection and tracking (Allan et al., 1998) to segment transcribed text and broadcast news stories.
    Topic boundaries are discovered by merging consecutive elementary blocks that are about the same topic.
    Existing algorithms used a sliding window (Hearst, 1994), lexical chains (Morris, 1988;
