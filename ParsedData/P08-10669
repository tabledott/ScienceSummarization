    Definition 1 A dependency structure di..j is fixed on head h, where h E [i, j], or fixed for short, if and only if it meets the following conditions In addition, we say the category of di..j is (&#8722;, h, &#8722;), where &#8722; means this field is undefined.
    We say the category of di..j is (C, &#8722;, &#8722;) if j &lt; h, or (&#8722;, &#8722;, C) otherwise.
    A category is composed of the three fields (A, h, B), where h is used to represent the head, and A and B are designed to model left and right dependents of the head respectively.
    A dependency structure is well-formed if and only if it is either fixed or floating.
    We can represent dependency structures with graphs.
    Figure 2 shows examples of fixed structures, Figure 3 shows examples of floating structures, and Figure 4 shows ill-formed dependency structures.
    It is easy to verify that the structures in Figures 2 and 3 are well-formed.
    4(a) is ill-formed because boy does not have its child word the in the tree.
