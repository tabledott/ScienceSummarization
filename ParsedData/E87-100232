 the transition.
    One member of the pair of symbols on a transition can be the designated null symbol, which we will write c. When this appears, the corresponding tape is not examined, and it does not advance as the machine moves to the next state.
    Finite-state morphology originally arose out of a desire to provide ways of analyzing surface forms using grammars expressed in terms of systems of ordered rewriting rules.
    Kaplan and Kay (in preparation) observed, that finite-state transducers could be used to mimic a large class of rewriting rules, possibly including all those required for phonology.
    The importance of this came from two considerations.
    First, transducers are indifferent as to the direction in which they are applied.
    In other words, they can be used with equal facility to translate between tapes, in either direction, to accept or reject pairs of tapes, or to generate pairs of tapes.
    Second, a pair of transducers with one tape in common is equivalent to a single transduce
