tten in C and Common Lisp, which are pipelined, working as a series of Unix-style filters.
    RASP runs on Unix and is compatible with most C compilers and Common Lisp implementations.
    The public release includes Lisp and C executables for common 32- and 64-bit architectures, shell scripts for running and parameterising the system, documentation, and so forth.
    An overview of the system is given in Figure 1.
    The system is designed to take unannotated text or transcribed (and punctuated) speech as input, and not simply to run on pre-tokenised input such as that typically found in corpora produced for NLP purposes.
