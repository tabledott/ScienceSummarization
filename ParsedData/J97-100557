undaries that subjects used, as discussed above.
    The second is the inherently fuzzy nature of boundary location.
    We discuss this second issue at length in Passonneau and Litman (1996).
    In Litman and Passonneau (1995b), we also present relaxed IR metrics that penalize near misses less heavily (cases where an algorithm does not place a boundary at a statistically validated boundary location, but does place one within one phrase of the validated boundary).
    In principle, the process of determining whether the statistically validated segment boundaries correlate with linguistic devices requires a complex search through a large space of possibilities, depending on what set of linguistic devices one examines, and what features are used to recognize and classify them.
    Rather than developing a method to search blindly through the space of possibilities, we first provide an initial evaluation of three linguistic devices whose distribution or surface form has frequently been hypothesized to be condit
