so opt to merge all tuples returned by a query into sets of tuples that are deemed synonymous.
  
  
    On our test corpus of 9 million Web documents, TEXTRUNNER extracted 7.8 million well-formed tuples.
    On a randomly selected subset of 400 tuples, 80.4% were deemed correct by human reviewers.
    We performed a head-to-head comparison with a state-of-the-art traditional information extraction system, called KNOWITALL.
    (Etzioni et al., 2005) On a set of ten high-frequency relations, TEXTRUNNER found nearly as many correct extractions as KNOWITALL (11,631 to 11,476), while reducing the error rate of KNOWITALL by 33% (18% to 12%).
