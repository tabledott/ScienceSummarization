recognition of LCFRS's, we make further assumption concerning the contribution of each structure to the input string, and how the composition operations combine structures in this respect.
    We can show that languages generated by LCFRS's are semilinear as long as the composition operation does not remove any terminal symbols from its arguments.
    Semilinearity and the closely related constant growth property (a consequence of semilinearity) have been discussed in the context of grammars for natural languages by Joshi (1983/85) and Berwick and Weinberg (1984).
    Roughly speaking, a language, L, has the property of semilinearity if the number of occurrences of each symbol in any string is a linear combination of the occurrences of these symbols in some fixed finite set of strings.
    Thus, the length of any string in L is a linear combination of the length of strings in some fixed finite subset of L, and thus L is said to have the constant growth property.
    Although this property is not structural, i
