t; and &amp;quot;He gave a summary of the book&amp;quot; are effectively equivalent in meaning Sometimes these morphological relations can be picked up from glosses, as when {disagreement} is defined as (the speech act of disagreeing or arguing or disputing), but these are generally regarded as uninformative definitions, and the reverse relation may not happen to occur Since many of the words are polysemous, morphological relations should not link words, but synsets that have related meanings For example, {execute} meaning (to put to death) should be linked to {execution} meaning (the act of putting a condemned person to death), and {execute} meaning (to carry out a task) should be linked to {execution} meaning (the act of doing something successfully), etc And in cases where the concepts of the noun and verb are different-e g, {womanize} from {woman}-no semantic link would need to be created
