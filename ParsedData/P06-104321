es.6 A Wilcoxon signed rank test on the remaining 2,049 paired sentence level f-scores was significant at p = 0.0003.
    Of these 2,049 sentences, there were 983 parse pairs with the same sentence-level f-score.
    Of the 1,066 sentences for which the parsers produced parses with different f-scores, there were 580 sentences for which the BROWN/BROWN parser produced a parse with a higher sentence-level f-score and 486 sentences for which the WSJ+NANC/WSJ parser produce a parse with a higher f-score.
    We constructed a generalized linear model with a binomial link with BROWN/BROWN f-score &gt; WSJ+NANC/WSJ f-score as the predicted variable, and sentence length, the number of prepositions (IN), the number of conjunctions (CC) and Brown f-score &gt; WSJ+NANC/WSJ f-score identified by model selection.
    The feature IN is the number prepositions in the sentence, while ID identifies the Brown subcorpus that the sentence comes from.
    Stars indicate significance level. subcorpus ID as explanatory variables.
