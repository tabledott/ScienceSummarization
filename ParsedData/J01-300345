urn to our computational experiments that investigate whether the statistical indicators of thematic properties that we have developed can in fact be used to classify verbs.
    Recall that the task we have set ourselves is that of automatically learning the best class for a set of usages of a verb, as opposed to classifying individual occurrences of the verb.
    The frequency distributions of our features yield a vector for each verb that represents the estimated values for the verb on each dimension across the entire corpus: Vector template: [verb-name, TRANS, PASS, VBN, CAUS, ANIM, class] Example: [opened, .69, .09, .21, .16, .36, unacd The resulting set of 59 vectors constitutes the data for our machine learning experiments.
    We use this data to train an automatic classifier to determine, given the feature values for a new verb (not from the training set), which of the three major classes of English optionally intransitive verbs it belongs to.
    In pilot experiments on a subset of the features, we i
