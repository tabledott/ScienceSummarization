ordering is problematic in phrase-based SMT.
    For example, the distancebased reordering model (Koehn et al., 2003) allows a decoder to translate in non-monotonous order, under the constraint that the distance between two phrases translated consecutively does not exceed a limit known as distortion limit.
    In theory the distortion limit can be assigned a very large value so that all possible reorderings are allowed, yet in practise it is observed that too high a distortion limit not only harms efficiency but also translation performance (Koehn et al., 2005).
    In our own experiment setting, the best distortion limit for ChineseEnglish translation is 4.
    However, some ideal translations exhibit reorderings longer than such distortion limit.
    Consider the sentence pair in NIST MT2005 test set shown in figure 1(a): after translating the word &#8220;&#8226;V/mend&#8221;, the decoder should &#8216;jump&#8217; across six words and translate the last phrase &#8220;)&#65533; ,* R /fissures in the relation
