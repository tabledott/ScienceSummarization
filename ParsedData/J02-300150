ndependently of the grammatical-function feature results Minimal lattice. in the lattice of Figure 8b, corresponding to the second column of Table 7.
    Choosing distributions such that the grammatical function and voice features are always used together results in Figure 8c, corresponding to the third column of Table 7.
    In each case, as in previous results, the grammatical function feature was used only when the candidate constituent was an NP.
    The last row of Table 7 shows results using no grammatical-function feature: the distributions making use of GF are removed from the lattices of Figure 8.
    As a guideline for interpreting these results, with 8,167 observations, the threshold for statistical significance with p &lt; .05 is a 1.0% absolute difference in performance.
    It is interesting to note that looking at a constituent&#8217;s position relative to the target word performed as well as either of our features that read grammatical function off the parse tree, both with and without passive
