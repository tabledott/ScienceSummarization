the high ambiguity level of the morphological data (average number of 2.4 analyses per word).
    Reported results on a large scale corpus (6M words) with fully unsupervised learning are 92.32% for PoS tagging and 88.5% for full morphological disambiguation.
    In this work, we used the backoff smoothing method, suggested by Thede and Harper (1999), with an extension of additive smoothing (Chen, 1996, 2.2.1) for the lexical probabilities (B and B2 matrices).
    To complete this study, we are currently investigating several smoothing techniques (Chen, 1996), in order to check whether the morpheme model is critical for the data sparseness problem, or whether it can be handled with smoothing over a word model.
    We are currently investigating two major methods to improve our results: first, we have started gathering a larger corpus of manually tagged text and plan to perform semi-supervised learning on a corpus of 100K manually tagged words.
    Second, we plan to improve the unknown word model, such as inte
