nt ways to estimate its parameters, with the intention of maximizing the ability of the model to tag text accurately.
    In particular, we are interested in a way to make the best use of untagged text in the training of the model.
  
  
    We suppose that the user has defined a set of tags (attached to words).
    Consider a sentence W = w1w2 wn, and a sequence of tags T =-- tit2 tn, of the same length.
    We call the pair (W, T) an alignment.
    We say that word w, has been assigned the tag t, in this alignment.
    We assume that the tags have some linguistic meaning for the user, so that among all possible alignments for a sentence there is a single one that is correct from a grammatical point of view.
    A tagging procedure is a procedure 0 that selects a sequence of tags (and so defines an alignment) for each sentence.
    0:W--+T=0(W) There are (at least) two measures for the quality of a tagging procedure: In practice, performance at sentence level is generally lower than performance at word level
