ontrast to Carroll and Rooth&#8217;s (1998) approach, the model proposed by Collins (1997) does not compute rule probabilities directly.
    Rather, they are generated using a Markov process that makes certain independence assumptions.
    A grammar rule LHS &#57736; RHS can be written as P &#57736; Lm ...L1 H R1 ...Rn where P is the mother and H is the head daughter.
    Let l(C) be the head word of C and t(C) the tag of the head word of C. Then the probability of a rule is defined as: Here, Ph is the probability of generating the head, and Pl and Pr are the probabilities of generating the nonterminals to the left and right of the head, respectively; d(i) is a distance measure.
    (L0 and R0 are stop categories.)
    At this point, the model is still unlexicalized.
    To add lexical sensitivity, the Ph, Pr and Pl probability functions also take into account head words and their POS tags:
  
  
    This experiment was designed to compare the performance of the three models introduced in the last section.
