 Z will be thresholded out, because none is part of such a sequence.
    Rayner et al. used this insight for a hierarchical, non-recursive grammar, and only used their technique to prune after the first level of the grammar.
    They computed a score for each sequence as the minimum of the scores of each node in the sequence, and computed a score for each node in the sequence as the minimum of three scores: one based on statistics about nodes to the left, one based on nodes to the right, and one based on unigram statistics.
    We wanted to extend the work of Rayner et al. to general PCFGs, including those that were recursive.
    Our approach therefore differs from theirs in many ways.
    Rayner et al. ignore the inside probabilities of nodes; while this may work after processing only the first level of a grammar, when the inside probabilities will be relatively homogeneous, it could cause problems after other levels, when the inside probability of a node will give important information about its usefulness
