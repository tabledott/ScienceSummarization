 is a multiset of examples, each of which is an occurrence of a noun at a given slot r of a given verb v (i.e., duplication is allowed).
    We let I SI denote the size of S as a multiset, and n E S indicate the inclusion of n in S as a multiset.
    For example, the column labeled slot_value in Table 1 represents a sample S for the subject slot of fly, and in this case I SI= 10.
    Given a sample S and a tree cut F, we employ MLE to estimate the parameters of the corresponding tree cut model 14 = (F, &#212;), where &#212; denotes the estimated parameters.
    The total description length L(M, S) of the tree cut model kl and the sample S observed through M is computed as the sum of the model description length L(F), parameter description length L(e I r), and data description length L(S I Note that we sometimes refer to L(F) + L(e I n as the model description length.
    The model description length L(F) is a subjective quantity, which depends on the coding scheme employed.
    Here, we choose to assign the s
