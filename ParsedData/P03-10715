nsidered to be difficult to mark reliably.
    Subjects were asked to mark each speaker change (potential boundary) as either boundary or non-boundary.
    In the resulting annotation, the agreed segmentation based on majority opinion contained 7.5 segments per meeting on average, while the average number of potential boundaries is 770.
    We used Cochran&#8217;s Q (1950) to evaluate the agreement among annotators.
    Cochran&#8217;s test evaluates the null hypothesis that the number of subjects assigning a boundary at any position is randomly distributed.
    The test shows that the interjudge reliability is significant to the 0.05 level for 19 of the meetings, which seems to indicate that segment identification is a feasible task.2
  
  
    Previous work on discourse segmentation of written texts indicates that lexical cohesion is a strong indicator of discourse structure.
    Lexical cohesion is a linguistic property that pertains to speech as well, and is a linguistic phenomenon that can also be exploi
