ds of dealing with the large number of parameters in these models that are both more principled and more practical than the approaches described above.
    First, we can integrate out &#952;, and second, we can infer values for the adaptor hyperparameters using sampling.
    These methods (the latter in particular) make it practical to use Pitman-Yor Process adaptors in complex grammars such as the collocation-syllable adaptor grammar, where it is impractical to try to find optimal parameter values by grid search.
    As we will show, they also improve segmentation accuracy, sometimes dramatically.
    Johnson et al. (2007a) describe Gibbs samplers for Bayesian inference of PCFG rule probabilities &#952;, and these techniques can be used directly with adaptor grammars as well.
    Just as in that paper, we place Dirichlet priors on &#952;: here &#952;X is the subvector of &#952; corresponding to rules expanding nonterminal X E N, and &#946;X is a corresponding vector of positive real numbers specifying the hy
