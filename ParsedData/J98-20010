  A Corpus-Based Investigation Of Definite Description Use
  
    We present the results of a study of the use of definite descriptions in written texts aimed at assessing the feasibility of annotating corpora with information about definite description interpretation.
    We ran two experiments, in which subjects were asked to classify the uses of definite descriptions in a corpus of 33 newspaper articles, containing a total of 1,412 definite descriptions.
    We measured the agreement among annotators about the classes assigned to definite descriptions, as well as the agreement about the antecedent assigned to those definites that the annotators classified as being related to an antecedent in the text.
    The most interesting result of this study a corpus annotation perspective was the rather low agreement = 0.63) we obtained versions of Hawkins's and Prince's classification schemes; better results = 0.76) obtained using the simplified scheme proposed by Fraurud that includes only two classes, firstmentio
