summary of overall performance, we also sum the deviation of the observed value from the ideal value for each metric: (1 &#8212; recall) + (1&#8212;precision) + fallout + error.
    The summed deviation for perfect performance is thus 0.
    Finally, to interpret our quantitative results, we use the performance of our human subjects as a target for the performance of our algorithms (Gale, Church, and Yarowsky 1992).
    Table 3 shows the average human performance for both the training and test sets of narratives, for both boundaries identified by at least three and four subjects.
    Note that human performance is basically the same for both sets of narratives.
    However, two factors prevent this performance from being closer to ideal (e.g., recall and precision 12 Elsewhere we have discussed problems with the use of IR metrics, given that segmentation is a fuzzy phenomenon.
    However, they provide a rough (lower bound) measure of performance. of 1).
    The first is the wide variation in the number of bo
