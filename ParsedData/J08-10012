shable from human writing, makes the incorporation of coherence theories in robust large-scale systems particularly appealing.
    The task is, however, challenging considering that most previous efforts have relied on handcrafted rules, valid only for limited domains, with no guarantee of scalability or portability (Reiter and Dale 2000).
    Furthermore, coherence constraints are often embedded in complex representations (e.g., Asher and Lascarides 2003) which are hard to implement in a robust application.
    This article focuses on local coherence, which captures text relatedness at the level of sentence-to-sentence transitions.
    Local coherence is undoubtedly necessary for global coherence and has received considerable attention in computational linguistics (Foltz, Kintsch, and Landauer 1998; Marcu 2000; Lapata 2003; Althaus, Karamanis, and Koller instance, McKoon and Ratcliff (1992) argue that local coherence is the primary source of inference-making during reading.
    The key premise of our work is
