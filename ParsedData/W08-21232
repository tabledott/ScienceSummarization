 multi-headed dependency anal- ysis, which is NP-hard even if the number of heads is bounded (Chickering et al., 1994).
  This means that we must resort to a simplifica- tion such as an incremental method or a reranking approach.
  We chose the latter option and thus cre- ated syntactic and semantic submodels.
  The joint syntactic?semantic prediction is selected from a small list of candidates generated by the respective subsystems.
  2 Syntactic Submodel We model the process of syntactic parsing of a sentence x as finding the parse tree y?
  syn = argmax y F (x, y) that maximizes a scoring func- tion F .
  The learning problem consists of fitting this function so that the cost of the predictions is as low as possible according to a cost function ?.
  In this work, we consider linear scoring functions of the following form: F (x, y) = w ??
  (x, y) is a numeric feature representation of the pair (x, y) andw a vector of feature weights.
  We defined the syntactic cost ?
  as the sum of link costs, where the l
