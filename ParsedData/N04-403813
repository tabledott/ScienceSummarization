 inconsistencies in the training data.
    For example, the word for United in United States ofAmerica or United Nations is randomly tagged as a noun, or an adjective in the training data.
    We applied a similar SVM based POS tagging system to English text using the English TreeBank.
    The size of the training and test data corresponded to those evaluated in the Arabic experiments.
    The English experiment resulted in an accuracy of 94.97%, which is comparable to the Arabic SVM-POS results of 95.49%.
    Results: Table 4 illustrates the results obtained by SVM-BP Discussion: The overall performance of SVM-BP is score of 92.08.
    These results are interesting in light of state-of-the-art for English BP chunking performance which is at an score of 93.48, against a baseline of 77.7 in CoNLL 2000 shared task (Tjong et al., 2000).
    It is worth noting that SVM-BP trained on the English TreeBank, with a comparable training and test size data to those of the Arabic experiment, yields an score of 93.05.
