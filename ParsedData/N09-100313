    Several studies indicate that the human scores consistently have very high correlations with each other (Miller and Charles, 1991; Resnik, 1995), thus validating the use of these datasets for evaluating semantic similarity.
    For the cross-lingual evaluation, the two datasets were modified by translating the second word in each pair into Spanish.
    Two humans translated simultaneously both datasets, with an inter-tagger agreement of 72% for RG and 84% for WordSim353.
  
  
    Table 1 shows the Spearman correlation obtained on the RG and WordSim353 datasets, including the interval at 0.95 of confidence6.
    Overall the distributional context-window approach performs best in the RG, reaching 0
