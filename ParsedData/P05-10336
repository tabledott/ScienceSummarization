 result sometimes resembles a syntactician&#8217;s grammar but often does not.
    In this respect it resembles Wu&#8217;s bilingual bracketer (Wu, 1997), but ours uses a different extraction method that allows more than one lexical item in a rule, in keeping with the phrasebased philosophy.
    Our extraction method is basically the same as that of Block (2000), except we allow more than one nonterminal symbol in a rule, and use a more sophisticated probability model.
    In this paper we describe the design and implementation of our hierarchical phrase-based model, and report on experiments that demonstrate that hierarchical phrases indeed improve translation.
  
  
    Our model is based on a weighted synchronous CFG (Aho and Ullman, 1969).
    In a synchronous CFG the elementary structures are rewrite rules with aligned pairs of right-hand sides: where X is a nonterminal, &#947; and &#945; are both strings of terminals and nonterminals, and &#8212; is a one-to-one correspondence between nonterminal occurr
