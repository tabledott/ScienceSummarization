ther rule-based/symbolic or corpusbased/probabilistic.
    Recent work (e.g.
    Brill 1992) has demonstrated clearly that this categorization is in fact a mix-up of two distinct categorization systems: on the one hand there is the representation used for the language model (rules, Markov model, neural net, case base, etc.) and on the other hand the manner in which the model is constructed (hand crafted vs. data driven).
    Data driven methods appear to be the more popular.
    This can be explained by the fact that, in general, hand crafting an explicit model is rather difficult, especially since what is being modelled, natural language, is not (yet) wellunderstood.
    When a data driven method is used, a model is automatically learned from the implicit structure of an annotated training corpus.
    This is much easier and can quickly lead to a model which produces results with a 'reasonably' good quality.
    Obviously, 'reasonably good quality' is not the ultimate goal.
    Unfortunately, the quality tha
