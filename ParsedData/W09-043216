or rate) and PER (position independent error rate).
    The distance in style, genre, jargon, etc. between the UN and the EP corpora is made evident by the gap in perplexity (Federico and De Mori, 1998) and OOV percentage between their English LMs: 286 vs 74 and 1.12% vs 0.15%, respectively.
    Performance of the system trained on the EP corpus (third row) can be taken as an upper bound for any adaptation strategy trying to exploit parts of the EP corpus, while those of the first line clearly provide the corresponding lower-bound.
    The system in the second row can instead be consider as the lower bound when only monolingual English adaptation data are assumed.
    The synthesis of the S&#175;E-EP corpus was performed with the system trained just on the UN training data (first row of Table 2), because we had assumed that the in-domain data were only monolingual Spanish and thus not useful for neither the TM, RM nor target LM estimation.
    Similarly, the system in the last row of Table 2 was developed on
