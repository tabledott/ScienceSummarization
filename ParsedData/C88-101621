 an experimentally appropriate threshold 71, and iuchulc in the glossary all pairs (e, e) and (e, e) whose mutual information exceeds 7.
  While tile process above results in two-word fixed locutions, longer locutions can be obtained iteratively in the next round after the two-word variety had been included in the glossary and in the formulation of its creation.
  To obtain French locutions, one must simply reverse the direction of the translation process, making English and French the source and target languages, respectively.
  With two-word locutions present in both the English and French parts of the glossary, it is necessary to reformulate the generation process (4.1).
  The change would be minimal if we could decide to treat the words of a locution ( , / ; f  )  as a single word f* = U, f  )  rather than as two separate words f and f   whenever both are found in a sentence.
  In such a case nothing more than a receding of the French text would be required.
  However, such a radical step would almost cer
