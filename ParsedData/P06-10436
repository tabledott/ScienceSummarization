ectly comparable to ours is that of (Ratnaparkhi, 1999; Hwa, 1999; Gildea, 2001; Bacchiani et al., 2006).
    All of these papers look at what happens to modern WSJ-trained statistical parsers (Ratnaparkhi&#8217;s, Collins&#8217;, Gildea&#8217;s and Roark&#8217;s, respectively) as training data varies in size or usefulness (because we are testing on something other than WSJ).
    We concentrate particularly on the work of (Gildea, 2001; Bacchiani et al., 2006) as they provide results which are directly comparable to those presented in this paper.
    Looking at Table 1, the first line shows us the standard training and testing on WSJ &#8212; both parsers perform in the 86-87% range.
    The next line shows what happens when parsing Brown using a WSJ-trained parser.
    As with the Charniak parser, both parsers take an approximately 6% hit.
    It is at this point that our work deviates from these two papers.
    Lacking alternatives, both (Gildea, 2001) and (Bacchiani et al., 2006) give up on adapting a pure
