   For each observed coarse symbol s: ii.
    For each child symbol s': A.
    Draw second-level infinite multinomial over subsymbols &#960;s0szc &#8212; DP(&#945;,&#946;s0).
    For each tree node i generated in context c by parent symbol s' and parent subsymbol z': and parses.
    In the above GEM, DP, Dir, and Mult refer respectively to the stick breaking distribution, Dirichlet process, Dirichlet distribution, and multinomial distribution.
    Generating Symbols and Words We describe how a single node of the tree is generated before discussing how the entire tree structure is formed.
    Each node of the dependency tree is comprised of three random variables: an observed coarse symbol s, a hidden refined subsymbol z, and an observed word x.
    In the following let the parent of the current node have symbol s' and subsymbol z'; the root node is generated from separate root-specific distributions.
    Subsymbol refinement is an optional component of the full model and can be omitted by deterministically eq
