ximately 3%.
    Thus it is possible that the performance gains achieved by the parent annotation transform have little to do with PP attachment.
  
  
    This paper has presented theoretical and empirical evidence that the choice of tree representation can make a significant difference to the performance of a PCFG-based parsing system.
    What makes a tree representation a good choice for PCFG modeling seems to be quite different to what makes it a good choice for a representation of a linguistic theory.
    In conventional linguistic theories the choice of rules, and hence trees, The effects of selective application of the Parent transform.
    Each point corresponds to a PCFG induced after selective application of the Parent transform.
    The point labeled All corresponds to the PCFG induced after the Parent transform to all nonroot nonterminal nodes, as before.
    Points labeled with a single category A correspond to PCFGs induced after applying the Parent transform to just those nodes labeled A, whil
