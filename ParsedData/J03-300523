sparseness problem to a certain extent.
    Table 5 provides the number of zero counts for both Web search engines and compares them to the number of bigrams that yielded no matches in the NANTC.
    We observe that the Web counts are substantially less sparse than the NANTC counts: In the worst case, there are nine bigrams for which our Web queries returned no matches (10% of the data), whereas up to 82 bigrams were unseen in the NANTC (91% of the data).
    Recall that the NANTC is 3.5 times larger than the BNC, which does not seem to be enough to substantially mitigate data sparseness.
    All further analyses were carried out on log-transformed frequencies; hence we adjusted zero counts by setting them to .5.
    Table 6 shows descriptive statistics for the bigram counts we obtained using AltaVista and Google.
    For comparison, this table also provides descriptive statistics for the BNC and NANTC counts (for seen bigrams only) and for the counts re-created using class-based smoothing (see Section 3.3 fo
