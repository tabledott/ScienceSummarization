 concluding remarks are in Section 6.
  
  
    In this section we describe the basic structure and operation of a weighted head transducer.
    In some respects, this description is simpler than earlier presentations (e.g., Alshawi 1996); for example, here final states are simply a subset of the transducer states whereas in other work we have described the more general case in which final states are specified by a probability distribution.
    The simplified description is adequate for the purposes of this paper.
    Formally, a weighted head transducer is a 5-tuple: an alphabet W of input symbols; an alphabet V of output symbols; a finite set Q of states go, &#8226; &#8226; &#8226; , qs; a set of final states F C Q; and a finite set T of state transitions.
    A transition from state q to state q' has the form (q, q' ,w, v, a, 0, c) where w is a member of W or is the empty string e; v is a member of V or 6; the integer a is the input position; the integer 0 is the output position; and the real number c is t
