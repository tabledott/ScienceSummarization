en extended to take advantage of partially bracketed input, and to return partial parses on ungrammatical input.
    The latter extension removes one of the common objections against top-down, predictive (as opposed to bottom-up) parsing approaches (Magerman and Weir 1992).
  
  
    The remainder of the article proceeds as follows.
    Section 3 briefly reviews the workings of an Earley parser without regard to probabilities.
    Section 4 describes how the parser needs to be extended to compute sentence and prefix probabilities.
    Section 5 deals with further modifications for solving the Viterbi and training tasks, for processing partially bracketed inputs, and for finding partial parses.
    Section 6 discusses miscellaneous issues and relates our work to the literature on the subject.
    In Section 7 we summarize and draw some conclusions.
    To get an overall idea of probabilistic Earley parsing it should be sufficient to read Sections 3, 4.2, and 4.4.
    Section 4.5 deals with a crucial technicali
