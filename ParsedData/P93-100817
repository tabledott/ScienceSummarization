uences of possible repairs in the utterance, the mechanism produces a ranked set of candidate corrected utterances.
    These candidates are ranked in order of the fewest deleted words.
    The first candidate that can be given an interpretation is accepted as the intended meaning of the utterance.
    This approach is presented in detail in (Bear, Dowding, and Shriberg, 1992).
    The repair correction mechanism helps increase the syntactic and semantic coverage of Gemini (as reported in Table 1).
    In the 5875utterance training set, 178 sentences contained nontrivial repairs2, of which Gemini found 89 (50%).
    Of the sentences Gemini corrected, 81 were analyzed correctly (91%), and 8 contained repairs but were corrected wrongly.
    Similarly, the 756utterance test set contained 26 repairs, of which Gemini found 11(42%).
    Of those 11, 8 were analyzed correctly (77%), and 3 were analyzed incorrectly.
    Since Gemini's approach is to extend language analysis to recognize specific patterns characterist
