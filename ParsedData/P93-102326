mplex cases of pairs.
    Furthermore, some of the associations between adjectives that the system reports appear to be more stable than others; these associations remain in the same group when we vary the number of clusters in the partition.
    We have noticed that adjectives with a higher degree of semantic content (e.g. international or severe) appear to form more stable associations than relatively semantically empty adjectives (e.g. little or real).
    This observation can be used to filter out adjectives which are too general to be meaningfully clustered in groups.
  
  
    To evaluate the performance of our system we compared its output to a model solution for the problem designed by humans.
    Nine human judges were presented with the set of adjectives to be partitioned, a description of the domain, and a simple example.
    They were told that clusters should not overlap but they could select any number of clusters (the judges used from 6 to 11 clusters, with an average of 8.565 and a sample stan
