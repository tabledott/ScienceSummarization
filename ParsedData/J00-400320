ial antecedent whose head matches the head noun of the definite description.
    The key issues to address in doing this are: CNP ,the , squabbling , [PP,within, [NP,the,Organization...]]] .
    Although this strategy works most of the time, it does have some problems.
    One of these problems are headless definites (such as the highest in the southern region).
    A second problem are definites whose head is not represented in the Treebank as an atom at the determiner level (such as, INP,The,[NP,ENP,20001,INP,tax1i1).
    Corpus 1, for example, contains 17 definite descriptions with these problems (0.2%).
    A third problem We found that different recall/precision trade-offs can be achieved depending on the choice of potential antecedents&#8212;i.e., depending on whether all NPs are considered as possible antecedents, or only indefinite NPs, or various other subsets&#8212;so we ran experiments to identify the best group of potential antecedents.
    Four different NP subsets were considered: The results ob
