erances and centering.
    Both of them find a correspondence between the Cb and the theme or the topic of an utterance.
    They refrain, however, from establishing a strong link between the information structure and centering as we suggest in our model, one that mirrors the influence of information structure in the way the forward-looking centers are actually ranked.
    Grosz, Joshi, and Weinstein (1995) admit that several factors may have an influence on the ranking of the Cf but limit their exposition to the exploitation of grammatical roles only.
    We diverge from this proposal and claim that, at least for languages with relatively free word order (such as German), the functional information structure of the utterance is crucial for the ranking of discourse entities in the Cf list.
    Originally, in Strube and Hahn (1996), we defined the Cf ranking criteria in terms of contextboundedness.
    In this paper, we redefine the functional Cf ranking criteria by making reference to Prince's work on the ass
