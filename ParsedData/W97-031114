    Now, i'(x) and i'(y), can be estimated under Assumption 2 When x occurs without y in its context, it will be linked to the same target words by the trial translation model as by the base translation model, and likewise for y without x. Estimating ii(xy) is more difficult because it requires knowledge of the entire translational distributions of both x and y, conditioned on all the contexts of x and y.
    Since we wish to consider hundreds of candidate NCCs simultaneously, and contexts from many megabytes of text, all this information would not fit on disk, let alone in memory.
    The best we can do is approximate with lower-order distributions that are easier to compute.
    The approximation begins with Assumption 3 implies that for all t E T Pr(xy, t) = Pr(x : RC = y, t) Pr(y : LC = x, t) (8) The approximation continues with Under Assumptions 3 and 4, we can estimate i'(xy) as shown in Figure 2.
    The final form of Equation 5 (in Figure 2) allows us to partition all the terms in Equation 4 into two
