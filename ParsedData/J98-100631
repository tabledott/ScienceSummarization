    The WordNet on-line lexical database (Miller 1990, 1995) has been developed at Princeton University over the past 10 years.'
    Like a standard dictionary, WordNet contains the definitions of words.
    It differs from a standard dictionary in that, instead of being organized alphabetically, WordNet is organized conceptually.
    The basic unit in WordNet is a synonym set, or synset, which represents a lexicalized concept.
    For example, WordNet Version 1.5 distinguishes between two senses of the noun shot with the synsets {shot, snapshot} and {shot, injection}.
    In the context, &amp;quot;The photographer took a shot of Mary,&amp;quot; the word snapshot can be substituted for one sense of shot.
    In the context, &amp;quot;The nurse gave Mary a flu shot,&amp;quot; the word injection can be substituted for another sense of shot.
