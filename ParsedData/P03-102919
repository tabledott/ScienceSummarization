ut generalizing case marking for nominalized predicates, the Predicate-Argument model excludes some highly contributing patterns with nominalized predicates, as some example patterns show in Figure 4.
    Also, chains of modifiers could be extracted only by the Subtree and Chain models.
    A typical and highly relevant expression for the Succession scenario is (((daihyo-ken-SBJ) aru-REL) CPOST ) &#8220; C-POST with ministerial authority&#8221;.
    Although, in the Arrest scenario, the superiority of the Subtree model to the other models is not clear, the general discussion about the capability of capturing additional context still holds.
    In Figure 4, the short pattern (( C-PERSON C-POST -APPOS) CNUM ), which is used for a general description of a person with his/her occupation and age, has relatively low precision (71%).
    However, with more relevant context, such as &#8220;arrest&#8221; or &#8220;unemployed&#8221;, the patterns become more relevant to Arrest scenario.
