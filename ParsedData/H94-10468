 most-frequent heuristic was defined as follows: on encounter- ing a noun, verb, adjective, or adverb in the test material, ook it up in WordNet.
  If the word is monosamous, assign that sense to it.
  If the syntactically tagged word (word/pos) has more than one sense in WordNet, consult the semantic concordance to determine which sense occurred most often in that corpus and assign that sense to it; if there is a fie, select one of the equally frequent senses at random.
  If the word is polysemous but does not occur in the semantic con- cordance, choose a sense at random with a probability of 1/rh where n is the number of different senses of that word in WordNet.
  In short, when there are dam indicating the most frequent sense of a polyseanous word, use it; otherwise, guess.
