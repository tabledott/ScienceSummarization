e on the number of support vectors, which tend to grow with the size of the training set.
    Thus, for any given algorithm, there is a strong tendency that parsing times for different languages follow the same order as training set sizes.
    The notable exceptions are Arabic, Turkish, and Chinese, which have higher parsing times than expected (relative to other languages), and Japanese, where parsing is surprisingly fast.
    Because these deviations are the same for all algorithms, it seems likely that they are related to specific properties of these data sets.
    It is also worth noting that for Arabic and Japanese the deviations are consistent across learning and parsing (slower than expected for Arabic, faster than expected for Japanese), whereas for Chinese there is no consistent trend (faster than expected in learning, slower than expected in parsing).
    Comparing algorithms, we see that the non-projective list-based algorithm is slower than the strictly projective stack-based algorithms, which can
