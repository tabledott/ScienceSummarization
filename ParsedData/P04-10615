    CTB10 is the sentences of the same length from the Penn Chinese treebank (v3).
    NEGRA10 is the same, for the German NEGRA corpus, based on the supplied conversion of the NEGRA corpus into Penn treebank format.
    In most of the present experiments, the provided partsof-speech were used as the input alphabet, though we also present limited experimentation with synthetic parts-of-speech.
    It is important to note that the Penn treebanks do not include dependency annotations; however, the automatic dependency rules from (Collins, 1999) are sufficiently accurate to be a good benchmark for unsupervised systems for the time being (though see below for specific issues).
    Similar head-finding rules were used for Chinese experiments.
    The NEGRA corpus, however, does supply hand-annotated dependency structures. structures which specify orders of attachment among multiple dependents which share a common head.
    Where possible, we report an accuracy figure for both directed and undir
