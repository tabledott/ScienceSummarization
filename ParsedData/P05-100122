ext, we report syntactic chunking performance on the CoNLL&#8217;00 shared-task5 corpus.
    The training and test data sets consist of the Wall Street Journal corpus (WSJ) sections 15&#8211;18 (212K words) and section 20, respectively.
    They are annotated with eleven types of syntactic chunks such as noun phrases.
    We uni- and bi-grams of words and POS in a 5-token window. word-POS bi-grams in a 3-token window.
    POS tri-grams on the left and right. labels of the two words on the left and their bi-grams. bi-grams of the current word and two labels on the left. use the WSJ articles in 1991 (15 million words) from the TREC corpus as the unlabeled data.
    Our feature representation is a slight modification of a simpler configuration (without linguistic features) in (Zhang et al., 2002), as shown in Figure 6.
    We use the POS information provided by the organizer.
    The types of auxiliary problems are the same as in the named entity experiments.
    For word predictions, we exclude instances of pun
