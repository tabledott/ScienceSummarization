s of boundary are used.
    For example, using a threshold of seven subjects yields the set of consensus boundaries, as defined in Hirschberg and Nakatani (1996).
    Comparison with Table 9 shows that for T = 5, &amp;quot;Learning 1&amp;quot; rather than &amp;quot;Learning 2&amp;quot; is the better performer.
    However, the more interesting result is that for T = 6 and T = 7, the learning approach has an important limitation with respect to the boundary classification task.
    In particular, the way in which C4.5 minimizes error rate is not an effective strategy when the distribution of the classes is highly skewed.
    For both T = 6 and T = 7, extremely few of the 1004 training examples are classified as boundary (40 and 19 examples, respectively).
    C4.5 minimizes the error rate by always predicting nonboundary.
    For example, for T = 6, because only 4% of the training examples are boundaries, C4.5 achieves an error rate of 4% by always predicting nonboundary.
    However, this low error rate is ac
