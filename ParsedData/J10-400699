    The retrieved snippets are manually classified by the SEMEVAL organizers as positive or negative instances of a certain relation (see the earlier Cause&#8211;Effect examples).
    About 50% training and test cases are positive instances.
    In our experiments we do not make use of the contexts of the target word pairs that are provided with the test set.
