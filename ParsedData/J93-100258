 approach to semi-automatic parsing we have been able to demonstrate that the correct analysis is among this set.
    Furthermore, a probabilistic parser such as the one described later may well be able to compute this analysis in a tractable fashion by extracting it from the parse forest.
    (To date, the largest example for which we have been able to compute all analyses had approximately 2500).
    The parse histories resulting from semi-automatic parsing are automatically stored and can be used to derive the probabilistic information that will guide the parser after training.
    We return to a discussion of the manner in which this information is utilized in Section 7.
  
  
    As well as building an interactive parsing system incorporating the ANLT grammar (described above), we have implemented a breadth-first, nondeterministic LR parser for unification grammars.
    This parser is integrated with the Grammar Development Environment (GDE; Carroll et al. 1988) in the ANLT system, and provided as an alt
