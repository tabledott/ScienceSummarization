y of syntactic configurations in different languages (e.g. in the case of English, compound nouns: post office, verbal idioms: pull strings, verb-particle constructions: push on, etc.).
    Decomposability is a description of the degree to which the semantics of an MWE can be ascribed to those of its parts (Riehemann, 2001; Sag et al., 2002).
    Analysis of the semantic correlation between the constituent parts and whole of an MWE is perhaps more commonly discussed under the banner of compositionality (Nunberg et al., 1994; Lin, 1999).
    Our claim here is that the semantics of the MWE are deconstructed and the parts coerced into often idiosyncratic interpretations to attain semantic alignment, rather than the other way around.
    One idiom which illustrates this process is spill the beans, where the semantics of reveal'(secret') are decomposed such that spill is coerced into the idiosyncratic interpretation of reveal' and beans into the idiosyncratic interpretation of secret'.
    Given that these senses
