phrases and their contribution to automatic evaluation.
    We analyze how the substitution frequency and the accuracy of those substitutions contributes to a method&#8217;s performance.
    We compute the substitution frequency of an automatic paraphrasing method by counting the number of words it rewrites in a set of reference sentences.
    Table 6 shows the substitution frequency and the corresponding BLEU score.
    The substitution frequency varies greatly across different methods &#8212; LSA is by far the most prolific rewriter, while Brown produces very few substitutions.
    As expected, the more paraphrases identified, the higher the BLEU score for the method.
    However, this increase does well as the Kappa coefficient of agreement. not translate into better evaluation performance.
    For instance, our contextual filtering method removes approximately a quarter of the paraphrases suggested by WordNet and yields a better evaluation measure.
    These results suggest that the substitution frequency
