	Lexical Semantic Relatedness with Random Graph Walks
		Many systems for tasks such as question answering, multi-document summarization, and infor mation retrieval need robust numerical measures of lexical relatedness.
		Standard thesaurus-based measures of word pair similarity are based on only a single path between those words in the thesaurus graph.
		By contrast, we propose a newmodel of lexical semantic relatedness that incorporates information from every explicit or implicit path connecting the two words in the en tire graph.
		Our model uses a random walk over nodes and edges derived from WordNet links and corpus statistics.
		We treat the graph as aMarkov chain and compute a word-specific sta tionary distribution via a generalized PageRank algorithm.
		Semantic relatedness of a word pair is scored by a novel divergence measure, ZKL, that outperforms existing measures on certain classes of distributions.
		In our experiments, the resultingrelatedness measure is the WordNet-based measure most highly co
