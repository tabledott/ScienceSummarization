t a path through a network generated around a-best from a system with a zero weight will not be chosen.
    The prior probabilities are estimated by viewing the negative average TER scores between the skeleton and other hypotheses as log-probabilities.
    These log-probabilities are scaled so that the priors sum to one.
    There is a concern that the prior probabilities estimated this way may be inaccurate.
    Therefore, the priors may have to be smoothed by a tunable exponent.
    However, the optimization experiments showed that the best performance was obtained by having a smoothing factor of 1 which is equivalent to the original priors.
    Thus, no smoothing was used in the experiments presented later in this paper.
    An example joint network with the priors is shown in Figure 2.
    This example has three confusion networks with priors ,and .
    The total number of nodes in the network is represented by .
    Similar combination of multiple confusion networks was presented in (Matusov et al., 2006
