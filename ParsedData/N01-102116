ity seems as good a guide as any in the selection of a grammar formalism.
  
  
    Probabilistic context-free grammar (1) will help illustrate the way a phrase-structured language model The human sentence processing mechanism is metaphorically led up the garden path by the main verb reading, when, upon hearing &#8220;fell&#8221; it is forced to accept the alternative reduced relative reading shown in figure 2.
    The confusion between the main verb and the reduced relative readings, which is resolved upon hearing &#8220;fell&#8221; is the empirical phenomenon at issue.
    As the parse trees indicate, grammar (1) analyzes reduced relative clauses as a VP adjoined to an NP3.
    In one sample of parsed text4 such adjunctions are about 7 times less likely than simple NPs made up of a determiner followed by a noun.
    The probabilities of the other crucial rules are likewise estimated by their relative frequencies in the sample.
    This simple grammar exhibits the essential character of the explanation: gard
