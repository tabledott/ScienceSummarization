n a PoS tagger.
    These two different approaches mean that the length of the potential terms is not limited to something arbitrary, but reflects a linguistic property.
    The solution to limiting the number of terms&#8212;as the majority of the extracted words or phrases are not keywords&#8212;was to apply a machine learning algorithm to decide which terms are keywords and which are not.
    The output from the machine learning algorithm is binary (a term is either a keyword or not), consequently the system itself limits the amount of extracted keywords per document.
    As for the features, a fourth feature was added to the ones used by Frank et al., namely the POS tag(s) assigned to the term.
    This feature turned out to dramatically improve the results.
