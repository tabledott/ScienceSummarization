ections (Brown and Yule 1983), but this is only a gross division; subtopics evolve inside sections, often in unified groups of several paragraphs.
    Automatic segmentation of texts into such units would obviously be helpful for WSD methods that use topical context.
    It has been noted that the repetition of words within successive segments or sentences is a strong indicator of the structure of discourse (Skorochod'ko 1972; Morris 1988; Morris and Hirst 1991); methods exploiting this observation to segment a text into subtopics are beginning to emerge (see, for example, Hearst [1994], van der Eijk [1994], Richmond, Smith, and Amitay [1997]).
    In this volume, Leacock, Chodorow, and Miller consider the role of microcontext vs. topical context and attempt to assess the contribution of each.
    Their results indicate that for a statistical classifier, microcontext is superior to topical context as an indicator of sense.
    However, although a distinction is made between microcontext and topical context in
