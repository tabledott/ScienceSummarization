  Combining Distributional And Morphological Information For Part Of Speech Induction
  
    In this paper we discuss algorithms for clustering words into classes from unlabelled text using unsupervised algorithms, based on distributional and morphological information.
    We show how the use of morphological information can improve the performance on rare words, and that this is robust across a wide range of languages.
  
  
    The task studied in this paper is the unsupervised learning of parts-of-speech, that is to say lexical categories corresponding to traditional notions of, for example, nouns and verbs.
    As is often the case in machine learning of natural language, there are two parallel motivations: first a simple engineering one &#8212; the induction of these categories can help in smoothing and generalising other models, particularly in language modelling for speech recognition as explored by (Ney et al., 1994) and secondly a cognitive science motivation &#8212; exploring how evidence in the pr
