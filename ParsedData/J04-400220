 examples of alignment templates.
    The alignment A&#732; is represented as a matrix with J' &#183; (I' + 1) binary elements.
    A matrix element with value 1 means that the words at the corresponding positions are aligned, and the value 0 means that the words are not aligned.
    If a source word is not aligned with a target word, then it is aligned with the empty word e0, which is at the imaginary position i = 0.
    The classes used in FJy1 and EI&#65533;1 are automatically trained bilingual classes using the method described in Och (1999) and constitute a partition of the vocabulary of source and target language.
    In general, we are not limited to disjoint classes as long as each specific instance of a word is disambiguated, that is, uniquely belongs to a specific class.
    In the following, we use the class function C to map words to their classes.
    Hence, it would be possible to employ parts-of-speech or semantic categories instead of the automatically trained word classes used here.
