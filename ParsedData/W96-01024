mory-based approach computationally attractive.
  
  
    Memory-based Learning is a form of supervised, inductive learning from examples.
    Examples are represented as a vector of feature values with an associated category label.
    During training, a set of examples (the training set) is presented in an incremental fashion to the classifier, and added to memory.
    During testing, a set of previously unseen feature-value patterns (the test set) is presented to the system.
    For each test pattern, its distance to all examples in memory is computed, and the category of the least distant instance(s) is used as the predicted category for the test pattern.
    The approach is based on the assumption that reasoning is based on direct reuse of stored experiences rather than on the application of knowledge (such as rules or decision trees) abstracted from experience.
    In AT, the concept has appeared in several disciplines (from computer vision to robotics), using terminology such as similarity-based, examp
