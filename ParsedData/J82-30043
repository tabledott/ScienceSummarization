    Until such time, the processor can do little more than note that the input sentence is &amp;quot;every way ambiguous.&amp;quot; We suggested that a table lookup scheme might be an effective method to implement such a processor.
    We then introduced rules for combining primitive grammars, such as Catalan grammars,
