ws: The dimensionality is the number of possible combinations of feature values and thus the size of the feature space.
    These values vary since the number of possible values for M varies with the part&#8212;of&#8212;speech of the ambiguous word.
    The lower number is associated with adjectives and the higher with verbs.
    To get a feeling for the adequacy of these feature sets, we performed supervised learning experiments with the interest data using the Naive Bayes model.
    We disambiguated 3 senses using a 10:1 training&#8212;to&#8212; test ratio.
    The average accuracies for each feature set over 100 random trials were as follows: A 80.9%, B 87.7%, and C 82.7%.
    The window size, the number of values for the POS features, and the number of words considered in the collocation features are kept deliberately small in order to control the dimensionality of the problem.
    In future work, we will expand all of the above types of features and employ techniques to reduce dimensionality along the li
