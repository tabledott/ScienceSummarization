 For each point p = (x, y), let X be the number of points in column x within the search rectangle, and let Y be the number of points in row y within the search rectangle.
    The ambiguity level of p is defined as X + Y &#8212; 2.
    In particular, if p is the only point in its row and in its column, then its ambiguity level is zero.
    The chain recognition heuristic ignores SIMR's noise filter makes an important contribution to the signal-to-noise ratio in the bitext space.
    Even if one chain of false points of correspondence slips by the chain recognition heuristic, the expanding rectangle is likely to find its way back to the TBM trace before the chain recognition heuristic accepts another chain. points whose ambiguity level is too high.
    What makes this a localized filter is that only points within the search rectangle count toward each other's ambiguity level.
    The ambiguity level of a given point can change when the search rectangle expands or moves.
    The noise filter ensures that false p
