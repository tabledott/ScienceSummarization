al comparison of the two analysis models.
    In Lauer (1994), the degree of acceptability is again provided by statistical measures over a corpus.
    The metric used is a mutual information-like measure based on probabilities of modification relationships.
    This is derived from the idea that parse trees capture the structure of semantic relationships within a noun compound.'
    The dependency model attempts to choose a parse which makes the resulting relationships as acceptable as possible.
    For example, when backup compiler disk is encountered, the analysis will be: I claim that the dependency model makes more intuitive sense for the following reason.
    Consider the compound calcium ion exchange, which is typically left-branching (that is, the first two words are bracketed together).
    There does not seem to be any reason why calcium ion should be any more frequent than ion exchange.
    Both are plausible compounds and regardless of the bracketing, ions are the object of an exchange.
