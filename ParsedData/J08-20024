    If we consider the linguistic basis for joint modeling of a verb&#8217;s arguments (including modifiers), there are at least three types of information to be captured.
    The most basic is to limit occurrences of each kind of argument.
    For instance, there is usually at most one argument of a verb that is an ARG0 (agent), and although some modifier roles such as ARGM-TMP can fairly easily be repeated, others such as ARGM-MNR also generally occur at most once.1 The remaining two types of information apply mainly to core arguments (the strongly selected arguments of a verb: ARG0&#8211;ARG5 in Propbank), which in most linguistic theories are modeled as belonging together in an argument frame (set of arguments).
    The information is only marginally useful for adjuncts (the ARGM arguments of Propbank), which are usually treated as independent realizational choices not included in the argument frame of a verb.
    Firstly, many verbs take a number of different argument frames.
