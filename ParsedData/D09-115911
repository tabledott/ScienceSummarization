ased on it, all NPs and VPs are selected as candidate product features.
    While prepositional phrases (PPs) and adjectival phrases (ADJPs) are excluded.
    Although it can cover nearly all the true product features, the precision is relatively low.
    The large amount of noise candidates may confuse the relation extraction classifier.
    To shrink the size of candidate set, we introduce language model by an intuition that the more likely a phrase to be a product feature, the more closely it related to the product review.
    In practice, for a certain domain of product reviews, a language model is build on easily acquired unlabeled data.
    Each candidate NP or VP chunk in the output of shallow parser is scored by the model, and cut off if its score is less than a threshold.
    Opinion expressions are spans of text that express a comment or attitude of the opinion holder, which are usually evaluative or subjective phrases.
    We also analyze the labeled corpus for opinion expressions and observe that
