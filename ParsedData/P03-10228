with each compatible1 NP-markable preceding2 it in the list.
    The resulting pairs were labelled P if both markables had the same (non-empty) value in their member attribute, N otherwise.
    For anaphors with non-NP-antecedents, additional training and test data instances had to be generated.
    This process was triggered by the markable at the current position being it or that.
    In that case, a small set of potential non-NP-antecedents was generated by selecting S- and VP-markables from the last two valid sentences preceding the potential anaphor.
    The choice of the last two sentences was motivated pragmatically by considerations to keep the search space (and the number of instances) small.
    A sentence was considered valid if it was neither unfinished nor a backchannel utterance (like e.g.
    &#8221;Uh-huh&#8221;, &#8221;Yeah&#8221;, etc.).
    From the selected markables, inaccessible non-NP-expressions were automatically removed.
    We considered an expression inaccessible if it ended before
