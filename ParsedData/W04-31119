nts provides us with an evoked entity representing the specific instance of a gene.
    Variation Events as Relations Variations comprise a relationship between the following entities: Type (e.g. point mutation, translocation, or inversion), Location (e.g. codon 14, 1p36.1, or base pair 278), Original-State (e.g.
    Alanine), and Altered-State (e.g.
    Thymine).
    These four components represent the key elements necessary to describe any genomic variation event.
    Variations are often underspecified in the literature, frequently having only two or three of these specifications.
    Characterizing individual variations as a relation among such components provides us with a great deal of flexibility: 1) it allows us to capture the complete variation event even when specific components are broadly spaced in the text, often spanning multiple sentences or even paragraphs; 2) it provides us with a convenient means of tracking anaphora between detailed descriptions (e.g. a point mutation at codon 14 and summar
