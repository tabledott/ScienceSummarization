    We do not detect entailment with lexicosyntactic patterns.
    In fact, we propose that whether the entailment relation holds between V1 and V2 depends on the absence of another verb V1' in the same relationship with V2.
    For example, given the relation marry happens-before divorce, we can conclude that divorce entails marry.
    But, given the relation buy happens-before sell, we cannot conclude entailment since manufacture can also happen before sell.
    This also applies to the enablement and strength relations.
    Corpus-based methods, including ours, hold the promise of wide coverage but are weak on discriminating senses.
    While we hope that applications will benefit from this resource as is, an interesting next step would be to augment it with sense information.
  
  
    There are several ways to improve the accuracy of the current algorithm and to detect relations between low frequency verb pairs.
    One avenue would be to automatically learn or manually craft more patterns and t
