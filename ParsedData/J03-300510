one of the 30 adjectives.
    Examples of the syntactic patterns the parser identified are given in Table 1.
    In the case of adjectives modifying compound nouns, only sequences of two nouns were included, and the rightmost-occurring noun was considered the head.
    Bigrams involving proper nouns or low-frequency nouns (less than 10 per million words) were discarded.
    This was necessary because the bigrams were used in experiments involving native speakers (see Section 3.2), and we wanted to reduce the risk of including words unfamiliar to the experimental subjects.
    For each adjective, the set of bigrams was divided into three frequency bands based on an equal division of the range of log-transformed co-occurrence frequencies.
    Then one bigram was chosen at random from each band.
    This procedure ensures that the whole range of frequencies is represented in our sample.
    Lapata, Keller, and McDonald (2001) compiled a set of 90 unseen adjective-noun bigrams using the same 30 adjectives.
