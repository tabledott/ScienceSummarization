te accuracy drops when converting from Pinyin to Chinese characters, due to homophone confusion.
    Unlike Japanese katakana or Korean alphabet, Chinese characters are more ideographic than phonetic.
    To arrive at an appropriate Chinese transliteration, one cannot rely solely on the intermediate phonemic representation.
    To illustrate the importance of contextual information in transliteration, let&#8217;s take name /Minahan/ as an example, the correct segmentation should be /Mi-na-han/, to be transliterated as &#31859;&#32435;-&#27721; (Pinyin: Mi-Na-Han).
    According to the transliteration guidelines, a wise segmentation can be reached only after exploring the combination of the left and right context of transliteration units.
    From the computational point of view, this strongly suggests using a contextual n-gram as the knowledge base for the alignment decision.
    Another example will show us how one-to-many mappings could be resolved by context.
    Let&#8217;s take another name /Smith/ as an
