paraphrasing is an important problem extending beyond that of paraphrasing smaller lexical units.
    Our work presents a novel knowledge-lean algorithm that uses multiple-sequence alignment (MSA) to learn to generate sentence-level paraphrases essentially from unannotated corpus data alone.
    In contrast to previous work using MSA for generation (Barzilay and Lee, several versions of their component sentences.
    This could, for example, aid machine-translation evaluation, where it has become common to evaluate systems by comparing their output against a bank of several reference translations for the same sentences (Papineni et al., 2002).
    See Bangalore et al. (2002) and Barzilay and Lee (2002) for other uses of such data.
    2002), we need neither parallel data nor explicit information about sentence semantics.
    Rather, we use two comparable corpora, in our case, collections of articles produced by two different newswire agencies about the same events.
    The use of related corpora is key: we ca
