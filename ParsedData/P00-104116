s that were counted as wrong in the evaluation. traction (Hovy and Lin, 1997; Mittal et al., 1999).
    We trained a content selection model based on the position of the tokens in the training set in their respective documents.
    There are several models of positional salience that have been proposed for sentence selection; we used the simplest possible one: estimating the probability of a token appearing in the headline given that it appeared in the 1st, 2nd, 3rd or 4th quartile of the body of the article.
    We then tested mixtures of the lexical and POS models, lexical and positional models, and all three models combined together.
    Sample output for the article in Figure 3, using both lexical and POS/positional information can be seen in Figure 4.
    As can be seen in Table 2,7 Although adding the POS information alone does not seem to provide any benefit, positional information does.
    When used in combination, each of the additional information sources seems to improve the overall model of summa
