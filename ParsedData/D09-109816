f S is computed by building a feature vector consisting of a weighted average of the features of its seed elements s1, s2, ..., sk, a centroid.
    For example, given the seed elements {Volvic, San Pellegrino, Gerolsteiner Brunnen, Bling H2O}, the resulting centroid consists of (details of the feature extraction protocol are in Section 6.1): brand, mineral water, monitor, lake, water, take over, ... Centroids are represented in the same space as terms allowing us to compute the similarity between centroids and all terms in our corpus.
    A scored and ranked set for expansion is ultimately generated by sorting all terms according to their similarity to the seed set centroid, and applying a cutoff on either the similarity score or on the total number of retrieved terms.
    In our reported experiments, we expanded over 22,000 seed sets using our Web similarity model from Section 3.
  
  
    In this section, we describe our methodology for evaluating Web-scale set expansion.
