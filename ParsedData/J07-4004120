g the head annotation in the lexical categories which apply to relative pronouns.
    In summary, considerable changes were required to the markedup file in order to bring the dependency annotations of CCGbank and DepBank closer together.
    The major types of changes have been described here, but not all the details.
    Despite the considerable changes made to the parser output described in the previous section, there were still significant differences between the GRs created from the CCG dependencies and the DepBank GRs.
    To obtain some idea of whether the schemes were converging, we performed the following oracle experiment.
    We took the CCG derivations from CCGbank corresponding to the sentences in DepBank, and ran the parser over the gold-standard derivations, outputting the newly created GRs.9 Treating the DepBank GRs as a gold standard, and comparing these with the CCGbank GRs, gave precision and recall scores of only 76.23% and 79.56%, respectively.
    Thus given the current mapping, the perf
