 cannot predict the utility value of the paraphrasing method.
    Accuracy measures the correctness of the proposed substitutions in the context of a reference sentence.
    To evaluate the accuracy of different paraphrasing methods, we randomly extracted 200 paraphrasing examples from each method.
    A paraphrase example consists of a reference sentence, a reference word to be paraphrased and a proposed paraphrase of that reference (that actually occurred in a corresponding system translation).
    The judge was instructed to mark a substitution as correct only if the substitution was both semantically and grammatically correct in the context of the original reference sentence.
    Paraphrases produced by the four methods were judged by two native English speakers.
    The pairs were presented in random order, and the judges were not told which system produced a given pair.
    We employ a commonly used measure, Kappa, to assess agreement between the judges.
    We found that on all the four sets the Kappa
