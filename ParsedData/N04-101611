 a determiner, and the object (see Section 2).
    Table 3 compares the web-based models against the BNC models.
    For both the high ambiguity and the low ambiguity data set, we find that the performance of the best Altavista model is not significantly different from that of the best BNC model.
    Table 4 compares our simple, unsupervised methods with the two sophisticated class-based models discussed above.
    The results show that there is no significant difference in performance between the best model reported in the literature and the best Altavista or the best BNC model.
    However, both models significantly outperform the baseline.
    This holds for both the high and low ambiguity data sets.
  
  
    Context-sensitive spelling correction is the task of correcting spelling errors that result in valid words.
    Such a spelling error is illustrated in (4) where principal was typed when principle was intended.
    (2) Introduction of the dialogue principal proved strikingly effective.
