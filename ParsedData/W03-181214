 giving a vector for the string test we were able to build separate vectors for the nouns, verbs and adjectives test.
    This combination of technologies was also used to good effect by Widdows (2003): an example of the contribution of part-of-speech information to extracting semantic neighbours of the word fire is shown in Table 1.
    As can be seen, the noun fire (as in the substance/element) and the verb fire (mainly used to mean firing some sort of weapon) are related to quite different areas of meaning.
    Building a single vector for the string fire confuses this distinction &#8212; the neighbours offire treated just as a string include words related to both the meaning offire as a noun (more frequent in the BNC) and as a verb.
    The appropriate granularity of syntactic classifications is an open question for this kind of research: treating all the possible verbs categories as different (e.g. distinguishing infinitive from finite from gerund forms) led to data sparseness, and instead we considered
