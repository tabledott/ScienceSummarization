rce phrase and alignment that lead to non-syntactifiable phrase pairs.
    The rewriting process adds new rules to those that can be created under the SPMT model 1 constraints.
    The process creates one xRS rule that is headed by a pseudo, non-syntactic nonterminal symbol that subsumes the target phrase and corresponding multi-headed syntactic structure; and one sibling xRS rule that explains how the non-syntactic nonterminal symbol can be combined with other genuine nonterminals in order to obtain genuine parse trees.
    In this view, the foreign/source phrase THE MUTUAL and corresponding alignment in Figure 3 licenses the rules *NPB* NN(DT(the) JJ(mutual)) --+ THE MUTUAL and NPB(*NPB* NN:x0 NN:x1) --+ x0 x1 even though the foreign word UNDERSTANDING is aligned to an English word outside the NPB consituent.
    The name of the non-syntactic nonterminal reflects the intuition that the English phrase &#8220;the mutual&#8221; corresponds to a partially realized NPB that needs an NN to its right in order to b
