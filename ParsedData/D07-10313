tagging model.
			However, bitag models are rich enough to capture at least some distributional information (i.e., the tag 296for a word depends on the tags assigned to its neighbours).
			Moreover, more complex models add addi tional complicating factors that interact in ways stillpoorly understood; for example, smoothing is gen erally regarded as essential for higher-order HMMs,yet it is not clear how to integrate smoothing into un supervised estimation procedures (Goodman, 2001; Wang and Schuurmans, 2005).
			Most previous work exploiting unsupervised training data for inferring POS tagging models has focused on semi-supervised methods in the in which the learner is provided with a lexicon specifying the possible tags for each word (Merialdo, 1994; Smith and Eisner, 2005; Goldwater and Griffiths, 2007) or a small number of ?prototypes?
			for each POS(Haghighi and Klein, 2006).
			In the context of semi supervised learning using a tag lexicon, Wang and Schuurmans (2005) observe discrepencies between the em
