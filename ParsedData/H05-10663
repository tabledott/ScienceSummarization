			A non-projective example from the Czech Prague Dependency Treebank (Hajic?
			et al, 2001) is also shown in Figure 2.
			Most previous dependency parsing models have focused on projective trees, including the work of Eisner (1996), Collins et al (1999), Yamada and Matsumoto (2003), Nivre and Scholz (2004), and McDonald et al (2005).
			These systems have shown that accurate projective dependency parsers can be automatically learned from parsed data.
			However, non-projective analyses have recently attracted some interest, not only for languages with freer word order but also for English.
			In particular, Wang and Harper (2004) describe a broad coverage non-projectiveparser for English based on a hand-constructed constraint dependency grammar rich in lexical and synt
