 then we could establish the identity.
    But of course we don't have such an axiom, for it isn't true.
    There are lots of other kinds of fluids.
    There would seem to be no way to use superset information in our scheme.
    Fortunately, however, there is a way.
    We can make use of this information by converting the axiom into a biconditional.
    In general, axioms of the form species D genus can be converted into a biconditional axiom of the form genus A differentiae a species 7To prime this intuition, imagine two doors.
    Behind one is a car.
    Behind the other is something with no top.
    You pick a door.
    If there's a convertible behind it, you get to keep it.
    Which door would you pick?
    Often, of course, as in the above example, we will not be able to prove the differentiae, and in many cases the differentiae can not even be spelled out.
    But in our al,ductive scheme, this does not matter.
    They can simply be assumed.
    In fact, we need not state them explicitly.
    We c
