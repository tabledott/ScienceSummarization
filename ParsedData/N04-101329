eech tag to the appropriate one (usually NNP) if necessary.
    (The number of words indicated at the beginning of the input string was also reduced accordingly.)
    An example is shown in (1).
    After parsing, the underscores were converted to spaces to match the PARC 700 predicates.
    Before the final evaluation, 1/5 of the PARC 700 dependency bank was randomly extracted as a heldout set.
    This set was used to adjust the performance parameters of the XLE system and the Collins parser so as to optimize parsing speed without losing accuracy.
    For example, the limit on the length of medial phrases was set to 20 words for the XLE system (see Sec.
    2), and a regularizer penalty of 10 was found optimal for the Bl prior used in stochastic disambiguation.
    For the Collins parser, a beam size of 1000 was found to improve speed considerably at little cost in accuracy.
    Furthermore, the np-bracketing flag (npbflag) was set to 0 to produce an extended set of NP levels for improved argument/adjunct d
