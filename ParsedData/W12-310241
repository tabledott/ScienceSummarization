    Each team was allowed up to two submissions (for each subtask).
    In the descriptions below participation in the ranking is denoted (R) and scoring is denoted (S).
    Baseline system (R, S): the baseline system used the feature extraction software (also provided to all participants).
    It analyzed the source and translation files and the SMT training corpus to extract the following 17 system-independent features that were found to be relevant in previous work (Specia et al., 2009): These features are used to train a Support Vector Machine (SVM) regression algorithm using a radial basis function kernel with the LIBSVM package (Chang and Lin, 2011).
    They, E and C parameters were optimized using a grid-search and 5-fold cross validation on the training set.
    We note that although the system is referred to as a &#8220;baseline&#8221;, it is in fact a strong system.
    Although it is simple it has proved to be robust across a range of language pairs, MT systems, and text domains.
    It is a sim
