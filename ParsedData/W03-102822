 (for three documents) with the median 16, and 29 to 0 (for four documents) with the median value being 9 terms.
    Extracting the terms with the chunking approach meant that slightly more than half of the keywords actually present in the test set were lost, and compared to the n-gram approach the number of correct terms assigned was almost halved.
    The number of incorrect keywords, however, decreased considerably.
    But, the difference is shown when the POS tag feature is included: the number of correctly assigned terms is more or less the same for this approach with or without the tag feature, while the number of incorrect terms is halved.
    When extracting the terms according to the stemmed pattern approach, the test data consisted of 33 507 examples.
    Of these were 3 340 positive, and 30 167 negative.
    In total, 12.5% of the present keywords were lost.
    The F-scores (F ) for the two runs, displayed in Table 2, are 25.6 (without the tag feature) and 28.1 (with the tag feature).
