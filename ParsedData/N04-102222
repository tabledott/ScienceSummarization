or statistical machine translation.
    It is a simple model rescoring framework that improves well-trained statistical models For each metric, the performance under a matched condition is shown in bold.
    Note that better results correspond to higher BLEU scores and to lower error rates. by tuning them for particular criteria.
    These criteria could come from evaluation metrics or from other desiderata (such as syntactic well-formedness) that we wish to see in automatic translations.
  
  
    This work was performed as part of the 2003 Johns Hopkins Summer Workshop research group on Syntax for Statistical Machine Translation.
    We would like to thank all the group members for providing various resources and tools and contributing to useful discussions during the course of the workshop.
