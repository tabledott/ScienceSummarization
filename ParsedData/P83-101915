 of naturally occurring errors are not part of this system, for example, phonological and semantic errors.
    It is reasonable to hope that much of this dreck will be handled by similar subsystems.
    Of course, there will always remain errors that are outside of any system.
    But we expect that the apparent chaos is much more regular than it at first appears and that it can be modeled by the interaction of components that are themselves simple.
    In the following discussion, I use the terms self. correction and editing more or less interchangeably, though the two terms emphasize the generation and interpretation aspects of the same process.
  
  
    The editing system that I will describe is implemented on top of a deterministic parser, called Fidditch. based on the processing principles proposed by Marcus (1980).
    It takes as input a sentence of standard words and returns a labeled bracketing that represents the syntactic structure as an annotated tree structure.
    Fidditch was 'designed to proc
