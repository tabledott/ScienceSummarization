 counterexamples to show that no finite number of conditions of the form BsWA(BsWA(...(KNOW(S,P))) is sufficient either.
    The solution he proposes is that the recognition of intention must be mutually believed between the speaker and the hearer.
    Cohen and Levesque [1980] and Allen [forthcoming] show how the speech act definitions given here can be extended in this direction.
    We have only considered acts to request and inform because many of their interesting properties can be based on belief and want.
    At least primitive accounts of the logics of these propositional attitudes are available.
    Clearly there is room for much work here.
    Extending the analysis to other speech acts, such as promises, will require a study of other underlying logics such as that of obligation.
    There also remain many problems with the formalization of actions.
    We believe this work shows that the concepts of preconditions, effects, and action bodies are fruitful in discussing plan recognition.
