ting trick can be applied to infer monolingual hierarchical paraphrase pairs (or paraphrastic patterns).
    However, the patterns are not the final output and are actually used as rules from a monolingual SCFG grammar in order to define an English-to-English translation model.
    Features for each monolingual rule are estimated in terms of the features of the bilingual pairs that the rule was inferred from.
    A sentential paraphrase can then be generated for any given sentence by using this model along with an n-gram language model and a regular SMT decoder to paraphrase (or monolingually translate) any sentence just as one would translate bilingually.
    The primary advantage of this approach is the ability to produce good quality sentential paraphrases by leveraging the SMT machinery to address the noise issue.
    However, although the decoder and the language model do serve to counter the noisy word alignment process, they do so only to a degree and not entirely.
    Again, we must draw a connection
