    The most successful stochastic language models have been based on finite-state descriptions such as n-grams or hidden Markov models (HMMs) (Jelinek et al., 1992).
    However, finite-state models cannot represent the hierarchical structure of natural language and are thus ill-suited to tasks in which that structure is essential, such as language understanding or translation.
    It is then natural to consider stochastic versions of more pow
