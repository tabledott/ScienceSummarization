 material, automatic grammar induction seems like a path worth pursuing.
    A number of systems have been built that can be trained automatically to bracket text into syntactic constituents.
    In (MM90) mutual information statistics are extracted from a corpus of text and this information is then used to parse new text.
    (Sarn86) defines a function to score the quality of parse trees, and then uses simulated annealing to heuristically explore the entire space of possible parses for a given sentence.
    In (BM92a), distributional analysis techniques are applied to a large corpus to learn a context-free grammar.
    The most promising results to date have been 'Not in the traditional sense of the term. based on the inside-outside algorithm, which can be used to train stochastic context-free grammars.
    The inside-outside algorithm is an extension of the finite-state based Hidden Markov Model (by (Bak79)), which has been applied successfully in many areas, including speech recognition and part of speech
