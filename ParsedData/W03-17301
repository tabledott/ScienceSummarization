    ICT (Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences) participated the First International Chinese Word Segmentation Bakeoff.
    We have taken six tracks: Academia Sinica closed (ASc), U. Penn Chinese Tree Bank open and closed(CTBo,c), Hong Kong CityU closed (HKc), Peking University open and closed(PKo,c).
    The structure of this document is as follows.
    The next section presents the HHMM-based framework of ICTCLAS.
    Next we detail the operation of six tracks.
    The following section provides evaluation result and gives further analysis.
    2 HHMM-based Chinese lexical analysis
  
  
    As illustrated in Figure 1, HHMM-based Chinese lexical analysis comprises five levels: atom segmentation, simple and recursive unknown words recognition, class-based segmentation and POS tagging.
    In the whole frame, class-based segmentation graph, which is a directed graph designed for word segmentation, is an essential intermediate data structure that links disambiguation, unknown words rec
