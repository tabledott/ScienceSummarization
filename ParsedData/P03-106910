ces V is equal to the set of sentences S and each edge u &#57735; v has a weight, the probability P(u|v).
    Cohen et al. (1999) show that the problem of finding an optimal ordering through a directed weighted graph is NP-complete.
    Fortunately, they propose a simple greedy algorithm that provides an approximate solution which can be easily modified for our task (see also Barzilay et al. 2002).
    The algorithm starts by assigning each vertex v &#57736; V a probability.
    Recall that in our case vertices are sentences and their probabilities can be calculated by taking the product of the probabilities of their features.
    The greedy algorithm then picks the node with the highest probability and orders it ahead of the other nodes.
    The selected node and its incident edges are deleted from the graph.
    Each remaining node is now assigned the conditional probability of seeing this node given the previously selected node (see (4)).
    The node which yields the highest conditional probability is sel
