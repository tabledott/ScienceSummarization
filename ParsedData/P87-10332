 In previous research [4,5] we have shown how descriptions of feature structures can be represented by a certain type of logical formula, and that the consistency problem for disjunctive descriptions is NP-complete.
    This result indicates, according to the widely accepted mathematical assumption that P NP, that any complete unification algorithm for disjunctive descriptions will require exponential time in the worst case.
    However, this result does not preclude algorithms with better average performance, such as the method described in the remainder of this paper.
    This method overcomes the shortcomings of previously existing methods, and has the following desirable properties:
  
  
    The most common unification methods for non-disjunctive feature structures use a directed graph (DG) representation, in which arcs are labeled by names of features, and nodes correspond to values of features.
    For an introduction to these methods, the reader is referred to Shieber's survey [11].
