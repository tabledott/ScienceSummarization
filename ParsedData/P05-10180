  Modeling Local Coherence: An Entity-Based Approach
  
    This paper considers the problem of automatic assessment of local coherence.
    We present a novel entity-based representation of discourse which is inspired by Centering Theory and can be computed automatically from raw text.
    We view coherence assessment as a ranking learning problem and show that the proposed discourse representation supports the effective learning of a ranking function.
    Our experiments demonstrate that the induced model achieves significantly higher accuracy than a state-of-the-art coherence model.
  
  
    A key requirement for any system that produces text is the coherence of its output.
    Not surprisingly, a variety of coherence theories have been developed over the years (e.g., Mann and Thomson, 1988; Grosz et al. 1995) and their principles have found application in many symbolic text generation systems (e.g., Scott and de Souza, 1990; Kibble and Power, 2004).
    The ability of these systems to generate high qual
