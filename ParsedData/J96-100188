, the translation produced by Champollion could be provided as a prompt giving the translator the opportunity to approve it.
    In such cases, it may be useful to provide the top several translations produced by Champollion allowing the translator to choose the best, as Dagan and Church do.
    Finally, Champollion could also be used for computer-assisted lexicography.
    Since its output includes the translation of 1 to n word phrases, Champollion could be used to automatically translate lexicons.
    While it could not translate sentences that are often used in dictionaries as examples, it could be used for translation of both individual words and phrases.
    In this way, a list of translated words could be produced automatically from a monolingual dictionary and filtered by a lexicographer.
  
  
    Champollion is one of the first attempts at translating lexical constructions using statistical techniques and our work has several limitations, which will be addressed in future work.
