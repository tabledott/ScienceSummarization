e source separately, we implemented a set of simple disambiguation algorithms, each of which uses the output from a single partial tagger.
    Each algorithm takes the result of its partial tagger and checks it against the disambiguated text to see if it is correct.
    If the partial tagger returns more than one sense, as do the simulated annealing, subject code and selectional preference taggers, the first sense is taken to break the tie.
    For the partial tagger based on Yarowsky's subject-code algorithm, we choose the sense with the highest saliency value.
    If more than one sense has been assigned the maximum value, the tie is again broken by choosing the first sense.
    Therefore, each partial tagger returns a single sense and the exact match metric is used to determine the proportion of tokens for which that tagger returns the correct sense.
    The part-of-speech filter is run before the partial taggers make their decision and so they only consider the set of senses it did not remove.
