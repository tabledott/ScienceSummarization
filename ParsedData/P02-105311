es with accuracies ranging from 78% to 92%, depending on the amount of training data that is available.
    The algorithm can go beyond a binary positive-negative distinction, because the clustering algorithm (step 3 above) can produce a &#8220;goodness-of-fit&#8221; measure that indicates how well an adjective fits in its assigned cluster.
    Although they do not consider the task of classifying reviews, it seems their algorithm could be plugged into the classification algorithm presented in Section 2, where it would replace PMI-IR and equation (3) in the second step.
    However, PMI-IR is conceptually simpler, easier to implement, and it can handle phrases and adverbs, in addition to isolated adjectives.
    As far as I know, the only prior published work on the task of classifying reviews as thumbs up or down is Tong&#8217;s (2001) system for generating sentiment timelines.
    This system tracks online discussions about movies and displays a plot of the number of positive sentiment and negative sentimen
