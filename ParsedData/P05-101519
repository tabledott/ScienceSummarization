ors of each item are also taken from the full training set.
    Figure 2 summarizes our average 10-fold crossvalidation accuracy results.
    We first observe from the plots that all the algorithms described in Section 3 always definitively outperform the simple baseline of predicting the majority class, although the improvements are smaller in the four-class case.
    Incidentally, the data was distributed in such a way that the absolute performance of the baseline itself does not change much between the three- and four-class case (which implies that the three-class datasets were relatively more balanced); and Author c&#8217;s datasets seem noticeably easier than the others.
    We now examine the effect of implicitly using label and item similarity.
    In the four-class case, regression performed better than OVA (significantly so for two authors, as shown in the righthand table); but for the three-category task, OVA significantly outperforms regression for all four authors.
    One might initially interpre
