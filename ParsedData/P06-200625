l because DepBank treats modal auxiliaries as syntactic heads while the GRscheme treats the main verb as head in all ccomp relations.
    We have not attempted to compensate for any further such discrepancies other than the one discussed in the previous paragraph.
    However, we do believe that they collectively damage scores for our system.
    As King et al. note, it is difficult to identify such informational redundancies to avoid doublecounting and to eradicate all system specific biases.
    However, reporting precision, recall and F1scores for each relation and feature separately and microaveraging these scores on the basis of a hierarchy, as in our GR scheme, ameliorates many of these problems and gives a better indication of the strengths and weaknesses of a particular parser, which may also be useful in a decision about its usefulness for a specific application.
    Unfortunately, Kaplan et al. do not report their results broken down by relation or feature so it is not possible, for example, on the
