hoose the longest proposed translation; in the case of a tie, we choose the proposed translation with the highest score according to the WSD model.
    Define a chunk of a rule to be a maximal substring of terminal symbols on the English side of the rule.
    For example, in Rule (2), the chunks would be &#8220;go to&#8221; and &#8220;every month to&#8221;.
    Whenever we find a matching WSD translation, we mark the whole chunk on the English side as consumed.
    Finally, we compute the feature values for the rule.
    The feature P,sd(t  |s) is the sum of the costs (according to the WSD model) of all the matched translations, and the feature Pty,sd is the sum of the lengths of all the matched translations.
    Figure 1 shows the pseudocode for the rule scoring algorithm in more detail, particularly with regards to resolving conflicts between overlapping matches.
    To illustrate the algorithm given in Figure 1, consider Rule (2).
    Hereafter, we will use symbols to represent the Chinese and English word
