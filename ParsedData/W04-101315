nman&#8221;), S3 has one skip-bigram match with S1 (&#8220;the gunman&#8221;), and S4 has two skip-bigram matches with S1 (&#8220;police killed&#8221;, &#8220;the gunman&#8221;).
    Given translations X of length m and Y of length n, assuming X is a reference translation and Y is a candidate translation, we compute skip-bigram-based F-measure as follows: Where SKIP2(X,Y) is the number of skip-bigram matches between X and Y, &#223; controlling the relative importance of Pskip2 and Rskip2, and C is the combination function.
    We call the skip-bigram-based Fmeasure, i.e.
    Equation 18, ROUGE-S.
    Using Equation 18 with &#223; = 1 and S1 as the reference, S2&#8217;s ROUGE-S score is 0.5, S3 is 0.167, and S4 is 0.333.
    Therefore, S2 is better than S3 and S4, and S4 is better than S3.
    This result is more intuitive than using BLEU-2 and ROUGE-L. One advantage of skip-bigram vs. BLEU is that it does not require consecutive matches but is still sensitive to word order.
