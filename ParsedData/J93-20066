probabilistic algorithm is critical to selecting the appropriate generalizations to make from a set of examples.
    The effectiveness of the semantic case frames inferred is measured by testing how well those case frames predict the correct attachment point for prepositional phrases.
    In this case, a significant new model synthesizing both semantic and syntactic knowledge is employed.
  
  
    Identifying the part of speech of a word illustrates both the problem of ambiguity and the problem of unknown words.
