			These transition parame ters are drawn from a DP centered on the top-level stick-breaking weights ? according to Equations (2) and (3).
			Assume that z1 is always fixed to a special START state, so we do not need to generate it.
			2.4 HDP-PCFG.
			We now present the HDP-PCFG, which is the focus of this paper.
			For simplicity, we consider Chomsky normal form (CNF) grammars, which has two typesof rules: emissions and binary productions.
			We con sider each grammar symbol as a mixture component whose parameters are the rule probabilities for that symbol.
			In general, we do not know the appropriate number of grammar symbols, so our strategy is to let the
