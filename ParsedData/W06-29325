commonalities between a head and its dependents in terms of attributes like gender, case, or number.
    Not all data sets in our experiments include morphological features, so we use them only when available.
  
  
    The second stage takes the output parse y for sentence x and classifies each edge (i, j) E y with a particular label l(i,j).
    Ideally one would like to make all parsing and labeling decisions jointly so that the shared knowledge of both decisions will help resolve any ambiguities.
    However, the parser is fundamentally limited by the scope of local factorizations that make inference tractable.
    In our case this means we are forced only to consider features over single edges or pairs of edges.
    However, in a two stage system we can incorporate features over the entire output of the unlabeled parser since that structure is fixed as input.
    The simplest labeler would be to take as input an edge (i, j) E y for sentence x and find the label with highest score, Doing this for each edge
