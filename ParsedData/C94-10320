  j l ) Abstract We present a novel method for segmenting the input sentence into words and assigning parts of speech to the words.
  It consists of a statistical language model and an efficient wo-pa~qs N-best search algorithm.
  The algorithm does not require delimiters between words.
  Thus it is suitable for written Japanese.
  qhe proposed Japanese morphological nalyzer achieved 95. l% recall and 94.6% precision for open text when it was trained and tested on the ATI?
  1 Introduct ion In recent years, we have seen a fair number of l)al)ers re- porting accuracies ofmore than 95% for English part of speech tagging with statistical language modeling tech- niques [2-4, 10, 11].
  On the other hand, there are few work
