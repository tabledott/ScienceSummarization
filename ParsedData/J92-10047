ion of the constraint mechanism.
    Unifications introduce additional syntactic and semantic constraints such as person and number agreement and subject/verb semantic restrictions.
    This paper is organized as follows.
    Section 2 contains a detailed description of the grammar and the control strategy, including syntactic and semantic constraint mechanisms.
    Section 3 describes a number of domain-dependent versions of the system that have been implemented, and addresses, within the context of particular domains, several evaluation measures, including perplexity coverage, and portability.
    Section 4 discusses briefly two application domains involving database access in which the parser provides the link between a speech recognizer and the database queries.
    The last section provides a summary and a discussion of our future plans.
    There is also an appendix, which walks through an example grammar for three-digit numbers, showing how to train the probabilities, parse a sentence, and compute perp
