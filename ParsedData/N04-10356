mbol tree that we want to derive as the target tree.
    Any subtree of this tree will be called a target subtree.
    Furthermore, we define a derivation string as an ordered sequence of elements, each of which is either a source symbol or a target subtree.
    Now we are ready to define the derivation process.
    Given a derivation string S, a derivation step replaces a substring S' of S with a target subtree T that has the following properties: Moreover, a derivation from a string S of source symbols to the target tree T is a sequence of derivation steps that produces T from S. Moving away from the abstract for a moment, let us revisit the example from Figure 1.
    Figure 2 shows three derivations of the target tree from the source string &#8220;il ne va pas&#8221;, which are all consistent with our definitions.
    However, it is apparent that one of these derivations seems much more &#8220;wrong&#8221; than the other.
    Specifically, in the second derivation, &#8220;pas&#8221; is replaced by the Engl
