 rule).
    Matching of single anchors relies on the general distributional similarity principle and unlike the other methods does not require redundancy of sets of multiple anchors.
    Consequently, a much larger number of paraphrases can be found in a regular corpus.
    Lin and Pantel report experiments for 9 templates, in which their system extracted 10 correct inference rules on average per input template, from 1GB of news data.
    Yet, this method also suffers from certain limitations: (a) it identifies only templates with pre-specified structures; (b) accuracy seems more limited, due to the weaker notion of similarity; and (c) coverage is limited to the scope of an available corpus.
    To conclude, several approaches exhaustively process different types of corpora, obtaining varying scales of output.
    On the other hand, the Web is a huge promising resource, but current Web-based methods suffer serious scalability constraints.
