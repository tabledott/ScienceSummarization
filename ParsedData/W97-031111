are translated very inconsistently, and it is difficult to model their translational distributions accurately.
    To make discovery of NCCs involving function words more likely, I consider content words that are separated by one or two functions words to be adjacent.
    Thus, NCCs like &amp;quot;blow ... whistle&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;icing ... cake&amp;quot; may contain gaps.
    Fusing NCCs with gaps may fuse some words incorrectly, when the NCC is a frozen expression.
    For example, we would want to recognize that &amp;quot;icing ... cake&amp;quot; is an NCC when we see it in new text, but not if it occurs in a sentence like &amp;quot;Mary ate the icing off the cake.&amp;quot; It is necessary to determine whether the gap in a given NCC is fixed or not.
    Thus, the price for this flexibility provided by NCC gaps is that, before Step 7, the algorithm fills gaps in proposed NCCs by looking through the text.
    Sometimes, NCCs have multiple possible gap fillers, for example &amp;quot;make up {my,your,h
