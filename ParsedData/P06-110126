rently existing hypernym links in WordNet 2.1.
    In order to compare taxonomies we use a hand-labeled test set of over 5,000 noun pairs, randomly-sampled from newswire corpora (described in (Snow et al., 2005)).
    We measured the performance of both our inferred taxonomies and WordNet against this test set.8 The performance and comparison of the best WordNet classifier vs. our taxonomies is given in Table 4.
    Our best-performing inferred taxonomy on this test set is achieved after adding 30,000 novel hyponyms, achieving an 23% relative improvement in F-score over the WN2.1 classifier.
  
  
    We have presented an algorithm for inducing semantic taxonomies which attempts to globally optimize the entire structure of the taxonomy.
    Our probabilistic architecture also includes a new model for learning coordinate terms based on (m, n)-cousin classification.
    The model&#8217;s ability to integrate heterogeneous evidence from different classifiers offers a solution to the key problem of choosing the c
