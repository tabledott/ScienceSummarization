s, use of the stop list improves results.
    It should also be noted that the texts used in this study were not chosen to have well-defined boundaries, and so pose a difficult test for the algorithm.
    Perhaps some tests against texts with more obvious subtopic boundaries (for which the kappa coefficient for interjudge agreement is larger) would be illuminating.
    One way to evaluate the algorithm is in terms of how well it distinguishes entire articles from one another when they are concatenated into one file.
    Nomoto and Nitta (1994) implement the tf.idf version of TextTiling from Hearst (1993) and Hearst and Plaunt (1993) and evaluate it this way on Japanese newswire text.13 Also, as discussed in Section 4, Reynar (1994) uses this form of evaluation on a greedy version of the blocks algorithm.
    This task violates a major assumption of the TextTiling algorithm.
    TextTiling assumes that the similarity comparisons are done within the vocabulary patterns of one text, and so a relatively large shi
