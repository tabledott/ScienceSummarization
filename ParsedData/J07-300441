ose Treebank annotation differs from the standard CCG analysis for linguistic reasons.
    This includes small clauses, as well as pied-piping, subject extraction from embedded sentences and argument cluster coordination (discussed in Section 6).
    Small Clauses.

    Because our current grammar treats predicative NPs like ordinary NPs, we are not able to express the relationship between it and supplier, or between pool and hostage.
    A correct analysis would assign a functor category S[nom]\NP (or perha
