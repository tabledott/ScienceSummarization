 clustering space for these experiments, which yielded a very high dimension space.
			To reduce this dimensionality, we performed a simple feature selection procedure including in the feature vector only those terms that represented the highest tf*idf value for at least one data point.
			This resulted in a feature vector containing 484 tf*idf values for each document.

			This dependency severelylimits the usefulness of VI: it is inappropriate in selecting an appropriate parameter for k or for evaluating the distance between clustering solutions gen erated using different values of k. V-measure and Q2 demonstrate si
