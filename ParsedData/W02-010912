nd motivates the domain, followed by a detailed walk-through that uses examples to show how NLTK can be used to perform specific tasks.
    Reference Documentation provides precise definitions for every module, interface, class, method, function, and variable in the toolkit.
    It is automatically extracted from docstring comments in the Python source code, using Epydoc (Loper, 2002).
    Technical Reports explain and justify the toolkit&#8217;s design and implementation.
    They are used by the developers of the toolkit to guide and document the toolkit&#8217;s construction.
    Students can also consult these reports if they would like further information about how the toolkit is designed, and why it is designed that way.
  
  
    NLTK can be used to create student assignments of varying difficulty and scope.
    In the simplest assignments, students experiment with an existing module.
    The wide variety of existing modules provide many opportunities for creating these simple assignments.
