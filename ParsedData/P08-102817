set.
    In order to establish an independent measure of sentence similarity, we assembled a set of experimental materials and elicited similarity ratings from human subjects.
    In the following we describe our data collection procedure and give details on how our composition models were constructed and evaluated.
    Materials and Design Our materials consisted of sentences with an an intransitive verb and its subject.
    We first compiled a list of intransitive verbs from CELEX2.
    All occurrences of these verbs with a subject noun were next extracted from a RASP parsed (Briscoe and Carroll, 2002) version of the British National Corpus (BNC).
    Verbs and nouns that were attested less than fifty times in the BNC were removed as they would result in unreliable vectors.
    Each reference subject-verb tuple (e.g., horse ran) was paired with two landmarks, each a synonym of the verb.
    The landmarks were chosen so as to represent distinct verb senses, one compatible with the reference (e.g., horse gall
