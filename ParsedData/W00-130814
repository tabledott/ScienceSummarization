lects the importance of lexical information to taggers: in the best accuracy figures published for corpus-based taggers, known word accuracy is around 97%, whereas unknown word accuracy is around 85%.
    In following experiments, we examined ways of using additional features to improve the accuracy of tagging unknown words.
    As previously discussed in Mikheev (1999), it is possible to improve the accuracy on capitalized words that might be proper nouns or the first word in a sentence, etc.
    For example, the error on the proper noun category (NNP) accounts for a significantly larger percent of the total error for unknown words than for known words.
    In the Baseline model, of the unknown word error 41.3% is due to words being NNP and assigned to some other category, or being of other category and assigned NNP.
    The percentage of the same type of error for known words is 16.2%.
    The incorporation of the following two feature schemas greatly improved NNP accuracy: Conversely, empirically it was fo
