definition of best parse tree also outperforms the best results obtained in Bod (2001).
  
  
    As our second experimental goal, we compared the models SL-DOP and LS-DOP explained in Section 3.2.
    Recall that for n=1, SL-DOP is equal to the PCFG-reduction of Bod (2001) (which we also called Likelihood-DOP) while LS-DOP is equal to Simplicity-DOP.
    Table 2 shows the results for sentences 100 words for various values of n. Note that there is an increase in accuracy for both SL-DOP and LS-DOP if the value of n increases from 1 to 12.
    But while the accuracy of SL-DOP decreases after n=14 and converges to Simplicity DOP, the accuracy of LS-DOP continues to increase and converges to Likelihood-DOP.
    The highest accuracy is obtained by SL-DOP at 12 n 14: an LP of 90.8% and an LR of 90.7%.
    This is roughly an 11% relative reduction in error rate over Charniak (2000) and Bods PCFG-reduction reported in Table 1.
    Compared to the reranking technique in Collins (2000), who obtained an LP of 89.9% and
