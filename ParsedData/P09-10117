nd speed, sky cover, chance of rain, etc., which represent the underlying world state.
    This world state is summarized by records which aggregate measurements over selected time intervals.
    For example, one of the records states the minimum, average, and maximum temperature from 5pm to 6am.
    This aggregation process produced 22,146 scenarios, each containing |s |= 36 multi-field records.
    There are 12 record types, each consisting of only integer and categorical fields.
    To annotate the data, we split the text by punctuation into lines and labeled each line with the records to which the line refers.
    These lines are used only for evaluation and are not part of the model (see Section 5.1 for further discussion).
    The weather domain is more complex than the Robocup domain in several ways: The text w is longer, there are more candidate records, and most notably, w references multiple records (5.8 on average), so the segmentation of w is unknown.
