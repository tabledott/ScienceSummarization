abic, much morphological variation goes untagged.
    For example, verbal inflections for subject person, number, and gender are not marked; dual and plural are not distinguished on nouns; and gender is not marked on nouns at all.
    In Arabic nouns, arguably the gender feature is the more interesting distinction (rather than the number feature) as verbs in Arabic always agree with their nominal subjects in gender.
    Agreement in number occurs only when the nominal subject precedes the verb.
    We use the tagset here only to compare to previous work.
    Instead, we advocate using a reduced part-of-speech tag set,9 along with the other orthogonal linguistic features in Figure 2.
    We map our best solutions as chosen by the Maj model in Section 6 to the English tagset, and we furthermore assume (as do Diab et al. (2004)) the gold standard tokenization.
    We then evaluate against the gold standard POS tagging which we have mapped for all tokens (based on gold-standard tokenization) and only for word tok
