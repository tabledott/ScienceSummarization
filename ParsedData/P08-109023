hains is most coherent, the original or the random (baseline 50%)?
    We generated up to 300 random orderings for each test document, averaging the accuracy across all.
    Our evaluation data is the same 69 documents used in the test set for learning narrative relations.
    The chain from each document is hand identified and labeled for a partial ordering using only the before relation.
    Ordering was done by the authors and all attempts were made to include every before relation that exists in the document, or that could be deduced through transitivity rules.
    Figure 4 shows an example and its full reversal, although the evaluation uses random orderings.
    Each edge is a distinct before relation and is used in the judgement score.
    The coherence score for a partially ordered narrative chain is the sum of all the relations that our classified corpus agrees with, weighted by how certain we are.
    If the gigaword classifications disagree, a weighted negative score is given.
