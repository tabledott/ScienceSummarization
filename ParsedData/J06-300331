learn a measure of relational similarity that can handle arbitrary semantic relations.
    A nearest neighbor algorithm can then use this relational similarity measure to learn to classify according to any set of classes of relations, given the appropriate labeled training data.
    Girju, Badulescu, and Moldovan (2003) present an algorithm for learning meronym relations from a corpus.
    Like Hearst (1992) and Berland and Charniak (1999), they use manually generated rules to mine text for their desired relation.
    However, they supplement their manual rules with automatically learned constraints, to increase the precision of the rules.
    Veale (2003) has developed an algorithm for recognizing certain types of word analogies, based on information in WordNet.
    He proposes to use the algorithm for analogical information retrieval.
    For example, the query Muslim church should return mosque and the query Hindu bible should return the Vedas.
    The algorithm was designed with a focus on analogies of th
