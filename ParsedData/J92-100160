    No additional weights are necessary, because the specificity values the system uses are a direct measure of strength.
  
  
    Our goal has been a natural language system that can effectively analyze an arbitrary input at least to the level of word sense tagging.
    Although we have not yet fully accomplished this goal, our results are quite encouraging.
    Using a lexicon of approximately 10,000 roots and 10,000 derivations, the system shows excellent lexical and morphological coverage.
    When tested on a sample of 25,000 words of text from the Wall Street Journal, the system covered 98% of non-proper noun, non-abbreviated word occurrences (and 91% of all words).
    Twelve percent of the senses the system selected were derivatives.
    The semantic interpreter is able to discriminate senses even when the parser cannot produce a single correct parse.
    Figure 20 gives an example of the sense tagging that the system gives to the following segment of Wall Street Journal text:
