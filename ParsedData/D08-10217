    By Bannard and Callison-Burch&#8217;s definition, equal, create equal, and to create equal would be considered paraphrases because they are aligned to the same foreign phrase.
    Tables 1 and 2 show how sub- and super-phrases can creep into the paraphrases: equal can be paraphrased as equal rights and create equal can be paraphrased as equal.
    Obviously when e2 is substituted for e1 the resulting sentence will generally be ungrammatical.
    The first case could result in equal equal rights, and the second would drop the verb.
    This problem is pervasive.
    To test its extent we attempted to generate paraphrases for 900,000 phrases using Bannard and Callison-Burch&#8217;s method trained on the Europarl corpora (as described in Section 4).
    It generated a total of 3.7 million paraphrases for 400,000 phrases in the list.1 We observed that 34% of the paraphrases (excluding the phrase itself) were super- or sub-strings of the original phrase.
    The most probable paraphrase was
