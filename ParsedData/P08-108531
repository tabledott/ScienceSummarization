ation information, we believe there is much room for improvement in this respect.
    In particular, (Haghighi and Klein, 2006) presents very strong results using a distributional-similarity module and achieve impressive tagging accuracy while starting with a mere 116 prototypical words.
    Experimenting with combining similar models (as well as TJ&#8217;s ambiguity class model) with our p(t|w) distribution estimation method is an interesting research direction.
