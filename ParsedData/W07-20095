sx.ac.uk/research/nlp/mccarthy/files/ instructions.pdf.2There were only 19 verbs due to an error in automatic selection of one of the verbs picked for manual selection of sen tences.
			Pairwise inter-annotator agreement was 27.75%.
			73.93% had modes, and pairwise agreement with themode was 50.67%.
			Agreement is increased if we remove one annotator who typically gave 2 or 3 sub stitutes for each item, which increased coverage butreduced agreement.
			Without this annotator, inter annotator agreement was 31.13% and 64.7% with mode.
			Multiword detection pairwise agreement was 92.30% and agreement on the identification of the exact form of the actual multiword was 44.13%.
	
	
			We have 3 separate subtasks 1) best 2) oot and 3) mw which we describe below.
			3 In the equations and results tables that follow we use P for precision, R for recall, and Mode P and Mode R where we calculate precision and recall against the substitute chosen by the majority of annotators, provided that there is a majority.
			Let
