a has clear advantages over simpler metrics and can be interpreted as long as appropriate care is used.
    The main move and game cross-coding study involved four coders, all of whom had already coded substantial portions of the Map Task Corpus.
    For this study, they simply segmented and coded four dialogues using their normal working procedures, which included access to the speech as well as the transcripts.
    All of the coders interacted verbally with the coding developers, making it harder to say what they agree upon than if they had worked solely from written instructions.
    On the other hand, this is a common failing of coding schemes, and in some circumstances it can be more important to get the ideas of the coding scheme across than to tightly control how it is done.
    4.3.1 Reliability of Move Segmentation.
    First, the move coders agree on how to segment a dialogue into moves.
    Two different measures of agreement are useful.
    In the first, kappa is used to assess agreement on whethe
