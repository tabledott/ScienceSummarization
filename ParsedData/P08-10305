a collection of topically-related documents, the distribution may be much more convergent.
    We investigate this hypothesis by automatically obtaining 25 related documents for each test text.
    The statistics of some trigger examples are presented in table 2.
    As we can see from the table, the likelihood of a candidate word being an event trigger in the test document is closer to its distribution in the collection of related documents than the uniform training corpora.
    So if we can determine the sense (event type) of a word in the related documents, this will allow us to infer its sense in the test document.
    In this way related documents can help recover event mentions missed by within-sentence extraction.
    For example, in a document about &#8220;the advance into Baghdad&#8221;: Most US army commanders believe it is critical to pause the breakneck advance towards Baghdad to secure the supply lines and make sure weapons are operable and troops resupplied.... British and US forces report gains
