The features of our model are presented in Section 3, and experimental results for word aligning both French-English and Romanian-English sentences are given in Section 4.
    Section 5 presents related work, and we describe future work in Section 6.
    Finally, we conclude in Section 7.
  
  
    CRFs are undirected graphical models which define a conditional distribution over a label sequence given an observation sequence.
    We use a CRF to model many-to-one word alignments, where each source word is aligned with zero or one target words, and therefore each target word can be aligned with many source words.
    Each source word is labelled with the index of its aligned target, or the special value null, denoting no alignment.
    An example word alignment is shown in Figure 1, where the hollow squares and circles indicate the correct alignments.
    In this example the French words une and autre would both be assigned the index 24 &#8211; for the English word another &#8211; when French is the source lan
