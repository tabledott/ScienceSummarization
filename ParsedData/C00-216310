dictionary but indirectly also for other words.
  The additional sentences in the training cortms are weighted with a factor Fl~x during the EM-training of the lexicon probabilities.
  We assign tile dictionary entries which really co- occur in the training corpus a high weight Fle.~.
  and the remaining entries a vexy low weight.
  In our ex- periments we use Flex = 10 for the co-occurring dic- tionary entries which is equivalent to adding every dictionary entry ten times to the training cortms.
  6 The Al ignment Template  System The statistical machine-translation method descri- bed in (Och et al., 1999) is based on a word aligned traiifing corIms and thereby makes use of single- word based alignment models.
  Tile key element of tiffs apt/roach are the alignment emplates which are pairs of phrases together with an alignment between the words within tile phrases.
  The advantage of the alignment emplate approach over word based statistical translation models is that word context and local re-orderings are
