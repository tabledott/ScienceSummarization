rt that &amp;quot;Christmas&amp;quot; corresponds to &amp;quot;projet de loi&amp;quot; and to &amp;quot;conge des Fetes&amp;quot; with equal probability, no matter how likely the correspondence between &amp;quot;Bill&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;projet de loi&amp;quot;.
    The model can be refined to reflect this situation by considering the joint probability that a target npF(t) corresponds to a source npE(s) and all the other possible correspondences in the alignment are produced.
    This situation is very similar to that involved in training HMM text taggers, where joint probabilities are computed that a particular word corresponds to a particular part-ofspeech, and the rest of the words in the sentence are also generated (e.g.
    [Cutting et al., 1992]).
  
  
    The algorithm described in this paper provides a practical means for obtaining correspondences between noun phrases in a bilingual corpus.
    Linguistic structure is used in the form of noun phrase recognizers to select phrases for a stochastic m
