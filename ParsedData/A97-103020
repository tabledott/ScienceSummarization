 Since it is usually the case that a right-hand operator has stronger scope over a left-hand one, we evaluate strings containing operators from right to left.
    To illustrate, New York's MOMA and the Victoria and Albert Museum in London is first evaluated for splitting on in.
    Since the left and right substrings do not satisfy any conditions, we proceed to the next operator on the left &#8212; and.
    Because of the strong scope of Museum, as mentioned above, no splitting occurs.
    Next, the second and from the right is evaluated.
    It causes a split because it is immediately preceded by an all-capitalized word.
    We have found this simple typographical heuristic to be powerful and surprisingly accurate.
    Ambiguous operators form recursive structures and so the splitting heuristics apply recursively to name sequences until no more splitting conditions hold.
    New York's MOMA is further split at 's because of a heuristic that checks for place names on the left of a possessive pronoun or a comm
