n 2), it is not too surprising that they both achieved good results.
    It is surprising, however, how similar their total scores are, given that their approaches are quite different (see Table 2).
    The results show that experiments on just one or two languages certainly give an indication of the usefulness of a parsing approach but should not be taken as proof that one algorithm is better for &#8220;parsing&#8221; (in general) than another that performs slightly worse.
    The Bulgarian scores suggest that rankings would not have been very different had it been the 13th obligatory languages.
    Table 6 shows that the same holds had we used another evaluation metric.
    Note that a negative number in both the third and fifth column indicates that errors on HEAD and DEPREL occur together on the same token more often than for other parsers.
    Finally, we checked that, had we also scored on punctuation tokens, total scores as well as rankings would only have shown very minor differences.
