 with that rule, then All models considered in this article take this form, although in the boosting models the score for a parse is not a log-probability.
    The features hk define an m-dimensional vector of counts which represent the tree.
    The parameters ak represent the influence of each feature on the score of a tree.
    A drawback of history-based models is that the choice of derivation has a profound influence on the parameterization of the model.
    (Similar observations have been made in the related cases of belief networks [Pearl 1988], and language models for speech recognition [Rosenfeld 1997].)
    When designing a model, it would be desirable to have a framework in which features can be easily added to the model.
    Unfortunately, with history-based models adding new features often requires a modification of the underlying derivations in the model.
    Modifying the derivation to include a new feature type can be a laborious task.
    In an ideal situation we would be able to encode arbit
