 node to the sub-tree root node in consideration).
			Zhang et al(2006) also showed that the widely-used Shortest Path-enclosed Tree (SPT) performed best.
			One problem with SPT is that it fails to capture the contextual information outside the shortest path, which is important for relation extraction in many cases.
			Our random selection of 100 pos i tive training instances from the ACE RDC 2003 training corpus shows that ~25% of the cases need contextual information outside the shortest path.
			Among other kernels, Bunescu and Mooney (2005b) proposed a subsequence kernel and applied it in pro tein interaction and ACE relation extraction tasks.
			In order to integrate the advantages of featurebased and tree kernel-based methods, some research ers have turned to composite kernel-based methods.
			Zhao and Grishman (2005) defined several feature based composite kernels to integrate diverse features for relation extraction and achieved the F-measure of 70.4 on the 7 relation types of the ACE RDC 2004 corpus
