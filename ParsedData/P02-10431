			The potential benefit of wide-coverage parsing with CCG lies in its more constrained grammar and itssimple and semantically transparent capture of ex traction and coordination.We present a number of models over syntac tic derivations of Combinatory Categorial Grammar (CCG, see Steedman (2000) and Clark et al (2002), this conference, for introduction), estimated from and tested on a translation of the Penn Treebank to a corpus of CCG normal-form derivations.
			CCG grammars are characterized by much larger categorysets than standard Penn Treebank grammars, distin guishing for example between many classes of verbswith different subcategorization frames.
			As a re sult, the categorial lexicon extracted for this purposefrom the training corpus has 1207 categories, com pared with the 48 POS-tags of the Penn Treebank.On the other hand, grammar rules in CCG are lim ited to a small number of simple unary and binary combinatory schemata such as function application and composit
