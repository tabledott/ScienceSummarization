against which to evaluate the model, this instance is counted as the classifier being wrong because it disagrees with the annotators.
			A better indication of the model?sperformance may be to independently judge its de cisions, to avoid being subject to the annotators?bias.
			Finally, we are beginning to look at the rela tions between preposition errors and other types oferror such as verb choice, and how these are anno tated in the data.
			An overview of the classifier?s error patterns forthe data in this task shows that they are largely similar to those observed in the L1 data.
			This sug gests that the gap in performance between L1 and L2 is due more to the challenges posed by learner text than by inherent shortcomings in the model, and therefore that the key to better performance is likely to lie in overcoming these problems.
			In future work we plan to use L2 data where someof the spelling errors and non-preposition or deter miner errors have been corrected so that we can see which of the other erro
