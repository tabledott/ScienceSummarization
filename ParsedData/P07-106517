s of adding 5-grams drawn from the Gigaword corpus to the baseline.
    It also contrasts the Boolean BF and the log-frequency BF suggesting in this case that the log-frequency BF can provide useful information when the quantisation base is relatively fine-grained (base 2).
    The Boolean BF and the base 5 (coarse-grained quantisation) log-frequency BF perform approximately the same.
    The base 2 quantisation performs worse for smaller amounts of memory, possibly due to the larger set of events it is required to store.
    Figure 5 shows sub-sequence filtering resulting in a small increase in performance when false positive rates are high (i.e. less memory is allocated).
    We believe this to be the result of an increased a priori membership probability for n-grams presented to the filter under the sub-sequence filtering scheme.
    Figure 6 shows that for this task the most useful n-gram sizes are between 3 and 6.
    Figure 8 compares the memory requirements of the log-frequencey BF (base 2) and the Boo
