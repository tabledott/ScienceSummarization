  Pseudo-Projective Dependency Parsing
  
    In order to realize the full potential of dependency-based syntactic parsing, it is desirable to allow non-projective dependency structures.
    We show how a datadriven deterministic dependency parser, in itself restricted to projective structures, can be combined with graph transformation techniques to produce non-projective structures.
    Experiments using data from the Prague Dependency Treebank show that the combined system can handle nonprojective constructions with a precision sufficient to yield a significant improvement in overall parsing accuracy.
    This leads to the best reported performance for robust non-projective parsing of Czech.
  
  
    It is sometimes claimed that one of the advantages of dependency grammar over approaches based on constituency is that it allows a more adequate treatment of languages with variable word order, where discontinuous syntactic constructions are more common than in languages like English (Mel&#8217;&#711;cuk, 198
