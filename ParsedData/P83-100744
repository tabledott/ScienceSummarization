it is sometimes the case that such an argument can be the backward-looking center of the sentence.
    We are currently studying such cases and expect to integrate that study into our theory of discourse phenomena.
    The basic rule that constrains the realization of the backward-looking center of an utterance is a constraint on the speaker, namely: If the Cb of the current utterance is the same as the Cb of the previous utterance, a pronoun should be used.
    There are two things to note about this rule.
    First, it does not preclude using pronouns for other entities as long as one is used for the center.
    Second, it is not a hard rule, but rather a principle, like a Gricean maxim, that can be violated.
    However, such violations lead at best to conditions in which the hearer is forced to draw additional inferences.
    As a simple example, consider the following sequence, assuming at the outset that John is the center of the discourse: (8a) He called up Mike yesterday.
    (he=John) (8b) He vas ann
