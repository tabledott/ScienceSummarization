 cut and paste techniques observed in human-written abstracts.
    In order to automatically analyze a large quantity of human-written abstracts, we developed a decomposition program.
    The automatic decomposition allows us to build large corpora for studying sentence reduction and sentence combination, which are two effective operations in cut and paste.
    We developed a sentence reduction module that makes reduction decisions using multiple sources of knowledge.
    We also investigated possible sentence combination operations and implemented the combination module.
    A sentence extraction module was developed and used as the front end of the summarization system.
    We are preparing the task-based evaluation of the overall system.
    We also plan to evaluate the portability of the system by testing it on another corpus.
    We will also extend the system to query-based summarization and investigate whether the system can be modified for multiple document summarization.
