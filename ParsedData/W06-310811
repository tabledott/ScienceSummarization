s case, only the topmost alignment link is considered because the other ones cannot occur at a phrase boundary.
    Many-toone and many-to-many alignments are handled in a similar way.
  
  
    The experiments were carried out on the Basic Travel Expression Corpus (BTEC) task (Takezawa et al., 2002).
    This is a multilingual speech corpus which contains tourism-related sentences similar to those that are found in phrase books.
    We use the Arabic-English, the Chinese-English and the Japanese-English data.
    The corpus statistics are shown in Table 1.
    As the BTEC is a rather clean corpus, the preprocessing consisted mainly of tokenization, i.e., separating punctuation marks from words.
    Additionally, we replaced contractions such as it&#8217;s or I&#8217;m in the English corpus and we removed the case information.
    For Arabic, we removed the diacritics and we split common prefixes: Al, w, f, b, l. There was no special preprocessing for the Chinese and the Japanese training corpora.
