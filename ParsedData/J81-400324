    Although it would be possible to describe fully the operation of XGs in terms of derivations on bracketed strings, it is much simpler to complete the explanation of XGs using the translation of XG rules into definite clauses.
    In fact, a rigorous definition of XGs independently of definite clauses would require a formal apparatus very similar to the one needed to formalise definite clause programs in the first place, and so it would fall outside the scope of the present paper.
    The interested reader will find a full discussion of those issues in two articles by Colmerauer [2,3].
    Like a DCG, a general XG is no more than a convenient notation for a set of definite clauses.
    An XG non-terminal of arity n corresponds to an n+4 place predicate (with the same name).
    Of the extra four arguments, two are used to represent string positions as in DCGs, and the other two are used to represent positions in an extraposition list, which carries symbols to be repositioned.
    Each element of the extrap
