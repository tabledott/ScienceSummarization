    The results for the latter approaches improve only slightly with the modification of ranking the antecedent of an functional anaphor (FAante) above the functional anaphor itself (FA).
    In any case, they do not compare to the results of the functional approach.
    Our use of the centering transitions led us to the conclusion that CONTINUE and SMOOTH-SHIFT are not completely specified by Grosz, Joshi, and Weinstein (1995) and Brennan, Friedman, and Pollard (1987).
    According to Brennan, Friedman, and Pollard's definition, it is possible that a transition is labeled SMOOTH-SHIFT even if Cp(U,) Cp(U,_1).
    Such a SHIFT is less smooth, because it contradicts the intuition that a SMOOTH-SHIFT fulfills what a RETAIN predicted.
    The same applies to a CONTINUE with this characteristic.
    Hence, we propose to extend the set of transitions as shown in TaCONT.
