    Figure 2 shows typical results.
    Notice that the Bracketed Recall Algorithm's Consistent Brackets Rate (versus iteration) is smoother and more nearly monotonic than the Labelled Tree Algorithm's.
    The Bracketed Recall Algorithm also gets off to a much faster start, and is generally (although not always) above the Labelled Tree level.
    For the Labelled Tree Rate, the two are usually very comparable.
    The replication of the Pereira and Schabes experiment was useful for testing the Bracketed Recall Algorithm.
    However, since that experiment induces a grammar with nonterminals not comparable to those in the training, a different experiment is needed to evaluate the Labelled Recall Algorithm, one in which the nonterminals in the induced grammar are the same as the nonterminals in the test set.
    For this experiment, a very simple grammar was induced by counting, using a portion of the Penn Tree Bank, version 0.5.
    In particular, the trees were first made binary branching by removing epsilon
