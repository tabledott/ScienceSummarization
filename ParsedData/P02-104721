    Table 5 displays the performance of our two way classifiers for relations defined over elementary discourse units.
    The table displays in the second row, for each discourse relation, the number of examples extracted from the RST corpus.
    For each binary classifier, the table lists in bold the accuracy of our classifier and in non-bold font the majority baseline associated with it.
    The results in Table 5 show that the classifiers learned from automatically generated training data can be used to distinguish between certain types of RST relations.
    For example, the results show that the classifiers can be used to distinguish between CONTRAST and CAUSE-EXPLANATION-EVIDENCE relations, as defined in RST, but not so well between ELABORATION and any other relation.
    This result is consistent with the discourse model proposed by Knott et al. (2001), who suggest that ELABORATION relations are too ill-defined to be part of any discourse theory.
