    We used the various tools in the GTP software package, created at the University of Tennessee3 to build these matrices from the co-occurrence data, and to perform SVD analysis.
    We calculated the similarity between two terms by finding the cosine of the angle between their vectors.
    We performed a pairwise comparison between all verbs and all particles.
    For each term we then sorted all of the other items of the same part-of-speech in descending order of similarity, which gave us the thesaurus for use in substitution.
    As with the Lin method, we performed substitutions by taking the 10 most similar items for the head verb and particle of each VPC.
    We noted in Section 4 that a significant problem with the substitution approach is that it is sensitive to institutionalisation rather than non-compositionality.
    Method 3 attempts to adapt substitution to more accurately reflect non-compositionality by removing the assumption that an item formed by substitution should have the same distri
