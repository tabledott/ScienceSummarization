ful for so-called low-density languages, where limited resources &#8211; and even more limited numbers of native speakers &#8211; are available.
    For the moment, we find the initial results encouraging.
    We achieved a 25% reduction in error on a standard named-entity problem, compared to a state-of-the-art HMM.
    Our main objective, though, was not reducing error rates but rather reducing the amount of annotation required.
    At least for the named-entity task we studied, using the method described, a single annotator could begin work after breakfast and, by lunchtime, have enough data annotated to achieve an F-score of 90.
