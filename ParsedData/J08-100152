Pine Mountain stated that the visibility at the time of the accident was about 1/4 mile in haze/fog. whereas such sequences are more common in coherent Earthquakes documents and more sparse in their permutations.
    This indicates that syntax-free analysis can sufficiently discriminate coherent from incoherent texts in the Earthquakes domain, while a more refined representation of entity transition types is required for the Accidents domain.
    The contribution of salience is less pronounced in both domains&#8212;the difference in performance between the full model (Coreference+Syntax+Salience+) and its salience-agnostic counterpart (Coreference+Syntax+Salience+) is not statistically significant.
    Salience-based models do deliver some benefits for linguistically impoverished models&#8212;for instance, Coreference&#8722;Syntax&#8722;Salience+ improves over Coreference&#8722;Syntax&#8722;Salience&#8722; (p &lt; 0.06) on the Earthquakes corpus.
    We hypothesize that the small contribution of salience is r
