  A Linear Observed Time Statistical Parser Based On Maximum Entropy Models
  
    3.
    A search heuristic which attempts to find the highest scoring parse tree for a given input sentence.
    Abstract This paper presents a statistical parser for natural language that obtains a parsing accuracy&#8212;roughly 87% precision and 86% recall&#8212;which surpasses the best previously published results on the Wall St. Journal domain.
    The parser itself requires very little human intervention, since the information it uses to make parsing decisions is specified in a concise and simple manner, and is combined in a fully automatic way under the maximum entropy framework. running time of the parser on test sentence linear with respect to the sentence length.
    Furthermore, the parser returns several scored parses for a sentence, and this paper shows that a scheme to pick the best parse from the 20 highest scoring a dramatically higher accuracy of 93% precision and recall.
