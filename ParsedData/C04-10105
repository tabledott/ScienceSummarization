			In dependency parsing the goal of the parsing pro cess is to construct a labeled dependency graph of the kind depicted in Figure 1.
			In formal terms, we define dependency graphs as follows: 1.
			Let R = {r1, . . .
			, rm} be the set of permissible.

			A dependency graph for a string of words W = w1?
			?wn is a labeled directed graph D = (W,A), where (a) W is the set of nodes, i.e. word tokens in the input string, (b) A is a set of labeled arcs (wi, r, wj) (wi, wj ? W , r ? R), (c) for every wj ? W , there is at most one arc (wi, r, wj) ? A.1The attachment score only considers whether a word is as signed the correct head; the labeled accuracy score in additionrequires that it is assigned the correct dependency type; cf.
