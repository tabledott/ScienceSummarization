 5475 words, thus an accuracy of 87% Out of the remaining 13% of the words, 3% were disambiguated erroneously and 10% could not be done with the heuristics used The collect sense for each word was determined manually by a team of three students We ha&#8216;e found a few s3 nsets such as {commemorate, remember} that have no links to any other synsets, ie no h3 perny ms and no hypomy nis Step 3 Apply Method 2 - Conceptual Density - to the 6294 polysemous words, star ting fresh Step 4 Apply Method 3 - Statistics - to the 6294 words using AltaN ista on the Internet Step 5 The results obtained with Method 1 and Method 2 are combined, that is, take all the words that were disambiguated, and in the case of conflict give priority to Method 1 Step 6 The results from Step 5 are combined with the results given by Method 3 and in the case of conflict give priority to results obtained in Step 5 Table 1 indicates the accuracy obtained at each step An overall accuracy of 94% was achieved Our goal is to improve the technique
