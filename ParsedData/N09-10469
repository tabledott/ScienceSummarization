p Ei &#955;ihi(s1 , w) (4 ) To simplify inference and to make the lattice representation more natural, we only make use of local feature functions that depend on properties of each segment: The segmentation model just introduced is equivalent to a lattice where each vertex corresponds to a particular coverage (in terms of letters consumed from left to right) of the input word.
    Since we only make use of local features, the number of vertices in a lattice for word w is |w |&#8722; m, where m is the minimum segment length permitted.
    In all experiments reported in this paper, we use m = 3.
    Each edge is labeled with a morpheme s (corresponding to the morpheme associated with characters delimited by the start and end nodes of the edge) as well as a weight, Pi Aihi(s, w).
    The cost of any path from the start to the goal vertex will be equal to the numerator in equation (4).
    The value of the denominator can be computed using the forward algorithm.
    In most of our experiments, s will be identical
