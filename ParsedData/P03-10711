is paper, we present an algorithm for segmenting meeting transcripts.
    This study uses recorded meetings of typically six to eight participants, in which the informal style includes ungrammatical sentences and overlapping speakers.
    These meetings generally do not have pre-set agendas, and the topics discussed in the same meeting may or may not related.
    The meeting segmenter comprises two components: one that capitalizes on word distribution to identify homogeneous units that are topically cohesive, and a second component that analyzes conversational features of meeting transcripts that are indicative of topic shifts, like silences, overlaps, and speaker changes.
    We show that integrating features from both components with a probabilistic classifier (induced with c4.5rules) is very effective in improving performance.
    In Section 2, we review previous approaches to the segmentation problem applied to spoken and written documents.
    In Section 3, we describe the corpus of recorded meetings int
