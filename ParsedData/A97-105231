given predicate built from successful parses and records the number of observations of each subcategorization class.
    Patterns provide several types of information which can be used to rank or select between patterns in the patternset for a given sentence exemplifying an instance of a predicate, such as the ranking of the parse from which it was extracted or the proportion of subanalyses supporting a specific pattern.
    Currently, we simply select the pattern supported by the highest ranked parse.
    However, we are experimenting with alternative approaches.
    The resulting set of putative classes for a predicate are filtered, following Brent (1993), by hypothesis testing on binomial frequency data.
    Evaluating putative entries on binomial frequency data requires that we record the total number of patternsets n for a given predicate, and the number of these patternsets containing a pattern supporting an entry for given class m. These figures are straightforwardly computed from the output of the cla
