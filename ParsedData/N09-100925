 is also the highest in the bilingual setting, with TIEA and TIEV&amp;N.
  
  
    In future work we plan to lexicalize the model, including a Bayesian grammar prior that accounts for the syntactic patterns of words.
    Nonparametric models (Teh, 2006) may be appropriate.
    We also believe that Bayesian discovery of cross-linguistic patterns is an exciting topic worthy of further exploration.
  
  
    We described a Bayesian model that allows soft parameter tying among any weights in a probabilistic grammar.
    We used this model to improve unsupervised parsing accuracy on two different languages, English and Chinese, achieving state-of-the-art results.
    We also showed how our model can be effectively used to simultaneously learn grammars in two languages from non-parallel multilingual data.
