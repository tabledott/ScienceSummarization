selines: One alternative to our approach is admit instances on the Web using literal search queries.
    We investigated this technique but discarded it due to subtle yet critical issues with pattern canonicalization that resulted in rejecting nearly all inferences.
    However, we are investigating other ways of using Web corpora for this task.
    For each ISP algorithm and parameter combination, we constructed a confusion matrix on the development set and computed the system sensitivity, specificity and accuracy as described in Section 4.3.
    This resulted in 180 experiments on the development set.
    For each ISP algorithm and semantic class source, we selected the best parameter combinations according to the following criteria: textual entailment researchers have commented that inference rule collections like DIRT are difficult to use due to low precision.
    Many have asked for filtered versions that remove incorrect inferences even at the cost of removing correct inferences.
    In response, we sho
