    Several approaches to multi-engine machine translation systems have been proposed over the past decade.
    The Pangloss system and work by several other researchers attempted to combine lattices from many different MT systems (Frederking et Nirenburg 1994, Frederking et al 1997; Tidhar &amp; K&#252;ssner 2000; Lavie, Probst et al. 2004).
    These systems suffer from requiring cooperation from all the systems to produce compatible lattices as well as the hard research problem of standardizing confidence scores that come from the individual engines.
    In 2001, Bangalore et al used string alignments between the different translations to train a finite state machine to produce a consensus translation.
    The alignment algorithm described in that work, which only allows insertions, deletions and substitutions, does not accurately capture long range phrase movement.
    In this paper, we propose a new way of combining the translations of multiple MT systems based on a more versatile word alignment
