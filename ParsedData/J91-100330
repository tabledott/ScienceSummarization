onymy interpretation also.
    Using Searle's (1979) views on metaphor as an example, he characterizes the typical model for detecting nonliteral meaning as a three-stage process: [11 compute the literal meaning of a sentence, [21 decide if the literal meaning is defective, and if so, [3] seek an alternative meaning, i.e., a metaphorical one (though, presumably, a metonymic interpretation might also be sought at this stage).
    Gibbs (1984, p. 275) concludes that the distinction between literal and metaphoric meanings has &amp;quot;little psychological validity.&amp;quot; Among AT researchers, Martin (1990) shares many of Gibbs's views in criticizing the &amp;quot;literal meaning first approach&amp;quot; (ibid., p. 24).
    Martin suggests a two-stage process for interpreting sentences containing metaphors: [1] parse the sentence to produce a syntactic parse tree plus primal (semantic) representation, and [21 apply inference processes of &amp;quot;concretion&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;metaphoric viewing&amp;quo
