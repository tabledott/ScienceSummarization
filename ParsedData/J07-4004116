    With the default annotation the relation between is and parent would be dobj, whereas in DepBank the argument of the copular is analyzed as an xcomp.
    Table 15 gives some examples of how we attempt to deal with this problem.
    The constraint in the first example means that, whenever the word associated with the transitive verb category is a form of be, the second argument is xcomp, otherwise the default case applies (in this case dobj).
    There are a number of categories with similar constraints, checking whether the word associated with the category is a form of be.
    The second type of constraint, shown in the third line of the table, checks the lexical category of the word filling the argument slot.
    In this example, if the lexical category of the preposition is PP/NP, then the second argument of (S[dcl]\NP)/PP maps to iobj; thus in The loss stems from several factors the relation between the verb and preposition is (iobj stems from).
    If the lexical category of th
