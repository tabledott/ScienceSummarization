  Automatic Processing of Large Corpora fbr the Resolution of Anaphor  References Ido Dagan * Alon Itai Computer Science Department Technion, tIaifa, Israel dagan~techunix .b i tnet ,  i ta i~ cs.technion, ac.il Abstract Manual acquisition of semantic onstraints in broad domains is very expensive.
  This paper presents an automatic scheme for collecting statistics on cooc- currence patterns in a large corpus.
  To a large ex- tent, these statistics reflect, semantic onstraints and thus are used to disambiguate anaphora references and syntactic ambiguities.
  The scherne was imple- mented by gathering statistics on the output of other linguistic tools.
  An experiment was performed to resolve references of the pronoun "it" in sentences that were randomly selected from the corpus.
  Ttle results of the experiment show that in most of the cases the cooccurrence statistics indeed reflect the semantic onstraints and thus provide a basis {or a useful disambiguat.ion tool.
