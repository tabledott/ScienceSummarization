 in turn computed as the inner product of a high-dimensional feature representation of the edge with a corresponding weight vector, This is a standard linear classifier in which the weight vector w are the parameters to be learned during training.
    We should note that f(i, j) can be based on arbitrary features of the edge and the input sequence x.
    Given a directed graph G = (V, E), the maximum spanning tree (MST) problem is to find the highest scoring subgraph of G that satisfies the tree constraint over the vertices V .
    By defining a graph in which the words in a sentence are the vertices and there is a directed edge between all words with a score as calculated above, McDonald et al. (2005c) showed that dependency parsing is equivalent to finding the MST in this graph.
    Furthermore, it was shown that this formulation can lead to state-of-the-art results when combined with discriminative learning algorithms.
    Although the MST formulation applies to any directed graph, our feature representati
