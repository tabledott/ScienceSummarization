ifference between the versions with and without constraints.
    Example 1 shows the additional compression obtained by using our special rules.
    Figure 2 shows the parse trees of the original pair of short and long versions.
    The relevant expansion is NP &#8594; NP1 , PP in the long version and simply NP1 in the short version.
    The supervised version that includes the special rules learned this particular common special joint rule from the training data and could apply it to the example case.
    This supervised version compresses better than either version of the supervised noisy-channel model that lacks these rules.
    The unsupervised version does not compress at all, whereas the semi-supervised version is identical with the better supervised version.
    Example 2 shows how unsupervised and semisupervised techniques can be used to improve compression.
    Although the final length of the sentences is roughly the same, the unsupervised and semisupervised versions are able to take the action of d
