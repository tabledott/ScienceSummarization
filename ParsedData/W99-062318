 hybridization.
    For each experiment we gave an nonparametric and a parametric technique for combining parsers.
    All four of the techniques studied result in parsing systems that perform better than any previously reported.
    Both of the switching techniques, as well as the parametric hybridization technique were also shown to be robust when a poor parser was introduced into the experiments.
    Through parser combination we have reduced the precision error rate by 30% and the recall error rate by 6% compared to the best previously published result.
    Combining multiple highly-accurate independent parsers yields promising results.
    We plan to explore more powerful techniques for exploiting the diversity of parsing methods.
  
  
    We would like to thank Eugene Charniak, Michael Collins, and Adwait Ratnaparkhi for enabling all of this research by providing us with their parsers and helpful comments.
