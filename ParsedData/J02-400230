 we describe in section 4.
    Noisy and unreliably annotated training material will very likely deteriorate the classification performance.
    In inherently subjective tasks, it is also common practice to consider human performance as an upper bound.
    The theoretically best performance of a system is reached if agreement among a pool of human annotators does not decrease when the system is added to the pool.
    This is so because an automatic process cannot do any better in this situation than to be indistinguishable from human performance.
    The annotated development corpus consists of 80 conference articles in computational linguistics (12,188 sentences; 285,934 words).
    It is part of a larger corpus of 260 articles (1.1 million words) that we collected from the CMP LG archive (CMP LG 1994).
    The appendix lists the 80 articles (archive numbers, titles and authors) of our development corpus; it consists of the 80 chronologically oldest articles in the larger corpus, containing articles deposite
