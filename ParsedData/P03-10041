Support Vector Machines (Vapnik, 1995)) attract a great deal of attention recently.
    In the field of Natural Language Processing, many successes have been reported.
    Examples include Part-of-Speech tagging (Nakagawa et al., 2002) Text Chunking (Kudo and Matsumoto, 2001), Named Entity Recognition (Isozaki and Kazawa, 2002), and Japanese Dependency Parsing (Kudo and Matsumoto, 2000; Kudo and Matsumoto, 2002).
    It is known in NLP that combination of features contributes to a significant improvement in accuracy.
    For instance, in the task of dependency parsing, it would be hard to confirm a correct dependency relation with only a single set of features from either a head or its modifier.
    Rather, dependency relations should be determined by at least information from both of two phrases.
    In previous research, feature combination has been selected manually, and the performance significantly depended on these selections.
    This is not the case with kernel-based methodology.
    For instance, if
