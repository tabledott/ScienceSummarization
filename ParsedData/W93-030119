f exactly one connection for each relevant French position (the irrelevant positions are ignored).
    To model the dependency between connections in an alignment, we assume that the offset of a connection is determined relative to the preceding connection in A, instead of relative to the initial alignment, I.
    For this purpose, we define A' (j) as a linear extrapolation from the preceding connection in A: where previ is the last French position before j which is aligned by A and NE and NF are the lengths of the English and French corpora.
    A'(j) thus predicts the connection of j, knowing the connection of jprey and assuming that the two languages have the same word order.
