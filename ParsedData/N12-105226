 well the direct transfer NER systems are able to detect entity boundaries (ignoring the entity categories).
    Here, on average, the best clusters provide a 24% relative error reduction on the test set (75.8 vs. 68.1 FI).
    To our knowledge there are no comparable results on transfer learning of NER systems.
    Based on the results of this first attempt at this scenario, we believe that transfer learning by multilingual word clusters could be developed into a practical way to construct NER systems for resource poor languages.
  
  
    In the first part of this study, we showed that word clusters induced from a simple class-based language model can be used to significantly improve on stateof-the-art supervised dependency parsing and NER for a wide range of languages and even across language families.
    Although the improvements vary between languages, the addition of word cluster features never has a negative impact on performance.
    This result has important practical consequences as it allows pract
