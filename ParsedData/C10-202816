Many tweets include more than a single tag and 3852 ?frequent?
			tags appear in more than 1000 different tweets.
			Two human judges manually annotated these frequenttags into five different categories: 1 ? strong sen timent (e.g #sucks in the example above), 2 ?most likely sentiment (e.g., #notcute), 3 ? contextdependent sentiment (e.g., #shoutsout), 4 ? fo cused sentiment (e.g., #tmobilesucks where the target of the sentiment is part of the hashtag), and 5 ? no sentiment (e.g. #obama).
			Table 1 shows annotation results and the percentage of similarly assigned values for each category.
			We selected 50 hashtags annotated ?1?
			or ?2?by both judges.
			For each of these tags we automatically sampled 1000 tweets resulting in 50000 la beled tweets.
			We avoided sampling tweets which include more than one of the sampled hashtags.
			As a no-sentiment dataset we randomly sampled 10000 tweets with no hashtags/smileys from thewhole dataset assuming that such a random sam ple is unlikely to contain a significa
