nal step, head-finding, is actually required by some of the previous steps in certain cases; in our implementation, we selectively employ a head-finding module during the first 10 steps where necessary.
    A few of the preprocessing steps rely on the notion of a coordinated phrase.
    In this article, the conditions under which a phrase is considered coordinated are slightly more detailed than is described in Collins&#8217; thesis.
    A node represents a coordinated phrase if In the Penn Treebank, a coordinating conjunction is any preterminal node with the label CC.
    This definition essentially picks out all phrases in which the head-child is truly conjoined to some other phrase, as opposed to a phrase in which, say, there is an initial CC, such as an S that begins with the conjunction but.
    As a preprocessing step, pruning of unnecessary nodes simply removes preterminals that should have little or no bearing on parser performance.
    In the case of the English Treebank, the pruned subtrees are all
