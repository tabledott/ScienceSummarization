d text is available, the one-at-a-time, characterbased approach could indeed be a worthwhile compromise, performing only slightly worse than the all-at-once approach.
    Table 1 summarizes the methods investigated in this paper.
    Total testing time includes both word segmentation and POS tagging on 10% of CTB data.
    Note that an all-atonce, word-based approach is not applicable as word segmentation requires character features to determine the word boundaries.
  
  
    Word-based or character-based?
    The findings that a character-based approach is better than a word-based approach for Chinese POS tagging is not too surprising.
    Unlike in English where each English letter by itself does not possess any meaning, many Chinese characters have well defined meanings.
    For example, the single Chinese character &#8220;0&#8221; means &#8220;know&#8221;.
