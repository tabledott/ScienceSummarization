 character to Pinyin mapping is unique while Pinyin to character mapping could be one to many.
    Since we have obtained results in character already, we expect less Pinyin error than character error should a character-to-Pinyin mapping be needed.
  
  
    In this paper, we propose a new framework (DOM) for transliteration. n-gram TM is a successful realization of DOM paradigm.
    It generates probabilistic orthographic transformation rules using a data driven approach.
    By skipping the intermediate phonemic interpretation, the transliteration error rate is reduced significantly.
    Furthermore, the bilingual aligning process is integrated into the decoding process in n-gram TM, which allows us to achieve a joint optimization of alignment and transliteration automatically.
    Unlike other related work where pre-alignment is needed, the new framework greatly reduces the development efforts of machine transliteration systems.
