 words in French.
    For example, the tagging The accident was a tragedy/cALAmnv would yield L'accident etait une catastrophe/CALAMITY.
    As a result, a large number of French words will receive tags from the English sense inventory.
  
  
    In order to provide a useful formal evaluation of this approach for English sense disambiguation, there were three requirements.
    We needed: Meeting all three requirements simultaneously presented something of a challenge.
    There are a few human-tagged English corpora available for word sense disambiguation, but most are relatively small by model-training standards and none have associated translations in other languages.
    Conversely, there are some parallel corpora large enough for training alignment models, but to our knowledge none of these have been even partially sense tagged.
    To solve this problem, we adopted a &amp;quot;pseudotranslation&amp;quot; approach (Diab, 2000).
    A suitably large English corpus is constructed, containing as a subset an
