  A Fast Algorithm for the Generation of Referring Expressions Abst rac t We simplify previous work in the development of algorithms for the generation of referring expre~ sions while at the same time taking account of psy- cholinguistic findings and transcript data.
  The result is a straightforward algorithm that is computation- ally tractable, sensitive to the preferences of human users, and reasonably domain-independent.
  We pro- vide a specification of the resources a host system must provide in order to make use of the algorithm, and describe an implementation used in the IDAS sys- tem.
  In t roduct ion In previous work [Da189,DH91,Rei90a,Rei90b] we have proposed algorithms for determining the con- tent of referring expressions.
  Scrutiny of the psy- cholinguistics literature and transcripts of human di- alogues hows that in a number of respects the be- haviour of these algorithms does not correspond to what people do.
  In particular, as compared to these algorithms, human speakers pay far less att
