    In this and subsequent tables, we list the word count for the test corpus, test recall (R), test precision (P), F score1, the out-of-vocabulary (OOV) rate for the test corpus, the recall on OOV words (R ), and the recall on in-vocabulary (R ) words.
    Per normal usage, OOV is defined as the set of words in the test corpus not occurring in the training corpus.2 We expect systems to do at least as well as this baseline.
    As a nominal topline we ran the same maximum matching experiments, but this time populating the dictionary only with words from the test corpus; this is of course a &#8220;cheating&#8221; experiment since one could not reasonably know exactly the set of words that occur in the test corpus.
    Since this is better than one could hope for in practice, we would expect systems to generally underperform this topline.
    The results of this &#8220;cheating&#8221; experiment are given in Table 4.3 Results for the closed tests are presented in Tables 5&#8211;8.
