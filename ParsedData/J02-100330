rithm deals with disjunctions of length 2, Phase 3 deals with disjunctions of length 3, and so on.
    Optimizations may be applied to shorten the resulting descriptions.
    For instance, a description of the form (P U Q) n (P U R) can be simplified to (P U (Q n R)) using standard algorithms (e.g., McCluskey 1965).
    Such optimizations, however, are less urgent than in the case of the more verbose descriptions generated using Satellite sets (see above), and we will disregard optimizations here.
    A schematic presentation may be useful, in which P+1_ stands for any literal, that is, any atomic property or its negation.
    (Different occurrences of P+1_ denote potentially different literals.)
    The length of a property will equal the number of literals van Deemter Generating Referring Expressions occurring in it.
    We will say that a D&amp;RPlural phase uses a set of properties X if it loops through the properties in X (i.e., X takes the place of P in the original D&amp;RPlural).
