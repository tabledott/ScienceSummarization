 more training sentences produce both a longer rule sequence and a larger error reduction in the test data.
    Upon inspection of the English segmentation errors produced by both the maximum matching algorithm and the learned transformation sequences, one major category of errors became clear.
    Most apparent was the fact that the limited context transformations were unable to recover from many errors introduced by the naive maximum matching algorithm.
    For example, because the greedy algorithm always looks for the longest string of characters which can be a word, given the character sequence &amp;quot;economicsituation&amp;quot; , the greedy algorithm first recognized &amp;quot;economics&amp;quot; and several shorter words, segmenting the sequence as &amp;quot;economics it u at io n&amp;quot;.
    Since our transformations consider only a single character of context, the learning algorithm was unable to patch the smaller segments back together to produce the desired output &amp;quot;economic situation&
