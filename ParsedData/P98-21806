 linked to every word that appears in them.
    Such an inverted structure, produced from a definition for motorist and linked to the entry for car (appearing as the root of the inverted structure), is shown in the figure below: Researchers who produced spreading activation networks from MRDs, including Veronis and Ide (1990) and Kozima and Furugori (1993), typically only implemented forward links (from headwords to their definition words) in those networks.
    Words were not related backward to any of the headwords whose definitions mentioned them, and words co-occurring in the same definition were not related directly.
    In the fully inverted structures stored in MindNet, however, all words are cross-linked, no matter where they appear.
    The massive network of inverted semrel structures contained in MindNet invalidates the criticism leveled against dictionary-based methods by Yarowsky (1992) and Ide and Veronis (1993) that LKBs created from MRDs provide spotty coverage of a language at best.
