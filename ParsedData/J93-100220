of heterogeneity in the training corpus, and so forth.
    Fujisaki et al. report some results based on testing the parser on the corpus used for training.
    In 72 out of 84 sentences examined, the most probable analysis was also the correct analysis.
    Of the remainder, 6 were false positives and did not receive a correct parse, while the other 6 did but it was not the most probable.
    A success rate (per sentence) of 85% is apparently impressive, but it is difficult to evaluate properly in the absence of full details concerning the nature of the corpus.
    For example, if the corpus contains many simple and similar constructions, unsupervised training is more likely to converge quickly on a useful set of probabilities.
    Sharman, Jelinek, and Mercer (1990) conducted a similar experiment with a grammar in ID/LP format (Gazdar et al. 1985; Sharman 1989).
    ID/LP grammars separate the two types of information encoded in CF rules&#8212;immediate dominance and immediate precedence&#8212;into two rule
