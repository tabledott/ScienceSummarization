n, in order to describe the structures used in FTAGs.
  Finally, in Section 4, we summarize the work presented in this paper.
  1.1 In t roduct ion  to  T ree  Ad jo in ing  Grammars Tree Adjoining Grammars (TAG), unlike other grammatical systems used in computational linguistics, is a tree rewriting system.
  Unlike the string rewriting formalisms which writes recursion into the rules that generate the phrase structure, a TAG factors reeursion and dependencies into a finite set of elementary trees.
  The elementary trees in a TAG correspond to minimal inguistic structures that localize the dependencies such as agreement, subcategorization, a d filler-gap.
  There are two kinds of el- enrentary trees: the initial trees and auxiliary trees.
  The initial trees roughly (Figure 1) correspond to simple sentences.
  Thus, the root of an initial trce is labelled by the symbol S. They are required to have a frontier made up of terminals.
  The auxiliary trees (Figure 2) correspond roughly to minimal recur- sive cons
