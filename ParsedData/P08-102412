eference translation from the source.
    The derivations in this chart are a subset of those in the full derivation chart.
    Again, we use the inside-outside algorithm to find the &#8216;reference&#8217; feature expectations from this chart.
    These expectations are analogous to the empirical observation of maximum entropy classifiers.
    Given these two charts we can calculate the loglikelihood of the reference translation as the insidescore from the sentence spanning cell of the reference chart, normalised by the inside-score of the spanning cell from the full chart.
    The gradient is calculated as the difference of the feature expectations of the two charts.
    Clark and Curran (2004) provides a more complete discussion of parsing with a loglinear model and latent variables.
    The full derivation chart is produced using a CYK parser in the same manner as Chiang (2005), and has complexity O(|e|3).
    We produce the reference chart by synchronously parsing the source and reference sentences using
