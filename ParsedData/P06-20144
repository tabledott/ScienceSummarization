Foreign.
    When this occurs, the alignment is said to maintain phrasal cohesion.
    Fox (2002) measured phrasal cohesion in gold standard alignments by counting crossings.
    Crossings occur when the projections of two disjoint phrases overlap.
    For example, Figure 1 shows a head-modifier crossing: the projection of the the tax subtree, imp&#710;ot ... le, is interrupted by the projection of its head, cause.
    Alignments with no crossings maintain phrasal cohesion.
    Fox&#8217;s experiments show that cohesion is generally maintained for French-English, and that dependency trees produce the highest degree of cohesion among the tested structures.
    Cherry and Lin (2003) use the phrasal cohesion of a dependency tree as a constraint on a beam search aligner.
    This constraint produces a significant reduction in alignment error rate.
    However, as Fox (2002) showed, even in a language pair as close as French-English, there are situations where phrasal cohesion should not be maintained.
