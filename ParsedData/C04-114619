 relation of hyponymy, where a hypernym is a semantically more general term and a hyponym is a semantically more specificterm.
			For example, animal is an (indirect1) hypernym of dog and conversely dog is an (indi rect) hyponym of animal.
			Although one can obviously think of counter-examples, we would generally expect that the more specific term dog can only be used in contexts where animal can be used and that the more general term animal might be used in all of the contexts where dogis used and possibly others.
			Thus, we might ex pect that distributional generality is correlated with semantic generality ? a word has high recall/low precision retrieval of its hyponyms?co-occurrences and high precision/low recall re trieval of its hypernyms?
			co-occurrences.
			Thus, if n1 and n2 are related and P(n2, n1) &gt;R(n2, n1), we might expect that n2 is a hy ponym of n1 and vice versa.
			However, having discussed a connection between frequency and distributional generality, we might also expect to find that
