ncludes the information that X dominates A.
    From this initial configuration, a wide variety of moves may be made.
    We examine several changes and the cue phrases that can indicate each of them.
    Because these phrases and words in isolation may ambiguously play either discourse or other functional roles, we also discuss the other uses whenever appropriate.
    Furthermore, cue phrases do not function unambiguously with respect to a particular discourse role.
    Thus for example, first can be used for two different moves that we discuss below.
    First, consider what happens when the ICP shifts to a new DSP, B, that is dominated by A (and correspondingly by X).
    The dominance relationship between A and B becomes part of the intentional structure.
    In addition, the change in DSP results in a change in the focus stack.
    The focus stack models this change, which we call new dominance, by a having new space pushed onto the stack with B as the DSP of that space (as illustrated in Figure 11).
