    This paper has discussed the communication between syntactic, semantic and pragmatic modules that is necessary for making implicit linguistic information explicit.
    The key is letting syntax and semantics recognize missing linguistic entities as implicit entities, so that they can be marked as such, and reference resolution can be directed to find specific referents for the entities.
    Implicit entities may be either empty syntactic constituents in sentence fragments or unfilled semantic roles associated with domain-specific verb decompo5itions.
    In this way the task of making implicit information explicit becomes a subset of the tasks performed by reference resolut
