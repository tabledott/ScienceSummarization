stitutes such a use is somewhat inconsistently marked.
    It is as yet unclear just to what degree these tagging errors in the corpus are affecting our results.
  
  
    This work presents a method for assigning function tags to text that has been parsed to the simple label level.
    Because of the lack of prior research on this task, we are unable to compare our results to those of other researchers; but the results do seem promising.
    However, a great deal of future work immediately suggests itself: &#8226; Although we tested twenty or so feature trees besides the one given in figure 4, the space of possible trees is still rather unexplored.
    A more systematic investigation into the advantages of different feature trees would be useful.
    &#8226; We could add to the feature tree the values of other categories of function tag, or the function tags of various tree-relatives (parent, sibling).
    &#8226; One of the weaknesses of the lexical features is sparse data; whereas the part of speech is too
