, the result ing structure is copied and then the original feature sets are then restored.
  The copied result remains of course unaffected by the cancellation.
  The following sketch summarizes the difference between I) PATI{ and earl ier versions of Z.PATR with respect to copying and unification.
  Here X and v stand for the original feature sets, z for the result, and the copied structures are identified with primes.

  D-PATR x restore X un i fy  ~&gt; Z copy -~, Z y restore Y As the i l lustration shows, the new me~,hod entails making only one copy, not two, when the operation succeeds.
  In the event of failure, 1) IATR simply restores the original structures without copying anything; the old method always copies both input structures.
  In the case of Z-PATR, the new method has shortened parsing times by a factor of three.
  It is expected that this technique can be further improved by hnplcmenting some fmm of structure sharing [Karttunen :~nd Kay 1985; Pereira 1.9851 to minimize t
