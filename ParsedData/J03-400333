 model.
    This section describes how punctuation is integrated into the generative models.
    Our first step is to raise punctuation as high in the parse trees as possible.
    Punctuation at the beginning or end of sentences is removed from the training/test data altogether.13 All punctuation items apart from those tagged as comma or colon (items such as quotation marks and periods, tagged &#8220; &#8221; or . ) are removed altogether.
    These transformations mean that punctuation always appears between two nonterminals, as opposed to appearing at the end of a phrase.
    (See Figure 10 for an example.)
    A parse tree before and after punctuation transformations.
    13 As one of the anonymous reviewers of this article pointed out, this choice of discarding the sentence-final punctuation may not be optimal, as the final punctuation mark may well carry useful information about the sentence structure.
    Punctuation is then treated in a very similar way to coordination: Our intuition is that there is a
