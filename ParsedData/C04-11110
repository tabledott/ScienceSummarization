	Towards Terascale Semantic Acquisition
		Although vast amounts of textual data are freely available, many NLP algorithms exploit only a minute percentage of it.
		In this paper, we study the challenges of working at the terascale.
		We present an algorithm, designed for the terascale, for mining is-a relations that achieves similar performance to a state-of-the-art linguistically-rich method.
		We focus on the accuracy of these two systems as a func tion of processing time and corpus size.
	
	
			The Natural Language Processing (NLP) com munity has recently seen a growth in corpus-based methods.
			Algorithms light in linguistic theories but rich in available training data have been successfully applied to several applications such as ma chine translation (Och and Ney 2002), information extraction (Etzioni et al 2004), and question an swering (Brill et al 2001).
			In the last decade, we have seen an explosion in the amount of available digital text resources.
			It is estimated that the Internet contains h
