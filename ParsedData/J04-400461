f the unpublished details are, most likely, interacting.
    However, we note that certain individual details, such as the universal p(w It) model, do appear to have a much more marked effect on overall parsing accuracy than others.
    The previous section accounts for the noticeable effects of all the unpublished details of Collins&#8217; model.
    But what of the details that were published?
    In chapter 8 of his thesis, Collins gives an account on the motivation of various features of his model, including the distance metric, the model&#8217;s use of subcats (and their interaction with the distance metric), and structural versus semantic preferences.
    In the discussion of this last issue, Collins points to the fact that structural preferences&#8212;which, in his model, are 33 These F-measures and the differences between them were calculated from experiments presented in Collins (1999, page 201); these experiments, unlike those on which our reported numbers are based, were on all sentences, not just
