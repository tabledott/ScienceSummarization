			If the word and its parent in the dependency tree share an obj, adj, mod, or vmod relationship, the modifies polarity feature is set to the prior polarity of the word?s parent (if the parent is not in our prior-polarity lexicon, its prior polarity is set to neutral).
			The modified by polarity featureis similar, looking for adj, mod, and vmod relation ships and polarity clues within the word?s children.

			Figure 1 helps to illustrate these features: modifies polarity isnegative for the word ?substantial,?
			modified by po larity is positive for the word ?challenge,?
			and conj polarity is negative for the word ?good.?
			The last three polarity features look in a window of four words before, searching for the presence ofparticular types of polarity influencers.
