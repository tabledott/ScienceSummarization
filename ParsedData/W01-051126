 for each noun in the compound.
    We also plan to compare the results to the tree cut algorithm reported in (Li and Abe, 1998), which allows different levels to be identified for different subtrees.
    We also plan to tackle the problem of noun compounds containing more than two terms.
  
  
    We would like to thank Nu Lai for help with the classification of the noun compound relations.
