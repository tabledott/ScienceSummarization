 feature value fj(xi, yz ).
    In this paper, the expectations in Eq.
    10 are computed by the forwardbackward algorithm generalized to lattices.
    We emphasize that the function ,GN is not globally concave; our search will lead only to a local optimum.3 Therefore, as with all unsupervised statistical learning, the bias in the initialization of B will affect the quality of the estimate and the performance of the method.
    In future we might wish to apply techniques for avoiding local optima, such as deterministic annealing (Smith and Eisner, 2004).
  
  
    We next consider some non-classical neighborhood functions for sequences.
    When X = E+ for some symbol alphabet E, certain kinds of neighborhoods have natural, compact representations.
    Given an input string x = (x1, x2, ..., xm), we write xji for the substring (xi, xi+1, ..., xj) and xm1 for the whole string.
    Consider first the neighborhood consisting of all sequences generated by deleting a single symbol from the m-length sequence xm1 :
