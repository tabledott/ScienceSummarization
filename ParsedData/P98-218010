words that similar words have in common.
    Syntagmatic strategies for determining similarity have often been based on statistical analyses of large corpora that yield clusters of words occurring in similar bigram and trigram contexts (e.g., Brown et al. 1992, Yarowsky 1992), as well as in similar predicateargument structure contexts (e.g., Grishman and Sterling 1994).
    There have been a number of attempts to combine paradigmatic and syntagmatic similarity strategies (e.g., Hearst and Grefenstette 1992, Resnik 1995).
    However, none of these has completely integrated both syntagmatic and paradigmatic information into a single repository, as is the case with MindNet.
    The MindNet similarity procedure is based on the top-ranked (by weight) semrel paths between words.
    For example, some of the top semrel paths in MindNet between pen and pencil, are shown below: penf--Means--draw&#8212;Means--4pencil penf-Means&#8212;write&#8212;Means-&gt;pencil pen&#8212;Hyp-4instrument*-Hyp&#8212;pencil pen&#8212;Hy
