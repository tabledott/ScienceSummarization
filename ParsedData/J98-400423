n this two-tree corpus that we applied to the previous corpora to investigate the effect of this relabeling on the PCFG modeling of PP attachment structures.
    The counts C4 and the nonunit production probability estimates P4 for the PCFG induced from this two-tree corpus are as follows: As in the previous subsection P4(A4) &lt;f and P4(B4) &lt; (1 -f).
    Again, we calculate the estimated relative frequencies of (A4) and (B4) under P4.
    The relationship between f and .11 is plotted in Figure 4.
    The value of 1.4 can diverge from f, just like the other estimates.
    For example, at f = 0.48 fi = 0.46, which is closer to f than any of the other relative frequency estimates presented earlier.
    (However, for f less than approximately 0.38, the relative frequency estimate using the Chomsky adjunction representations j2 is closer to f than f4).
    Thus as expected, increasing the context information in the form of an enriched node-labeling scheme can improve the performance of a PCFG language model.
