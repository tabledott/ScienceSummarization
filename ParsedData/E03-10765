ve study of such transformations is carried out by Langer [1998] for German.
    To summarize: We try to cover the entire length of the compound with known words and fillers between words.
    An algorithm to break up words in such a manner could be implemented using dynamic programming, but since computational complexity is not a problem, we employ an exhaustive recursive search.
    To speed up word matching, we store the known words in a hash based on the first three letters.
    Also, we restrict known words to words of at least length three.
    For the word Aktionsplan, we find the following splitting options: We arrive at these splitting options, since all the parts &#8212; aktionsplan, aktions, aktion, akt, ion, and plan &#8212; have been observed as whole words in the training corpus.
    These splitting options are the basis of our work.
    In the following we discuss methods that pick one of them as the correct splitting of the compound.
