h document is characterized by one feature, the count of all PSE instances (regardless of type) in the document, normalized by document length in words.
    The distance between two documents is simply the absolute value of the difference between the normalized PSE counts for the two documents.
    With leave-one-out cross-validation, the set of n documents to be classified is divided into a training set of size n&#8722;1 and a validation set of size 1.
    The one document in the validation set is then classified according to the majority classification of its k closest-neighbor documents in the training set.
    This process is repeated until every document is classified.
    Which value to use for k is chosen during a preprocessing phase.
    During the preprocessing phase, we run the KNN algorithm with leave-one-out cross-validation on a separate training set, for odd values of k from 1 to 15.
    The value of k that results in the best classification during the preprocessing phase is the one used for lat
