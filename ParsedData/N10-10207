    Twitter&#8217;s noisy style makes processing Twitter text more difficult than other domains.
    While moving to a new domain (e.g. biomedical text) is a challenging task, at least the new words found in the vocabulary are limited mostly to verbs and nouns, while function words remain constant.
    On Twitter, even closed-class words such as prepositions and pronouns are spelled in many different ways.
  
  
    We propose two models to discover dialogue acts in an unsupervised manner.
    An ideal model will give insight into the sorts of conversations that happen on Twitter, while providing a useful tool for later processing.
    We first introduce the summarization technology we apply to this task, followed by two Bayesian extensions.
    Our base model structure is inspired by the content model proposed by Barzilay and Lee (2004) for multi-document summarization.
    Their sentencelevel HMM discovers the sequence of topics used to describe a particular type of news event, such
