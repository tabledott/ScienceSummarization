he corpus (6 is a parameter, tuned for our corpus.
    In some cases the similarity method identifies less than 6 similar words).
    Having an estimate for the mutual information of a pair, we can estimate its expected frequency in a corpus of the given size using a variation of equation 2: In our example, f (chapter) = 395, N = 8, 871, 126 and d = 3, getting a similarity based estimate of I (chapter, describes) = 3.15.
    This value is much higher than the frequency based estimate (0.037), reflecting the plausibility of the specific combination of words'.
    On the other hand, the similarity based estimate for f (chapter, knows) is 0.124, which is identical to the frequency based estimate, reflecting the fact that there is no expected association between the two words (notice that the frequency based estimate is higher for the second pair, due to the higher frequency of `knows').
  
  
    Assume that we need to determine the degree of similarity between two words, wi and w2.
    Recall that if we decide
