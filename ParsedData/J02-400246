    Distribution of rhetorical categories (relevant sentences).
  
  
    We now describe an automatic system that can perform extraction and classification of rhetorical status on unseen text (cf. also a prior version of the system reported in Teufel and Moens [2000] and Teufel [1999]).
    We decided to use machine learning to perform this extraction and classification, based on a variety of sentential features similar to the ones reported in the sentence extraction literature.
    Human annotation is used as training material such that the associations between these sentential features and the target sentences can be learned.
    It is also used as gold standard for intrinsic system evaluation.
    A simpler machine learning approach using only word frequency information and no other features, as typically used in tasks like text classification, could have been employed (and indeed Nanba and Okumura [1999] do so for classifying c
