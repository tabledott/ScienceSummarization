also considered more complex syntactic features, we are not able to generate such features for Romanian as they require tools currently not available for this language.
    We create two classifiers, one trained on each data set.
    The quality of the classifiers is evaluated on the 504-sentence Romanian gold-standard corpus described above.
    Recall that the baseline on this data set is 54.16%, the percentage of sentences in the corpus that are subjective.
    Table 7 shows the results. fier using training data obtained via projections from data automatically labeled by OpinionFinder (OF).
    Our best classifier has an F-measure of 67.85, and is obtained by training on projections from the high-coverage OpinionFinder annotations.
    Although smaller than the 74.70 F-measure obtained by the English high-coverage classifier (see Table 5), the result appears remarkable given that no language-specific Romanian information was used.
    The overall results obtained with the machine learning approach are cons
