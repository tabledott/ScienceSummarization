onrecursive NPs (from here on referred to as base-NPs and labeled NPB rather than NP) as NPs that do not directly dominate an NP themselves, unless the dominated NP is a possessive NP (i.e., it directly dominates a POS-tag POS).
    Figure 8 gives some examples.
    Base-NPs deserve special treatment for three reasons: &#8226; The boundaries of base-NPs are often strongly marked.
    In particular, the start points of base-NPs are often marked with a determiner or another distinctive item, such as an adjective.
    Because of this, the probability of generating the STOP symbol should be greatly increased when the previous modifier is, for example, a determiner.
    As they stand, the independence assumptions in the three models lose this information.
    The probability of NPB(dog) &#8594; DT(the) NN(dog) would be estimated as11 In making the independence assumption the model will fail to learn that the STOP symbol is very likely to follow a determiner.
    As a result, the model will assign unreasonably high
