#183;&#183; n [[Qm]] = {r}, where the properties Q1,...,Qm occur in P in the order indicated by the subscripts.
    Now either D&amp;R returns Success before it has inspected all of Q1, ... , Qm, or it reaches the point where all of Q1, ... , Qm have been inspected.
    This does not mean that all of Q1, ... , Qm have necessarily been included in L, since other properties in P may have been selected that cause some of Q1, ... , Qm not to remove any distractors.
    Yet, when all of Q1,...,Qm have been inspected, Success must have been achieved.
    To see this, let Desi be the description that results after processing (i.e., inspecting and possibly including) Qi.
    Then a proof by induction over van Deemter Generating Referring Expressions i shows that [[Desi]] c [[Q1]] n &#183; &#183; &#183; n [[Qi]], for all i &lt; m. (Consider the basic case, where i = 1, and assume that Q1 E&#65533; [[Des1]].
    Q1 was rejected, so it did not remove any distractors; hence, [[Des1]] c [[Q1]].
    The induction step is a
