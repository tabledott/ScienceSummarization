 first few iterations certainly leverage the transliteration, demonstrating that the propagation method works.
    However, we observe that the performance drops when more iterations are used, presumably due to noise introduced from more distantly connected nodes.
    Thus, a relatively conservative approach is to choose a high &#945; value, and run only a few iterations.
    Note, finally, that the CO method seems to be more stable than the MI method.
  
  
    In this paper we have discussed the problem of Chinese-English name transliteration as one component of a system to find matching names in comparable corpora.
    We have proposed two methods for transliteration, one that is more traditional and based on phonetic correspondences, and one that is based on word distributions and adopts methods from information retrieval.
    We have shown that both methods yield good results, and that even better results can be achieved by combining the methods.
    We have further showed that one can improve upon the c
