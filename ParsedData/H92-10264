probability of a sequence of sentences and their respec- tive interpretations (parse trees) occurring in the lan- guage, "P(S1 T1 $2 T2 ... S~ T~).
  The difficulty in applying probabilistic models to natu- 134 ral language is deciding what aspects of the sentence and the discourse are relevant o the model.
  Most previous probabilistic models of parsing assume the probabilities of sentences in a discourse are independent of other sen- tences.
  In fact, previous works have made much stronger independence assumptions.
  The P-CFG model consid- ers the probability of each constituent rule independent of all other constituents in the sentence.
  The Pearl [10] model includes a slightly richer model of context, allow- ing the probability of a constituent rule to depend upon the immediate parent of the rule and a part-of-speech tri- gram from the input sentence.
  But none of these models come close to incorporating enough context to disam- biguate many cases of ambiguity.
  A significant reason researchers have
