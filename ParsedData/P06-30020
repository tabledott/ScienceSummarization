  Unsupervised Part-Of-Speech Tagging Employing Efficient Graph Clustering
  
    An unsupervised part-of-speech (POS) tagging system that relies on graph clustering methods is described.
    Unlike in current state-of-the-art approaches, the kind and number of different tags is generated by the method itself.
    We compute and merge two partitionings of word graphs: one based on context similarity of high frequency words, another on log-likelihood statistics for words of lower frequencies.
    Using the resulting word clusters as a lexicon, a Viterbi POS tagger is trained, which is refined by a morphological component.
    The approach is evaluated on three different languages by measuring agreement with existing taggers.
  
  
    Assigning syntactic categories to words is an important pre-processing step for most NLP applications.
    Essentially, two things are needed to construct a tagger: a lexicon that contains tags for words and a mechanism to assign tags to running words in a text.
