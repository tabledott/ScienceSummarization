rent segment.
    Any other NP type provides a referential link if its index occurs in the immediately preceding FIC.
    The symbol NP in Figure 2 indicates boundaries assigned by the algorithm.
    Boundary (3.3,4.1) is assigned because the sole NP in 4.1, a number of people, refers to a new entity, one that cannot be inferred from any entity mentioned in 3.3.
    Boundary (8.4,9.1) results from the following facts about the NPs in 9.1: 1) the full NP the ladder is not referred to implicitly or explicitly in 8.4, 2) the third person pronoun he refers to an entity, the farmer, that was last mentioned in 3.3, and 3 NP boundaries have been assigned since then.
    If the farmer had been referred to anywhere in 7.1 through 8.4, no boundary would be assigned at (8.4,9.1).
    Figure 5 illustrates the three decision points of the algorithm.
    FIC n is the current clause (at location n); CD n is the set of all indices for NPs in FIC; Fn is the set of entities that are inferrentially linked to entities in CD,&#82
