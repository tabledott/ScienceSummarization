omplex languages (Finnish and Russian, for example) are not as satisfying in this respect.
  In these systems, lexical forms typically contain diacritic markers and special symbols; they are not real words in the language.
  For example, in Finnish the lexical counterpart of otin I took might be rendered as otTallln, where T, al, and I1 are an arbitrary encoding of morpho- logical alternations that determine the allomorphs of the stem and the past tense morpheme.
  The canonical citation form ottaa to take is composed from annotations on the leaf nodes of the letter trees that are linked to match the input.
  It is not in any direct way related to the lexical form produced by the transducers.
  (2) Morphological categories are not directly encoded as part of the lexical form.
  Instead of morphemes like Plural or Past, we typically see suffix strings like +s, and +ed, which do not by themselves indi- cate what morpheme they express.
  Different realizations of the same morpho- logical category are often repre
