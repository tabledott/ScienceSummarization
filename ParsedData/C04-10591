eloped to cope with this situation.
			In statistical machine translation we have a similar situation, i.e. estimate the model parameter from some data, and use the system to translate sentences which may not be well covered by the training data.
			Therefore, the potential of adaptation techniques needs to be explored for machine translation applications.
			Statistical machine translation is based on the noisy channel model, where the translation hypothesis is searched over the space defined by a translation model and a target language (Brown et al, 1993).
			Statistical machine translation can be formulated as follows: )()|(maxarg)|(maxarg* tPtsPstPt tt ?== where t is the target sentence, and s is the source sentence.
			P(t) is the target language model and P(s|t) is the translation model.
			The argmax operation is the search, which is done by the decoder.
			In the current study we modify the target language model P(t), to represent the test data better, and thereby improve the translation quality.
