a previously centered entity (e.g.
    Grosz [1977], Reichman [19851).
    In such cases additional inferences are required to determine that the pronoun does not refer to a member of the current forward-looking centers and to identify the context back to which attention is shifting.
    Further investigation is required to determine the linguistic cues (e.g., intonation or cue phrases [Grosz and Hirschberg 19921) and intentional information that are required to enable such shifts while preserving coherence, as well as the effect on inference load.
    A third complication arises in the application of Rule 1 in sequences in which the Cb of an utterance is realized but not directly realized in that utterance.
    This situation typically holds when an utterance directly realizes an entity implicitly focused by an element of the Cf of the previous utterance.
    For instance, it arises in utterances containing noun phrases that express functional relations (e.g., &amp;quot;the door,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;the owne
