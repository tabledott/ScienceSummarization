etter than closest-first clustering.
    Nicolae and Nicolae (2006) show that bestfirst clustering performs similarly to Bell-treebased clustering, but neither of these algorithms performs as well as their proposed minimum-cutbased graph partitioning algorithm.
    While coreference clustering algorithms attempt to resolve each NP encountered in a document, only a subset of the NPs are anaphoric and therefore need to be resolved.
    Hence, knowledge of the anaphoricity of an NP can potentially improve the precision of a coreference resolver.
    Traditionally, the task of anaphoricity determination has been tackled independently of coreference resolution using a variety of techniques.
    For example, pleonastic it has been identified using heuristic approaches (e.g., Paice and Husk (1987), Lappin and Leass (1994), Kennedy and Boguraev (1996)), supervised approaches (e.g., Evans (2001), M&#168;uller (2006), Versley et al. (2008a)), and distributional methods (e.g., Bergsma et al.
    (2008)); and non-anaphor
