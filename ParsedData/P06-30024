ass schemes as tag sets, and the exact amount of word classes is not agreed upon intra- and interlingually, inputting the number of desired clusters beforehand is clearly a drawback.
    In that way, the clustering algorithm is forced to split coherent clusters or to join incompatible sub-clusters.
    In contrast, unsupervised part-of-speech induction means the induction of the tag set, which implies finding the number of classes in an unguided way.
    This work constructs an unsupervised POS tagger from scratch.
    Input to our system is a considerable amount of unlabeled, monolingual text bar any POS information.
    In a first stage, we employ a clustering algorithm on distributional similarity, which groups a subset of the most frequent 10,000 words of a corpus into several hundred clusters (partitioning 1).
    Second, we use similarity scores on neighbouring co-occurrence profiles to obtain again several hundred clusters of medium- and low frequency words (partitioning 2).
    The combination of both
