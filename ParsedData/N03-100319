sformed into &#8220;Y tide of X&#8221; so that its output format would be the same as ours. trees, with the leaves serving as slots.
    Then, pairs of paths in which the slots tend to be filled by similar values, where the similarity measure is based on the mutual information between the value and the slot, are deemed to be paraphrases.
    We randomly extracted 500 pairs from the two algorithms&#8217; output sets.
    Of these, 100 paraphrases (50 per system) made up a &#8220;common&#8221; set evaluated by all four judges, allowing us to compute agreement rates; in addition, each judge also evaluated another &#8220;individual&#8221; set, seen only by him- or herself, consisting of another 100 pairs (50 per system).
    The &#8220;individual&#8221; sets allowed us to broaden our sample&#8217;s coverage of the corpus.8 The pairs were presented in random order, and the judges were not told which system produced a given pair.
    As Figure 4 shows, our system outperforms the DIRT system, with a consistent perfo
