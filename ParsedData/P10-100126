le, fgsib(x, g, h, m, s) contains features examining the implicit head-modifier relationship (g, m) that are only activated when the POS tag of s is a coordinating conjunction.
    Finally, we make two brief remarks regarding the use of POS tags.
    First, we assume that input sentences have been automatically tagged in a preprocessing step.9 Second, for any feature that depends on POS tags, we include two copies of the feature: one using normal POS tags and another using coarsened versions10 of the POS tags.
    There are a wide variety of parameter estimation methods for structured linear models, such as log-linear models (Lafferty et al., 2001) and max-margin models (Taskar et al., 2003).
    We chose the averaged structured perceptron (Freund and Schapire, 1999; Collins, 2002) as it combines highly competitive performance with fast training times, typically converging in 5&#8211;10 iterations.
    We train each parser for 10 iterations and select paon English parsing.
    For each beam value, parsers wer
