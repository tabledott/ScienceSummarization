a set of preclassified entities and outputs a set of questions that can be asked about an entity to determine its proper classification.
    Decision trees are built by finding the question whose resulting partition is the purest,2 splitting the training data according to that question, and then recursively reapplying this procedure on each resulting subset.
    We first show that the set of classifications that can be provided via decision trees is a proper subset of those that can be provided via transformation lists (an ordered list of transformation-based rules), given the same set of primitive questions.
    We then give some practical differences between the two learning methods.
    We prove here that for a fixed set of primitive queries, any binary decision tree can be converted into a transformation list.
    Extending the proof beyond binary trees is straightforward.
    Given the following primitive decision tree, where the classification is A if the answer to the query X? is yes, and the classific
