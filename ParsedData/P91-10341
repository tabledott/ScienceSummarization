    The system is not always so successful.
    It incorrectly renders Je vais prendre ma propre decision as / will take my own decision.
    The language model does not realize that take my own decision is improbable because take and decision no longer fall within a single trigram.
    Errors such as this are common because the statistical models only capture local phenomena; if the context necessary to determine a translation falls outside the scope of the models, the word is likely to be translated incorrectly.

    We can achieve this within the traditional paradigm of analysis, transfer, and synthesis by incorporating into the analysis phase a sense-disambiguation component that assigns sense labels to French words.
