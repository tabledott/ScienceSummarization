EGEX methods (87.7%) that do consider content-word negators as well as function-word negators perform better than VOTE.
    This confirms the importance of content-word negators for determining the polarities of expressions.
    The heuristic-based methods motivated by compositional semantics COMPO further improve the performance over NEGEX, achieving up to 89.7% accuracy.
    In fact, these heuristics perform even better than the SC learning-based methods (- 89.1%).
    This shows that heuristics that take into account the compositional structure of the expression can perform better than learning-based methods that do not exploit such structure.
    Finally, the learning-based methods that incorporate compositional inference CCI-COMPO (90.7%) perform better than all of the previous methods.
    The difference between CCI-COMPOPR (90.7%) and SC-NEGEX (89.1%) is statistically significant at the .05 level by paired t-test.
    The difference between COMPO and any other heuristic that is not based on computation
