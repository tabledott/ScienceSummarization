tal computation saves time, since the work for common prefix strings can be shared.
    The key to most of the features of our algorithm is that it is based on the topdown parsing method for nonprobabilistic CFGs developed by Earley (1970).
    Earley's algorithm is appealing because it runs with best-known complexity on a number of special classes of grammars.
    In particular, Earley parsing is more efficient than the bottom-up methods in cases where top-down prediction can rule out potential parses of substrings.
    The worst-case computational expense of the algorithm (either for the complete input, or incrementally for each new word) is as good as that of the other known specialized algorithms, but can be substantially better on well-known grammar classes.
    Earley's parser (and hence ours) also deals with any context-free rule format in a seamless way, without requiring conversions to Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), as is often assumed.
    Another advantage is that our probabilistic Earley parser has be
