s in recall, precision, and F1.
  The F1 difference is 1.5 points when using the gold-standard data.
  However, when automatic parsers are used, the shallow parsing?based system is, in fact, slightly better; although the difference is not statistically significant.
  This may be due to the fact that chunk and clause predictions are very important here, and shallow parsers are more accurate in chunk or clause predictions than a full parser (Li and Roth 2001).
  Full parsing information helps in argument identification.
  However, when the automatic parsers are used, using the full parsing information may not have better overall results compared to using shallow parsing.
  4.4 Pruning As shown in the previous two sections, the overall performance gaps of full parsing and shallow parsing are small.
  When automatic parsers are used, the difference is less than 1 point in F1 or accuracy.
  Therefore, we conclude that themain contribution of full parsing is in the pruning stage.
  Because the shallow parsing syste
