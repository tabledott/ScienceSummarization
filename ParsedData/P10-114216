ic definite descriptions have been identified using rule-based techniques (e.g., Vieira and Poesio (2000)) and unsupervised techniques (e.g., Bean and Riloff (1999)).
    Recently, anaphoricity determination has been evaluated in the context of coreference resolution, with results showing that training an anaphoricity classifier to identify and filter non-anaphoric NPs prior to coreference resolution can improve a learning-based resolver (e.g., Ng and Cardie (2002b), Uryupina (2003), Poesio et al. (2004b)).
    Compared to earlier work on anaphoricity determination, recently proposed approaches are more &#8220;global&#8221; in nature, taking into account the pairwise decisions made by the mention-pair model when making anaphoricity decisions.
    Examples of such approaches have exploited techniques including integer linear programming (ILP) (Denis and Baldridge, 2007a), label propagation (Zhou and Kong, 2009), and minimum cuts (Ng, 2009).
    From a learning perspective, a two-step approach to coreference &#
