    For each sentence pair, we use the basic translation model to compute the Viterbi alignment A between E and F. Using this alignment, we then construct an (x, y) training event.
    The event consists of a context x containing the six words in E surrounding in and a future Several actual training events for the maximum entropy translation model for in, extracted from the transcribed proceedings of the Canadian Parliament.

    A few actual examples of such events for in are depicted in Table 3.
    Next we define the set of candidate features.
    For this application, we employ features that are indicator functions of simply desc
