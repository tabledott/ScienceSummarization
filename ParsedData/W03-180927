butional characteristics as the original item.
    Rather than basing the compositionality judgement on the relative mutual information scores of the original items and the items resulting from substitution, we instead base it on the corpusbased semantic similarity between the original expression and word-substituted derivative expressions.
    The same method of substitution is used, with each component being replaced by each of its 10 nearest neighbours according to the knowledge-free similarity measure described above.
    We judge a VPC item to be compositional if an expression formed by substitution occurs among the nearest 100 verb-particle items to the original, and failing this, we judge it to be non-compositional.
    We experimented with a number of cut-off points for identifying semantically similar items, and found that a value of 100 gave the best results.
    While Method 3 softens the reliance upon productivity as a test for compositionality, it still confuses institutionalisation with non-comp
