notators are unsure and have a domain expert resolve the ambiguity, as the sentences that needs such intervention seems few.
			Some cases of ambiguity in modifier at tachment (which do not involve coordination) can be solved with similar process.
			We believe that other type of disagreements can be solved with supplementing criteria for linguistic phenomena not well-covered by the scheme, and annotator training.
			Automatic pre processing by POS taggers and parsers can also help increase the consistent annotation.

			A subset of the GENIA corpus is annotated for syntactic (tree) structure.
			Inter-annotator agreement test indicated that the annotation can be done stably by linguists without much knowledge in biology, provided that proper guideline is established for linguistic phenomena particular to scientific research abstracts.
			We have made the 500-abstract corpus in both XML and PTB formats and made it publicly available as ?the GENIA Treebank beta version?
			(GTB beta).
