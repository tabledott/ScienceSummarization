he task of part-of-speech tagging.
    The main morphological variations are embedded in the tag name (for example, Ns and Np for noun singular or plural).
    The tagging accuracy of supervised stochastic taggers is around 96%97% (Manning and Schutze, 1999, 10.6.1).
    Merialdo (1994) reports an accuracy of 86.6% for an unsupervised word-based HMM, trained on a corpus of 42,186 sentences (about 1M words), over a tag set of 159 different tags.
    Elworthy (1994), in contrast, reports an accuracy of 75.49%, 80.87% and 79.12% for unsupervised word-based HMM trained on parts of the LOB corpora, with a tagset of 134 tags.
    With good initial conditions, such as good approximation of the tag distribution for each word, Elworthy reports an improvement to 94.6%, 92.27% and 94.51% on the same data sets.
    Merialdo, on the other hand, reports an improvement to 92.6% and 94.4% for the case where 100 and 2000 sentences of the training corpus are manually tagged.
