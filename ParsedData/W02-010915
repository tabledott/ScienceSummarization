    The student calculated how often each part-of-speech tag was included in a noun phrase.
    They then constructed chunks from any sequence of tags that occurred in a noun phrase more than 50% of the time.
    In the third example, the student constructed a single chunk containing the entire text, and then excised all elements that did not belong.
    NLTK provides graphical tools that can be used in class demonstrations to help explain basic NLP concepts and algorithms.
    These interactive tools can be used to display relevant data structures and to show the step-by-step execution of algorithms.
    Both data structures and control flow can be easily modified during
