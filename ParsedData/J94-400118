by a path include such words, we impose penalty points on the path so that the possibility of selecting such a path is reduced.
    We define five separating levels (SLs) for bunsetsus, which express the strength of separating meanings in a sentence (Table 2; see Table 1), by observing sentences containing CSs.
    If candidate conjuncts contain a bunsetsu whose SL is equal to the KB's SL or higher, we reduce the path score by (SL of the bunsetsu &#8212; KB's SL + 1) x 7.
    However, two high SL bunsetsus corresponding to each other often exist in a CS, and these do not limit the scope of the CS, like &amp;quot;X TO-SHITE WA(As to X), ... DE-ARI(be), Y TO-SHITE WA(as to Y), .
    DE-ARU(be).&amp;quot; To take this into consideration, penalty points for corresponding high SL bunsetsus are not given to paths.
    For high SL bunsetsus, B, and BI, to be corresponding, they have to be of the same type, and the path contains the element a(i,j).
    We define two bunsetsus to be of the same type if: For example, &
