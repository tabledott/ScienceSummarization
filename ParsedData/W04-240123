tion value of the target classes, we can also rely directly on the raw activation value it outputs, which is the weighted linear sum of the active features, to estimate the posteriors.
    It can be verified that the resulting values are monotonic with the confidence in the prediction, therefore provide a good source of probability estimation.
    We use softmax (Bishop, 1995) over the raw activation values as conditional probabilities.
    Specifically, suppose the number of classes is n, and the raw activation values of class i is acti.
    The posterior estimation for class i is derived by the following equation.
    Pipeline, mimics the typical strategy in solving complex natural language problems &#8211; separating a task into several stages and solving them sequentially.
    For example, a named entity recognizer may be trained using a different corpus in advance, and given to a relation classifier as a tool to extract features.
    This approach first trains an entity classifier as described in the bas
