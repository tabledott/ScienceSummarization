ng (Ratnaparkhi 1996), named-entity recognition (Borthwick et.
    al 1998), and information extraction tasks (McCallum et al. 2000).
    Thus the maximumentropy tagger we used represents a serious baseline for the task.
    We used the following features (several of the features were inspired by the approach of (Bikel et. al 1999), an HMM model which gives excellent results on named entity extraction): The word being tagged, the previous word, and the next word.
    The previous tag, and the previous two tags (bigram and trigram features).
    A compound feature of three fields: (a) Is the word at the start of a sentence?
    ; (b) does the word occur in a list of words which occur more frequently as lower case rather than upper case words in a large corpus of text?
    (c) the type of the first letter of the word, where is defined as &#8216;A&#8217; if is a capitalized letter, &#8216;a&#8217; if is a lower-case letter, &#8216;0&#8217; if is a digit, and otherwise.
    For example, if the word Animal is seen
