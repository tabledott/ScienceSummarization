    In [Kupiec, 1989a], networks are used to selectively augment the context in a basic firstorder model, rather than using uniformly second-order dependencies.
    2.2 Our approach We next describe how our choice of techniques satisfies the listed in section 1.
    The use of an complete flexibility in the choice of training corpora.
    Text from any desired domain can be used, and a tagger can be tailored for use with a particular text database by training on a portion of that database.
    Lexicons containing alternative tag sets can be easily accommodated without any need for re-labeling the training corpus, affording further flexibility in the use of specialized tags.
    As the resources required are simply a lexicon and a suitably large sample of ordinary text, taggers can be built with minimal effort, even for other languages, such as French (e.g., [Kupiec, 1992]).
    The use of ambiguity classes and a first-order model reduces the number of parameters to be estimated without significant reduction
