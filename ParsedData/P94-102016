possible interactions among the features were generated, and a model with good fit was selected.
    Models were generated and tested as described in Section 2.
  
  
    Both the form and the performance of the model selected for each set of variables is presented in Table 2.
    Performance is measured in terms of the total percentage of the test set tagged correctly by a classifier using the specified model.
    This measure combines both precision and recall.
    Portions of the test set that are not covered by the estimates of the parameters made from the training set are not tagged and, therefore, counted as wrong.
    The form of the model describes the interactions among the variables by expressing the joint distribution of the values of all contextual features and sense tags as a product of conditionally independent marginals, with each marginal being composed of non-independent variables.
    Models of this form describe a markov field ([8], [21]) that can be represented graphically as is shown in F
