ssociated with subanalyses in the forest via those associated with specific actions in cells of the LR table (Inui et al., 1997).
    The n-best (i.e. most probable) parses can be efficiently extracted by unpacking subanalyses, following pointers to contained subanalyses and choosing alternatives in order of probabilistic ranking.
    This process backtracks occasionally since unifications are required during the unpacking process and they occasionally fail (see Oepen and Carroll, 2000).
    The probabilities of actions in the LR table are computed using bootstrapping methods which utilise an unlabelled bracketing of the Susanne Treebank (Watson et al., 2006).
    This makes the system more easily retrainable after changes in the grammar and opens up the possibility of quicker tuning to in-domain data.
    In addition, the structural ranking induced by the parser can be reranked using (in-domain) lexical data which provides conditional probability distributions for the SUBCATegorisation attributes of the majo
