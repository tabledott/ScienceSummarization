xt to will be preferred, unless using left of or right of requires fewer (or less expensive) additional edges for the construction of a distinguishing graph.
    Another advantage of the way the graphbased algorithm models the list of preferred attributes is that finer-grained distinctions can be made than can with the incremental algorithm.
    In particular, we are not forced to say that values of the attribute type are always cheaper than values of the attribute color.
    Instead of assigning costs to attributes, we can assign costs to values of attributes.
    This gives us the freedom to assign edges labeled with a common color value (e.g., brown) a lower cost than edges labeled with obscure type values, such as Polish owczarek nizinny sheepdog.
    This implies that it will be cheaper to construct a distinguishing graph referring to an object using two cheap edges (the brown dog) than with one particularly expensive edge (the Polish owczarek nizinny sheepdog).
