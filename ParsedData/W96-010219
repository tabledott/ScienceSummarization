 right, gives good results.
    We will call this case representation pdassst:3 three suffix letters (s), one prefix letter (p), one left disambiguated context words (d), and one ambiguous right context word (a).
    As the chance of an unknown word being a function word is small, and cases representing function words may interfere with correct classification of open-class words, only open-class words are used during construction of the unknown words case base.
    Table 2 shows part of the case base for unknown words.
    Figure 3 shows the architecture of the tagger-generator: a tagger is produced by extracting a lexicon and two case-bases from the tagged example corpus.
    During tagging, the control is the following: words are looked up in the lexicon and separated into known and unknown words.
    They are retrieved from the known words case base and the unknown words case base, respectively.
    In both cases, context is used, in the case of unknown words, the first and three last letters of the word a
