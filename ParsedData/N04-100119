 starting an entity can be computed using the linking probabilities , provided that the marginal is known.
    While other models are possible, in the results reported in this paper, is approximated as: (2) 'The number of all possible partitions of a set is given by the Bell number (Bell, 1934).
    This number is very large even for a document with a moderate number of mentions: about trillion for a 20-mention document.
    For practical reasons, the search space has to be reduced to a reasonably small set of hypotheses.
    That is, the starting probability is just one minus the maximum linking probability.
    Training directly the model is difficult since it depends on all partial entities .
    As a first attempt of modeling the process from mentions to entities, we make the following modeling assumptions: Algorithm 3 Coreference Decoding Algorithm A maximum entropy model is used to implement (4).
    Atomic features used by the model include: string match &#8211; whether or not the mention strings of an
