ralized quantifier Q to the term's restriction and the abstract derived from the formula.
    In Section 5 we will say more about the ramifications of adopting this type of quantifier evaluation rule.
    Note that this rule is also applicable to resolved terms such as pronouns for which Q has been resolved to exists and T is a constant or a scoped variable.
    The denotation assigned to a resolved formula form(C,R,F') in which the resolution variable has been instantiated to a formula F' is simply: As mentioned earlier, the denotation of a formula F in the QLF language will be a possibly partial function ([[...11) from models to truth values.
    Again we use the notation [[F]]m for the truth value of a formula F with respect to a model in (explicit reference to a variable assignment function is again suppressed).
    For interpretation to be monotonic, we want [[G] to be an extension of [[F]] whenever G is a more resolved version of F, and in particular for [[G]] to be total if G is fully resolved.
    We
