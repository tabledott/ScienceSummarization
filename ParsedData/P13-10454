 information can help in cases where syntactic ambiguity can only be resolved with semantic information, such as in the PP attachment of the two sentences: They ate udon with forks. vs.
    They ate udon with chicken.
    Previous RNN-based parsers used the same (tied) weights at all nodes to compute the vector representing a constituent (Socher et al., 2011b).
    This requires the composition function to be extremely powerful, since it has to combine phrases with different syntactic head words, and it is hard to optimize since the parameters form a very deep neural network.
    We generalize the fully tied RNN to one with syntactically untied weights.
    The weights at each node are conditionally dependent on the categories of the child constituents.
    This allows different composition functions when combining different types of phrases and is shown to result in a large improvement in parsing accuracy.
    Our compositional distributed representation allows a CVG parser to make accurate parsing decisions
