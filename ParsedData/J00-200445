 being possible mutual translations, for all u and v: Method B differs from Method A only in its redefinition of the score function in Equation 36.
    The auxiliary parameters A+ and A- and the noise model that they represent can be employed the same way in translation models that are not based on the one-to-one assumption.
    In Method B, the estimation of the auxiliary parameters A+ and A- depends only on the overall distribution of co-occurrence counts and link frequencies.
    All word pairs that co-occur the same number of times and are linked the same number of times are assigned the same score.
    More accurate models can be induced by taking into account various features of the linked tokens.
    For example, frequent words are translated less consistently than rare words (Catizone, Russell, and Warwick 1989).
    To account for these differences, we can estimate separate values of A+ and A- for different ranges of cooc(u, v).
    Similarly, the auxiliary parameters can be conditioned on the linked
