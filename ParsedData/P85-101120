say a node X of a derived tree 3" belongs to A(i,j.k,lJ iJr X dominates a sub-tree o( 3 whose frontier m given by either =q+a...aq Y ak+i... ~ (where the foot node of 3 ~ labelled by Y) or ~q+t--.~ (i.e., j ,,- k. ~; - 86 corresponds to the case when T is a sentential tree).
  The indices (i,j,k,I) refer to the positions between the input symbols and range over 0 through u.
  the,, it refers to the gap between a s and a s. Initially, we fill A l i , i+ l , t+ l , i+ l  ] with those nodes in the frontier of the elementary trees whose label is the same as the input ai+ t for 0 &lt; i &lt; n- l .
  The foot nodes of auxiliary trees will belong to MI A(i,i,j,jl, such that i _&lt; j.
  We are now in a position to fill in 311 the elements of the array A.
  There are five c~mes to be considered.
  We know that if a node X in a derived tree is the ancestor of the foot node, and node Y is its right sibling, such that X E A[i,j,k,II and Y E A[l,m.m,nJ, then their parent, say.
  Z should belong to A(i,j,k,n[, see Fig 3.
