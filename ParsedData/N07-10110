  First-Order Probabilistic Models for Coreference Resolution
  
    Traditional noun phrase coreference resolution systems represent features only of pairs of noun phrases.
    In this paper, we propose a machine learning method enables features over noun phrases, resulting in a first-order probabilistic model for coreference.
    We outline a set of approximations that make this approach practical, and apply our method to the ACE coreference dataset, achieving a 45% error reduction over a comparable method that only considers features of pairs of noun phrases.
    This result demonstrates an example of how a firstorder logic representation can be incorporated into a probabilistic model and scaled efficiently.
  
  
    Noun phrase coreference resolution is the problem of clustering noun phrases into anaphoric sets.
    A standard machine learning approach is to perform a set of independent binary classifications of the form &#8220;Is mention a coreferent with mention b?&#8221; This approach of decomposing
