t constrain allowable arguments of predicates.
    The expected arguments of each predicate are numbered sequentially from Arg0 to Arg5.
    Regardless of the syntactic frame or verb sense, the arguments are similarly labeled to determine near-similarity of the predicates.
    The general procedure was to select for each verb the roles that seem to occur most frequently and use these roles as mnemonics for the predicate arguments.
    Generally, Arg0 would stand for agent, Arg1 for direct object or theme whereas Arg2 represents indirect object, benefactive or instrument, but mnemonics tend to be verb specific.
    For example, when retrieving the argument structure for the verb-predicate assail with the sense &#8221;to tear attack&#8221; from www.cis.upenn.edu/ cotton/cgibin/pblex fmt.cgi, we find Arg0:agent, Arg1:entity assailed and Arg2:assailed for.
    Additionally, the argument may include functional tags from Treebank, e.g.
    ArgM-DIR indicates a directional, ArgM-LOC indicates a locative, and ArgM-TM
