emains an open question how we might be able to align a broader class of texts, especially those that are written in different character sets and share relatively few character sequences.
			The K-vec method attempts to address this question.
	
	
			K-vec starts by estimating the lexicon.
			Consider the example: fisheries --~ p~ches.
			The K-vec algorithm will discover this fact by noting that the distribution of fisheries in the English text is similar to the distribution of p~ches in the French.
			The concordances for fisheries and p~ches are shown in Tables 1 and 2 (at the end of this paper).
			1 1.
			These tables were computed from a small fragment ofthe.
			Canadian Hansards that has been used in a number of other studies: Church (1993) and Simard et al(1992).
			The English text has 165,160 words and the French text has 185,615 words.
			1096 There are 19 instances of fisheries and 21 instances of p~ches.
			The numbers along the left hand edge show where the concordances were found in the texts.
