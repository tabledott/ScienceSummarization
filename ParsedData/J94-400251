l preference information casts doubt on the efficacy of relatively inexpensive (and superficial) methods for capturing semantic and pragmatic factors for purposes of anaphora resolution.
    Our results suggest that scoring procedures which rely primarily on tractable syntactic and attentional (recency) properties can yield a broad coverage anaphora resolution system that achieves a good level of performance.
  
  
    We have designed and implemented an algorithm for pronominal anaphora resolution that employs measures of discourse salience derived from syntactic structure and a simple dynamic model of attentional state.
    We have performed a blind test of this algorithm on a substantial set of cases taken from a corpus of computer manual text and found it to provide good coverage for this set.
    It scored higher than a version of Hobbs' algorithm that we implemented for Slot Grammar.
    Results of experiments with the test corpus show that the syntax-based elements of our salience weighting mechanism c
