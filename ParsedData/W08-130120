erformed the previous best system on the LLL challenge dataset (by an 18% absolute improvement in F-measure).
    Airola et al. (2008) provide more systematic results on a number of proteinprotein interaction datasets.
    Their graph kernel approach uses an all-dependency-paths kernel which allows their system to consider full dependency graphs.
    Their system is based on the SD scheme, and they demonstrate state-of-the-art performance for this approach.
    In the biomedical domain, SD has recently been used in evaluations of parsers (Clegg and Shepherd, 2007; Pyysalo et al., 2007a).
    Pyysalo et al. (2007a) assessed the suitability of the SD scheme over the Link Grammar dependency scheme in an application-oriented evaluation.
    The Link Parser indeed uses a very fine-grained set of relations, which often makes distinctions of a structural rather than a semantic nature.
    One example is the MX relation which &#8220;connects modifying phrases with commas to preceding nouns (&#8216;The DOG, a POODLE,
