    The corpus consists of the Penn Treebank 2 Wall Street Journal texts (www.cis.upenn.edu/ treebank).
    The PropBank annotations, performed at University of Pennsylvania (www.cis.upenn.edu/ ace) were described in (Kingsbury et al., 2002).
    To date PropBank has addressed only predicates lexicalized by verbs, proceeding from the most to the least common verbs while annotating verb predicates in the corpus.
    For any given predicate, a survey was made to determine the predicate usage and if required, the usages were divided in major senses.
    However, the senses are divided more on syntactic grounds than semantic, under the fundamental assumption that syntactic frames are direct reflections of underlying semantics.
    The set of syntactic frames are determined by diathesis alternations, as defined in (Levin, 1993).
    Each of these syntactic frames reflect underlying semantic components tha
