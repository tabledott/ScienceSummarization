der the uniformity assumption is 1k; hence the total agreement expected by chance is The calculation of the value of S for the figures in Table 1 is shown in Table 2.
    The coefficient S is problematic in many respects.
    The value of the coefficient can be artificially increased simply by adding spurious categories which the coders would never use (Scott 1955, pages 322&#8211;323).
    In the case of CL, for example, S would reward designing extremely fine-grained tagsets, provided that most tags are never actually encountered in real data.
    Additional limitations are noted by Hsu and Field (2003).
    It has been argued that uniformity is the best model for a chance distribution of items among categories if we have no independent prior knowledge of the distribution (Brennan and Prediger 1981).
    However, a lack of prior knowledge does not mean that the distribution cannot be estimated post hoc, and this is what the other coefficients do.
