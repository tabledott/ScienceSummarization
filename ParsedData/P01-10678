hat an English word can be translated into a French NULL word.
    The notation stands for a set of values of . is a set of values of random variables associated with .
    And is the set of all random variables associated with a parse tree .
    The probability of getting a French sentence given an English parse tree is where Str is the sequence of leaf words of a tree transformed by from .
    The probability of having a particular set of values of random variables in a parse tree is This is an exact equation.
    Then, we assume that a transform operation is independent from other transform operations, and the random variables of each node are determined only by the node itself.
    So, we obtain sumed to be independent of each other.
    We also assume that they are dependent on particular features of the node.
    Then, of children was used for .
    The last line in the above formula introduces a change in notation, meaning that those probabilities are the model parameters ,, and , where ,, and are the
