ce of the combination methods.
    Results for such oracles are also reported in Table 6.
    The methods corresponding to &amp;quot;oracle-1&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;distance&amp;quot; are choosing from the same set of proposed targets, and the &amp;quot;distance&amp;quot; method achieves performance close to that of the oracle (77 vs. 82.8).
    6 Path Differences This section investigates the effect of different pathway configurations on the performance of the final multi-path system by examining the following situations: &#8226; English to Portuguese, using the other Romance languages as bridges.
    &#8226; English to Norwegian, using the Germanic languages as bridges.
    &#8226; English to Ukrainian, using the Slavic languages as bridges.
    &#8226; Portuguese to English, using the Germanic languages and French as bridges.
    The results of these experiments are shown in Taen=English, pt=Portuguese, fr=French, it=Italian, es=Spanish, ro=Romanian, du=Dutch, no=Norwegian, de=German, da=Danish, cz=Czech,
