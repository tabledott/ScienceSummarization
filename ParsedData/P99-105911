    Deriving narrower items before wider ones as before will not work here because the rule HALVE derives narrow items from wide ones.
  
  
    Rather than parsing an input string directly, it is often desirable to parse another string related by a (possibly stochastic) transduction.
    Let T be a finite-state transducer that maps a morpheme sequence w E Vit to its orthographic realization, a grapheme sequence fo T may realize arbitrary morphological processes, including affixation, local clitic movement, deletion of phonological nulls, forbidden or dispreferred k-grams, typographical errors, and mapping of multiple senses onto the same grapheme.
    Given grammar G and an input ti), we ask whether E T(L(G)).
    We have extended all the algorithms in this paper to this case: the items simply keep track of the transducer state as well.
    Due to space constraints, we sketch only the special case of multiple senses.
    Suppose that the input is iD= d1 &#8226; &#8226; &#8226; dn, and ea
