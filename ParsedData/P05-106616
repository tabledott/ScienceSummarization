    We now describe the method we use for reordering German sentences.
    As a first step in the reordering process, we parse the sentence using the parser described in (Dubey and Keller, 2003).
    The second step is to apply a sequence of rules that reorder the German sentence depending on the parse tree structure.
    See Figure 2 for an example German sentence before and after the reordering step.
    In the reordering phase, each of the following six restructuring steps were applied to a German parse tree, in sequence (see table 1 also, for examples of the reordering steps): [1] Verb initial In any verb phrase (i.e., phrase with label VP-...) find the head of the phrase (i.e., the child with label -HD) and move it into the initial position within the verb phrase.
    For example, in the parse tree in Figure 1, aushaendigen would be mo
