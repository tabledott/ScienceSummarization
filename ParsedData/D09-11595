    Fig.
    1 gives the architecture overview for our approach, which performs the opinion mining task in three main steps: (1) constructing phrase dependency tree from results of chunking and dependency parsing; (2) extracting candidate product features and candidate opinion expressions; (3) extracting relations between product features and opinion expressions.
    Dependency grammar is a kind of syntactic theories presented by Lucien Tesni`ere(1959).
    In dependency grammar, structure is determined by the relation between a head and its dependents.
    In general, the dependent is a modifier or complement; the head plays a more important role in determining the behaviors of the pair.
    Therefore, criteria of how to establish dependency relations and how to distinguish the head and dependent in such relations is central problem for dependency grammar.
