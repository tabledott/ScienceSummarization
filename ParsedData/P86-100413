d by the parser during the parse of a sentence, after each noun phrase has been parsed.
    It relies heavily on the domain model for both determining semantic wen formedness and building partial semantic representations of the noun phrases.
    For example, in the :,etitence, field engineer replaced disk drive at 11/2/0800, the phrase disk drive at 11/2/0800 is a syntactically acceptable noun phrase, (as in participants at the meeting).
    However, it is not semantically acceptable in that at 11/20/800 is intended to designate the time of the replacement, not a property of the disk drive.
    Noun phrase semantics will inform the parser that the noun phrase is not semantically acceptable, and the parser can then look for another parse.
    In order for this capability to be fully utilized, however, an extensive set of domain-specific rules about semantic acceptability is required.
    At present we have only the minimal set used for the development of the basic mechanism.
    For example, in the case descri
