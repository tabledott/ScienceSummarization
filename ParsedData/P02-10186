S&#8221; column gives its preterminal label and the &#8220;Antecedent&#8221; column gives the label of its antecedent.
    The entry with an SBAR POS and empty label corresponds to an empty compound SBAR subtree, as explained in the text and Figure 3. be regarded as an instance of the Memory-Based Learning approach, where both the pattern extraction and pattern matching involve recursively visiting all of the subtrees of the tree concerned.
    It can also be regarded as a kind of tree transformation, so the overall system architecture (including the parser) is an instance of the &#8220;transform-detransform&#8221; approach advocated by Johnson (1998).
    The algorithm has two phases.
    The first phase of the algorithm extracts the patterns from the trees in the training corpus.
    The second phase of the algorithm uses these extracted patterns to insert empty nodes and index their antecedents in trees that do not contain empty nodes.
    Before the trees are used in the training and insertion phases they
