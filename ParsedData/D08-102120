end our work, we have prepared the following materials for download2: &#8226; The complete set of paraphrases generated for the test set.
    This includes the 3.7 million paraphrases generated by the baseline method and the 3.5 million paraphrases generated with syntactic constraints.
    &#8226; The code that we used to produce these paraphrases and the complete data sets (including all 10 word-aligned parallel corpora along with their English parses), so that researchers can extract paraphrases for new sets of phrases.
    &#8226; The manual judgments about paraphrase quality.
    These may be useful as development material for setting the weights of a log-linear formulation of paraphrasing, as suggested in Zhao et al. (2008a).
  
  
    Table 6 summarizes the results of the manual evaluation.
    We can observe a strong trend in the syntactically constrained approaches performing better of the eight conditions.
    Correct meaning is the percent of time that a condition was assigned a 3, 4, or 5, and corr
