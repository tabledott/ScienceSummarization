    The comparison in Table 5 covers a broad spectrum of coherence models.
    At one end of the spectrum is LSA, a lexicalized model of local discourse coherence which is fairly robust and domain independent.
    In the middle of the spectrum lies our entitygrid model, which is unlexicalized but linguistically informed and goes beyond simple sentence-to-sentence transitions without, however, fully modeling global discourse structure.
    At the other end of the spectrum are the HMM-based content models, which are both global and lexicalized.
    Our results indicate that these models are complementary and that their combination could yield improved results.
    For example, we could lexicalize our entity grids or supply the content models with local information either in the style of LSA or as entity transitions.
    However, we leave this to future work.
    Training Requirements.
    We now examine in more detail the training requirements for the entity-grid models.
    Although for our ordering experi
