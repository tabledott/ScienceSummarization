he assistance of computers, analysts have no choice but to read each document in order to identify those from a perspective of interest, which is extremely time-consuming.
    What these analysts need is to find strong statements from different perspectives and to ignore statements that reflect little or no perspective.
    In this paper we approach the problem of learning individual perspectives in a statistical framework.
    We develop statistical models to learn how perspectives are reflected in word usage, and we treat the problem of identifying perspectives as a classification task.
    Although our corpus contains documentlevel perspective annotations, it lacks sentence-level annotations, creating a challenge for learning the perspective of sentences.
    We propose a novel statistical model to overcome this problem.
    The experimental results show that the proposed statistical models can successfully identify the perspective from which a document is written with high accuracy.
