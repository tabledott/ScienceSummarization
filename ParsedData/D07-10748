VM based on a taxonomy kernel.
  They evaluated their models for person name disambiguation over 110, 540, and 2,847 categories, reporting accuracies between 55.4% and 84.8% on (55-word context, entity) pairs extracted from Wikipedia, depending on the model and the development/test data employed.
  The system discussed in this paper performs both named entity identification and disambiguation.
  The entity identification and in-document corefer- ence components resemble the Nominator system (Wacholder et al., 1997).
  However, while Nomina- tor made heavy use of heuristics and lexical clues to solve the structural ambiguity of entity men- tions, we employ statistics extracted from Wikipe- dia and Web search results.
  The disambiguation component, which constitutes the main focus of the paper, employs a vast amount of contextual and category information automatically extracted from Wikipedia over a space of 1.4 million distinct enti- ties/concepts, making extensive use of the highly interlinked structure of t
