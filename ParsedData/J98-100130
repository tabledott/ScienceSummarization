are very similar to Quillian's (1968): Thus one may think of a full concept analogically as consisting of all the information one would have if he looked up what will be called the &amp;quot;patriarch&amp;quot; word in a dictionary, then looked up every word in each of its definitions, then looked up every word found in each of these, and so on, continually branching outward... (p. 238).
    However, Quillian's network also keeps track of semantic relationships among the words encountered along the path between two words, which are encoded in his semantic network; the neural network avoids the overhead of creating the semantic network but loses this relational information.
    Ide and Wronis Introduction In many ways, the supplementary information in the LDOCE, and in particular the subject codes, is similar to that in a thesaurus, which, however, is more systematically structured.
    Inconsistencies in dictionaries, noted earlier, are not the only and perhaps not the major source of their limitations for WS
