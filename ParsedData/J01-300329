dgment that the verbs were likely to be used with sufficient frequency in the WSJ.
    Also, each 3 We used an equal number of verbs from each class in order to have a balanced group of items.
    One potential disadvantage of this decision is that each verb class is represented equally, even though they may not be equally frequent in the corpora.
    Although we lose the relative frequency information among the classes that could provide a better bias for assigning a default classification (i.e., the most frequent one), we have the advantage that our classifier will be equally informed (in terms of number of exemplars) about each class.
    Note that there are only 19 unaccusative verbs because ripped, which was initially counted in the unaccusatives, was then excluded from the analysis as it occurred mostly in a very different usage in the corpus (as verb+particle, in ripped off) from the intended optionally intransitive usage.
