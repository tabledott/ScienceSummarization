 team, and at the end the number of wins decides the rankings.6 We can simulate this type of tournament as well with Monte Carlo methods.
    However, in the limit, each team will be on average ranked based on its expected number of wins in the competition.
    We can compute the expected number of wins straightforward as j Note that this is very similar to Bojar&#8217;s method of ranking systems, with one additional and important twist.
    We can rewrite Equation 4, the variant that ignores ties, as: The difference is that the new overall ranking method normalizes the win ratios per pairwise ranking.
    And this makes sense, since it overcomes one problem with our traditional and Bojar&#8217;s ranking method.
    Previously, some systems were put at an disadvantage, if they are compared more frequently against good systems than against bad systems.
    This could happen, if participants were not allowed to rank their own systems (a constraint we enforced in the past, but no longer).
    This was noticed by
