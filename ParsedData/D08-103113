mention m, examples are generated with the closest antecedent a to form a positive example, and every mention between a and m to form negative examples.
    Anaphoricity Ng and Cardie (2002a) and Denis and Baldridge (2007) show that when used effectively, explicitly predicting anaphoricity can be helpful.
    Thus, we learn a separate classifier to detect whether a mention is anaphoric (that is, whether it is not the first mention in its equivalence class), and use that classifier&#8217;s output as a feature for the coreference model.
    Features for the anaphoricity classifier include the mention type, whether the mention appears in a quotation, the text of the first word of the extent, the text of the first word after the head (if that word is part of the extent), whether there is a longer mention preceding this mention and having the same head text, whether any preceding mention has the same extent text, and whether any preceding mention has the same text from beginning of the extent to end of the head.
