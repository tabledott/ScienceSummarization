s 1977; 1982b; Hobbs and Martin 1987), metaphor (Hobbs 1977; 1983a; 1983b) and the &amp;quot;local pragmatics&amp;quot; phenomena of metonymy (Hobbs and Martin 1987), but not anomaly.
    To my knowledge, Hobbs has yet to produce a unified description of selective inferencing that shows in detail how lexical ambiguity is resolved or how the differences between metaphor, metonymy, and so on can be recognized.
    Hobbs' earlier papers include a series of programs &#8212; SATE, DIANA, and DIANA-2 &#8212; but the papers are not clear about what the programs can do.
    It is not clear, for example, whether any of the programs actually analyze any metaphors.
    Martin's (1990) work is the only other computational approach to metaphor that has been implemented.
    However, the work does not have a treatment of metonymy.
    Martin's metaphor-maps, which are used to represent conventional metaphors and the conceptual information they contain, seem to complement semantic vectors of the extended kind described in S
