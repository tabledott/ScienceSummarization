veral syntactic relations.
    For example, it may make sense to multiply estimates of conditional probabilities of tuples in different relations, in a way that is analogous to n-gram language modeling (Jelinek, Mercer, and Roukos 1992).
    However, such an approach will make it harder to take into account the statistical significance of the estimate (a criterion that is missing in standard n-gram models).
    In our set of examples, the constraint propagation method proved to be successful and did not seem to introduce any errors.
    Further experimentation, on much larger data sets, is needed to determine which of the two methods (if any) is substantially superior to the other.
  
  
    To evaluate the proposed disambiguation method, we implemented and tested the method on a random set of examples.
    The examples consisted of a set of Hebrew paragraphs and a set of German paragraphs.
    In both cases the target language was English.
    The Hebrew examples consisted of ten paragraphs picked at random
