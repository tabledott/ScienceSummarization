ocational multi-word expressions by exploiting statistical properties of the co-occurrence of the component words have become increasingly sophisticated (Evert and Krenn, 2001; Evert, 2004), it is well known that mere co-occurrence does not well distinguish compositional from non-compositional expressions (Manning and Sch&#168;utze, 1999, Ch.
    5).
    While expressions which may potentially have idiomatic meanings can be identified using various lexical association measures (Evert and Krenn, 2001; Evert and Kermes, 2003), other techniques must be used to determining whether or not a particular MWE does, in fact, have an idiomatic use.
    In this paper we explore the hypothesis that the local linguistic context can provide adequate cues for making this determination and propose one method for doing this.
    We characterize our task on analogy with wordsense disambiguation (Sch&#168;utze, 1998; Ide and V&#180;eronis, 1998).
    As noted by Sch&#168;utze, WSD involves two related tasks: the general task of
