e found that adding hybrid features resulted in even greater improvements.
    One possible explanation is that the clusterings generated by the Brown algorithm can be noisy or only weakly relevant to syntax; thus, the clusters are best exploited when &#8220;anchored&#8221; to words or parts of speech.
    Finally, we found it useful to impose a form of vocabulary restriction on the cluster-based features.
    Specifically, for any feature that is predicated on a word form, we eliminate this feature if the word in question is not one of the top-N most frequent words in the corpus.
    When N is between roughly 100 and 1,000, there is little effect on the performance of the cluster-based feature sets.4 In addition, the vocabulary restriction reduces the size of the feature sets to managable proportions.
  
  
    In order to evaluate the effectiveness of the clusterbased feature sets, we conducted dependency parsing experiments in English and Czech.
    We test the features in a wide range of parsing configura
