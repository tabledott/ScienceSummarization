 not strikingly different.
    However, the hits are primarily syntactic in nature while the misses are both semantic (as in open-class:choice) and syntactic (as in closed-class:missing).
    ALEK is sensitive to open-class word confusions (affect vs effect) where the part of speech differs or where the target word is confused with another word (*In this aspect, ... instead of In this respect,...).
    In both cases, the system recognizes that the target is in the wrong syntactic environment.
    Misses can also be syntactic &#8212; when the target word is confused with another word but the syntactic environment fails to trigger an error.
    In addition, ALEK does not recognize semantic errors when the error involves the misuse of an open-class word in combination with the target (for example, make in &amp;quot;they make benefits&amp;quot;).
    Closed class words typically are either selected by or agree with a head word.
    So why are there so many misses, especially with prepositions?
