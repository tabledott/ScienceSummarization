    In our model we employ the CCG supertagger to obtain the best sequences of supertags for a corpus of sentences from which we obtain language model statistics.
    Besides the difference in probabilities and statistical estimates, these two supertaggers differ in the way the supertags are extracted from the Penn Treebank, cf.
    (Hockenmaier, 2003; Chen et al., 2006).
    Both supertaggers achieve a supertagging accuracy of 90&#8211;92%.
    Three aspects make supertags attractive in the context of SMT.
    Firstly, supertags are rich syntactic constructs that exist for individual words and so they are easy to integrate into SMT models that can be based on any level of granularity, be it wordor phrase-based.
    Secondly, supertags specify the local syntactic constraints for a word, which resonates well with sequential (finite state) statistical (e.g.
    Markov) models.
    Finally, because supertags are rich lexical descriptions that represent underspecification in parsing, it is possible to have s
