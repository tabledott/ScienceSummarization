all Street Journal data comprised of about 300,000 words.
    The boundary statistics were counted directly from the training data as well.
    The treebank grammar is much larger and more ambiguous than our original grammar, containing about 16,000 rules and 78 terminal and nonterminal symbols, and it was impractical to parse sentences to exhaustion using our existing hardware, so the figures based on 95% of the probability mass could not be computed.
    We were able to use this grammar to compare the number of edges needed to find the first parse using the trigram and boundary trigram estimates.
    % of the 18- to 26-word sentences finding a parse in a fixed number of edges for a treebank grammar.
    Figure 14 shows the percentage of sentences of length 18 through 26 for which a parse could be found within 20,000 edges.
    Again, we used a test set of approximately 570 sentences of the appropriate length from the Wall Street Journal corpus.
    Although the x-axis covers a much wider range than in Figur
