    Thus, percent agreement for the excerpt as a whole is 71/77, or 92%.
    The breakdown of agreement on boundary and non-boundary majority opinions is 13/14 (93%) and 58/63 (92%), respectively.
    The figures for percent agreement with the majority opinion for all 20 narratives are shown in Table 1.
    The columns represent the narratives in our corpus.
    The first two rows give the absolute number of potential boundary sites in each narrative (i.e., n1) followed by the corresponding percent agreement figure for the narrative as a whole.
    Percent agreement in this case averages 89% (variance cr=.0006; max.=92%; min.=82%).
    The next two pairs of rows give the figures when the majority opinions are broken down into boundary and non-boundary opinions, respectively.
    Non-boundaries, with an average percent agreement of 91% (a=.0006; max.=95%; min.--=84%), show greater agreement among subjects than boundaries, where average percent agreement is 73% (cr= .003; max.=80%; min.=60%).
