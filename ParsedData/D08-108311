es might further improve the performance.
    4Moilanen and Pulman (2007) provide more detailed discussion on the semantic scope of negations and the semantic priorities in resolving polarities.
    When consulting the General Inquirer dictionary, senses with less than 5% frequency and senses specific to an idiom are dropped.
  
  
    While we expect that a set of hand-written heuristic rules motivated by compositional semantics can be effective for determining the polarity of a sentimentbearing expression, we do not expect them to be perfect.
    Interpreting natural language is such a complex task that writing a perfect set of rules would be extremely challenging.
    Therefore, a more ideal solution would be a learning-based method that can exploit ideas from compositional semantics while providing the flexibility to the rigid application of the heuristic rules.
    To this end, we present a novel learning-based approach that incorporates inference rules inspired by compositional semantics into the learni
