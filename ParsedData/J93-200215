bservations in Table 4, made by the method of Section 3. recall NP, cl recognize NP, cl recover NP refuse inf The cues are fairly rare, so verbs in Table 4 that occur fewer than 15 times tend not to occur with these cues at all.
    Further, these cues occur fairly often in structures other than those they are designed to detect.
    For example, record, recover, and refer all occurred with cues for an infinitive, although none of them in fact takes an infinitive argument.
    The sentences responsible for these erroneous observations are: In (2a,b) record occurs as a noun.
    In (2c) recover is a verb but the infinitive VP, to make a race of it.

    In (2d) refer is a verb but to change is a PP rather than an infinitive.
