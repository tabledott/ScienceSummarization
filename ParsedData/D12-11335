ition of a word in the sentence, plus an extra artificial root node 0.
    The set A of arcs is a set of pairs (i, j), where i is the head node and j is the dependent node.
    The functions 7r and 6 assign a unique part-of-speech label to each node/word and a unique dependency label to each arc, respectively.
    This notion of dependency tree differs from the standard definition only by including part-of-speech labels as well as dependency labels (K&#168;ubler et al., 2009).
    Following Nivre (2008), we define a transition system for dependency parsing as a quadruple 5 = (C, T, cs, Ct), where A transition sequence for a sentence x in 5 is a sequence of configuration-transition pairs C0,m = In this paper, we take the set C of configurations to be the set of all 5-tuples c = (E, B, A, 7r, 6) such that E (the stack) and B (the buffer) are disjoint sublists of the nodes Vx of some sentence x, A is a set of dependency arcs over Vx, and 7r and 6 are labeling functions as defined above.
    We take the initial c
