f the noisier channel paradigm, demonstrating substantial performance gains in Arabic-English and Chinese-English translation.
    In Section 5 we discuss relevant prior work, and we conclude in Section 6.
  
  
    Most statistical machine translation systems model translational equivalence using either finite state transducers or synchronous context free grammars (Lopez, to appear 2008).
    In this section we discuss the issues associated with adapting decoders from both classes of formalism to process word lattices.
    The first decoder we present is a SCFG-based decoder similar to the one described in Chiang (2007).
    The second is a phrase-based decoder implementing the model of Koehn et al. (2003).
    A word lattice G = hV, Ei is a directed acyclic graph that formally is a weighted finite state automaton (FSA).
    We further stipulate that exactly one node has no outgoing edges and is designated the &#8216;end node&#8217;.
    Figure 1 illustrates three classes of word lattices.
