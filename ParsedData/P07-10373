    They employ a stochastic, top-down transtaggers, supertaggers employ probabilities based on duction process that assigns a joint probability to local context and can be implemented using finite a source sentence and each of its alternative transstate technology, e.g.

    The rewriting/transduction process There are currently two supertagging approaches is driven by &#8220;xRS rules&#8221;, each consisting of a pair available: LTAG-based (Bangalore &amp; Joshi, 1999) of a source phrase and a (possibly only partially) and CCG-based (Clark &amp; Curran, 2004).
    Both the lexicalized syntactified target phrase.
    In order to LTAG (Chen et al., 2006) and the CCG supertag extract xRS rules, the word-to-word alignment insets (Hockenmaier, 2003) were acquired from the duced from the parallel training corpus is used to WSJ section of the Penn-II Treebank us
