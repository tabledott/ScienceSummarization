    Section 3 discusses the IBM BLEU (Papineni et al. 2001) and NIST (2002) n-gram co-occurrence scoring procedures and the application of a similar idea in evaluating summaries.
    Section 4 compares n-gram cooccurrence scoring procedures in terms of their correlation to human results and on the recall and precision of statistical significance prediction.
    Section 5 concludes this paper and discusses future directions.
