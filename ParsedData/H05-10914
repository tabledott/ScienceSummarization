ies will be relevant for relation extraction.
			Furthermore, with each sentence we associate its dependency graph,with words figured as nodes and word-word dependencies figured as directed edges, as shown in Fig ure 1.
			A subset of these word-word dependencies capture the predicate-argument relations present inthe sentence.
			Arguments are connected to their target predicates either directly through an arc point ing to the predicate (?troops ? raided?), or indirectly through a preposition or infinitive particle (?warning?
			to ? stop?).
			Other types of word-word dependen cies account for modifier-head relationships present in adjective-noun compounds (?several ? stations?), noun-noun compounds (?pumping ? stations?), or adverb-verb constructions (?recently ? raided?).
			In Figure 1 we show the full dependency graphs for two sentences from the ACE newspaper corpus.Word-word dependencies are typically catego rized in two classes as follows:?
			[Local Dependencies] These correspond to local predicate-ar
