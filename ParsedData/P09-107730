    We also confirm that even within the PDTB, information from annotated explicit relations (Wordpairs-PDTBExpl) is not as helpful as information from annotated implicit relations (Wordpairs-PDTBImpl).
    The absolute difference in f-score between the two models is close to 2% for Comparison, and 6% for Contingency.
    Adding other features to word pairs leads to improved performance for Contingency, Expansion and Temporal relations, but not for Comparison.
    For contingency detection, the best combination of our features included polarity, verb information, first and last words, modality, context with Wordpairs-selected.
    This combination led to a definite improvement, reaching an f-score of 47.13 (16% absolute improvement in f-score over Wordpairs-TextRels).
    For detecting expansions, the best combination of our features (polarity+Inquirer tags+context) outperformed Wordpairs-PDTBImpl by a wide margin, close to 13% absolute improvement (fscores of 76.42 and 63.84 respectively).
