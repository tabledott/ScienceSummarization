001), shallow parsing (Sha and Pereira, 2003), and named entity recognition for newswire data (McCallum and Li, 2003).
    They have also just recently been applied to the more limited task of finding gene and protein mentions (McDonald and Pereira, 2004), with promising early results.
    Let o = (o1, o2, ... , on) be an sequence of observed words of length n. Let 5 be a set of states in a finite state machine, each corresponding to a label l E L (e.g.
    PROTEIN, DNA, etc.).
    Let s = (s1, s2, ... , sn) be the sequence of states in 5 that correspond to the labels assigned to words in the input sequence o. Linearchain CRFs define the conditional probability of a state sequence given an input sequence to be: where Zo is a normalization factor of all state sequences, fj(si_1, si, o, i) is one of m functions that describes a feature, and &#955;j is a learned weight for each such feature function.
    This paper considers the case of CRFs that use a firstorder Markov independence assumption with binary featur
