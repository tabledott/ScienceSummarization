lignments produced by the model under test.2 We take AER, which is derived from F-measure, as our primary evaluation metric.
    The results of our evaluation are presented in Table 1.
    The columns of the table present (in order) a description of the model being tested, the AER on the trial data, the AER on the test data, test data recall, and test data precision, followed by the optimal values on the trial data for the LLR exponent, the initial (heuristic model) null-word weight, the nullword weight used in EM re-estimation, the add-n parameter value used in EM re-estimation, and the number of iterations of EM.
    &#8220;NA&#8221; means a parameter is not applicable in a particular model.
    Results for the four principal versions of Model 1 are presented in bold.
    For each principal version, results of the corresponding ablation experiments are presented in standard type, giving the name of each omitted modification in parentheses.3 Probably the most striking result is that the heuristic model subst
