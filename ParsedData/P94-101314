uate, if somewhat diluted, distributional evidence.
    Similarly, it is useful to compute collocational statistics for arbitrary word classes, such as the class WEEKDAY ={ domingo, Innes, mantes, }.
    Such classes may cover many types of associations, and need not be mutually exclusive.
    For the French experiments, no additional linguistic knowledge or lexical resources were used.
    The decision lists were trained solely on raw word associations without additional patterns based on part of speech, morphological analysis or word class.
    Hence the reported performance is representative of what may be achieved with a rapid, inexpensive implementation based strictly on the distributional properties of raw text.
    For the Spanish experiments, a richer set of evidence was utilized.
    Use of a morphological analyzer (developed by Tzoukermann and Liberman (1990)) allowed distributional measures to be computed for associations of lemmas (morphological roots), improving generalization to different inflec
