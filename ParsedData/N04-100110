ed on datasets outside of ACE training data and they identify types of mentions different from the ACE types of mentions.
    For instance, a pre-existing tagger may identify dates or occupation mentions (not used in ACE), among other types.
    It could also have a class called PERSON, but the annotation guideline of what represents a PERSON may not match exactly to the notion of the PERSON type in ACE.
    Our hypothesis &#8211; the combination hypothesis &#8211; is that combining pre-existing classifiers from diverse sources will boost performance by injecting complementary information into the mention detection models.
    Hence, we used the output of these pre-existing taggers and used them as additional feature streams for the mention detection models.
    This approach allows the system to automatically correlate the (different) mention types to the desired output.
    Even if the three languages (Arabic, Chinese and English) are radically different syntacticly, semantically, and even graphically, all
