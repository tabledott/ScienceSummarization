gated each cluster with the threshold of cosine similarity just above 0.
    We got 34 ing the threshold of cosine similari ty in complete linkage clustering for the PERSON-GPE domain ty in complete linkage clustering for the COMPANY-COMPANY domain PER-GPE clusters and 15 COM-COM clusters.
    We show the F-measure, recall and precision at this cosine threshold in both domains in Table 2.
    We got 80 F-measure in the PER-GPE domain and 75 Fmeasure in the COM-COM domain.
    These values were very close to the best F-measure.
    Then, we evaluated the labeling of clusters of NE pairs.
    We show the larger clusters for each domain, along with the ratio of the number of pairs bearing the major relation to the total number of pairs in each cluster, on the left in Table 3.
    (As noted above, the major relation is the most frequently represented relation in the cluster.)
    We also show the most frequent common words and their relative frequency in each cluster on the right in Table 3.
