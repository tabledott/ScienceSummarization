the single-sentence assump tion does not simplify the task, since the hardest part of answer finding is to locate the correct sentence.
			From an end-user?s point of view, presenting thesentence that contains the answer is often more in formative and evidential.
			Furthermore, although the judgement data in our case are more labor-intensiveto obtain, we believe our evaluation method is a better indicator than the TREC evaluation for the qual ity of an answer selection algorithm.To illustrate the point, consider the example question, ?When did James Dean die??
			The correct an9More human-judged data are desirable, though we will address training from noisy, automatically judged data in Section 5.4.
			It is important to note that human judgement of answer sentence correctness was carried out prior to any experi ments, and therefore is unbiased.
			The total number of questions in TREC 13 is 230.
			We exclude from the TREC 13 set questions that either have no correct answer candidates (27 questions), or no
