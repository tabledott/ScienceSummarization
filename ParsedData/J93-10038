nting words).
    More applicable techniques are important in textual analysis.
    The next section describes one such technique; implementation of this technique is described in later sections.
  
  
    Binomial distributions arise commonly in statistical analysis when the data to be analyzed are derived by counting the number of positive outcomes of repeated identical and independent experiments.
    Flipping a coin is the prototypical experiment of this sort.
    The task of counting words can be cast into the form of a repeated sequence of such binary trials comparing each word in a text with the word being counted.
    These comparisons can be viewed as a sequence of binary experiments similar to coin flipping.
    In text, each comparison is clearly not independent of all others, but the dependency falls off rapidly with distance.
    Another assumption that works relatively well in practice is that the probability of seeing a particular word does not vary.
    Of course, this is not really true, sinc
