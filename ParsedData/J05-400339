 impact.
    In an attempt to give a better indication of the value of these corpora, we used them alone as MT training data.
    The BLEU scores obtained by the systems we trained on them are presented in the third row of Table 7.
    For comparison purposes, the last line of the table shows the scores of systems trained on 10M English tokens of outof-domain data.
    As can be seen, our automatically extracted corpora obtain better MT performance than out-of-domain parallel corpora of similar size.
    It&#8217;s true that this is not a fair comparison, since the extracted corpora were obtained using all our available parallel data.
    The numbers do show, however, that the extracted data, although it was obtained automatically, is of good value for machine translation.
  
  
    As can be seen from Table 2, the amount of data we can extract from our comparable corpora is adversely affected by poor dictionary coverage.
    Thus, if we start with very little parallel data, we do not make good use of the com
