 of the raw empirical unigram distribution to represent content significance.
    For instance, there is no distinction between a word which occurs many times in the same document or the same number of times across several documents.
    Intuitively, the latter word is more indicative of significant document set content.
    The KLSUM algorithm introduces a criterion for selecting a summary S given document collection D, where PS is the empirical unigram distribution of the candidate summary S and KL(P Q) represents the Kullback-Lieber (KL) divergence given by divergence between the true distribution P (here the document set unigram distribution) and the approximating distribution Q (the summary distribution).
    This criterion casts summarization as finding a set of summary sentences which closely match the document set unigram distribution.
    Lin et al. (2006) propose a related criterion for robust summarization evaluation, but to our knowledge this criteria has been unexplored in summarization systems.
