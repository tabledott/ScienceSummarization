    The acquisition of extensive linguistic and discourse knowledge necessary for resolving coreference is time consuming, difficult and error-prone.
    Neverthless, recent results show that knowledge-poor, empirical methods perform with amazing accuracy on certain forms of coreference (cf.
    (Mitkov 1998) (Kennedy and Boguraev 1996) (Kameyama 1997)).
    For example, COGNIAC (Baldwin 1997), a system based on just seven ordered heuristics, generates high-precision resolution (over 90%) for some cases of pronominal reference.
    In our work, we approached the coreference resolution problem by trying to determine how much more knowledge is required to supplement the abovementioned knowledge-poor methods and how to derive that knowledge.
    To this end we (1) analyze the data to find what types of anaphor-antecedent pairs are most popular in real-world texts; (2) devise knowledge-minimalist rules for handling th
