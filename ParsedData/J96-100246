 which results in coherent blocks of words.
    For our purposes, however, a safe segmentation is dependent on the Viterbi alignment A between the input French sentence F and its English translation E. We define a rift as a position j in F such that for all k &lt;j, ak &lt;a1 and for all k &gt; j, ak &gt; al. In other words, the words to the left of the French word yi are generated by words to the left of the English word eal, and the words to the right of yi are generated by words to the right of ea,.
    In the alignment of figure 4, for example, there are rifts at positions j = 1, 2, 4, 5 in the French sentence.
    One visual method of determining whether a rift occurs after the French word j is to try to trace a line from the last letter of yj up to the last letter of eai; if the line can be drawn without intersecting any alignment lines, position f is a rift.
    Using our definition of rifts, we can redefine a safe segmentation as one in which the segment boundaries are located only at rifts.
