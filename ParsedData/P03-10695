ching through the space of possible orders.
    As in the case of Mellish et al. (1998) we construct an acceptable ordering rather than the best possible one.
    We propose an automatic method of evaluating the orders generated by our model by measuring closeness or distance from the gold standard, a collection of orders produced by humans.
    The remainder of this paper is organized as follows.
    Section 2 introduces our model and an algorithm for producing a possible order.
    Section 3 describes our corpus and the estimation of the model parameters.
    Our experiments are detailed in Section 4.
    We conclude with a discussion in Section 5.
  
  
    Given a collection of texts from a particular domain, our task is to learn constraints on the ordering of their sentences.
    In the training phase our model will learn these constraints from adjacent sentences represented by a set of informative features.
    In the testing phase, given a set of unseen sentences, we will rely on our prior experience o
