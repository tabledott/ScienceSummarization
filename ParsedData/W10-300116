tween the two annotations were later resolved by the chief annotator, who was also responsible for creating the annotation guidelines and training the two annotators.
    The datasets are freely available2 for further benchmark experiments at http://www.inf.u-szeged.hu/ rgai/conll2010st.
    Since uncertainty cues play an important role in detecting sentences containing uncertainty, they are tagged in the Task1 datasets as well to enhance training and evaluation of systems.
    The biological training dataset consisted of the biological part of the BioScope corpus (Vincze et al., 2008), hence it included abstracts from the GENIA corpus, 5 full articles from the functional genomics literature (related to the fruit fly) and 4 articles from the open access BMC Bioinformatics website.
    The automatic segmentation of the documents was corrected manually and the sentences (14541 in number) were annotated manually for hedge cues and their scopes.
    The evaluation dataset was based on 15 biomedical articles downl
