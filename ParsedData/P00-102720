evenshtein distance, and with the minimal search-simplifying assumption in all the models that candidate alignments must begin with a the same VC * prefix.9 Given a starting point where all single character X-+17 changes at the point of suffixation are equally likely, the processes of elison (e-+e), gemination (e.g.
    E-xd in the context of d), and y-xi shift (in the context of a preceding consonant, not vowel) all emerge by the end of the first iteration with high probability in their appropriate contexts, and low probability elsewhere.
    Table 10 shows how each of the models perform on a randomly-selected 30% of the highly irregular forms, with correctly selected roots identified in bold.
    The residual errors are primarily of three types: Two inflections, went and ate, were not alignable with their correct roots due to different first character.
    The largest class of errors are due to the pigeonhole principle strongly disfavoring two inflections from sharing the same root.10 9To put the Table 9 re
