ical items involved and thus cannot be captured by a few general rules.
    Simplification is strongly related to but distinct from paraphrasing and machine translation (MT).
    While it can be considered a directional form of the former, it differs in spirit because simplification must trade off meaning preservation (central to paraphrasing) against complexity reduction (not a consideration in paraphrasing).
    Simplification can also be considered to be a form of MT in which the two &#8220;languages&#8221; in question are highly related.
    However, note that ComplexEW and SimpleEW do not together constitute a clean parallel corpus, but rather an extremely noisy comparable corpus.
    For example, Complex/Simple same-topic document pairs are often written completely independently of each other, and even when it is possible to get good sentence alignments between them, the sentence pairs may reflect operations other than simplification, such as corrections, additions, or edit spam.
