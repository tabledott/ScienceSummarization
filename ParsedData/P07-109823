    In this paper, we have introduced new structures to represent textual information in three question answering tasks: question classification, answer classification and answer re-ranking.
    We have defined tree structures (PAS and PASN) to represent predicateargument relations, which we automatically extract using our SRL system.
    We have also introduced two functions, SSTK and Kall, to exploit their representative power.
    Our experiments with SVMs and the above models suggest that syntactic information helps tasks such as question classification whereas semantic information contained in PAS and PASN gives promising results in answer classification.
    In the future, we aim to study ways to capture relations between predicates so that more general se1 n
