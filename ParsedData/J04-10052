 A &#954; value of one means perfect agreement, a &#954; value of zero means that agreement is equal to chance, and a &#954; value of negative one means &#8220;perfect&#8221; disagreement.
    This squib addresses two issues that have been neglected in the computational linguistics literature.
    First, there are two main ways of computing P(E), the expected agreement, according to whether the distribution of proportions over the categories is taken to be equal for the coders (Scott 1955; Fleiss 1971; Krippendorff 1980; Siegel and Castellan 1988) or not (Cohen 1960).
    Clearly, the two approaches reflect different conceptualizations of the problem.
    We believe the distinction between the two is often glossed over because in practice the two computations of P(E) produce very similar outcomes in most cases, especially for the highest values of &#954;.
    However, first, we will show that they can indeed result in different values of &#954;, that we will call &#954;Co (Cohen 1960) and &#954;S&amp;C (Siege
