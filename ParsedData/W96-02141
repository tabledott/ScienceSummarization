ent on the same data.
    We show that Bod's results are at least partially due to an extremely fortuitous choice of test data, and partially due to using cleaner data than other researchers.
  
  
    The Data-Oriented Parsing (DOP) model has a short, interesting, and controversial history.
    It was introduced by Reinko Scha (1990), and was then studied by Rens Bod.
    Unfortunately, Bod (1993c, 1992) was not able to find an efficient exact algorithm for parsing using the model; however he did discover and implement Monte Carlo approximations.
    He tested these algorithms on a cleaned up version of the ATIS corpus, and achieved some very exciting results, reportedly getting 96% of his test set exactly correct, a huge improvement over previous results.
    For instance, Bod (1993b) compares these results to Schabes (1993), in which, for short sentences, 30% of the sentences have no crossing brackets (a much easier measure than exact match).
    Thus, Bod achieves an extraordinary 8-fold error rate reduct
