al information coming from the left side only, UTBL considers both left and right contexts.
			Reported tagging accuracies for these methods range from 87% to 96%, but are not directly comparable.
			Kupiec?s HMM class-based tagger, when trained on a sample of 440,000 words of the original Brown corpus, obtained a test set accuracy of 95.7%.
			Brill assessed his UTBL tagger using 350,000 words of the Brown corpus for training, and found that 96% of words in a separate 200,000-word test set could be tagged correctly.
			Furthermore, he reported test set accuracy of 95.1% for the UTBL tagger trained on 120,000 words of Penn Treebank and tested on a separate test set of 200,000 words taken from the same corpus.
			Finally, using 1 million words from the Associated Press for training, Merialdo?s trigram tagger was reported to have an accuracy of 86.6%.
			This tagger was assessed using a tag set other than that which is employed by the Penn Treebank.
			Unfortunately none of these results can be directly compare
