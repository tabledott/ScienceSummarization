    As size increases, the benefits diminish.
    Our results are comparable to hers in terms of BLEU score and consistent in terms of conclusions.
    We extend on previous work by experimenting with a wider range of preprocessing schemes for Arabic, by studying the effect of morphological disambiguation (beyond POS tagging) on preprocessing schemes over learning curves, and by investigating the effect on different genres.
  
  
    Arabic is a morphologically complex language with a large set of morphological features.
    These features are realized using both concatenative (affixes and stems) and templatic (root and patterns) morphology with a variety of morphological and phonological adjustments that appear in word orthography and interact with orthographic variations.
    Certain letters in Arabic script are often spelled inconsistently which leads to an increase in both sparsity (multiple forms of the same word) and ambiguity (same form corresponding to multiple words).
    For example, variants of Ham
