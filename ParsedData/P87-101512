djoined at that address.
    The following context-free production captures the derivation step of the grammar shown in Figure 7, in which the trees in the auxiliary tree set are adjoined into themselves at the root node (address c).
    ((fii, Q2, Pa) , &#8212;&#9632; (01, i32, 03) , e),(02,e) Oa, en) The path complexity of the tee set generated by a MCTAG is not necessarily context-free.
    Like the string languages of MCTAG's, the complexity of the path set increases as the cardinality of the elementary tee sets increases, though both the string languages and path sets will always be semilinear.
    MCTAG's are able to generate tee sets having dependent paths.
    For example, the MCTAG shown in Figure 7 generates trees of the form shown in Figure 4b.
    The number of paths that can be dependent is bounded by the grammar (in fact the maximum cardinality of a tree set determines this bound).
    Hence, trees shown in Figure 8 can not be generated by any MCTAG (but can be generated by an IG) because the nu
