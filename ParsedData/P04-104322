hereas in FrameNet, it shows a similar performance 79.5% vs. 82.1% (compare tables with Figure 5).
    This suggests that PAF generates the same information as the standard features in a linear space.
    However, when a degree greater than 1 is used for standard features, PAF is outperformed10.
    Second, SCF improves the polynomial kernel (d = 3), i.e. the current state-of-the-art, of about 3 percent points on PropBank (column SCF&#183;P).
    This suggests that (a) PAK can measure the similarity between two SCF structures and (b) the sub-categorization information provides effective clues about the expected argument type.
    The interesting consequence is that SCF together with PAK seems suitable to automatically cluster different verbs that have the same syntactic realization.
    We note also that to fully exploit the SCF information it is necessary to use a kernel product (K1 &#183; K2) combination rather than the sum (K1 + K2), e.g. column SCF+P.
    Finally, the FrameNet results are completely diffe
