ed chains and schemas outperform untyped chains, combining the two gives a further performance boost.
    Clustered arguments improve the results further, helping with sparse argument counts (&#8216;Typed Schema&#8217; in figure 6 uses CBC arguments).
    Overall, using all the data (by year 2004) shows a 10.1% improvement over untyped narrative chains.
  
  
    Our significant improvement in the cloze evaluation shows that even though narrative cloze does not evaluate argument types, jointly modeling the arguments with events improves event clustering.
    Likewise, the FrameNet comparison suggests that modeling related events helps argument learning.
    The tasks mutually inform each other.
    Our argument learning algorithm not only performs unsupervised induction of situation-specific role classes, but the resulting roles and linking structures may also offer the possibility of (unsupervised) FrameNet-style semantic role labeling.
    Finding the best argument representation is an important future dire
