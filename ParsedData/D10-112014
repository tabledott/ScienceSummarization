4;a et al. (2007), we constrain the posterior to satisfy the rules in expectation during inference.
    This effectively biases the inference toward linguistically plausible settings.
    In standard variational inference, an intractable true posterior is approximated by a distribution from a tractable set (Bishop, 2006).
    This tractable set typically makes stronger independence assumptions between model parameters than the model itself.
    To incorporate the constraints, we further restrict the set to only include distributions that satisfy the specified expectation constraints over hidden variables.
    In general, for some given model, let B denote the entire set of model parameters and z and x denote the hidden structure and observations respectively.
    We are interested in estimating the posterior p(B, z  |x).
    Variational inference transforms this problem into an optimization problem where we try to find a distribution q(B, z) from a restricted set Q that minimizes the KL-divergence between q(B
