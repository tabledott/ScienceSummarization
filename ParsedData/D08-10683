uffices to outperform Haghighi and Klein&#8217;s (2007) one.
    Our full model, using apposition and other relations for joint inference, is often as accurate as the best supervised models, or more.
    We begin by reviewing the necessary background on Markov logic.
    We then describe our Markov logic network for joint unsupervised coreference resolution, and the learning and inference algorithms we used.
    Finally, we present our experiments and results.
  
  
    Most existing supervised learning approaches for coreference resolution are suboptimal since they resolve each mention pair independently, only imposing transitivity in postprocessing (Ng, 2005).
    Moreover, many of them break up the resolution step into subtasks (e.g., first determine whether a mention is anaphoric, then classify whether it is coreferent with an antecedent), which further forsakes opportunities for joint inference that have been shown to be helpful (Poon &amp; Domingos, 2007).
