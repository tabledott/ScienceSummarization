d again r. The resulting percentages of correctly tagged words are shown in figure 4.
  These experiments demonstrate that the perfor- mance of the Net-Tagger is comparable to that of the trigram tagger and better than that of the IIMM tag- ger.
  They further show tl,at the performance of the Net-Tagger is less affected by a small amount of train- ing data than that of tim trigram tagger.
  This may be due to a much smaller number of paraineters in the Net-Tagger: while the trigram tagger must accurately ~l:or this test, a slightly simpler netwmk structure with two preceding and one following word in the input context was used.
