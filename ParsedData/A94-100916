g thereafter.
    In this case the initial model is of better quality than BW can achieve.
    That is, while BW will converge on an optimum, the notion of optimality is with respect to the HMM rather than to the linguistic judgements about correct tagging.
    Early maximum Rising accuracy for a small number of iterations (2-4), and then falling as in initial maximum.
    An example of each of the three behaviours is shown in figure 1.
    The values of the accuracies and the test conditions are unimportant here; all we want to show is the general patterns.
    The second experiment had the aim of trying to discover which pattern applies under which circumstances, in order to help decide how to train the model.
    Clearly, if the expected pattern is initial maximum, we should not use BW at all, if early maximum, we should halt the process after a few iterations, and if classical, we should halt the process in a &amp;quot;standard&amp;quot; way, such as comparing the perplexity of successive models.
