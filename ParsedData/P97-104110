one, two, or three characters over which the boundary is to be moved.
    Figure 1 enumerates the 22 segmentation transformations we define.
  
  
    With the above algorithm in place, we can use the training data to produce a rule sequence to augment an initial segmentation approximation in order to obtain a better approximation of the desired segmentation.
    Furthermore, since all the rules are purely character-based, a sequence can be learned for any character set and thus any language.
    We used our rule-based algorithm to improve the word segmentation rate for several segmentation algorithms in three languages.
    Despite the number of papers on the topic, the evaluation and comparison of existing segmentation algorithms is virtually impossible.
    In addition to the problem of multiple correct segmentations of the same texts, the comparison of algorithms is difficult because of the lack of a single metric for reporting scores.
    Two common measures of performance are recall and precision, where
