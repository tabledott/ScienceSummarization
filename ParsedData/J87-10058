    Most research in linguistic semantics, e.g., Montague (1973) and Cooper (1983), has concentrated on explicitly defining the range of possible scope relationships that can be manifested in sentences.
    But, to our knowledge, all fall prey to the profligacy of generation just outlined.
    We are concerned here only with suppressing readings that are spurious for purely structural reasons, that is, for reasons that follow from the general relationship between the structure of sentences and the structure of their logical forms and independent of the meanings of the particular sentences.
    For instance, we are not concerned with logical redundancies, such as those due to the commutativity of successive universal quantifiers.
    When we move beyond the two first-order logical quantifiers to deal with the so-called generalized quantifiers such as most, these logical redundancies become quite rare.
    Similarly, we are not concerned with the infel
