oding under this loss function allows us to integrate syntactic knowledge into a statistical MT system without building detailed models of linguistic features, and retraining the system from scratch.
    We first present a hierarchy of loss functions for translation based on different levels of lexical and syntactic information from source and target language sentences.
    This hierarchy includes the loss functions useful in both situations where we intend to apply MBR decoding.
    We then present the MBR framework for statistical machine translation under the various translation loss functions.
    We finally report the performance of MBR decoders optimized for each loss function.
  
  
    We now introduce translation loss functions to measure the quality of automatically generated translations.
    Suppose we have a sentence in a source language for which we have generated an automatic translation with word-to-word alignment relative to.
    The wordto-word alignment specifies the words in the source sen
