 &#8220;When did Elvis Presley die?&#8221; To do this, we build a noisy channel model that makes explicit how answer sentence parse trees are mapped into questions.
    Consider, for example, the automatically derived answer sentence parse tree in Figure 1, which associates to nodes both syntactic and shallow semantic, named-entity-specific tags.
    In order to rewrite this tree into a question, we assume the following generative story: according to a distortion table d, in order to obtain a well-formed, grammatical question.
    The probability P(Q  |SA) is computed by multiplying the probabilities in all the steps of our generative story (Figure 1 lists some of the factors specific to this computation.)
    The readers familiar with the statistical machine translation (SMT) literature should recognize that steps 3 to 5 are nothing but a one-to-one reproduction of the generative story proposed in the SMT context by Brown et al. (see Brown et al., 1993 for a detailed mathematical description of the model and
