ample makes stanP(ti|t&#8722;i, &#945;) = (6) dard evaluation methods possible, but yields subn(ti&#8722;2,ti&#8722;1) + T&#945; optimal results because the value for each tag is samn(ti,wi) + &#946; pled from a distribution, and some tags will be asP(wi|ti, t&#8722;i,w&#8722;i,&#946;) = (7) signed low-probability values.
    Our solution is to n(ti) + Wti&#946; treat the Gibbs sampler as a stochastic search prowhere n(ti&#8722;2,ti&#8722;1,ti) and n(ti,wi) are the number of cedure with the goal of identifying the MAP tag seoccurrences of the trigram (ti&#8722;2,ti&#8722;1,ti) and the quence.
    This can be done using tempering (annealtag-word pair (ti, wi) in the i &#8212; 1 previously gener- ing), where a temperature of &#966; is equivalent to raisated tags and words.
    Note that, by integrating out ing the probabilities in the sampling distribution to the parameters &#964; and &#969;, we induce dependencies the power of 1 &#966;.
