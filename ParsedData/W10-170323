    In addition to the metric scores of the submitted metrics identified above, we also present (1) the ranking of the system as determined by the human assessments; and (2) the metrics scores for two popular baseline metrics, BLEU as calculated by NIST&#8217;s mteval software12 and the NIST score.
    For each method of system measurement the absolute highest score is identified by being outlined in a box.
    Similarly, the remaining tables in Appendix B list the metric scores for the submitted metrics and the two baseline metrics, and the ranking based on the human assessments for translations into English from Czech, French, German and Spanish.
    As some metrics employ language-specific resources, not all metrics produced scores for all language pairs.
    It is noticeable that system combinations are often among those achieving the highest scores.
    To assess the performance of the automatic metrics, we correlated the metrics&#8217; scores with the human rankings at the system level.
