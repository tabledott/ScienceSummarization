ing different semantic roles for the same labels, the task of discovering the complete set of semantic roles should involve not only identifying these labels, but also the underlying sense for a given verb.
  However, as in all current SRL work, this article focuses only on identifying the boundaries and the labels of the arguments, and ignores the verb sense disambiguation problem.
  The distribution of these argument labels is fairly unbalanced.
  In the official release of PropBank I, core arguments (A0?A5 and AA) occupy 71.26% of the arguments, where the largest parts are A0 (25.39%) and A1 (35.19%).
  The rest mostly consists of adjunct arguments (24.90%).
  The continued (C-arg) and referential (R-arg) arguments are rela- tively few, occupying 1.22% and 2.63%, respectively.
  For more information on PropBank and the semantic role labeling task, readers can refer to Kingsbury and Palmer (2002) and Carreras and Ma`rquez (2004, 2005).
  Note that the semantic arguments of the same verb do not overlap.
