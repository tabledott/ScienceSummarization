    We also extracted 21,000 pairs of sentences linked by connectives such as even though, in contrast and but.
  
  
    In this section, we describe results from four sets of experiments designed to explore how textual entailment information can be used to enhance the quality of automatic Q/A systems.
    We show that by incorporating features from TE into a Q/A system which employs no other form of textual inference, we can improve accuracy by more than 20% over a baseline.
    We conducted our evaluations on a set of 500 factoid questions selected randomly from questions previously evaluated during the annual TREC Q/A evaluations.
    2 Of these 500 questions, 335 (67.0%) were automatically assigned an answer type from our system&#8217;s answer type hierarchy ; the remaining 165 (33.0%) questions were classified as having an unkn
