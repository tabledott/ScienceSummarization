	Bidirectional Inference With The Easiest-First Strategy For Tagging Sequence Data
		This paper presents a bidirectional inference algorithm for sequence labeling problems such as part-of-speech tag ging, named entity recognition and text chunking.
		The algorithm can enumerate all possible decomposition structures andfind the highest probability sequence together with the corresponding decomposi tion structure in polynomial time.
		We also present an efficient decoding algorithm based on the easiest-first strategy, which gives comparably good performance tofull bidirectional inference with significantly lower computational cost.
		Exper imental results of part-of-speech tagging and text chunking show that the proposedbidirectional inference methods consis tently outperform unidirectional inference methods and bidirectional MEMMs give comparable performance to that achievedby state-of-the-art learning algorithms in cluding kernel support vector machines.
