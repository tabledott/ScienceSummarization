ivre and Scholz 2004; Attardi 2006).
    Of the algorithms described in this article, the arc-eager stack-based algorithm is essentially the algorithm proposed for unlabeled dependency parsing in Nivre (2003), extended to labeled dependency parsing in Nivre, Hall, and Nilsson (2004), and most fully described in Nivre (2006b).
    The major difference is that the parser is now initialized with the special root node on the stack, whereas earlier formulations had an empty stack at initialization.15 The arc-standard stack-based algorithm is briefly described in Nivre (2004) but can also be seen as an incremental version of the algorithm of Yamada and Matsumoto (2003), where incrementality is achieved by only allowing one left-toright pass over the input, whereas Yamada and Matsumoto perform several iterations in order to construct the dependency graph bottom-up, breadth-first as it were.
    The list-based algorithms are both inspired by the work of Covington (2001), although the formulations are not equivalent.
