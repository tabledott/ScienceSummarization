 (b) a system built from GIZAalignments.
			All other parameters of the decoder re main constant and only the feature set is changed for these experiments.
			As training data, we use the UN parallel corpus and the LDC news corpora released in 2005.
			Comparison should therefore be only madeacross systems reported here and not to earlier eval uations or other systems.
			The results are shown in Table 5.
			Combination of the phrasal features from theHMM and MaxEnt alignments results in the ?Combined?
			system.
			The Combined system performs bet ter in all cases; in MT03 and MT04 the MaxEntderived features perform better than the HMM sys tem.
			In MT05, there is a slight degradation which isnot significant and the combination system still re sults in an improvement over either system.
			Since the MaxEnt aligner has access to a unique resource,every attempt was made to make that resource avail able to the other systems.
			Although GIZA++ and HMM can not directly utilize word aligned data, thetraining dat
