en data is that it will inevitably contain lexical units that have not previously been annotated in FrameNet, so that systems which do not generalizewell cannot get them right.
			In principle, the deci sion as to what frame to add a new LU to should be helped by the same criteria that are used to assign polysemous lemmas to existing frames.
			However,in practice this assignment is difficult, precisely be cause, unlike WSD, there is no assumption that all the senses of each lemma are defined in advance; if 102 the system can?t be sure that a new use of a lemma is in one of the frames listed for that lemma, thenit must consider all the 800+ frames as possibili ties.
			This amounts to the automatic induction of fine-grained semantic similarity from corpus data, a notoriously difficult problem (Stevenson and Joanis, 2003; Schulte im Walde, 2003).For LUs which clearly do not fit into any exist ing frames, the problem is still more difficult.
