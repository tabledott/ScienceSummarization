ensifier if it appears in a list of intensifiers and if it precedes a word of the appropriate part of speech (e.g., an intensifier adjective must come before a noun).
    The list of intensifiers is a compilation of those listed in Quirk et al. (1985), intensifiers identified from existing entries in the subjectivity lexicon, and intensifiers identified during explorations of the development data.
    The modifies/modifed by features involve the dependency parse tree of the sentence, obtained by first parsing the sentence (Collins 1997) and then converting the tree into its dependency representation (Xia and Palmer 2001).
    In a dependency representation, every node in the tree structure is a surface word (i.e., there are no abstract nodes such as NP or VP).
    The parent word is called the head, and its children are its modifiers.
    The edge between a parent and a child specifies the grammatical relationship between the two words.
    Figure 2 shows an example of a dependency parse tree.
