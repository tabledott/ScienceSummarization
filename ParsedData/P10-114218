two commonly-cited weaknesses.
    First, since each candidate antecedent for an anaphoric NP to be resolved is considered independently of the others, the model only determines how good a candidate antecedent is relative to the anaphoric NP, but not how good a candidate antecedent is relative to other candidates.
    In other words, it fails to answer the question of which candidate antecedent is most probable.
    Second, it has limitations in its expressiveness: the information extracted from the two NPs alone may not be sufficient for making an informed coreference decision, especially if the candidate antecedent is a pronoun (which is semantically empty) or a mention that lacks descriptive information such as gender (e.g., &#8220;Clinton&#8221;).
    Below we discuss how these weaknesses are addressed by the entity-mention model and ranking models.
    The entity-mention model addresses the expressiveness problem with the mention-pair model.
    To motivate the entity-mention model, consider an example t
