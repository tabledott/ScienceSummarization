 frames achieve similar recall levels as the extraction patterns, but with substantially fewer false hits.
    Our results are not directly comparable to the MUC-4 results because the MUC-4 systems contained additional components, such as domainspecific discourse analyzers that resolved coreferent noun phrases, merged event descriptions, and filtered out irrelevant information.
    The work presented here only addresses the initial stage of information extraction.
    However, in previous work we showed that AutoSlog-TS achieved performance comparable to AutoSlog (Riloff, 1996b), which performed very well in the MUC-4 evaluation (Lehnert et al., 1992b).
    Since the conceptual case frames achieved comparable recall and higher precision than AutoSlog-TS' extraction patterns, our results suggest that the case frames performed well relative to previous work on this domain.
    Several other systems learn extraction patterns that can also be viewed as conceptual case frames with selectional restrictions (e.g., P
