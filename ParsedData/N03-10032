omains (Iordanskaja et al., 1991; Robin, 1994; McKeown et al., 1994), this was generally not the case.
    For instance, consider the following two sentences (similar to examples found in Smadja and McKeown (1991)): After the latest Fed rate cut, stocks rose across the board.
    Winners strongly outpaced losers after Greenspan cut interest rates again.

    Also, note that one cannot draw one-to-one correspondences between single words or phrases.

    This evidence suggests two consequences: (1) we cannot rely solely on generic domain-independentlexical resources for the task of paraphrasing, and (2) sentence-level
