requencies in corpora.
    When a description of the unfamiliar terms was provided, the perceived readability of the texts almost doubled.
    A more general and principled approach to using vocabulary information for readability decisions has been the use of language models.
    For any given text, it is easy to compute its likelihood under a given language model, i.e. one for text meant for children, or for text meant for adults, or for a given grade level.
    (Si and Callan, 2001), (Collins-Thompson and Callan, 2004), (Schwarm and Ostendorf, 2005), and (Heilman et al., 2007) used language models to predict the suitability of texts for a given school grade level.
    But even for this type of task other factors besides vocabulary use are at play in determining readability.
    Syntactic complexity is an obvious factor: indeed (Heilman et al., 2007) and (Schwarm and Ostendorf, 2005) also used syntactic features, such as parse tree height or the number of passive sentences, to predict reading grade levels.
