SMT.
    We used lexical features and collocation features from boundary words of blocks to predicate reorderings of neighdence intervals.
    Italic numbers refer to results for which the difference to the best result (indicated in bold) is not statistically significant. bor blocks.
    Experiments on standard ChineseEnglish translation tasks from two different domains showed that our method achieves a significant improvement over the distortion/flat reordering models.
    Traditional distortion/flat-based SMT translation systems are good for learning phrase translation pairs, but learn nothing for phrasal reorderings from real-world data.
    This is our original motivation for designing a new reordering model, which can learn reorderings from training data just like learning phrasal translations.
    Lexicalized reordering model learns reorderings from training data, but it binds reorderings to individual concrete phrases, which restricts the model to reorderings of phrases seen in training data.
