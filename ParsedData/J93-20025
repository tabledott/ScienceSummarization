tiveness of this approach for inferring the syntactic frames of verbs is supported by experiments using an implementation called Lerner.
    In the spirit of the problem stated above, Lerner starts out with no knowledge of content words&#8212;it bootstraps from determiners, auxiliaries, modals, prepositions, pronouns, complementizers, coordinating conjunctions, and punctuation.
    Lerner has two independent components corresponding to the two strategies listed above.
    The first component identifies sentences where a particular verb is likely to be exhibiting a particular syntactic frame.
    It does this using local cues, such as the that the cue.
    This component keeps track of the number of times each verb appears with cues for each syntactic frame as well as the total number of times each verb occurs.
    This process can be described as collecting observations and its output as an observations table.
    A segment of an actual observations table is shown in Table 4.
    The observations table serves
