itial theoretical claims has been in wide circulation since 1986.
    This draft (Grosz, Joshi, and Weinstein 1986) has led to a number of papers by others on this topic and has been extensively cited, but has never been published.'
    We have been urged to publish the more detailed description of the centering framework and theory proposed in Grosz, Joshi, and Weinstein (1986) so that an official version would be archivally available.
    The task of completing and revising this draft became more daunting as time passed and more and more papers appeared on centering.
    Many of these papers proposed extensions to or revisions of the theory and attempted to answer questions posed in Grosz, Joshi, and Weinstein (1986).
    It has become ever more clear that it would be useful to have a &amp;quot;definitive&amp;quot; statement of the original motivations for centering, the basic definitions underlying the centering framework, and the original theoretical claims.
    This paper attempts to meet that need.
