in SME at the level of individual connections are somewhat rudimentary.
    We believe that a more sophisticated measure of relational similarity, such as LRA, may enhance the performance of SME.
    Likewise, the focus of our work here is on the similarity between particular relations, and we ignore systematic mapping between sets of relations, so LRA may also be enhanced by integration with SME.
    Metaphorical language is very common in our daily life, so common that we are usually unaware of it (Lakoff and Johnson 1980).
    Gentner et al. (2001) argue that novel metaphors are understood using analogy, but conventional metaphors are simply recalled from memory.
    A conventional metaphor is a metaphor that has become entrenched in our language (Lakoff and Johnson 1980).
    Dolan (1995) describes an algorithm that can recognize conventional metaphors, but is not suited to novel metaphors.
    This suggests that it may be fruitful to combine Dolan&#8217;s (1995) algorithm for handling conventional metaph
