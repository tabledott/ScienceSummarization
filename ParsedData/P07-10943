 Non-model-based approaches have also been proposed (Brill (1995); see also discussion in Banko and Moore (2004)).
    All of this work is really POS disambiguation: learning is strongly constrained by a dictionary listing the allowable tags for each word in the text.
    Smith and Eisner (2005) also present results using a diluted dictionary, where infrequent words may have any tag.
    Haghighi and Klein (2006) use a small list of labeled prototypes and no dictionary.
    A different tradition treats the identification of syntactic classes as a knowledge-free clustering problem.
    Distributional clustering and dimensionality reduction techniques are typically applied when linguistically meaningful classes are desired (Sch&#168;utze, 1995; Clark, 2000; Finch et al., 1995); probabilistic models have been used to find classes that can improve smoothing and reduce perplexity (Brown et al., 1992; Saul and Pereira, 1997).
    Unfortunately, due to a lack of standard and informative evaluation techniques, it is
