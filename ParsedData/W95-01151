    A machine translation system must be able to choose among possible translations based on context.
    To do this, it usually relies on a translation lexicon that contains a number of possible translations for each word.
    N -best translation lexicons contain up to N candidate translations for each word, ordered from most probable to least probable, sometimes specifying a priori probabilities or likelihood scores.
    Existing automatic methods for constructing N-best translation lexicons rely on the availability of large training corpora of parallel texts in the source and target languages.
    For some methods, the corpora must also be aligned by sentence [Bro93, Ga1914 Unfortunately, such training corpora are available for only a handful of language pairs, and the cost to create enough training data manually for new language pairs is very high.
    This paper presents The evaluation method uses a simple objective criterion rather than relying on subjective human judges.
    It allows many exp
