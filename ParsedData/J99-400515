earching for a decoding of length &lt; n is difficult, resembling the problem of covering a finite set with a small collection of subsets.
    In the example shown above, the smallest acceptable set of source words is {and, cooked, however, left, comma, period} .
    If M1-DECIDE returns yes, then some decoding e with P(e) &#8226; P(fle) &gt; 0 must exist.
    We know that e must contain n or fewer words&#8212;otherwise P(fle) = 0 by the E table.
    Furthermore, the s table tells us that every word fi is covered by at least one English word in e. Through the one-to-one correspondence between elements of e and C, we produce a set cover of size &lt; n for S. Likewise, if M1-DECIDE returns no, then all decodings have P(e) &#8226; P(fle) = 0.
    Because there are no zeroes in the source table b, every e has P(fle) = 0.
    Therefore either (1) the length of e exceeds n, or (2) some fi is left uncovered by the words in e. Because source words cover target words in exactly the same fashion as elements of C cover
