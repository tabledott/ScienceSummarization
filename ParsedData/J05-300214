, a, bulldozer).
    Besides its being ungrammatical, it is impossible to understand what event this intersection describes.
    The inadequacy of the bag-of-words method to the fusion task demonstrates the need for a more linguistically motivated approach.
    At the other extreme, previous approaches (Radev and McKeown 1998) have demonstrated that this task is feasible when a detailed semantic representation of the input sentences is available.
    However, these approaches operate in a limited domain (e.g., terrorist events), where information extraction systems can be used to interpret the source text.
    The task of mapping input text into a semantic representation in a domain-independent setting extends well beyond the ability of current analysis methods.
    These considerations suggest that we need a new method for the sentence fusion task.
    Ideally, such a method would not require a full semantic representation.
    Rather, it would rely on input texts and shallow linguistic knowledge (such as pa
