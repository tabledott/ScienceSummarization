ra, an adjective is an endomorphic linear map in noun space).
    In the framework of Mitchell and Lapata, our approach derives from the additive form in Equation (1) with the matrix multiplying the adjective vector (say, A) set to 0: p=Bv where p is the observed AN vector, B the weight matrix representing the adjective at hand, and v a noun vector.
    In our approach, the weight matrix B is specific to a single adjective &#8211; as we will see in Section 7 below, it is our representation of the meaning of the adjective.
    Like Guevara, we estimate the values in the weight matrix by partial least squares regression.
    In our case, the independent variables for the regression equations are the dimensions of the corpusbased vectors of the component nouns, whereas the AN vectors provide the dependent variables.
    Unlike Guevara, (i) we train separate models for each adjective (we learn adjective-specific functions, whereas Guevara learns a generic &#8220;AN-slot&#8221; function) and, consequently, (ii) co
