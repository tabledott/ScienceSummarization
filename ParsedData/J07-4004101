ses most of the RAM available on the cluster.
    However, it is possible to use smaller &#946; values for training the dependency model if we also apply the two types of normal-form restriction used by the normalform model.
    This hybrid model still uses the features from the dependency model; it is still trained using dependency structures as the gold standard; and decoding is still performed using the maximum-recall algorithm; the only difference is that the derivations in the charts are restricted by the normal-form constraints (both for training and testing).
    Table 5 gives the training statistics for this model, compared to the dependency and normal-form models.
    The number of sentences we were able to use for training this model was 36,345 (91.8% of Sections 02&#8211;21).
    The accuracy of this hybrid dependency model is given in Table 7.
    These are the highest results we have obtained to date on Section 00.
    We also give the results for the normal-form model from Table 6 for comparison
