to different anchors in a text: this makes it difficult to decide what the intended anchor and the intended link are (Poesio and Vieira 1998).
    For all these reasons, this class has been the most challenging problem we have dealt with in the development of our system, and the results we have obtained so far can only be considered very preliminary.
    Nevertheless, we feel that trying to process these definite descriptions is the only way to discover which types of commonsense knowledge are actually needed.
    Our work on bridging descriptions began with the development of a classification of bridging descriptions (Vieira and Teufel 1997) according to the kind of information needed to resolve them, rather than on the basis of the possible relations between descriptions and their anchors as is typical in the literature.
    This allowed us to get an estimate of what types of bridging descriptions we might expect our system to resolve.
    The classification is as follows: In the rest of this section, we de
