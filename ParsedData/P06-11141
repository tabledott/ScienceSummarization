 several types of lexicosemantic feedback (cf.
    (Harabagiu et al., 2001; Moldovan et al., 2002)); (2) a combination of language processes that transform questions and candidate answers in logic representations such that reasoning systems can select the correct answer based on their proofs (cf.
    (Moldovan et al., 2003)); (3) a noisy-channel model which selects the most likely answer to a question (cf.
    (Echihabi and Marcu, 2003)); or (4) a constraint satisfaction problem, where sets of auxiliary questions are used to provide more information and better constrain the answers to individual questions (cf.
    (Prager et al., 2004)).
    While different in their approach, each of these frameworks seeks to approximate the forms of semantic inference that will allow them to identify valid textual answers to natural language questions.
    Recently, the task of automatically recognizing one form of semantic inference &#8211; textual entailment &#8211; has received much attention from groups participating in
