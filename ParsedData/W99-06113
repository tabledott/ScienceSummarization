tion corpus, our clustering approach achieves an F-measure of 53.6%, placing it firmly between the worst (40%) and best (65%) systems in the MUC6 evaluation.
    More importantly, the clustering approach outperforms the only MUC-6 system to view coreference resolution as a learning problem: The RESOLVE system (McCarthy and Lehnert, 1995) employs decision tree induction and achieves an Fmeasure of 47% on the MUC-6 data set.
    Furthermore, our approach has a number of important advantages over existing learning and non-learning methods for coreference resolution: As a result, we believe that viewing noun phrase coreference as clustering provides a promising framework for corpus-based coreference resolution.
    The remainder of the paper describes the details of our approach.
    The next section provides a concrete specification of the noun phrase coreference resolution task.
    Section 3 presents the clustering algorithm.
    Evaluation of the approach appears in Section 4.
