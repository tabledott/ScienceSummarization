tically from HTML data on the Web.
    Previous work has built lexicons from fixed corpora by determining linguistic patterns for the context in which relevant words appear (Collins and Singer, 1999; Jones et al., 1999).
    Rather than mining a small corpus, we gather data from nearly the entire Web; rather than relying on fragile linguistic context patterns, we leverage robust formatting regularities on the Web.
    WebListing finds co-occurrences of seed terms that appear in an identical HTML formatting pattern, and augments a lexicon with other terms on the page that share the same formatting.
    Our current implementation uses GoogleSets, which we understand to be a simple implementation of this approach based on using HTML list items as the formatting regularity.
    We are currently building a more sophisticated replacement.
