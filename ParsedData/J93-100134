. 150) noted that although strong and powerful have similar syntax and semantics, there are contexts where one is much more appropriate than the other (e.g., strong tea vs. powerful computers).
    Psycholinguists have a similar concept, which they call word associations.
    Two frequently cited examples of highly associated words are: bread/butter and doctor 'nurse.
    See Palermo and Jenkins (1964) for tables of associations, measured for 200 words, factored by grade level and sex.
    In general, subjects respond more quickly to a word such as butter when it follows a highly associated word such as bread.
    Some results and implications are summarized from reaction-time experiments in which subjects either (a) classified successive strings of letters as words and nonwords, or (b) pronounced the strings.
    Both types of response to words (e.g., BUTTER) were consistently faster when preceded by associated words (e.g., BREAD) rather than unassociated words (e.g, NURSE).
