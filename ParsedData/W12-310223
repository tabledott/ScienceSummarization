 judges a few years ago, when we had instant reporting of rankings during the evaluation period.
    If you have one of the best systems and carry out a lot of human judgments, then competitors&#8217; systems will creep up higher, since they are not compared against your own (very good) system anymore, but more frequently against bad systems.
    Table 5 shows the different rankings for English&#8211; German, a rather typical example.
    The table displays the ranking of the systems according to five different methods, alongside with system scores according to the ranking method: the win ratio (Bojar), the average rank (MC Playoffs), and the expected win ratio (Expected Wins).
    For the latter, we performed bootstrap resampling and computed rank ranges that lie in a 95% confidence interval.
    You can find the tables for the other language pairs in the annex.
    The win-based methods (Bojar, MC Playoffs, Expected Wins) give very similar rankings &#8212; exhibiting mostly just the occasional pairwise flip
