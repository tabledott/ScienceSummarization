rees (Sima'an 1999; Chappelier et al. 2002).
    Sima'an (1995) gave an efficient algorithm for computing the parse tree generated by the most probable derivation, which in some cases is a reasonable approximation of the most probable parse.
    Goodman (1996, 1998) developed a polynomial time PCFG-reduction of DOP1 whose size is linear in the size of the training set, thus converting the exponential number of subtrees to a compact grammar.
    While Goodman's method does still not allow for an efficient computation of the most probable parse in DOP1, it does efficiently compute the &amp;quot;maximum constituents parse&amp;quot;, i.e. the parse tree which is most likely to have the largest number of correct constituents.
    Johnson (1998b, 2002) showed that DOP1's subtree estimation method is statistically biased and inconsistent.
    Bod (2000a) solved this problem by training the subtree probabilities by a maximum likelihood procedure based on Expectation-Maximization.
    This resulted in a statistically
