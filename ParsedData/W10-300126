stem which utilized directly the predicted scopes (it processes cue phrases from left to right) during predicting other scopes in the same sentence.
    The identification of the scope for a certain cue was typically carried out by classifying each token in the sentence.
    Task2 systems differ in the number of class labels used as target and in the machine learning approaches applied.
    Most systems &#8211; following Morante and Daelemans (2009) &#8211; used three class labels (F)IRST, (L)AST and NONE.
    Two participants used four classes by adding (I)NSIDE, while three systems followed a binary classification approach (SCOPE versus NONSCOPE).
    The systems typically included a post-processing procedure to force scopes to be continuous and to include the cue phrase in question.
    The machine learning methods applied can be again categorized into sequence labeling (SL) sification (TC), hand-crafted rules (HC); Machine learners: Entropy Guided Transformation Learning (ETL), Averaged Perceptron (AP), k
