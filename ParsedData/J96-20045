e categories used by the coders.
    For instance, consider what happens when the coders randomly place units into categories instead of using an established coding scheme.
    If there are two categories occurring in equal proportions, on average the coders would agree with each other half of the time: each time the second coder makes a choice, there is a fifty/fifty chance of coming up with the same category as the first coder.
    If, instead, the two coders were to use four categories in equal proportions, we would expect them to agree 25% of the time (since no matter what the first coder chooses, there is a 25% chance that the second coder will agree.)
    And if both coders were to use one of two categories, but use one of the categories 95% of the time, we would expect them to agree 90.5% of the time (.952 + .052, or, in words, 95% of the time the first coder chooses the first category, with a .95 chance of the second coder also choosing that category, and 5% of the time the first coder chooses the sec
