 indicated, reordering plays an important role on this task.
    The rather free word order in German as well as the verb group seems to be difficult to translate.
    Nevertheless, when ignoring the word order and looking at the mPER only, the monotone search is competitive with the best performing system.
    For further improvements, we will investigate the usefulness of additional models, e.g. modeling the segmentation probability.
    Also, slightly relaxing the monotonicity constraint in a way that still allows an efficient search is of high interest.
    In spirit of the IBM reordering constraints of the single-word based models, we could allow a phrase to be skipped and to be translated later.
