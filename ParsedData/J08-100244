re abstracted (i.e., ignored) for smoothing.
    Tables 2, 3, and 4 show the full set of templates of combined features used in the experiments.
    Each row represents the template for a feature function.
    A check indicates the atomic feature is incorporated, and a hyphen indicates the feature is ignored.
    Feature templates for root condition.
    Feature templates for predicate&#8211;argument dependencies.
  
  
    This section presents experimental results on the parsing accuracy attained by the feature forest models.
    In all of the following experiments, we use the HPSG grammar developed by the method of Miyao, Ninomiya, and Tsujii (2005).
    Section 5.1 describes how this grammar was developed.
    Section 5.2 explains other aspects of the experimental settings.
    In Sections 5.3 to 5.7, we report results of the experiments on HPSG parsing.
    In the following experiments, we use Enju 2.1 (Tsujii Laboratory 2004), which is a widecoverage HPSG grammar extracted from the Penn Treebank by the
