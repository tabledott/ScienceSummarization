unning time of EM.
    Notably, neither of these inference approaches offers any test to know if the optimal alignment is ever found.
    Furthermore, they both require small data sets due to computational expense.
    We cast O as an ILP problem, for which many optimization techniques are well known.
    First, we introduce binary indicator variables ai,j,k,l denoting whether (eij, fkl) &#8712; a.
    Furthermore, we introduce binary indicators ei,j and fk,l that denote whether some (eij, &#183;) or (&#183;, fkl) appears in a, respectively.
    Finally, we represent the weight function 0 as a weight vector in the program: wi,j,k,l = log 0(eij, fkl).
    Now, we can express an integer program that, when optimized, will yield the optimal alignment of our weighted sentence pair.
