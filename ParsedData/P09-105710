dentified by IP is not uniquely minimal.
    For the same word sequence, there exist other minimal grammars having the same size (459 entries).
    In our experiments, we choose the first solution returned by CPLEX. sequence consistent with the IP grammar (90.3%), it finds a relatively good one.
    The IP+EM tagging (with 84.5% accuracy) has some interesting properties.
    First, the dictionary we observe from the tagging is of higher quality (with fewer spurious tagging assignments) than the one we observe from the original EM tagging.
    Figure 4 shows some examples.
    We also measure the quality of the two observed grammars/dictionaries by computing their precision and recall against the grammar/dictionary we observe in the gold tagging.4 We find that precision of the observed grammar increases from 0.73 (EM) to 0.94 (IP+EM).
    In addition to removing many bad tag bigrams from the grammar, IP minimization also removes some of the good ones, leading to lower recall (EM = 0.87, IP+EM = 0.57).
