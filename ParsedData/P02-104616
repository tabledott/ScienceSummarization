ie, there is no prediction.
    The cost of a classifier pair (F, G) is based on a more general version of theorem 2, that admits abstaining rules.
    The following theorem is based on (Dasgupta et al., 2001).
    Theorem 4 If view independence is satisfied, and if F and G are rules based on different views, then one of the following holds: In other words, for a given binary rule F, a pessimistic estimate of the number of errors made by F is S/(&#181; &#8722; S) times the number of instances labeled by F, plus the number of instances left unlabeled by F. Finally, we note that the cost of F is sensitive to the choice of G, but the cost of F with respect to G is not necessarily the same as the cost of G with respect to F. To get an overall cost, we average the cost of F with respect to G and G with respect to F. Figure 5 shows the performance of the greedy agreement algorithm after each iteration.
    Because not all test instances are labeled (some are neither persons nor locations nor organizations), and bec
