 a list like the one in Figure 5 automatically (Figure 12 shows the actual output of the system when run on the example paper).
    In the next section, we turn to the manual annotation step and the development of the gold standard used during system training and system evaluation.
  
  
    For any linguistic analysis that requires subjective interpretation and that is therefore not objectively true or false, it is important to show that humans share some intuitions about the analysis.
    This is typically done by showing that they can apply it independently of each other and that the variation they display is bounded (i.e., not arbitrarily high).
    The argument is strengthened if the judges are people other than the developers of the analysis, preferably &#8220;naive&#8221; subjects (i.e., not computational linguists).
    Apart from the cognitive validation of our analysis, high agreement is essential if the annotated corpus is to be used as training material for a machine learning process, like the one
