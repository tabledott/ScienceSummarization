ionings imposed by the G?T4.
  By contrast, he :PROMOTE marker specified in the Spanish entry forces the head and adjunct o swap places in the syn- tactic structure.
  The general solution to promotional divergence is diagrammed as follows: (18) RLCS 1: [T(Q) Q] RLCS 2: [T(Q) :PROMOTE Q] Translation: [Y-MAX [Y-MAX W [X--MAX X Z]] Q] [T(X) X ([T(W) W], [T(Z) Z] [T(Q) Q])] [Y-MAX [Y-MAX W [X-MAX Q [ ... X Z]]]] 4.3 Demotional Divergence Demotional divergence is characterized by the demotion (placement "lower down") of a logical head into an internal argument position (or vice versa), as shown in Figure 9c.
  In such a situation, the logical head is associated with the syntactic adjunct position, and the logical argument is then associated with a syntactic head position.
  Thus, 610 Bonnie J. Dorr Machine Translation Divergences demotional divergence overrides the g?T4, invoking the following sets of relations in place of steps 1 and 3 of (10): (19) 1.
