to be optimized on held-out data.
    In our experiments, we set p0 = 0.2.
    Whereas the HMM is based on first-order dependencies p(i = aj  |aj&#8722;1,I) for the alignment distribution, Models 1 and 2 use zero-order dependencies p(i = aj  |j, I, J): Hence, the word order does not affect the alignment probability.
    To reduce the number of alignment parameters, we ignore the dependence on J in the alignment model and use a distribution p(aj  |j, I) instead of p(aj  |j, I, J).
    In the following, we give a short description of the fertility-based alignment models of Brown, Della Pietra, Della Pietra, and Mercer (1993).
    A gentle introduction can be found in Knight (1999b).
    The fertility-based alignment models (Models 3, 4, and 5) (Brown, Della Pietra, Della Pietra, and Mercer 1993) have a significantly more complicated structure than the simple Models 1 and 2.
    The fertility Oi of a word ei in position i is defined as the number of aligned source words: The fertility-based alignment models cont
