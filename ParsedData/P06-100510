act you don&#8217;t marry your own mother or write your own obituary is perhaps obvious, but this is the first time this kind of knowledge has been made available computationally.
    Naturally, exceptions to the coreference or non-coreference of some of these paths can be found; our patterns represent general trends only.
    And, as mentioned above, reliable path coreference is somewhat dependent on consistent parsing.
    Paths connecting pronouns to pronouns are different than paths connecting both nouns and pronouns to pronouns &#8211; the case we are ultimately interested in resolving.
    Consider &#8220;Company A gave its data on its website.&#8221; The pronoun-pronoun path coreference algorithm described above would learn the terminals in &#8220;Noun&#8217;s data on pronoun&#8217;s website&#8221; are often coreferent.
    But if we see the phrase &#8220;Company A gave Company B&#8217;s data on its website,&#8221; then &#8220;its&#8221; is not likely to refer to &#8220;Company B,&#8221; even though we
