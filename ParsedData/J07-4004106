setting (&#946; = 0.075).
    This suggests that, in order to increase the accuracy of the parser without losing efficiency, the accuracy of the supertagger at the &#946; = 0.075 level needs to be improved, without increasing the number of categories assigned on average.
    A possible response to our policy of adaptive supertagging is that any statistical parser can be made to run faster, for example by changing the beam parameter in the Collins (2003) parser, but that any increase in speed is typically associated with a reduction in accuracy.
    For the CCG parser, the accuracy did not degrade when using the new adaptive parsing strategy.
    Thus the accuracy and efficiency of the parser were not tuned separately: The configuration used to obtain the speed results was also used to obtain the accuracy results in Sections 10.2 and 11.
    To give some idea of how these parsing speeds compare with existing parsers, Table 12 gives the parse times on Section 23 for a number of well-known parsers.
