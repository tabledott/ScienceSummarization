  In this case, the relationship between Eb and E&#8222; then depends on the configuration of RTb and ETb.
    If ETb = RTb, then (minimally) Eb is taken to coincide in some way with Ea.
    This is shown in Figure 3a.
    If ETb &lt; RTb (as in the perfect tenses), Eb is taken to precede Ea.
    This is shown in Figure 3d.
    Alternatively, 0 may embody part of the tripartite ontology of events mentioned earlier: 13prep links RTb to the preparatory phase of Ea (as shown in Figure 3b)&#8212; i.e.
    : Pprep(Cb, Ea, RTb) = Eb while B conseq links RTb to the consequent phase of Ea (as shown in Figure 3c)&#8212;i.e.
    : (There is a third possibility&#8212;that RTb links to the culmination of Ea&#8212;but it is not clear to me that it could be distinguished from the simpler 00 function given above, which links RTb to Ea itself.
    Also, while [3prep and la conseq relations for RTb might theoretically be possible for a perfect, it is not clear to me that these cases could be distinguished from the simpler 0o.
