troductory material, or cover the exposition and development of the text, or contain conclusions and results&amp;quot; (p. 55).
    Thus, they do not address the subtopic detection task because they attempt only to find those segments of text that are strongly different than the surrounding text.
    They do this by comparing similarity between a paragraph and its four closest paragraph neighbors to the left and the right.
    If a similarity score between a pair of paragraphs does not exceed a threshold, then the link between that pair is removed.
    If a disconnected sequence of paragraphs is found, that sequence is considered a text segment.
    This algorithm is not evaluated.
    Kozima (1993) describes an algorithm for the detection of text segments, which are defined as &amp;quot;a sequence of clauses or sentences that display local coherence&amp;quot; (p. 286) in narrative text.
    Kozima (1993) presents a very elaborate algorithm for computing the lexical cohesiveness of a window of words, using sp
