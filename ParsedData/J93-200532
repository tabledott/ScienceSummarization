ition, in which case they are typically serving metonymically for the containee.
    Thus, the container LCP relates the set of generalized syntactic patterns V, Ni {to, from, on} Nk vi N This LCP includes a nominal alternation between the container and containee in the object position of verbs.
    For tape, this alternation is manifested for verbs that predicate the telic role of data storage but not the formal role of physical object, which refers to the object as a whole regardless of its contents: We have explored the use of heuristics to distinguish those predicates that relate to the Telic quale of the noun.
    Consider the word tape, which occurs as the direct object in 107 sentences in our corpus.
    It appears with a total of 34 different verbs.
    By applying the mutual information metric (MI) to the verb&#8212;object pairs, we can sort the verbs accordingly, giving us the table of verbs most highly associated with tape, shown in Figure 2.
    While the mutual information statistic does a good j
