e and its translation, but also the exact correspondence between their sub-parts.
    Among the grammar formalisms successfully put into use in syntaxbased SMT are synchronous context-free grammars (SCFG) (Wu, 1997) and synchronous treesubstitution grammars (STSG) (Yamada and Knight, 2001).
    Both formalisms have led to SMT systems whose performance is state-of-the-art (Chiang, 2005; Galley et al., 2006).
    Synchronous grammars have also been used in other NLP tasks, most notably semantic parsing, which is the construction of a complete, formal meaning representation (MR) of an NL sentence.
    In our previous work (Wong and Mooney, 2006), semantic parsing is cast as a machine translation task, where an SCFG is used to model the translation of an NL into a formal meaning-representation language (MRL).
    Our algorithm, WASP, uses statistical models developed for syntax-based SMT for lexical learning and parse disambiguation.
    The result is a robust semantic parser that gives good performance in variou
