ollowing examples: suppose the truth contains two large coreference chains and one small one (Figure 6), and suppose Figures 7 and 8 show two different responses.
    We will explore two different precision errors.
    The first error will connect one of the large coreference chains with the small one (Figure 7).
    The second error occurs when the two large coreference chains are related by the errant coreferent link (Figure 8).
    It is our position that the second error is more damaging because, compared to the first error, the second error makes more entities coreferent that should not be.
    This distinction is not reflected in the (Vilain 95) scorer which scores both responses as having a precision score of 90% (Figure 9).
    Imagine a scenario where a user recalls a collection of articles about John Smith, finds a single article about the particular John Smith of interest and wants to see all the other articles about that individual.
    In commercial systems with News data, precision is typically
