e the potential and the usefulness of the proposed method, we evaluate the result based on three measures: usefulness, argument role coverage, and correctness.
    For the usefulness evaluation, we manually reviewed the tables to determine whether a useful table is included or not.
    This is inevitably subjective, as the user does not specify in advance what table rows and columns are expected.
    We asked a subject to judge usefulness in three grades; A) very useful &#8211; for the query, many people might want to use this table for the further investigation of the topic, B) useful &#8211; at least, for some purpose, some people might want to use this table for further investigation and C) not useful &#8211; no one will be interested in using this table for further investigation.
    The argument role coverage measures the percentage of the roles specified for each ACE event type which appeared as a column in one or more of the created tables for that event type.
    The correctness was measured based on
