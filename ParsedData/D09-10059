quipped with a Kleene closure operator *.
    For example, in the real semiring (Il2, +, x, 0, 1), we define p* = (1 &#8722; p)&#8722;1 (= 1 + p + p2 + ...) for |p |&lt; 1 and is undefined otherwise.
    The closure operator enables exact summation over the infinitely many paths in a cyclic FSM, or trees in a hypergraph with non-branching cycles, without the need to iterate around cycles to numerical convergence.
    For completeness, we specify the closure operator for our semirings, satisfying the axioms k* = 1 &#174; k &#174; k* = 1 &#174; k* &#174; k, but we do not use it in our experiments since our hypergraphs are acyclic.
    3We assume that HG has already been built by deductive inference (Shieber et al., 1994).
    But in practice, the nodes&#8217; inside weights ,3(v) are usually accumulated as the hypergraph is being built, so that pruning heuristics can consult them.
    4Actually, the notation &#174;eEd ke assumes that &#174; is commutative as well, as does the notation &#8220;for u E T(e)&#8221;
