test).
    We can also see from these results that WSJ, although it is about the same size as LOB, and has a smaller tagset, has a higher difficulty level than LOB.
    We suspect that an important reason for this is the inconsistency in the WSJ annotation (cf.
    Ratnaparkhi 1996).
    We examine this effect in more detail below.
    The Eindhoven corpus, both with Wotan and WotanLite tagsets, is yet more difficult, but here the difficulty lies mainly in the complexity of the tagset and the large percentage of unknown words in the test sets.
    We see that the reduction in the complexity of the tagset from Wotan to WotanLite leads to an enormous improvement in accuracy.
    This granularity effect is also examined in more detail below.
    On the basis of the output of the single taggers we can also examine the feasibility of combination, as combination is dependent on different systems producing different errors.
    As expected, a large part of the errors are indeed uncorrelated: the agreement between th
