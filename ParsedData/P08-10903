cterized by the grammatical role played by the protagonist, and by the protagonist&#8217;s shared connection to surrounding events.
    Our algorithm is an unsupervised distributional learning approach that uses coreferring arguments as evidence of a narrative relation.
    We show, using a new evaluation task called narrative cloze, that our protagonist-based method leads to better induction than a verb-only approach.
    The next step is to order events in the same narrative chain.
    We apply work in the area of temporal classification to create partial orders of our learned events.
    We show, using a coherence-based evaluation of temporal ordering, that our partial orders lead to better coherence judgements of real narrative instances extracted from documents.
    Finally, the space of narrative events and temporal orders is clustered and pruned to create discrete sets of narrative chains.
  
  
    While previous work hasn&#8217;t focused specifically on learning narratives1, our work draws from two l
