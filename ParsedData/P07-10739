training bags consist of sentences extracted from online documents, using the methodology described in Section 6.
    Parsing web documents in order to obtain a syntactic analysis often gives unreliable results &#8211; the type of narrative can vary greatly from one web document to another, and sentences with grammatical errors are frequent.
    Therefore, for the initial experiments, we used a modified version of the subsequence kernel of Bunescu and Mooney (2006), which does not require syntactic information.
    This kernel computes the number of common subsequences of tokens between two sentences.
    The subsequences are constrained to be &#8220;anchored&#8221; at the two entity names, and there is a maximum number of tokens that can appear in a sequence.
    For example, a subsequence feature for the sentence S1 in Figure 1 is s&#65533; = &#8220;(e1) ... bought ... (e2) ... in ... billion ... deal&#8221;, where (e1) and (e2) are generic placeholders for the two entity names.
