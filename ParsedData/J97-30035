and its ending.
    Brill (1994, 1995) describes a system of rules that uses both ending-guessing and more morphologically motivated rules.
    A morphological rule, unlike an ending-guessing rule, uses information about morphologically related words already known to the lexicon in its prediction.
    For instance, a morphologically motivated guessing rule can say that a word is an adjective if adding the suffix /y to it will result in a word.
    Clearly, ending-guessing rules have wider coverage than morphologically oriented ones, but their predictions can be less accurate.
    The major topic in the development of word-Pos guessers is the strategy used for the acquisition of the guessing rules.
    A rule-based tagger described in Voutilainen (1995) was equipped with a set of guessing rules that had been hand-crafted using knowledge of English morphology and intuitions.
    A more appealing approach is automatic acquisition of such rules from available lexical resources, since it is usually less labor-inte
