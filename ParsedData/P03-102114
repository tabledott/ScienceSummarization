In our experiments, we compute in every iteration about 200 alternative translations.
    In practice, the algorithm converges after about five to seven iterations.
    As a result, error rate cannot increase on the training corpus.
    A major problem in applying the MMI criterion is the fact that the reference translations need to be part of the provided-best list.
    Quite often, none of the given reference translations is part of the-best list because the search algorithm performs pruning, which in principle limits the possible translations that can be produced given a certain input sentence.
    To solve this problem, we define for the MMI training new pseudo-references by selecting from thebest list all the sentences which have a minimal number of word errors with respect to any of the true references.
    Note that due to this selection approach, the results of the MMI criterion might be biased toward the mWER criterion.
    It is a major advantage of the minimum error rate training that it is not nec
