all parts of speech.
    Below we list two lexicalized transformations that were learned, training once again on the Wall Street Journal.
    Change the tag: The Penn Treebank tagging style manual specifies that in the collocation as ...as, the first as is tagged as an adverb and the second is tagged as a preposition.
    Since as is most frequently tagged as a preposition in the training corpus, the initial-state tagger will mistag the phrase as tall as as: The first lexicalized transformation corrects this mistagging.
    Note that a bigram tagger trained on our training set would not correctly tag the first occurrence of as.
    Although adverbs are more likely than prepositions to follow some verb form tags, the fact that P(as I IN) is much greater than P(as I RB), and P(JJ I IN) is much greater than P(JJ RB) lead to as being incorrectly tagged as a preposition by a stochastic tagger.
    A trigram tagger will correctly tag this collocation in some instances, due to the fact that P(IN I RB JJ) is greater
