ofitably seen as a means of summarizing a joint distribution.
    In particular, we would like to find a set of clusters C such that each conditional distribution p0(v) can be approximately decomposed as where p(c1n) is the membership probability of n in c and pc(v) = p(vIc) is v's conditional probability given by the centroid distribution for cluster c. The above decomposition can be written in a more symmetric form as assuming that p(n) and P(n) coincide.
    We will take (1) as our basic clustering model.
    To determine this decomposition we need to solve the two connected problems of finding suitable forms for the cluster membership p(cln) and the centroid distributions p(v lc), and of maximizing the goodness of fit between the model distribution An, v) and the observed data.
    Goodness of fit is determined by the model's likelihood of the observations.
    The maximum likelihood (ML) estimation principle is thus the natural tool to determine the centroid distributions Pc (v).
