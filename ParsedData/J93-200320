    Models 3 and 4 are deficient, a technical concept defined and discussed in Section 4.5.
    Briefly, this means that they waste some of their probability on objects that are not French strings at all.
    Model 5 is very much like Model 4, except that it is not deficient.
    Models 1-4 serve as stepping stones to the training of Model 5.
    Models 1 and 2 have an especially simple mathematical form so that iterations of the EM algorithm can be computed exactly.
    That is, we can explicitly perform sums over all possible alignments for these two models.
    In addition, Model 1 has a unique local maximum so that parameters derived for it in a series of EM iterations do not depend on the starting point for the iterations.
    As explained below, we use Model 1 to provide initial estimates for the parameters of Model 2.
    In Model 2 and subsequent models, the likelihood function does not have a unique local maximum, but by initializing each model from the parameters of the model before it, we a
