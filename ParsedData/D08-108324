stances with positive polarity than in the MPQA corpus.
    Nairn et al. (2006) also employ a &#8220;polarity&#8221; propagation algorithm in their approach to the semantic interpretation of implicatives.
    However, their notion of polarity is quite different from that assumed here and in the literature on sentiment analysis.
    In particular, it refers to the degree of &#8220;commitment&#8221; of the author to the truth or falsity of a complement clause for a textual entailment task.
    McDonald et al. (2007) use a structured model to determine the sentence-level polarity and the document-level polarity simultaneously.
    But decisions at each sentence level does not consider structural inference within the sentence.
    Among the studies that examined content-word negators, Niu et al. (2005) manually collected a small set of such words (referred as &#8220;words that change phases&#8221;), but their lexicon was designed mainly for the medical domain and the type of negators was rather limited.
