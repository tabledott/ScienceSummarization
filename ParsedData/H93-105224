ent collo- cation types for those tagged examples.
  The one sense per discourse constraint can be used to refine this process further.
  We are working on a similar use of these two constraints for unsupervised sense clustering.
  Algor i thm Design Our results also have implications for algorithm design.
  For the large number of current approaches which treat wide con- text as an unordered bag of words, it may be beneficial to model certain local collocations separately.
  We have shown that reliability of collocational evidence differs considerably between local and distant context, especially for verbs and adjectives.
  If one one is interested inproviding aprobability with an answer, modeling local collocations separately will improve the probability estimates and reduce cross entropy.
  Another eason for modeling local collocations separately is that his will allow the reliable inclusion of evidence with very low frequency counts.
  Evidence with observed frequency dis- tributions of 1/0 typically cons
