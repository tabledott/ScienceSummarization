ed set of 600 documents (half in each language) containing 240 translation pairs (as judged by humans).
    This technique yielded a 63MB parallel corpus of English-German.
    Other work on Web mining has been done by Jinxi Xu of BBN (personal communication), who began with our STRAND implementation and added a module for automatically learning string substitution patterns for URLs and also implemented a different dynamic programming algorithm for assessing structural alignment.
    Xu used the modified STRAND to obtain 3,376 Chinese-English document pairs, which we evaluated formally (see above), determining that the set has 98% precision and 61% recall.
    In addition, STRAND has been reimplemented by David Martinez and colleagues at Informatika Fakultatea in the Basque Country (personal communication), in order to perform exploratory experiments for discovering English-Basque document pairs.
    It is worth noting that STRAND, PTMiner, and BITS are all largely independent of linguistic knowledge about th
