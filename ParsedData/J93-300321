 present FO contours of synthetic speech, where the x-axis represents time and the y-axis, frequency in Hz.2 In Figure 1, the first FO peak occurs on let's; in Figure 2, the first peak occurred on now.
    The most prominent accent in a phrase is termed the nuclear stress, or nuclear H* accent on now. accent, of the phrase.
    In both Figures 1 and 2, cue bears nuclear stress.
    In addition to the FO excursions illustrated in Figures 1-5, accented syllables tend to be longer and louder than deaccented syllables, so there are a number of acoustic correlates of this perceptual phenomenon.
    In Pierrehumbert's description of English, there are six types of pitch accent, all composed of either a single low (L*) or high (H*) tone or an ordered pair of low and high tones, such as L+H* or H*+L.
    In each case, the tone aligned with the stressed syllable of the accented lexical item is indicated by a star (*); thus, if telephone is uttered with a L*+H accent, the low tone (L*) is aligned with the stressed syll
