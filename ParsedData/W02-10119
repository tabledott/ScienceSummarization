policy that maximized the accuracy of the baselines).
    While the tie rates suggest that the brevity of the human-produced lists is a factor in the relatively poor performance results, it is not the case that size alone necessarily limits accuracy.
    Based on a very preliminary examination of frequency counts in the entire corpus (including test data) plus introspection, we created a list of seven positive and seven negative words (including punctuation), shown in Figure 2.
    As that figure indicates, using these words raised the accuracy to 69%.
    Also, although this third list is of comparable length to the other two, it has a much lower tie rate of 16%.
    We further observe that some of the items in this third list, such as &#8220;?&#8221; or &#8220;still&#8221;, would probably not have been proposed as possible candidates merely through introspection, although upon reflection one sees their merit (the question mark tends to occur in sentences like &#8220;What was the director thinking?&#8221;; &
