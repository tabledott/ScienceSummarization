se model.
  Second, there is a special member of this set called the BACKWARD-LOOKING CENTER, Cb.
  The Cb is the discourse ntity that the utterance most centrally concerns, what has been elsewhere called the theme (Reinhart 1981; Horn 1986).
  The Cb entity links the current utterance to the previous discourse.
  The set of FORWARD-LOOKING CENTERS, Cf, is ranked according to discourse salience.
  We will discuss factors that determine the ranking below.
  The highest-ranked member of the set of forward-looking centers is referred to as the PREFERRED CENTER, Cp.
  4 The PREFERRED CENTER represents a prediction about the Cb of the following utterance.
  Sometimes the Cp will be what the previous egment of discourse was about, the Cb, but this is not necessarily the case.
  This distinction between looking back to the previ- ous discourse with the Cb and projecting preferences for interpretation i subsequent discourse with the Cp is a key aspect of centering theory.
  In addition to the structures for centers,
