 of space.
    We then use these values to compute two conditional probability distributions: , the probability that source word trans, i.e. the distribution of given that is present is the same as the distribution of when is not present.
    The LLR statistic gives a measure of the likelihood of this hypothesis.
    The LLR score of a word pair is low when these two distributions are very similar (i.e. the words are independent), and high otherwise (i.e. the words are strongly associated).
    However, high LLR scores can indicate either a positive association (i.e. lates into target word , and , the probability that does not translate into .
    We obtain the distributions by normalizing the LLR scores for each source word.
    The whole procedure follows: Word-align the parallel corpus.
    Following Och and Ney (2003), we run GIZA++ in both directions, and then symmetrize the alignments using the refined heuristic.
    Compute all LLR scores.
    There will be an LLR score for each pair of words which are
