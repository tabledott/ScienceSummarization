    The segmentation boundaries were placed at the ends of sentences.
    The segmentations were evaluated by applying an evaluation program in Choi&#8217;s package.
    The results are listed in Tables 2 and 3. is the result for our system when the numbers of segments were determined by the system.
    is the result for our system when the numbers of segments were given beforehand.8 and are the corresponding results for the systems deprobabilistic error metric proposed by Beeferman, et al. (1999).7 Low indicates high accuedges in the minimum-cost path, then the resulting segmentation often contains very small segments consisting of only one or two sentences.
    We found empirically that segments obtained by recursive segmentation were better than those obtained by minimum-cost segmentation when the specified number of segments was somewhat larger than that of the minimum-cost path, whose number of segments was automatically determined by the algorithm.
