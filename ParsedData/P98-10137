ently capturing human insights into semantic structure.
    The majority of the work involved is marking text with semantic tags, specifying (again by hand) the structure of the frames to be treated, and writing dictionary-style entries based the results of annotation and a priori descriptions.
    With the exception of the example sentence extraction component, all the software modules are highly interactive and have substantial user interface requirements.
    Most of this functionality is provided by WWW-based programs written in PERL.
    Four processing steps are required produce the FrameNet database of frame semantic representations: (a) generating initial descriptions of semantic and syntactic patterns for use in corpus queries and annotation (&amp;quot;Preparation&amp;quot;), (b) extracting good example sentences (&amp;quot;Subcorpus Extraction&amp;quot;), (c) marking (by hand) the constituents of interest (&amp;quot;Annotation&amp;quot;), and (d) building a database of lexical semantic representatio
