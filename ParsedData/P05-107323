harniak&#8217;s parser altered the tokenization of the input sentence and tokens could not be aligned.
    As our results show, the error reduction of our joint model with respect to the local model is more modest in this setting.
    One reason for this is the lower upper bound, due largely to the the much poorer performance of the identification model on automatic parses.
    For ARGM, the local identification model achieves 85.9 F-Measure and 59.4 Frame Accuracy; the local classification model achieves 92.3 F-Measure and 83.1 Frame Accuracy.
    It seems that the largest boost would come from features that can identify arguments in the presence of parser errors, rather than the features of our joint model, which ensure global coherence of the argument frame.
    We still achieve 10.7% and 18.5% error reduction for CORE arguments in F-Measure and Frame Accuracy respectively.
