 coreference equivalence classes can be merged unless there exist any incompatible NPs in the classes to be merged.
    It is useful to consider the application of our algorithm to an excerpt from a document: [i The chairman] spoke with [2 Ms. White] yesterday.
    [3 He] ...
    The noun phrase instances for this fragment are shown in Table 3.
    Initially, NPI, NP2, and NP3 are all singletons and belong to coreference classes c2, and c3, respectively.
    We begin by considering NP3.
    Dist(N P2,N P3) = oo due to a mismatch on gender, so they are not considered for possible merging.
    Next, we calculate the distance from NPi to NP3.
    Pronouns are not expected to match when the words of two noun phrases are compared, so there is no penalty here for word (or head noun) mismatches.
    The penalty for their difference in position is dependent on the length of the document.
    For illustration, assume that this is less than r. Thus, dist(NPi, NP3) &lt; r. Their coreference classes, c1 and c3, are then
