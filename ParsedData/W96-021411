how that it holds for trees of depth n +1.
    There are eight cases, one for each of the eight rules.
    We show two of them.
    Let Bak represent a tree of at most depth n with external leaves, headed by Bk, and with internal intermediate non-terminals.
    Then, for trees such as the probability of the tree is.
    -1- = -.
    Simibk ci aj a, larly, for another case, trees headed by A the probability of the tree is*kk-0 = 1.
    The other six cases follow trivially with similar reasoning.
    We call a PCFG derivation isomorphic to a STSG derivation if for every substitution in the STSG there is a corresponding subderivation in the PCFG.
    Figure 4 contains an example of isomorphic derivations, using two subtrees in the STSG and four productions in the PCFG.
    We call a PCFG tree isomorphic to a STSG tree if they are identical when internal nonterminals are changed to external non-terminals.
    Our main theorem is that this construction produces PCFG trees isomorphic to the STSG trees with equal pr
