lly from the parsed corpus is likely to be poor because of the lack of any rigorous checks on the form of the skeleton parses.
    Such a grammar might, in principle, be trained from the parsed corpus, but there are still likely to be small mismatches between the actual analysis assigned manually and any assigned automatically.
    For these reasons, we decided to attempt to produce a training corpus using the grammar that we wished ultimately to train.
    As long as the method employed ensured that any analysis assigned was a member of the set defined by the grammar, these problems during training should not arise.
    Following our experience of constructing a substantial lexicon for the ANLT grammar from unreliable and indeterminate data (Carroll and Grover 1989), we decided to construct the disambiguated training corpus semi-automatically, restricting manual interaction to selection between alternatives defined by the ANLT grammar.
    One obvious technique would be to generate all possible parses with a
