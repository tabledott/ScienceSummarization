classifier from (Riloff and Wiebe, 2003), and find that 65.6% of Palestinian sentences and 66.2% of Israeli sentences are classified as subjective.
    The high but almost equivalent percentages of subjective sentences in the two perspectives support our observation in Section 2 that a perspective is largely expressed using subjective language, but that the amount of subjectivity in a document is not necessarily indicative of its perspective.
  
  
    We develop algorithms for learning perspectives using a statistical framework.
    Denote a training corpus as a set of documents Wn and their perspectives labels Dn, n = 1, ... , N, where N is the total number of documents in the corpus.
    Given a new document W with a unknown document perspective, the perspective D&#65533; is calculated based on the following conditional probability.
    We are also interested in how strongly each sentence in a document conveys perspective information.
    Denote the intensity of the m-th sentence of the n-th document as a
