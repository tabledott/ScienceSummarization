ere asked to judge whether or not the system classification was acceptable (i.e. whether or not the relations output by the system were correct).
    Since the semantic relations are not disjoint (e.g. mop is both stronger than and similar to sweep), multiple relations may be appropriately acceptable for a given verb pair.
    The judges were also asked to identify their preferred semantic relations (i.e. those relations which seem most plausible).
    Table 3 shows five randomly selected pairs along with the judges' responses.
    The Appendix shows sample relationships discovered by the system.
    Table 4 shows the accuracy of the system.
    The baseline system consists of labeling each pair with the most common semantic relation, similarity, which occurs 33 times.
    The Tags Correct column represents the percentage of verb pairs whose system output relations were deemed correct.
    The Preferred Tags Correct column gives the percentage of verb pairs whose system output relations matched exactly the hu
