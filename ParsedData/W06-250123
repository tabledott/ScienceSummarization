tor measure attempts to overcome this &#8220;exactness&#8221; by using vectors that capture the contextual representation of all words.
    So even though silverware and spoon do not overlap, their contextual representations would overlap to some extent.
  
  
    (Wilks et al., 1990) describe a word sense disambiguation algorithm that also uses vectors to determine the intended sense of an ambiguous word.
    In their approach, they use dictionary definitions from LDOCE (Procter, 1978).
    The words in these definitions are used to build a co&#8211;occurrence matrix, which is very similar to our technique of using the WordNet glosses for our Word Space.
    They augment their dictionary definitions with similar words, which are determined using the co&#8211; occurrence matrix.
    Each concept in LDOCE is then represented by an aggregate vector created by adding the co&#8211;occurrence counts for each of the words in the augmented definition of the concept.
    The next step in their algorithm is to form a
