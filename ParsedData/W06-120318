 measure when compared with their associated composed vector, and this is indeed the case, as shown in Table 1.
    We also compared the literal and non-literal vectors for ins Wasser fallen from the first experiment with the composed vector, computed out of the meaning vectors for Wasser and for fallen.9 The difference isn&#8217;t large, but nevertheless the composed vector is more similar to the literal vector (cosine of 0.2937) than to the non-literal vector (cosine of 0.1733).
    Extending to the general case, our task was to compare the composed vector to the actual vector for all the MWEs in our test set.
    The resulting cosine similarity values range from 0.01 to 0.80.
    Our hope was that there would be a similarity threshold for distinguishing MWEs that have non-compositional interpretations from those that do not.
    Indeed of the MWEs with a similarity values of under 0.1, just over half are MWEs which were hand-annotated to have non-literal uses.10 It used in their idiomatic sense (apparently
