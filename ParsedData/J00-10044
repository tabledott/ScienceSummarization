and a corresponding target string.
    The recursive decomposition of the training examples results from an algorithm for computing hierarchical alignments of the examples, described in Section 4.2.
    This alignment algorithm uses dynamic programming search guided by source-target word correlation statistics as described in Section 4.1.
    Having constructed a hierarchical alignment for the training examples, a set of head transducer transitions are constructed from each example as described in Section 4.3.
    Finally, the dependency transduction model is constructed by aggregating the resulting head transducers and assigning transition weights, which are log probabilities computed from the training counts by simple maximum likelihood estimation.
    We have applied this method of training statistical dependency transduction models in experiments on English-to-Spanish and English-to-Japanese translations of transcribed spoken utterances.
    The results of these experiments are described in Section 5; our
