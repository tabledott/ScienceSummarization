 to determine the total probability of a sentence, that is, the sum of the probabilities of all parses found for that sentence.
    We then computed several quantities for best-first parsing with each figure of merit at the point where the best-first parsing method has found parses contributing at least 95% of the probability mass of the sentence.
    The 95% figure is simply a convenience; see Appendix C for a discussion of speed versus accuracy.
    We compared the figures of merit using the following measures: includes only words within the constituent.
    The statistics converged to their final values quickly.
    The edge-count percentages were generally within .01 of their final values after processing only 200 sentences, so the results were quite stable by the end of our 500-sentence test corpus.
    We gathered statistics for each sentence length from 3 to 30.
    Sentence length was limited to a maximum of 30 because of the huge number of edges that are generated in doing a full parse of long senten
