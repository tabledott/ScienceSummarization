milar behavior in evaluating these experimental results.
			They both reach a maximal value with 35 clusters, however, Q2shows a greater descent as the number of clusters in creases.
			We will discuss this quality in greater detail in section 5.2.
			5.2 Pitch Accent Clustering.
			Pitch accent is how speakers of many languages make a word intonational prominent.
			In mostpitch accent languages, words can also be accented in different ways to convey different meanings (Hirschberg, 2002).
			In the ToBI labeling con ventions for Standard American English (Silvermanet al, 1992), for example, there are five different ac cent types (H*, L*, H+!H*, L+H*, L*+H).
			We extracted a number of acoustic features from accented words within the read portion of the Boston Directions Corpus (BDC) (Nakatani et al, 1995) andexamined how well clustering in these acoustic dimensions correlates to manually annotated pitch ac cent types.
			We obtained a very skewed distribution,with a majority of H* pitch accents.5 We there fo
