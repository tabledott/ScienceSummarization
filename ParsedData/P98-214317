 the event of no subject being available, it is not able to propose an antecedent (the manual guide used as evaluation text contained many imperative zero-subject sentences).
    In the second experiment we evaluated the approach from the point of view also of its &amp;quot;critical success rate&amp;quot;.
    This measure (Mitkov 1998b) applies only to anaphors &amp;quot;ambiguous&amp;quot; from the point of view of number and gender (i.e. to those &amp;quot;tough&amp;quot; anaphors which, after activating the gender and number filters, still have more than one candidate for antecedent) and is indicative of the performance of the antecedent indicators.
    Our evaluation established the critical success rate as 82%.
    A case where the system failed was when the anaphor and the antecedent were in the same sentence and where preference was given to a candidate in the preceding sentence.
    This case and other cases suggest that it might be worthwhile reconsidering/refining the weights for the indicator &amp
