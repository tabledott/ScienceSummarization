d for a noncentered entity.
    We will consider each case separately.
    Several different functions may be served by the use of a full definite noun phrase to realize the currently centered entity.
    For instance, the full noun phrase may include some new and unshared information about the entity.
    In such cases, additional inferences arise from the need to determine that the center has not shifted and that the properties expressed hold for the centered entity.
    For example, in the following sequences the full definite noun phrases that are in boldface do more than merely refer.
    When the current center is not pronominalized (it may not be present in the sentence), the use of a pronoun to express an entity other than the current center, is strongly constrained.
    The particular cases that have been identified involve instances in which attention is being shifted back to a previously centered entity (e.g., Grosz, 1977; Reichman, 1978) or to one element of a set that is currently centered.
