fer ent predominant sense; other characteristics of the sense distribution may also differ such as entropy ofthe sense distribution and the dominance of the pre dominant sense.
			In Table 1 we show the entropy per word in our sample and relative frequency (relfr) ofits first sense (fs), for each of our three gold stan dard annotated corpora.
			We compute the entropy ofa word?s sense distribution as a fraction of the pos sible entropy (Yarowsky and Florian, 2002) $#%  (*),+ .0/21fi3)5476982:;69869 where $  = @?BADC 6982:;6986FE G H2IKJFL E MG  . This measure reduces the impact of the number of senses of a word and focuses on the uncertainty within thedistribution.
			For each corpus, we also show the av erage entropy and average relative frequency of the first sense over all words.From Table 1 we can see that for the vast ma jority of words the entropy is highest in the BNC.However there are exceptions: return, fan and ti tle for FINANCE and return, half, level, running strike and share for SPORTS.
