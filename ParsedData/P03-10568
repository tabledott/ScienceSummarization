    The CTB consists of 325 newswire articles; 291 are on economic topics, 34 on politics and culture.
    Past work on CTB parsing (Bikel and Chiang, 2000; Chiang and Bikel, 2002) has used articles 1-270 for training, 301-325 for development, and 271-300 for testing.
    We found, however, that this development set was uncharacteristic of the corpus as a whole and not ideal for development.
    As an extreme example, the word *`- appears in it 28 times as a measure word, meaning 'point', twice as an adverb, and once as a verb; in the rest of the corpus it appears eight times as a verb, once as an adverb, and never as a measure word.
    There turns out to be a high concentration of articles on non-economic topics in 301-325 (the problem with *`- arising from sports articles).
    Therefore, for this paper we set aside articles 1-25 for development and used 26-270 as training during development.
    During development, we found the difference in parse accuracy for 1-25 and 301-325 to range around a remar
