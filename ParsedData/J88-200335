ng example, the temporal reference point for the successive conjoined main clauses seems to move on from the time originally established by the adjunct: 43.
    At exactly five o'clock, Harry walked in, sat down, and took off his boots.
    Nor is this just a matter of pragmatic inference; other orders of the clauses are not allowed: 44.
    #At exactly five o'clock, Harry took off his boots, sat down and walked in.
    This fact has caused theorists such as Dowty 1986, Hinrichs 1984, and Partee 1984 to stipulate that the reference time autonomously advances during a narrative.
    However, such a stipulation (besides creating problems for the theory vis-&#224;-vis those narratives where reference time seems not to advance) seems to be unnecessary, since the amount by which the reference time advances still has to be determined by context.
    The concept of a nucleus that was invoked above to explain the varieties of aspectual categories offers us exactly what we need to explain both the fact that the refere
