ore accurate than or at least as accurate as previous domainindependent text segmentation systems, because has been shown to be more accurate than previous domain-independent text segmentation systems.10
  
  
    Evaluation of the output of text segmentation systems is difficult because the required segmentations depend on the application.
    In this paper, we have used an artificial corpus to evaluate our system.
    We regard this as appropriate for comparing relative performance among systems.
    It is important, however, to assess the performance of systems by using real texts.
    These texts should be domain independent.
    They should also be multi-lingual if we want to test the multilinguality of systems.
    For English, Klavans, et al. describe a segmentation corpus in which the texts were segmented by humans (Klavans et al., 1998).
    But, there are no such corpora for other languages.
    We are planning to build a segmentation corpus for Japanese, based on a corpus of speech transcriptions (
