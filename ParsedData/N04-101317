rameters were set on a held-out portion of the PARC700 which was also used to set the Collins parameters.
    In the experiments reported in this paper, we used a threshold on feature-extraction that allowed us to cut off feature-extraction in 3% of the cases at no loss in accuracy.
    Overall, feature extraction and weight calculation accounted for 5% of the computation time in combined parsing and stochastic selection.
  
  
    We used the PARC 700 Dependency Bank (DEPBANK) as the gold standard in our experiments.
    The DEPBANK consists of dependency annotations for 700 sentences that were randomly extracted from section 23 of the UPenn Wall Street Journal (WSJ) treebank.
    As described by (King et al., 2003), the annotations were boot-strapped by parsing the sentences with a LFG grammar and transforming the resulting f-structures to a collection of dependency triples in the DEPBANK format.
    To prepare a true gold standard of dependencies, the tentative set of dependencies produced by the robust pa
