anual text containing 360 pronoun occurrences; the algorithm successfully identified the antecedent of the pronoun in 86% of these pronoun occurrences.
    The addition of a module that contributes statistically measured lexical preferences to the range of factors the algorithm considers improved the performance by 2%.
  
  
    We have presented a statistical method for pronominal anaphora that achieves an accuracy of 84.2%.
    The main advantage of the method is its essential simplicity.
    Except for implementing the Hobbs referent-ordering algorithm, all other system knowledge is imbedded in tables giving the various component probabilities used in the probability model.
    We believe that this simplicity of method will translate into comparative simplicity as we improve the method.
    Since the research described herein we have thought of other influences on anaphora resolution and their statistical correlates.
    We hope to include some of them in future work.
