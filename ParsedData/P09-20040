  Using Syntax to Disambiguate Explicit Discourse Connectives in Text
  
    Discourse connectives are words or such as and contrary explicitly signal the presence of a discourse relation.
    There are two types of ambiguity that need to be resolved during discourse processing.
    First, a word can be ambiguous between discourse or non-discourse usage.
    For be either a temporal discourse connective or a simply a word meaning &#8220;formerly&#8221;.
    Secondly, some connectives are ambiguous in terms of the they mark.
    For example can serve as either a temporal or causal connective.
    We demonstrate that syntactic features improve performance in both disambiguation tasks.
    We report state-ofthe-art results for identifying discourse vs. non-discourse usage and human-level performance on sense disambiguation.
  
  
    Discourse connectives are often used to explicitly mark the presence of a discourse relation between two textual units.
    Some connectives are largely unambiguous, such as althou
