s is prohibitively large, if not infinite.
    Nevertheless, there are many words that intuitively should have a common parent but do not.
    For instance, liquid body substance and water should both be hyponyms of liquid, but in WordNet their shallowest common ancestor is substance.
    One of the descendants of substance is solid, so there is no single node that represents all liquids.
    Li and Abe (1998) describe another method of corpus-driven selectional-preference learning that finds a tree cut of WordNet for each case slot.
    A tree cut is a set of The elements of a cluster of WordNet nodes characteristic of the MILITARY domain. nodes that specifies a partition of the ontology&#8217;s leaf nodes, where a node stands for all the leaf nodes descended from it.
    The method chooses among possible tree cuts according to minimum-description-length criteria.
    The description length of a tree cut representation is the sum of the size of the tree cut itself (i.e., the minimum number of nodes specifyin
