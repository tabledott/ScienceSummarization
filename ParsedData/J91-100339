    In (19), for example, Ted does not literally play the composer Bach &#8212; he plays music composed by him.
    As Figure 1 shows, a metonymy is recognized in the met* method if a metonymic inference (diamond 2) is found.
    Conversely, if no successful inference is found then no metonymy is discovered and a metaphorical or anomalous semantic relation is then sought.
    A successful inference establishes a relationship between the ori
