e of matching judgments.
    For systems that provided a confidence-ranked list of the pairs, in addition to the YES/NO judgment, an Average Precision measure was also computed.
    This measure evaluates the ability of systems to rank all the T-H pairs in the test set according to their entailment confidence (in decreasing order from the most certain entailment to the least certain).
    Average precision is computed as the average of the system's precision values at all points in the ranked list in which recall increases, that is at all points in the ranked list for which the gold standard annotation is YES, or, more formally: where n is the number of the pairs in the test set, R is the total number of positive pairs in the test set, E(i) is 1 if the i-th pair is positive and 0 otherwise, and i ranges over the pairs, ordered by their ranking.
    In other words, the more the system was confident that t entails h, the higher was the ranking of the pair.
    A perfect ranking would have placed all the positiv
