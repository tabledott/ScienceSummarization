    Instead, such projects use an off-the-shelf realizer, among which PENMAN (Bateman, 1996) and SURGE/FUF (Elhadad and Robin, 1996) are probably the most popular.
    In this technical note and demo we present a new off-theshelf realizer, REALPRO.
    REALPRO is derived from previous systems (Iordanskaja et al., 1988; Iordanslcaja et al., 1992; Rambow and Korelsky, 1992), but represents a new design and a completely new implementation.
    REALPRO has the following characteristics, which we believe are unique in this combination: We reserve a more detailed comparison with PENMAN and FUF, as well as with AlethGen/GL (Coch, 1996) (which is perhaps the system most similar to REALPRO, since they are based on the same linguistic theory and are both implemented with speed in mind), for a more extensive paper.
    This technical note presents REALPRO, concentrating on its structure, its coverage, its interfaces, and its performance.
  
  
    The input to REALPRO is a syntactic dependency structure.
