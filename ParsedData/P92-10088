 between the matched strings, the less likely the phrase was a repair.
  
  
    We analyzed a subset of 607 sentences containing repairs and concluded that certain simple pattern-matching techniques could successfully detect a number of them.
    The pattern-matching component reported on here looks for identical sequences of words, and simple syntactic anomalies, such as &amp;quot;a the&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;to from.&amp;quot; Of the 406 sentences containing nontrivial repairs, the program successfully found 309.
    Of these it successfully corrected 177.
    There were 97 sentences that contained repairs which it did not find.
    In addition, out of the 10,517 sentence corpus (10,718 &#8212; 201 trivial), it incorrectly hypothesized that an additional 191 contained repairs.
    Thus of 10,517 sentences of varying lengths, it pulled out 500 as possibly containing a repair and missed 97 sentences actually containing a repair.
    Of the 500 that it proposed as containing a repair, 62% actually did and 38%
