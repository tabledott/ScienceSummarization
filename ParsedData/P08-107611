ast, JESS-CM is free from this kind of additional process, and the entire parameter estimation procedure can be performed in a single pass.
    Surprisingly, although JESS-CM is a simpler version of the hybrid model in terms of model structure and parameter estimation procedure, JESS-CM provides F-scores of 94.45 and 88.03 for CoNLL&#8217;00 and &#8217;03 data, respectively, which are 0.15 and 0.83 points higher than those reported in (Suzuki et al., 2007) for the same configurations.
    This performance improvement is basically derived from the full benefit of using labeled training data for estimating the parameter of the conditional model while the combination weights, F, of the hybrid model are estimated solely by using 1/5 of the labeled training data.
    These facts indicate that JESS-CM has several advantageous characteristics compared with the hybrid model.
  
  
    In our experiments, we report POS tagging, syntactic chunking and NER performance incorporating up to 1G-words of unlabeled data.
