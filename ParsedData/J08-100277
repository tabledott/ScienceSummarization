y also applied the supertagger in a parsing stage.
    We suppose that this was crucial for high accuracy in their approach, although empirical investigation is necessary.
    The proposed algorithm is an essential solution to the problem of estimating probabilistic models on exponentially many complete structures.
    However, the applicability of this algorithm relies on the constraint that features are defined locally in conjunctive nodes.
    As discussed in Section 6.1, this does not necessarily mean that features in our model can represent only the immediate-dominance relations of CFG rules, because conjunctive nodes may encode any fragments of complete structures.
    In fact, we demonstrated in Section 4.3 that certain assumptions allowed us to encode non-local predicate&#8211; argument dependencies in tractable-size feature forests.
    In addition, although in the experiments we used only features on bilexical dependencies, the method described in Section 4.3 allows us to define any features on a pr
