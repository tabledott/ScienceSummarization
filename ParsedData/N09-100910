    In particular, as noted by Blei and Lafferty (2006), there is no explicit flexible way for the Dirichlet&#8217;s parameters to encode beliefs about covariance between the probabilities of two events.
    To illustrate this point, we describe how a multinomial 0 of dimension d is generated from a Dirichlet distribution with parameters &#945; = h&#945;1,..., &#945;di: where F(&#945;,1) is a Gamma distribution with shape &#945; and scale 1.
    Correlation among &#952;i and &#952;j, i =6 j, cannot be modeled directly, only through the normalization in step 2.
    In contrast, LN distributions (Aitchison, 1986) provide a natural way to model such correlation.
    The LN draws a multinomial 0 as follows: Blei and Lafferty (2006) defined correlated topic models by replacing the Dirichlet in latent Dirichlet allocation models (Blei et al., 2003) with a LN distribution.
    Cohen et al. (2008) compared Dirichlet and LN distributions for learning DMV using empirical Bayes, finding substantial improvements
