ble from the same corpus using a cotraining-based paraphrase extraction algorithm (Barzilay and McKeown, 2001).
    To the best of our knowledge, this is the most relevant work to compare against since it aims at extracting paraphrase pairs from parallel corpus.
    Unlike our syntax-based algorithm which treats a sentence as a tree structure and uses this hierarchical structural information to guide the merging process, their algorithm treats a sentence as a sequence of phrases with surrounding contexts (no hierarchical structure involved) and cotrains classifiers to detect paraphrases and contexts for paraphrases.
    It would be interesting to compare the results from two algorithms so different from each other.
    For the purpose of this experiment, we randomly selected 300 paraphrase pairs (Ssyn) from the FSAs produced by our system.
    Since the co-training-based algorithm of Barzilay and McKeown (2001) takes parallel corpus as input, we created out of the MTC corpus 55 &#215; 993 sentence pairs (Each
