 is true for all the classification algorithms.
    As we might expect, including the negation features has the most marked effect on the performance of polarity classification, with statistically significant improvements for most metrics across all the algorithms.9 The polarity-modification features also seem to be important for polarity classification, in particular for disambiguating the positive instances.
    For all the algorithms except TiMBL, including the polarity-modification features results in significant improvements for at least one of the positive metrics.
    The polarity shifters also help classification, but they seem to be the weakest of the features: Including them does not result in significant improvements for any algorithm.
    Another question that is interesting to consider is how much the word token feature contributes to polarity classification, given all the other polarity features.
    Is it enough to know the prior polarity of a word, whether it is being negated, and how it is re
