compositional contribution of definite descriptions to the meaning of an utterance, as well as their truth-conditional properties, are spelled out in detail.
    These more formal analyses are concerned with questions such as the quantificational or nonquantificational status of definite descriptions and the proper treatment of presuppositions, but tend to concentrate on a subset of the full range of definite description use.
    Among the more developed semantic analyses, some identify uniqueness as the defining property of definite descriptions (Russell 1905; Neale 1990), whereas others take familiarity as the basis for the analysis (Christophersen 1939; Hawkins 1978; Heim 1982; Prince 1981; Kamp and Reyle 1993).
    We will say more about some of these analyses below.
    Our choice of a classification scheme was dictated in part by the intended use of the annotation, in part by methodological considerations.
    An annotation used to evaluate the performance of a system ought to identify the anaphoric con
