n which classes such as ours are further subdivided according to more detailed semantic properties).
    This level of classification granularity appears to be appropriate for numerous language engineering tasks.
    Because knowledge of argument structure captures fundamental participant/event relations, it is crucial in parsing and generation (e.g., Srinivas and Joshi [1999]; Stede [1998]), in machine translation (Dorr 1997), and in information retrieval (Klavarts and Kan 1998) and extraction (Riloff and Schmelzenbach 1998).
    Our use of statistical corpus-based methods to achieve this level of classification is motivated by our hypothesis that class-based differences in argument structure are reflected in statistics over the usages of the component verbs, and that those statistics can be automatically extracted from a large annotated corpus.
    The particular classification problem within which we investigate this hypothesis is the task of learning the three major classes of optionally intransitive verb
