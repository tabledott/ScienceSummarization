er, Della Pietra, and Della Pietra (1996), Ratnaparkhi (1998), and Della Pietra, Della Pietra, and Lafferty (1997) are not sufficiently efficient for the parsing task.
    More recent work (McCallum 2003; Zhou et al. 2003; Riezler and Vasserman 2004) has considered methods for speeding up the feature selection methods described in Berger, Della Pietra, and Della Pietra (1996), Ratnaparkhi (1998), and Della Pietra, Della Pietra, and Lafferty (1997).
    McCallum (2003) and Riezler and Vasserman (2004) describe approaches that add k features at each step, where k is some constant greater than one.
    The running time for these methods is therefore O(f x (p + 1)1k).
    Riezler and Vasserman (2004) test a variety of values for k, finding that k = 100 gives optimal performance.
    McCallum (2003) uses a value of k = 1,000.
    Zhou et al. (2003) use a different heuristic that avoids having to recompute the gain for every feature at every iteration.
    We would argue that the alternative feature selection metho
