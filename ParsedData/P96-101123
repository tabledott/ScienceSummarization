r hand, the NF parse of A/B B/C C/D/E uses &gt;B2 twice, while the non-NF parse gets by with &gt;B2 and &gt;B1.)
    Type-raising presents a greater problem.
    Various new spurious ambiguities arise if it is permitted freely in the grammar.
    In principle one could proceed without grammatical type-raising: (Dowty, 1988; Steedman, 1991) have argued on linguistic grounds that type-raising should be treated as a mere lexical redundancy property.
    That is, whenever the lexicon contains an entry of a certain category X, with semantics x, it also contains one with (say) category T/ (T \X) and interpretation Ap.p(x).
    As one might expect, this move only sweeps the problem under the rug.
    If type-raising is lexical, then the definitions of this paper do not recognize (19) as a spurious ambiguity, because the two parses are now, technically speaking, analyses of different sentences.
    Nor do they recognize the redundancy in (20), because&#8212;just as for the example &amp;quot;softly knock twice&amp;quo
