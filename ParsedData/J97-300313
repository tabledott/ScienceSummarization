in other approaches, is captured at the disambiguation phase of the tagger itself.
    The former feature is indirectly captured in our approach.
    It has been noticed (as in [Weischedel et al., 1993], for example) that capitalized and hyphenated words have a different distribution from other words.
    Our morphological rules account for this difference by checking the stem of the word.
    The ending-guessing rules, on the other hand, do not use information about stems.
    Thus if the ending s predicts that a word can be a plural noun or a 3d form of a verb, the information that this word was capitalized can narrow the considered set of POS-tags to plural proper noun.
    We therefore decided to collect ending-guessing rules separately for capitalized words, hyphenated words, and all other words.
    In our experiments, we restricted ourselves to the production of six different guessing-rule sets, which seemed most appropriate for English: As already mentioned, we see features that our guessing-rule sche
