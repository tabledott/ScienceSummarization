ype from that of the constituent, then the immediate parent is also the functional parent; otherwise, the functional parent is the functional parent of the immediate parent.
    The distinction between functional parents and immediate parents arises primarily to cope with unit productions.
    When unit productions of the form XP2 ---&gt; XP1 occur, the immediate parent of XP1 is XP2.
    But, in general, the constituent XP2 does not contain enough useful information for ambiguity resolution.
    In particular, when considering only immediate parents, unit rules such as NP2 &#8212;&#9632; NP1 prevent the probabilistic model from allowing the NP1 constituent to interact with the VP rule which is the functional parent of NP1.
    When the two parents are identical as it often happens, the duplicate information will be ignored.
    However, when they differ, the decision tree will select that parental context which best resolves ambiguities.
