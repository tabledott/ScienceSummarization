ula, or the values of the parameters.
    The strength of this approach, clearly, is its use of information that co-occurrence in a small window provides regarding semantic relatedness.
    This allows a more aggressive stance toward suffix identification (e.g., alpha interferon &#8212; alpha2 interferon).
    There can be little question that the type of corpus studied (a large technical medical corpus, and a list of terms&#8212;partially multiword terms) lends itself particularly to this style of inference, and that similar patterns would be far rarer in unrestricted text such as Tom Sawyer or the Brown corpus.'
    13 Gaussier also offers a discussion of inference of regular morphophonemics, which we do not treat in the present paper, and a discussion in a final section of additional analysis, though without test results.
    Gaussier aptly calls our attention to the relevance of minimum edit distance relating two potential allomorphs, and he proposes a probabilistic model based on patterns established bet
