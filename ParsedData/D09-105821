 2008), and for varying amounts of labeled data.
    The remainder of this section discusses these results in more detail.
    We can see from the results in Table 3 that our semi-supervised approach consistently gives gains data.
    Supervised SCM (1od) and Supervised MIRA (2od) are the baseline first and second-order approaches; SS-SCM (1od) and 2-stage SS-SCM(+MIRA) (2od) are the first and second-order approaches described in this paper.
    &#8220;Baseline&#8221; refers to models without cluster-based features, &#8220;CL&#8221; refers to models which make use of cluster-based features. in performance under various sizes of labeled data.
    Note that the baseline methods that we have used in these experiments are strong baselines.
    It is clear that the gains from our method are larger for smaller labeled data sizes, a tendency that was also observed in (Koo et al., 2008).
    One important observation from the results in Table 3 is that SS-SCMs can successfully improve the performance over a baseline
