4 summarizes these results.
    There we show the number of correct part words in the top 10, 20, 30, 40, and 50 parts for each seed (e.g., for &amp;quot;book&amp;quot;, 8 of the top 10 are parts, and 14 of the top 20).
    Overall, about 55% of the top 50 words for each seed are parts, and about 70% of the top 20 for each seed.
    The reader should also note that we tried one ambiguous word, &amp;quot;plant&amp;quot; to see what would happen.
    Our program finds parts corresponding to both senses, though given the nature of our text, the industrial use is more common.

    As a baseline we also tried using as our &amp;quot;pattern&amp;quot; the head nouns that immediately surround our target word.
    We then applied the same &amp;quot;strong conditioning, sigdiff&amp;quot; statistical test to rank the candidates.
    This performed quite poorly.
