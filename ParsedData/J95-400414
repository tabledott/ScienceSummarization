false, the transformations from L2 will be applied, because S&amp;quot; is the initial-state label for L2.
    0 We show here that there exist transformation lists for which no equivalent decision trees exist, for a fixed set of primitive queries.
    The following classification problem is one example.
    Given a sequence of characters, classify a character based on whether the position index of a character is divisible by 4, querying only using a context of two characters to the left of the character being classified.
    Assuming transformations are applied left to right on the sequence, the above classification problem can be solved for sequences of arbitrary length if the effect of a transformation is written out immediately, or for sequences up to any prespecified length if a transformation is carried out only after all triggering environments in the corpus are checked.
    We present the proof for the former case.
    Given the input sequence: the underlined characters should be classified as true bec
