 a case when a boundary is present in the reference segmentation but missing in the algorithm&#8217;s hypothesized segmentation, and a false positive as an assignment of a boundary that does not exist in the reference segmentation.
    The Pk metric is fast becoming the standard among researchers working in text segmentation (Allan et al. 1998; Dharanipragada et al.
    1999; Eichmann et al. 1999; van Mulbregt et al.
    1999; Choi 2000).
    However, we have reservations about this metric.
    We claim that the fundamental premise behind it is flawed; additionally, it has several significant drawbacks, which we identify in this section.
    In the remainder of the paper, we suggest modifications to resolve these problems, and we report the results of simulations that validate the analysis and suggest that the modified metric is an improvement over the original.
    Assume a text with segments of average size 2k, where k is the distance between the two ends of the Pk probe.
    If the algorithm misses a bound
