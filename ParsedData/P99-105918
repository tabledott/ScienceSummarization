ill help us bound the complexity.
    A split head automaton Ha is said to be g-split if its set of flip states, denoted C Qa, has size &lt; g. The languages that can be recognized by g-split HAs are those that can be written as 1..g 1 Li x R, where the Li and Ri are regular languages over VT. Eisner (1997) actually defined (g-split) bilexical grammars in terms of the latter property.6 We now present our result: Figure 3 specifies an 0(n3g2t2) recognition algorithm for a head automaton grammar H in which every H, is g-split.
    For deterministic automata, the runtime is 0(n3g2t)&#8212;a considerable improvement on the 0(n3g3t2) result of (Eisner, 1997), which also assumes deterministic automata.
    As in &#167;4, a simple bottom-up implementation will suffice.
    For a practical speedup, add h\j as an antecedent to the MID rule (and fill in the parse table from right to left).
    Like our previous algorithms, this one takes two steps (ATTACH, COMPLETE) to attach a child constituent to a parent constituent
