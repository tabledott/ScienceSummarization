    Each bitext defines a rectangular bitext space, as illustrated in Figure 1.
    The lower left corner of the rectangle is the origin of the bitext space and represents the two texts' beginnings.
    The upper right corner is the terminus and represents the texts' ends.
    The line between the origin and the terminus is the main diagonal.
    The slope of the main diagonal is the bitext slope.
    Each bitext space is spanned by a pair of axes.
    The lengths of the axes are the lengths of the two component texts.
    The axes of a bitext space are measured in characters, because text lengths measured in characters correlate better than text lengths measured in tokens (Gale and Church 1991a).
    This correlation is important for geometric bitext mapping heuristics, such as those described in Section 4.4.
    Although the axes are measured in characters, I will argue that word tokens are the optimum level of analysis for bitext mapping.
    By convention, each t
