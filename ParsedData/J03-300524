r details on the re-created frequencies).
    From these data, we computed the average factor by which the Web counts are larger than the BNC counts.
    The results are given in Table 7 and indicate that the AltaVista counts are between 550 and 691 times larger than the BNC counts, and that the Google counts are between 1,064 and 1,306 times larger than the BNC counts.
    As we know the size of the BNC (100 million words), we can use these figures to estimate the number of words available on the Web: between 55.0 and 69.1 billion words for AltaVista, and between 106.4 and 139.6 billion words for Google.
    These estimates are in the same order of magnitude as Grefenstette and Nioche&#8217;s (2000) estimate that 48.1 billion words of English are available on the Web (based on AltaVista counts compiled in February 2000).
    They also agree with Zhu and Rosenfeld&#8217;s (2001) estimate that the effective size of the Web is between 79 and 108 billion words (based on AltaVista, Lycos, and FAST counts; no date
