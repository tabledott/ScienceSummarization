limited the contex- tual information used by their models is because of the difficulty in estimating very rich probabilistic models of context.
  In this work, we present a model, the history- based grammar model, which incorporates a very rich model of context, and we describe a technique for es- timating the parameters for this model using decision trees.
  The history-based grammar model provides a mechanism for taking advantage of contextual informa- tion from anywhere in the discourse history.
  Using deci- sion tree technology, any question which can be asked of the history (i.e.
  Is the subject of the previous entence animate?
  Was the previous sentence a question?
  can be incorporated into the language model.
  The History-based Grammar Model The history-based grammar model defines context of a parse tree in terms of the leftmost derivation of the tree.
  Following [7], we show in Figure 1 a context-free gram- mar (CFG) for anb ~ and the parse tree for the sentence aabb.
