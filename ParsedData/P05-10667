 2004).
    In these approaches a baseline system is used to generate -best output.
    Syntactic features are then used in a second model that reranks the -best lists, in an attempt to improve over the baseline approach.
    (Koehn and Knight, 2003) apply a reranking approach to the sub-task of noun-phrase translation.
    (Och et al., 2004; Shen et al., 2004) describe the use of syntactic features in reranking the output of a full translation system, but the syntactic features give very small gains: for example the majority of the gain in performance in the experiments in (Och et al., 2004) was due to the addition of IBM Model 1 translation probabilities, a non-syntactic feature.
    An alternative use of syntactic information is to employ an existing statistical parsing model as a language model within an SMT system.
    See (Charniak et al., 2003) for an approach of this form, which shows improvements in accuracy over a baseline system.
    Our approach involves a preprocessing step, where sentences in th
