st we define simultaneously DTG derivations and subsertion-adjoining trees (SAtrees), which are partial derivation structures that can be interpreted as representing dependency information, the importance of which was stressed in the introduction'.
    Consider a DTG G = (VN, VT S D).
    In defining SA-trees, we assume some naming convention for the elementary d-trees in D and some consistent ordering on the components and nodes of elementary d-trees in D. For each i, we define the set of d-trees Ti(G) whose derivations are captured by SA-trees of height i or less.
    Let To(G) be the set D of elementary d-trees of G. Mark all of the components of each d-tree in To(G) as being substitutable6.
    Only components marked as substitutable can be substituted in a subsertion operation.
    The SA-tree for a E T0(G) consists of a single node labelled by the elementary d-tree name for a.
    For i&gt; 0 let Ti(G) be the union of the set T1_1(G) with the set of all d-trees 7 that can be produced as follows.
    Let
