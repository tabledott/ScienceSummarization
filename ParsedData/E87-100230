m itself.
    Since the root vowel affects the latter part of the root, it seems reasonable that it should be positioned to the right.
    Notice, however, that this is the only instance in which we have had to make any assumptions about the relative ordering of the morphemes that contribute to a stem.
    Once again, it may be possible to assemble further evidence reflecting on some such ordering, but I do not see it in these data.
    It is only right that I should point out the difficulty of accounting satisfactorily for the vocalic contribution of verbal roots.
    It is only right that I should also point out that the autosegmental solution fares no better on this score, resorting, as it must, to rules that access essentially non-phonological properties of the morphemes involved.
    By insisting that what I called the a morpheme should by, by definition, be its only contribution to phonological processes, I have cut myself off from such ex machina.
