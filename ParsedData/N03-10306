ary discourse units (edus).
    In the present work, elementary discourse units are taken to be clauses or clauselike units that are unequivocally the NUCLEUS or SATELLITE of a rhetorical relation that holds between two adjacent spans of text (see (Carlson et al., 2003) for details).
    Our approach to discourse segmentation breaks the problem further into two sub-problems: sentence segmentation and sentence-level discourse segmentation.
    The problem of sentence segmentation has been studied extensively, and tools such as those described by Palmer and Hearst (1997) and Ratnaparkhi (1998) can handle it well.
    In this section, we present a discourse segmentation algorithm that deals with segmenting sentences into elementary discourse units.
    The discourse segmenter proposed here takes as input a sentence and outputs its elementary discourse unit boundaries.
    Our statistical approach to sentence segmentation uses two components: a statistical model which assigns a probability to the insertion of a d
