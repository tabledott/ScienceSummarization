ed, that finite-state transducers could be used to mimic a large class of rewriting rules, possibly including all those for phonology.
    The importance of came from two considerations.
    First, transducers are indifferent as to the direction in which they are applied.
    In other words, they can be used with equal facility to translate between tapes, in either direction, to accept or reject pairs of tapes, or to generate pairs of tapes.
    Second, a pair of transducers with one tape in common is equivalent to a single transducer operating on the remaining pair of tapes.
    A simple algorithm exists for constructing the transition diagram for composite machine given those of the original pair.
    By repeated application of this algorithm, it is therefore possible to reduce a cascade of transducers, each linked to the next by a common tape, to a single transducer which accepts exactly the same pair of tapes as was accepted by the original cascade as a whole.
    From these two facts together, it follows
