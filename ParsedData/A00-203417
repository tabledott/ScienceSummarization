ed after the selection process outlined above.
    For this small sample we obtained a significant result (p = 0.02) with a mean accuracy of 67% and a median accuracy of 83%.
    On this occasion, the median performed better than the mean.
    More data is required to see if this difference is significant.
    This experiment was conducted using the same data as that used in the previous subsection.
    In this experiment, we used a similarity score on the argument heads directly, instead of generalizing the argument heads to WordNet classes.
    The venn diagram in figure 3 shows a subset of the lemmas at the transitive and intransitive scFs for the verb break.
    The lemma based similarity measure is termed lemma overlap (LO) and is given in equation 3, where A and B represent the target slots.
    LO is the size of the intersection of the multisets of argument heads at the target slots, divided by the size of the smaller of the two multisets.
    The intersection of two multisets includes duplicate items
