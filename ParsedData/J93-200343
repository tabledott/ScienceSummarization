rror made by including only some of the elements of &#8222;4(e, f) is not too great, this iteration will lead to values of the parameters for which the likelihood of the training data is at least as large as for the first set of parameters.
    We make no initial guess of the parameters for Model 3, but instead adapt the parameters from the final iteration of the EM algorithm for Model 2.
    That is, we compute the counts in Equations (34)&#8212;(38) using Model 2 to evaluate Pr(ai e, f).
    The simple form of Model 2 again makes exact calculation feasible.
    We can readily adapt Equations (27) and (28) to compute counts for the translation and distortion probabilities; efficient calculation of the fertility counts is more involved, and we defer a discussion of it to Appendix B.
    The reader will have noticed a problem with our parameterization of the distortion probabilities in Model 3: whereas we can see by inspection that the sum over all pairs y, 7 of the expression on the right-hand side of Equatio
