   It is no doubt easy to get lost in the formalism, so it may be helpful to point out what the contribution of the additional structure accomplishes.
    We observed above that the MDL analysis is an elaboration of the insight that the best morphological analysis of a corpus is obtained by counting the total number of letters in the list of stems and suffixes according to various analyses, and choosing the analysis for which this sum is the least (cf.
    Figure 2).
    This simple insight fails rapidly when we observe in a language such as English that there are a large number of verb stems that end in t. Verbs appear with a null suffix (that is, in bare stem form), with the suffixes -s, -ed, and -ing.
    But once we have 11 stems ending in t, the naive letter-counting approach will judge it a good idea to create a new set of suffixes: -t, -ted, -ts, and -ting, because those 10 letters will allow us to remove 11 or more letters from the list of stems.
    It is the creation of the lists, notably the signat
