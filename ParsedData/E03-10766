us, the bigger the statistical basis to estimate translation probabilities, and the more likely the correct translation probability distribution is learned [Koehn and Knight, 20011.
    This insight leads us to define a splitting metric based on word frequency.
    Given the count of words in the corpus, we pick the split S with the highest geometric mean of word frequencies of its parts pi (n being the number of parts): Since this metric is purely defined in terms of German word frequencies, there is not necessarily a relationship between the selected option and correspondence to English words.
    If a compound occurs more frequently in the text than its parts, this metric would leave the compound unbroken &#8212; even if it is translated in parts into English.
    In fact, this is the case for the example Aktionsplan.
    Again, the four options: Behind each part, we indicated its frequency in parenthesis.
    On the right side is the geometric mean score of these frequencies.
    The score for the unbroke
