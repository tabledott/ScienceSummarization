 temporal).
    It is not possible to discuss here the specific characteristics of such a structure.
    The only thing that we want to express is the constraint that the event in the embedded clause follows the event in the main clause.
    We assume that the temporal structure contains the following information for likely-to-V, as suggested by Fenstad et al. (1987): This is meant to indicate that the temporal reference point of the event denoted by the embedded verb extends after the temporal reference point of the main event.
    The time of the main event is in part determined by the tense of the verb be, which we ignore here.
    The only point we want to make is that aspects of these different projections can be specified in different parts of the grammar.
    We assume that French and English have the same temporal structure but that in the context of Here the identity between x and xt provides an interlingua-like approach to this particular subpart of the relation between the two languages.
