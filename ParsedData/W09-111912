IO and BILOU.
    The BIO scheme suggests to learn classifiers that identify the Beginning, the Inside and the Outside of the text segments.
    The BILOU scheme suggests to learn classifiers that identify the Beginning, the Inside and the Last tokens of multi-token chunks as well as Unit-length chunks.
    The BILOU scheme allows to learn a more expressive model with only a small increase in the number of parameters to be learned.
    Table 2 compares the end system&#8217;s performance with BIO and BILOU.
    Examining the results, we reach two conclusions: (1) choice of encoding scheme has a big impact on the system performance and (2) the less used BILOU formalism significantly outperforms the widely adopted BIO tagging scheme.
    We use the BILOU scheme throughout the paper.
  
  
    The key intuition behind non-local features in NER has been that identical tokens should have identical label assignments.
    The sample text discussed in the introduction shows one such example, where all occurrences of &
