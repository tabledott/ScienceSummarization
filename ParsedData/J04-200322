hich no translation can be retrieved from the lexicon.
    This problem is especially relevant for more-inflecting languages like German: Texts in German contain many more distinct word forms than their English translations.
    Table 5 also reveals that these words are often generated via inflection from a smaller set of base forms.
    As mentioned in Section 2.3, the lemma-tag representation of the information from morpho-syntactic analysis makes it possible to gradually access information with different grades of abstraction.
    Consider, for example, the German verb form ankomme, which is the indicative present first-person singular form of the lemma ankommen and can be translated into English by arrive.
    The lemma-tag representation provides an &#8220;observation tuple&#8221; consisting of In the following, ti0 = t0,.
    .
    .
    , ti denotes the representation of a word where the base form t0 and i additional tags are taken into account.
    For the example above, t0 = ankommen, t1 = verb, and
