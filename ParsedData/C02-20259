 and granularity of lexical distinctions have stabilized to a certain degree, it is not guaranteed that one set of discriminators will always fully disambiguate a more re- cent set of analyses for the same utterance (as the gram- mar may introduce new ambiguity), nor that re-playing a history of disambiguating decisions will necessarily identify the correct, preferred analysis for all sentences.
  A better understanding of the nature of discriminators and relations holding among them is expected to provide the foundations for an update procedure that, ultimately, should be mostly automated, with minimal manual in- spection, and which can become part of the regular re- gression test cycle for the grammar.
