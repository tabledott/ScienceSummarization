ce over the corresponding SEM-TAG based approach.
    These results are comparable to the results from Gildea and Palmer (2002), but only roughly because of differences in corpora.
    Gildea and Palmer (2002) achieve a recall of 0.50, a precision of 0.58, and an F-measure of 0.54 when using the full parser of Collins (1999).
    They also experiment with using a chunker which yields a recall of 0.35, a precision of 0.50, and an F-measure of 0.41.
  
  
    We have presented various alternative approaches to predicting PropBank role labels using forms of linguistic information that are deeper than the PTB&#8217;s surface-syntax labels.
    These features may either be directly derived from a TAG, such as Supertag path, or indirectly via aspects of supertags, such Task: determine Recall Precision F base + arg 0.65 0.75 0.70 base + bnd 0.48 0.55 0.51 base + bnd + arg 0.48 0.55 0.51 as deep syntactic features like Drole.
    These are found to produce substantial improvements in accuracy.
    We believe that suc
