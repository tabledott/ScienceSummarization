e.g., first- or last-N sentences).
    We therefore conclude that subjectivity extraction produces effective summaries of document sentiment.
    As noted in Section 3, both Naive Bayes and SVMs can be trained on our subjectivity dataset and then used as a basic subjectivity detector.
    The former has somewhat better average ten-fold cross-validation performance on the subjectivity dataset (92% vs. 90%), and so for space reasons, our initial discussions will focus on the results attained via NB subjectivity detection.
    Employing Naive Bayes as a subjectivity detector (ExtractNB) in conjunction with a Naive Bayes document-level polarity classifier achieves 86.4% accuracy.9 This is a clear improvement over the 82.8% that results when no extraction is applied (Full review); indeed, the difference is highly statistically significant (p &lt; 0.01, paired t-test).
    With SVMs as the polarity classifier instead, the Full review performance rises to 87.15%, but comparison via the paired t-test reveals that thi
