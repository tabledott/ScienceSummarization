ions D&#8222; C_ {subject, object, prep}.
    Thus, each event slot (v, d) for all d E D&#8222; belongs to a chain c E C in the schema.
    Further, each c must be unique for each slot of a single verb.
    Using the criminal prosecution domain as an example, a narrative schema in this domain is built as in figure 2.
    The three dotted boxes are graphical representations of the typed chains that are combined in this schema.
    The first represents the event slots in which the criminal is involved, the second the police, and the third is a court or judge.
    Although our representation uses a set of chains, it is equivalent to represent a schema as a constraint satisfaction problem between (e, d) event slots.
    The next section describes how to learn these schemas.
    Previous work on narrative chains focused on relatedness scores between pairs of verb arguments (event slots).
    The clustering step which built chains depended on these pairwise scores.
    Narrative schemas use a generalization of the
