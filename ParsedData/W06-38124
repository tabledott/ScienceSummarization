d to v. The adjacency matrix AG of a graph G with n nodes is an nxn matrix where the entry aij denotes the weight of the edge between vi and vj , 0 otherwise.
    The class matrix DG of a Graph G with n nodes is an nxn matrix where rows represent nodes and columns represent classes (ci)EC.
    The value dij at row i and column j represents the amount of vi as belonging to a class cj.
    For convention, class matrices are row-normalized; the i-th row denotes a distribution of vi over C. If all rows have exactly one non-zero entry with value 1, DG denotes a hard partitioning of V, soft partitioning otherwise.
    CW is a very basic &#8211; yet effective &#8211; algorithm to partition the nodes of weighted, undirected graphs.
    It is motivated by the eponymous children&#8217;s game, where children whisper words to each other.
    While the game&#8217;s goal is to arrive at some funny derivative of the original message by passing it through several noisy channels, the CW algorithm aims at finding groups of nod
