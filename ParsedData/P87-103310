e consistency of disjunctive descriptions, it is not necessary to use it every time a description is built during a parse.
    In practice, we find that the performance of the algorithm can be tuned by using this step only at strategic points during a parse, since it is the most inefficient step of the alFunction CHECK-INDEF (desc, cond) Returns feature-description: where desc is a feature-description, and cond is a DG.
    Let indef = desc.indefinite (a set of disjunctions).
    Let new-def = desc.definite (a DG).
    Let unchecked-parts = true.
    Function CHECK-DISJ (disj, cond) Returns disjunction: where disj is a disjunction of feature-descriptions, and cond is a DG. gorithm.
    In our application, using the Earley chart parsing method, it has proved best to use NWISE-CONSISTENCY only when building descriptions for complete edges, but not when building descriptions for active edges.
    Note that two feature-descriptions do not become permanently linked when they are unified, unlike unification for DG
