wed to make reference to parts of speech, words, and word classes, allowing for rules such as This approach has already been successfully applied to a system for prepositional phrase attachment disambiguation (Brill and Resnik 1994).
    So far, we have not addressed the problem of unknown words.
    As stated above, the initial-state annotator for tagging assigns all words their most likely tag, as indicated in a training corpus.
    Below we show how a transformation-based approach can be taken for tagging unknown words, by automatically learning cues to predict the most likely tag for words not seen in the training corpus.
    If the most likely tag for unknown words can be assigned with high accuracy, then the contextual rules can be used to improve accuracy, as described above.
    In the transformation-based unknown-word tagger, the initial-state annotator naively assumes the most likely tag for an unknown word is &amp;quot;proper noun&amp;quot; if the word is capitalized and &amp;quot;common noun&amp;q
