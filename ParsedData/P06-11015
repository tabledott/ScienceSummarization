ordNet include hypernymy, holonymy, verb entailment, and many others; the objects of WordNet between which these relations hold are its word senses or synsets.
    We define that each relation R E R is a set of ordered or unordered pairs of objects (i, j) E DT; we define Rij E T if relationship R holds over objects For the case of hyponym acquisition, the objects in our taxonomy are WordNet synsets.
    In this paper we focus on two of the many possible relationships between senses: the hypernym relation and the coordinate term relation.
    We treat the hypernym or ISA relation as atomic; we use the notation Hinj if a sense j is the n-th ancestor of a sense i in the hypernym hierarchy.
    We will simply use Hij to indicate that j is an ancestor of i at some unspecified level.
    Two senses are typically considered to be &#8220;coordinate terms&#8221; or &#8220;taxonomic sisters&#8221; if they share an immediate parent in the hypernym hierarchy.
    We generalize this notion of siblinghood to state that two
