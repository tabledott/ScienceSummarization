ring) into English.
    We use the GIZA++ implementation of IBM Model 4 (Brown et al., 1993; Och and Ney, 2003) coupled with the phrase extraction heuristics of Koehn et al. (2003) and the SCFG rule extraction heuristics of Chiang (2007) as our benchmark.
    All the SCFG models employ a single X non-terminal, we leave experiments with multiple non-terminals to future work.
    Our hypothesis is that our grammar based induction of translation units should benefit language pairs with significant reordering more than those with less.
    While for mostly monotone translation pairs, such as Arabic-English, the benchmark GIZA++-based system is well suited due to its strong monotone bias (the sequential Markov model and diagonal growing heuristic).
    We conduct experiments on both small and large corpora to allow a range of alignment qualities and also to verify the effectiveness of our distributed approximation of the Bayesian inference.
    The samplers are initialised with trees created from GIZA++ Model 4 al
