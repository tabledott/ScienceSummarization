  There were three ways of treating prepositions: (i) mark the pp with the prepo- sition, (ii) ignore the preposition, and (iii) keel) only the prepositions.
  For these different strategies, we see the percentage of perfect overlaps, as well as both tire 4Two of these classes correspond to one of the two non- unique signatures, and two (:orrespond to the other non- unique signature.
