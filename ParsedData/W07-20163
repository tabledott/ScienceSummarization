 linguistics students annotated the words with WordNet 2.1 senses.
			Our annotators examined each instance upon which they disagreed and resolvedtheir disagreements.
			Finally, we converted the re sulting data to the Senseval format.
			For this dataset, we got an inter-annotator agreement (ITA) of 72% on verbs and 86% for nouns.
			2.1.2 Results A total of 14 systems were evaluated on the All Words task.
			These results are shown in Table 1.
			We used the standard Senseval scorer ? scorer21 to score the systems.
			All the F-scores2 in this table as well as other tables in this paper are accompanied by a 95% confidence interval calculated using the bootstrap resampling procedure.
			2.2 OntoNotes English Lexical Sample WSD.
			It is quite well accepted at this point that it is dif ficult to achieve high inter-annotator agreement onthe fine-grained WordNet style senses, and without a corpus with high annotator agreement, auto matic learning methods cannot perform at a levelthat would be acceptable for a d
