discovery of dialogue structure, where a finite-state grammar induction algorithm is used to find the topology of the dialogue grammar.
    Computational approaches to prosodic modeling of DAs have aimed to automatically extract various prosodic parameters&#8212;such as duration, pitch, and energy patterns&#8212;from the speech signal (Yoshimura et al. [1996]; Taylor et al.
    [1997]; Kompe [1997], among others).
    Some approaches model FO patterns with techniques such as vector quantization and Gaussian classifiers to help disambiguate utterance types.
    An extensive comparison of the prosodic DA modeling literature with our work can be found in Shriberg et al. (1998).
    DA modeling has mostly been geared toward automatic DA classification, and much less work has been done on applying DA models to automatic speech recognition.
    Nagata and Morimoto (1994) suggest conditioning word language models on DAs to lower perplexity.
