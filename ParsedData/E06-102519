   Concerning the category Objective, the process we have followed is similar, but with a few key differences.
    These are motivated by the fact that the Objective category coincides with the complement of the union of Positive and Negative; therefore, Objective terms are more varied and diverse in meaning than the terms in the other two categories.
    To obtain a representative expanded set TrKo , we have chosen the seed set Tr1o = {entity} and we have expanded it by using, along with synonymy and antonymy, the WordNet relation of hyponymy (e.g. vehicle / car), and without imposing the restriction that the two related terms must have the same POS.
    These choices are strictly related to each other: the term entity is the root term of the largest generalization hierarchy in WordNet, with more than 40,000 terms (Devitt and Vogel, 2004), thus allowing to reach a very large number of terms by using the hyponymy relation8.
    Moreover, it seems reasonable to assume that terms that refer to entities are like
