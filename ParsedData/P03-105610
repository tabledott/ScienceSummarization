ive-clause equivalents have a level of CP annotation, equivalent to ETB's SBAR, containing a null WH-NP, even though Chinese has no relative pronouns (the overt prenominal modification marker, Aiv , introduces another level of CP annotation when present, as seen in Figure 3, but in this case the unary CP is compressed under standard pre-parsing tree transformations) .1 In the corresponding case for the ETB, reduced relative clauses are annotated as VPs.
    These annotation practices have a strong effect on the gross statistics of the CTB after standard tree normalizations for parsing.
    The CTB has far fewer rule types than an ETB of equivalent size, and has a considerably lower branching factor.
    In particular a far higher proportion of 'Standard tree normalizations are: the removal of empty nodes and nodes dominating no non-empty terminals, and the subsequent removal of A over A unaries.
    ETB and CTB.
    Rules and UnRu are the number of rule types and unary rule types respectively; BF is average B
