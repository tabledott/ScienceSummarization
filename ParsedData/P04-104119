ikely the PRED takes semantic frame s, and how likely the TOPIC, FOCUS or TOPIC-REL is resolved using path p. The algorithm also supports resolution of LDDs where no overt linguistic material introducesa source TOPIC-REL function (e.g. in reduced rela tive clause constructions).
			We distinguish between passive and active constructions, using the relevant semantic frame type when resolving LDDs.
	
	
			We ran experiments with grammars in both the pipeline and the integrated parsing architectures.
			The first grammar is a basic PCFG, while A-PCFG includes the f-structure annotations.
			We apply a parent transformation to each grammar (Johnson, 1999) to give P-PCFG and PA-PCFG.
			We train on sections 02-21 (grammar, lexical extraction andLDD paths) of the Penn-II Treebank and test on sec tion 23.
			The only pre-processing of the trees that wedo is to remove empty nodes, and remove all PennII functional tags in the integrated model.
			We evalu ate the parse trees using evalb.
