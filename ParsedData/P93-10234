w us to easily incorporate additional knowledge sources for computing similarity.
    While our current system does not distinguish between scalar and non-scalar adjectives, it is a first step in the automatic identification of adjectival scales, since the scales can be subsequently ordered and the non-scalar adjectives filtered on the basis of independent tests, done in part automatically and in part by hand in a post-editing phase.
    The result is a semi-automated system for the compilation of adjectival scales.
    In the following sections, we first provide background on scales, then describe our algorithm in detail, present the results obtained, and finally provide a formal evaluation of the results.
  
  
    A linguistic scale is a set of words, of the same grammatical category, which can be ordered by their semantic strength or degree of informativeness (Levinson, 1983).
    For example, lukewarm, warm, and hot fall along a single adjectival scale since they indicate a variation in the intensity of
