abel of word on which is dependent), Parse Tree PERSON-NP-PP-ORGANIZATION, PERSON-NP-PP:of-ORGANIZATION (both derived from the path shown in bold in Figure 1).
    We trained Maximum Entropy models using features derived from the feature streams described above.
  
  
    We divided the ACE training data provided by LDC into separate training and development sets.
    The training set contained around 300K words, and 9752 instances of relations and the development set contained around 46K words, and 1679 instances of relations.
    We report results in two ways.
    To isolate the perfomance of relation extraction, we measure the performance of relation extraction models on &#8220;true&#8221; mentions with &#8220;true&#8221; chaining (i.e. as annotated by LDC annotators).
    We also measured performance of models run on the deficient output of mention detection and mention chaining modules.
    We report both the F-measure' and the ACE value of relation extraction.
    The ACE value is a NIST metric that ass
