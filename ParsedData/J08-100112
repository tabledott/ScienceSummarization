improving the performance of a metric on a task.
    For instance, Miltsakaki and Kukich (2000) annotate a corpus of student essays with entity transition information, and show that the distribution of transitions correlates with human grades.
    Analogously, Hasler (2004) investigates whether Centering Theory can be used in evaluating the readability of automatic summaries by annotating human and machine generated extracts with entity transition information.
    The present work differs from these approaches in goal and methodology.
    Although our work builds upon existing linguistic theories, we do not aim to directly implement or refine any of them in particular.
    We provide our model with sources of knowledge identified as essential by these theories, and leave it to the inference procedure to determine the parameter values and an optimal way to combine them.
    From a design viewpoint, we emphasize automatic computation for both the underlying discourse representation and the inference procedure.
