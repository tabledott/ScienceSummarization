  However, some questions are relevant to only one of them.
    For example, the question of when the information becomes available is not relevant to determination but is crucial to recognition.
    An analogous distinction has been drawn with respect to sentence structure; the parse tree (determination) is differentiated from the parsing process (recognition) that produces the tree.
    The third component of discourse structure, the attentional state, is an abstraction of the participants' focus of attention as their discourse unfolds.
    The attentional state is a property of the discourse itself, not of the discourse participants.
    It is inherently dynamic, recording the objects, properties, and relations that are salient at each point in the discourse.
    The attentional state is modeled by a set of focus spaces; changes in attentional state are modeled by a set of transition rules that specify the conditions for adding and deleting spaces.
    We call the collection of focus spaces available at an
