nd and pair distortion costs (i..e, Ci(p, n, m, a) and Cp(p, n, m, a)) can be defined in a similar fashion.
    The above distortion costs are used in conjunction with other cost components used in our decoder.
    The ultimate word order choice made is influenced by both the language model cost as well as the distortion cost.
  
  
    The phrase-based decoder we use is inspired by the decoder described in (Tillmann and Ney, 2003) and similar to that described in (Koehn, 2004).
    It is a multistack, multi-beam search decoder with n stacks (where n is the length of the source sentence being decoded) The input is the reordered English in the reference.
    The 95% Confidence u ranges from 0.011 to 0.016 and a beam associated with each stack as described in (Al-Onaizan, 2005).
    The search is done in n time steps.
    In time step i, only hypotheses that cover exactly i source words are extended.
    The beam search algorithm attempts to find the translation (i.e., hypothesis that covers all source words) w
