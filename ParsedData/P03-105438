    This brought F1 to 82.28%.
  
  
    The notion that the head word of a constituent can affect its behavior is a useful one.
    However, often the head tag is as good (or better) an indicator of how a constituent will behave.12 We found several head annotations to be particularly effective.
    First, possessive NPs have a very different distribution than other NPs &#8211; in particular, NP &#8594; NP &#945; rules are only used in the treebank when the leftmost child is possessive (as opposed to other imaginable uses like for New York lawyers, which is left flat).
    To address this, POSS-NP marked all possessive NPs.
    This brought the total F1 to 83.06%.
    Second, the VP symbol is very overloaded in the Penn treebank, most severely in that there is no distinction between finite and infinitival VPs.
    An example of the damage this conflation can do is given in figure 7, where one needs to capture the fact that prese
