    Table 4 shows system performance for 5 fairly diverse languages: Romanian, English, Greek, Turkish and Hindi.
    The initial 4 rows provide some basic details on the training data available for each language.
    Note that when annotators were generating the lists of 150-300 seed words, they had access to a development test from which to extract samples, but they were not constrained to this text and could add additional ones from memory.
    Furthermore, it was quite unpredictable how many contexts would actually be found for a given word in the development texts, as some appeared several times and many did not appear at all.
    Thus the total number of contextual matches for the seed words was quite variable, from 113-249, and difficult to control.
    It is also the case that not all additional contexts bring comparable new benefit, as many secondary instances of the same word in a given related document collection tend to have similar or identical surrounding contexts to the f
