    Lexical Coverage on Unseen Data.
    The lexicon extracted from sections 02&#8211;21 contains the necessary categories (as determined by our translation algorithm) for 94.0% of all tokens in section 00 (42,707 out of 45,422).
    The missing entries that would be required for the remaining 6% of tokens fall into two classes: 1,728, or 3.8%, correspond to completely unknown words that do not appear at all in section 02&#8211;21, whereas the other 2.2% of tokens do appear in the training set, but not with the categories required in section 00.
    All statistical parsers have to be able to accept unknown words in their input, regardless of the underlying grammar formalism.
    Typically, frequency information for rare words in the training data is used to estimate parameters for unknown words (and when these rare or unknown words are encountered during parsing, additional information may be obtained from a POS-tagger
