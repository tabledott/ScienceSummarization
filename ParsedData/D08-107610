upper envelope on N-best lists is extended to phrase lattices.
    For a description on how to generate lattices, see (Ueffing et al., 2002).
    Formally, a phrase lattice for a source sentence f is defined as a connected, directed acyclic graph Gf~p = (Vf, Efq) with vertice set Vf, unique source and sink nodes s, tP c Vf, and a set of arcs Ef&#8364; c Vf~ x Vf.
    Each arc is labeled with a phrase &#981;ij = ei1, ..., eij and the (local) feature function values hM(&#981;ij, fq).
    A path 7r = (v0, E0, v1, E1, ..., En&#8212; 1, vnq) in Gf (with EiP c Ef and vi, vz+1P c Vf as the tail and head of Ei, 0&#164; &lt;, i &lt; n) defines a partial translation e&#960; of f which is the concatenation of all phrases along this path.
    The corresponding feature function values are obtained by summing over the arc-specific feature function values: In the following, we use the notation inp (vq) and outp(vq) to refer to the set of incoming and outgoing arcs for a node vP c Vf.
    Similarly, headp(E) and tailp(E) den
