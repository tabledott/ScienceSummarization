The German corpus is a compilation of mainly newspaper texts from Frankfurter Rundschau, Die Zeit and Mannheimer Morgen.
    To the knowledge of the author, the English and German corpora contain no parallel passages.
    For each pair of words in the English vocabulary its frequency of common occurrence in the English corpus was counted.
    The common occurrence of two words was defined as both words being separated by at most 11 other words.
    The co-occurrence frequencies obtained in this way were used to build up the English matrix.
    Equivalently, the German co-occurrence matrix was created by counting the co-occurrences of German word pairs in the German corpus.
    As a starting point, word order in the two matrices was chosen such that word n in the German matrix was the translation of word n in the English matrix.
    Co-occurrence studies like that conducted by Wettler St Rapp (1993) have shown that for many purposes it is desirable to reduce the influence of word frequency on the co-occurrence
