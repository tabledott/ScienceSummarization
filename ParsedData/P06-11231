ments between sentences that are translations of each other.
    The complexity of a given word alignment can be measured by the difficulty of decomposing it into its atomic units under certain constraints detailed in Section 2.
    This paper describes a study of the distribution of alignment complexity in a variety of bitexts.
    The study considered word alignments both in isolation and in combination with independently generated parse trees for one or both sentences in each pair.
    Thus, the study * Thanks to David Chiang, Liang Huang, the anonymous reviewers, and members of the NYU Proteus Project for helpful feedback.
