urgens et al., 2012), to estimate the extent to which RNNLM word vectors contain semantic information.
    The dataset contains 79 fine-grained word relations, where 10 are used for training and 69 testing.
    Each relation is exemplified by 3 or 4 gold word pairs.
    Given a group of word pairs that supposedly have the same relation, the task is to order the target pairs according to the degree to which this relation holds.
    This can be viewed as another analogy problem.
    For example, take the ClassInclusion:Singular Collective relation with the prototypical word pair clothing:shirt.
    To measure the degree that a target word pair dish:bowl has the same relation, we form the analogy &#8220;clothing is to shirt as dish is to bowl,&#8221; and ask how valid it is.
  
  
    As we have seen, both the syntactic and semantic tasks have been formulated as analogy questions.
    We have found that a simple vector offset method based on cosine distance is remarkably effective in solving these questions.
