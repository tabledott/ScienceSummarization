one relationship to a possible action of the generator (initiated by some monitoring component) which could be called ABANDON CONSTRUCT X.
    And suppose that this action can be initiated at any time up until CONSTRUCT X is completed, when a signal is returned that the construction is complete.
    Further suppose that ABANDON CONSTRUCT X causes an editing signal.
    When the speaker decides in the middle of some linguistic element to abandon it and start again, an editing signal is produced.
    If this is an appropriate model, then the elements which are self-corrected should be exactly those elements that xist at some stage in the generation process.
    Thus, we should be able to find evidence for the units involved in generation by looking at the data of self-correction.
    And indeed, such evidence should be available to the language learner as well.
    Summary I have described the nature of self-corrected speech (which is a major source of spoken non-fluencies) and how it can be resolved by simple
