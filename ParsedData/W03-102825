ation is crucial for assigning an acceptable number of terms per document, independent of what term selection strategy is chosen.
    One shortcoming of the work is that there is currently no relation between the different POS tag feature values.
    For example, a singular noun has no closer relationship to a plural noun than to an adjective.
    In the future, the patterns should somehow be categorised reflecting their semantics, perhaps in a hierarchical manner, or morphological information could be removed.
    In this paper I have not touched upon the more intricate aspects of evaluation, but simply treated the manually assigned keywords as the gold standard.
    This is the most severe way to evaluate a keyword extractor, as many terms might be just as good, although for one reason or another not chosen by the human indexer.
    Future work will examine alternative approaches to evaluation.
    One possibility for a more liberal evaluation could be to use human evaluators with real information needs, as
