lton 1989] or between a query and a segment of a document [Callan 1994].
    While effective techniques have been developed for document clustering and classification which depend on inter-document similarity measures, these techniques mostly rely on shared words, or occasionally collocations of words [Smeaton 1992].
    When larger units of text are compared, overlap may be sufficient to detect similarity; but when the units of text are small, simple surface matching of words and phrases is less likely to succeed since the number of potential matches is smaller.
    Our task differs from typical text matching applications not only in the smaller size of the text units compared, but also in its overall goal.
    Our notion of similarity is more restrictive than topical similarity&#8212;we provide a detailed definition in the next section.
    We aim to recover sets of small textual units from a collection of documents so that each text unit within a given set describes the same action.
    Our system, which i
