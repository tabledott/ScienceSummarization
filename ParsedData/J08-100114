an assessment phase in which the candidates are ranked based on a set of desirable properties encoded in a ranking function.
    The top-ranked candidate is selected for presentation.
    A two-stage generate-and-rank architecture circumvents the complexity of traditional generation systems, where numerous, often conflicting constraints, have to be encoded during development in order to produce a single high-quality output.
    Because the focus of our work is on text coherence, we discuss here ranking approaches applied to text planning (see Walker et al. [2001] and Knight and Hatzivassiloglou [1995] for ranking approaches to sentence planning and surface realization, respectively).
    The goal of text planning is to determine the content of a text by selecting a set of information-bearing units and arranging them into a structure that yields well-formed output.
    Depending on the system, text plans are represented as discourse trees (Mellish et al. 1998) or linear sequences of propositions (Karamanis 200
