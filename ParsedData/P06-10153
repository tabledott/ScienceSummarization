ic annotation.
    Minimally supervised algorithms, like (Hearst 1992; Pantel et al. 2004), typically ignore generic patterns since system precision dramatically decreases from the introduced noise and bootstrapping quickly spins out of control.
  
  
    To date, most research on relation harvesting has focused on is-a and part-of.
    Approaches fall into two categories: pattern- and clustering-based.
    Most common are pattern-based approaches.
    Hearst (1992) pioneered using patterns to extract hyponym (is-a) relations.
    Manually building three lexico-syntactic patterns, Hearst sketched a bootstrapping algorithm to learn more patterns from instances, which has served as the model for most subsequent pattern-based algorithms.
    Berland and Charniak (1999) proposed a system for part-of relation extraction, based on the (Hearst 1992) approach.
    Seed instances are used to infer linguistic patterns that are used to extract new instances.
