s with morphological analysis is the price willingly paid for not having to enter every distinct word in the stem list of the morphology.
    Summarizing, the compressed length of the corpus is where we have summed over the words in the corpus, and a(w) is the signature to which word w is assigned.
    The compressed length of the model is the length of the stem list, the suffix list, and the signature list.
    The length in bits of the stem list is and the length of the suffix list is where Lt5p00 is the measurement of the length of a string of letters in bits, which we take to be log2 26 times the number of letters (but recall note 18).
    The length of the signature list is where L(a) is the length of signature a.
    If the set of stems linked to signature a is T(a) and the set of suffixes linked to signature a is F(a), then (The denominator in the last term consists of the token count of words in a particular signature with the given suffix f, and we will refer to this below more simply as [f in ol.)
