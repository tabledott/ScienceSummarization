search in stochastic pars- ing in a number of frameworks, there is a lack of appro- priately rich and dynamic language corpora for HPSG.
  Likewise, stochastic parsing has so far been focussed on information-extraction-type applications and lacks any depth of semantic interpretation.
  The Redwoods initia- tive is designed to fill in this gap.
  In the next section, we present some of the motivation for the LinGO Redwoods project as a treebank develop- ment process.
  Although construction of the treebank is in its early stages, we present in Section 3 some prelim- inary results of using the treebank data already acquired on concrete applications.
  We show, for instance, that even simple statistical models of parse ranking trained on the Redwoods corpus built so far can disambiguate parses with close to 80% accuracy.
  2 A Rich and Dynamic Treebank The Redwoods treebank is based on open-source HPSG resources developed by a broad consortium of re- search groups including researchers at Stanford (USA), Saarbru
