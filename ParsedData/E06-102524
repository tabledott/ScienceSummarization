rs according to two evaluation measures: and Objective, i.e. in deciding both term orientation and subjectivity.
  
  
    We present results obtained from running every combination of (i) the three approaches to classification described in Section 4.3, (ii) the four learners mentioned in the same section, (iii) five different reduction factors for feature selection (0%, 50%, 90%, 95%, 99%), and (iv) the two different training sets (Tr3o and Tr4o) for Objective mentioned in Section 4.2.
    We discuss each of these four dimensions of the problem individually, for each one reporting results averaged across all the experiments we have run (see Table 1).
    The first and most important observation is that, with respect to a pure term orientation task, accuracy drops significantly.
    In fact, the best SOaccuracy and the best PNO-accuracy results obtained across the 120 different experiments are .676 and .660, respectively (these were obtained by using Approach II with the PrTFIDF learner and no feature selecti
