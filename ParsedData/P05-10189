assive verbs are recognized using a small set of patterns, and the underlying deep grammatical role for arguments involved in the passive construction is entered in the grid (see the grid cell o for Microsoft, Sentence 2, Table 2).
    When a noun is attested more than once with a different grammatical role in the same sentence, we default to the role with the highest grammatical ranking: subjects are ranked higher than objects, which in turn are ranked higher than the rest.
    For example, the entity Microsoft is mentioned twice in Sentence 1 with the grammatical roles x (for Microsoft Corp.) and s (for the company), but is represented only by s in the grid (see Tables 1 and 2). for coherence assessment that is based on grid representation.
    A fundamental assumption underlying our approach is that the distribution of entities in coherent texts exhibits certain regularities reflected in grid topology.
    Some of these regularities are formalized in Centering Theory as constraints on transitions of local
