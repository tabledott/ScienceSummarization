ically by considering only the next input and the contents of a shift-reduce stack.
    Generalized LR parsing is an extension that allows parallel tracking of multiple state transitions and stack actions by using a graph-structured stack (Tomita 1986).
    Probabilistic LR parsing (Wright 1990) is based on LR items augmented with certain conditional probabilities.
    Specifically, the probability p associated with an LR item X -4 A.,tt is, in our terminology, a normalized forward probability: where the denominator is the probability of the current prefix.'
    LR item probabilities, are thus conditioned forward probabilities, and can be used to compute conditional probabilities of next words: P(x, xo...1_1) is the sum of the p's of all items having x, to the right of the dot (extra work is required if the item corresponds to a &amp;quot;reduce&amp;quot; state, i.e., if the dot is in final position).
    Notice that the definition of p is independent of i as well as the start index of the corresponding Earle
