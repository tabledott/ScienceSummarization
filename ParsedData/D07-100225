			Our evaluation was motivated by the following ques tions: (1) How does the incompleteness of FrameNet impact QA performance on the TREC data sets?
			In particular, we wanted to examine whether there are questions for which in principle no answer can befound due to missing frame entries or missing an notated sentences.
			(2) Are all questions and theircorresponding answers amenable to a FrameNet style analy
