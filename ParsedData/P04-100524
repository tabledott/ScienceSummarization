 then the precision is n,/nm, recall is n,/nt, and f is 2pr/(p + r).
    For comparison we include the results of running the word-by-word classifier described in Charniak and Johnson (2001), but where partial words and punctuation have been removed from the training and test data.
    We also provide results for our noisy channel model using a bigram language model and a second trigram model where the twenty most likely analyses are rescored.
    Finally we show the results using the parser language model.
    The noisy channel model using a bigram language model does a slightly worse job at identifying reparandum and interregnum words than the classifier proposed in Charniak and Johnson (2001).
    Replacing the bigram language model with a trigram model helps slightly, and parserbased language model results in a significant performance improvement over all of the others.
  
  
    This paper has proposed a novel noisy channel model of speech repairs and has used it to identify reparandum words.
