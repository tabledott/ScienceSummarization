ferent contexts, and (ii) reordering: it is easier to move one unit around than having to move two consecutive units at the same time.
    Having words as the basic units helps the reordering model.
    For the first advantage, one example is the character &#8220;&#10128;&#8221;, which can both mean &#8220;intelligence&#8221;, or an abbreviation for Chile (&#10128;&#9316;).
