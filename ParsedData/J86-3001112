, it is as follows: This equivalence states that, if an agent (CP,) believes that the performance of some action (ad contributes in part to the performance of another action (A), and if CP., intends for CP2 to (intend to) do both of these actions, then his intention that CP2 (intend to) perform a; is dominated by his intention that CP2 (intend to) perform A.
    Viewed intuitively, CPI's belief that doing a; will contribute to doing A underlies his intention to get CP2 to do A by getting CP2 to do ai.
    The satisfaction of CPI's intention for CP2 to do a; will help satisfy CPI's intention for CP2 to do A.
    So, for example, in the task-oriented dialogue of Section 3.2, the expert knows that using the wheelpuller is a necessary part of removing the flywheel.
    His intention that the apprentice intend to use the wheelpuller is thus dominated by his intention that the apprentice intend to take off the flywheel.
    Satisfaction of the intention to use the wheelpuller will contribute to satisfying the inten
