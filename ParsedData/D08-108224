nces, larger MR structures, and a significant amount of non-compositionality.
    These factors combine to present a challenging problem for parsing with the generative model.
    Interestingly, although Model III fails to produce better best predictions for this corpus, we found that its top-k list contains a relatively larger number of correct predictions than Model I or Model II.
    This indicates the possibility of enhancing the performance with reranking.
    The reranking approach is shown to be quite effective.
    We observe a consistent improvement in both precision and F-measure after employing the reranking phase for each model.
    Among all the previous models, SILT, WASP, and KRISP are directly comparable to our model.
    They required the same amount of supervision as our system and were evaluated on the same corpora.
    We compare our model with these models in Table 4, where the performance scores for the previous systems are taken from (Wong, 2007).
    For GEOQUERY corpus, our model perf
