) using L-BFGS (Malouf, 2002; Sha and Pereira, 2003).
    This method has been demonstrated to be effective for (non-convex) log-linear models with latent variables (Clark and Curran, 2004; Petrov et al., 2007).
    Each L-BFGS iteration requires the objective value and its gradient with respect to the model parameters.
    These are calculated using inside-outside inference over the feature forest defined by the SCFG parse chart of f yielding the partition function, ZA(f), required for the log-likelihood, and the marginals, required for its derivatives.
    Efficiently calculating the objective and its gradient requires two separate packed charts, each representing a derivation forest.
    The first one is the full chart over the space of possible derivations given the source sentence.
    The inside-outside algorithm over this chart gives the marginal probabilities for each chart cell, from which we can find the feature expectations.
    The second chart contains the space of derivations which produce the r
