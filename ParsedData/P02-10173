as returned to using structure search.
    Note that both approaches are local.
    Structure search requires ways of deciding locally which merges will produce a coherent, globally good grammar.
    To the extent that such approaches work, they work because good local heuristics have been engineered (Klein and Manning, 2001a; Clark, 2001).
    Parameter search is also local; parameters which are locally optimal may be globally poor.
    A concrete example is the experiments from (Carroll and Charniak, 1992).
    They restricted the space of grammars to those isomorphic to a dependency grammar over the POS symbols in the Penn treebank, and then searched for parameters with the inside-outside algorithm (Baker, 1979) starting with 300 random production weight vectors.
    Each seed converged to a different locally optimal grammar, none of them nearly as good as the treebank grammar, measured either by parsing performance or data-likelihood.
    However, parameter search methods have a potential advantage.
