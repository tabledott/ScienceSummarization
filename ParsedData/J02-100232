e as follows: As can easily be seen, the estimate produced using this method is very similar to the actual Pk value.
    The same sort of analysis applies for Pk and WD.
    In Pk, Type A errors are penalized k on average, since the false positive penalty is doubled.
    Type B errors have an average penalty of k, as for Pk.
    Type C errors have an average penalty of 3e, where 2e is assigned for the false positive and e is assigned for the false negative.
    This means that the average penalty for a Type C error is 3 &#183; k2.
    Since we know that c = 1.5a by the linear metric assumption, we have p = a2 + b2 + 1.5 &#183; a2 = 5&#183; a4 + b2 (the choice of 1.5a over 1.5b was made for the same reason as the choice of 2a over b in the calculations for Pk).
    The results, arranged by segment size variation, are as follows: (20, 30) (15, 35) (10, 40) (5, 45) Estimate 0.443 0.429 0.401 0.378 Actual 0.446 0.432 0.403 0.375 Finally, WD incurs an average penalty of k for both Type A and Type B errors.
