ocument was used to compute the score.
    Carrying out the same cross-validation experiment (on the same random split of data), the combined structural and content-based classifier produced the results in Table 6.
    Also shown is the performance of the tsim-only classifier, assuming an optimal threshold is chosen.
    Averaged over three folds, the classifier achieved 95.06% precision and 98.48% recall (1.8% and 5.24% better than without tsim, respectively).
    After building a single classifier on all 149 test pairs (the set on which both human judges agreed), we reclassified the entire candidate set.
    Ignoring again pages from the (maktoob.com) domain, 2,206 pairs were marked as translations.
    The same crude duplicate filter was applied, cutting the set back to 1,821 pairs.28 Table 7 shows word counts for various tokenization schemes: the morphological analysis used for computing tsim, the Egypt tokenizer (which is aggressive), and counting only tokens with some alphabetic character from the Egypt
