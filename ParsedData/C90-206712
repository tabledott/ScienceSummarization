 assume that there are significant semantic relations between a word and the words used to define it.
			The connections in the network reflect these relations.
			All of the knowledge represented in the network is automatically generated from a machine-readable dictionary, and therefore no hand coding is required.
			Further, the lexicon m~d the knowledge it contains potentially cover all of English (90,000 words), and as a result this information cml potentially be used to help dismnbiguate unrestricted text.
			3.1.
			Topology of the network.
			In our model, words are complex units.
			Each word in the input is represented by a word node connected by excitatory links to sense nodes (figure 2) representing the different possible senses tbr that word in the Collins English Dictionary.
			Each sense node is in turn connected by excitatory links to word nodes rcpreseming the words in tile definition of that sense.
			This process is repeated a number of times, creating an increasingly complex and interconnec
