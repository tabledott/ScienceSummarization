llner (2005) incorporated transitivity into pairwise classification and achieved the state-of-the-art result on the MUC-6 dataset, but their approach can only leverage one binary relation at a time, not arbitrary relations among mentions.
    Denis &amp; Baldridge (2007) determined anaphoricity and pairwise classification jointly using integer programming, but they did not incorporate transitivity or other relations.
    While potentially more appealing, unsupervised learning is very challenging, and unsupervised coreference resolution systems are still rare to this date.
    Prior to our work, the best performance in unsupervised coreference resolution was achieved by Haghighi &amp; Klein (2007), using a nonparametric Bayesian model based on hierarchical Dirichlet processes.
    At the heart of their system is a mixture model with a few linguistically motivated features such as head words, entity properties and salience.
    Their approach is a major step forward in unsupervised coreference resolution, but e
