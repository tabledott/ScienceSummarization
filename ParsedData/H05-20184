e sentences using a variety of lexical and contextual features (Wiebe and Riloff, 2005; Riloff and Wiebe, 2003).
  The classifier is trained using subjective and objective sentences, which are automatically gener- ated from a large corpus of unannotated data by two high-precision, rule-based classifiers.
  2.3.2 Speech Events and Direct Subjective Expression Classification The second component identifies speech events (e.g., ?said,?

  and direct subjective expressions (e.g., ?fears,?
  Speech events include both speaking and writing events.
