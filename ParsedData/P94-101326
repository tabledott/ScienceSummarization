e evidence rarely produces a different classification than just using the single most reliable evidence, and when these differ it is as likely to hurt as to help.
    In a study comparing results for 20 words in a binary homograph disambiguation task, based strictly on words in local (&#177;4 word) context, the following differences were observed between an algorithm taking the single best evidence, and an otherwise identical algorithm combining all available matching evidence:9 Of course that this behavior does not hold for all classification tasks, but does seem to be characteristic of lexically-based word classifications.
    This may be explained by the empirical observation that in most cases, and with high probability, words exhibit only one sense in a given collocation (Yarowsky, 1993).
    Thus for this type of ambiguity resolution, there is no apparent detriment, and some apparent performance gain, from usit indicates the most likely accent pattern in cases where nothing matches.
