eaning &#8216;to die&#8217;.
    While den L&#168;offel abgeben is used almost exclusively in its idiomatic sense (all four occurrences in our corpus), many MWEs are used regularly in both their idiomatic and in their literal senses.
    About two thirds of the uses of the MWE ins Wasser fallen in our corpus are idiomatic uses, and the remaing one third are literal uses.
    In our first experiment we tested the hypothesis that these uses could reliably be distinguished using distribution-based models of their meaning.
    For this experiment we manually annotated the 67 occurrences of ins Wasser fallen in our corpus as to whether the expression was used compositionally (literally) or non-compositionally (idiomatically).4 Marking this distinction we generate an LSA meaning vectors for the compositional uses and an LSA meaning vector for the non-compositional uses of ins Wasser fallen.
    The vectors turned out, as expected, to be almost orthogonal, with a cosine of the angle between them of 0.02.
