.e. all the observed vectors and all the predicted vectors.
    We extract the 10 nearest neighbours for the 380 Adjective-Noun pairs in the test set and look for the intended predicted vectors in each case.
    The idea here is that the best models should produce predictions that are as close as possible to the originally observed A-N vector.
    Our second evaluation method uses the 10 nearest neighbours of each of the observed A-N pairs in the test set as gold-standard (excluding any modelled predictions), and compares them with the 10 nearest neighbours of each of the corresponding predictions as generated by the models.
    The aim is to assess if the predictions made by each model share any top-10 neighbours with their corresponding gold-standard.
    We award 1 point for every shared neighbour.
    We calculated the Euclidean distance between each observed A-N pair and the corresponding prediction made by each model.
    On general inspection, it is clear that the approximation of A-N compositional vec
