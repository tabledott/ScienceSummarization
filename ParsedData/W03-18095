 semantics of VPCs is frequently viewed in rather more complicated terms than we are suggesting here, with particles often seen as making significant construction-specific contributions in terms of aspect (e.g.
    Brinton (1985)).
    However no such existing linguistic account is completely robust, and for practical NLP purposes we are forced to adopt a rather straightforward definition of compositionality as meaning that the overall semantics of the MWE can be composed from the simplex semantics of its parts, as described (explicitly or implicitly) in a finite lexicon.
  
  
    Rather than attempting to model compositionality by anchoring word semantics to a given lexicon, our approach in this work is to defer to an empirical reference based on human judgements.
    We define MWE compositionality to be an entailment relationship between the whole and its various parts, and solicit entailment judgements based on a handful of example sentences.
    Entailment is conventionally defined for logical propositio
