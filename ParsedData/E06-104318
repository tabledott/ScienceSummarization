riments over the development data, in which ranges from to by steps of ; is set to based on the results.
    We also experimented with different values of ranging from to by steps of .
    Based on the development results, the best value for is (giving more weight to the syntactic fixedness measure).
    Test expressions are saved as unseen data for the final evaluation.
    We further divide the set of all test expressions, TEST , into two sets corresponding to two frequency bands: TEST contains idiomatic and literal pairs, each with total frequency between and ( ); TEST consists of idiomatic and literal pairs, each with total frequency of or greater ( ).
    All frequency counts are over the entire BNC.
    We first examine the performance of the individual fixedness measures, and 5In selecting literal pairs, we choose those that involve a physical act corresponding to the basic semantics of the verb.
