l for capturing translation generalizations between languages as discussed in the literature (Palmer and Rosenzweig, 1996), (Copestake and Sanfilippo, 1993), (Dorr, 1997).
    In pursuing this goal, we are currently implementing features for motion verbs in the English Tree-Adjoining Grammar, TAG (Bleam et al., 1998).
    TAGs have also been applied to Portuguese in previous work, resulting in a small Portuguese grammar (Kipper, 1994).
    We intend to extend this grammar, building a more robust TAG grammar for Portuguese, that will allow us to build an English/Portuguese transfer lexicon using these features.
