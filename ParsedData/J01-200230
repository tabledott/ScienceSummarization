rminate&amp;quot; tags, e.g., JJIVBD indicates a choice between adjective and past participle which cannot be decided or about which the annotator was unsure.
    Mostly because of the less detailed tagset, the average ambiguity of the tags is lower than LOB's, at 2.34 tags per token in the corpus.
    This means that the tagging task should be an easier one than that for LOB.
    This is supported by the values for Random and LexProb in Table 2.
    On the other hand, the less detailed tagset also means that the taggers have less detailed information to base their decisions on.
    Another factor that influences the quality of automatic tagging is the consistency of the tagging over the corpus.
    The WSJ material has not been checked as extensively as the LOB corpus and is expected to have a much lower consistency level (see Section 5.3 below for a closer examination).
    The training/test separation of the corpus is again done at utterance boundaries and leads to a 1,160K token training set and a 129K to
