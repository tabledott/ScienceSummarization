B given w. (b) Probability preferred; and when Q &lt; 1, high probability is assigned to sparse multinomials, where one or more parameters are at or near 0.
    Typically, linguistic structures are characterized by sparse distributions (e.g., POS tags are followed with high probability by only a few other tags, and have highly skewed output distributions).
    Consequently, it makes sense to use a Dirichlet prior with Q &lt; 1.
    However, as noted by Johnson et al. (2007), this choice of Q leads to difficulties with MAP estiwhere nk is the number of times k occurred in x&#8722;i.

    To perform inference in our model, we use Gibbs 2.2 Model Definition sampling (Geman and Geman, 1984), a stochastic Our model has the structure of a standard trigram procedure that produces samples from the posterior HMM, with the addition of symmetric Dirichlet pri- distribution P(t|w, &#945;, &#946;) a P(w|t, &#946;)P(t|&#945;).
