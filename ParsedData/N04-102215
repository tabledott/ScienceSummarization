eni et al., 2001).
    In case of the other metrics, we consider multiple references in the following way.
    For each sentence, we compute the error rate of the hypothesis translation with respect to the most similar reference translation under the corresponding loss function.
    In our experiments, a baseline translation model (JHU, 2003), trained on a Chinese-English parallel corpus (NIST, 2003) ( English words and Chinese words), was used to generate 1000-best translation hypotheses for each Chinese sentence in the test set.
    The 1000-best lists were then rescored using the different translation loss functions described in Section 2.
    The English sentences in the -best lists were parsed using the Collins parser (Collins, 1999), and the Chinese sentences were parsed using a Chinese parser provided to us by D. Bikel (Bikel and Chiang, 2000).
    The English parser was trained on the Penn Treebank and the Chinese parser on the Penn Chinese treebank.
    Under each loss function, the MBR decoding was
