hen the maximum-entropy equation is expressed in the form of Equation 4, the gi have as their initial values the values of the corresponding terms in Equation 7.
    (Our experience is that rather than requiring 50 or so iterations, three suffice.)
    Now we observe that if we were to use a maximum-entropy approach but run iterative scaling zero times, we would, in fact, just have Equation 7.
    The major advantage of using Equation 7 is that one can generally get away without computing the partition function Z(H).
    In the simple (content-free) form (Equation 6), it is clear that Z(H) = 1.
    In the more interesting version, Equation 7, this is not true in general, but one would not expect it to differ much from one, and we assume that as long as we are not publishing the raw probabilities (as we would be doing, for example, in publishing perplexity results) the difference from one should be unimportant.
    As partition-function calculation is typically the major on-line computational problem for maxim
