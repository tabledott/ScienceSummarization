    The definition of relevant and unimportant information, respectively, depends on many factors like the languages involved, the translation direction, and the choice of the models.
    We detect candidates for equivalence classes of words automatically from the probabilistic lexicon trained for translation from German to English.
    For this purpose, those inflected forms of the same base form which result in the same translation are inspected.
    For each set of tags T, the algorithm counts how often an additional tag t1 can be replaced with a certain other tag t2 without effect on the translation.
    As an example, let T = &#8216;blau-adjective&#8217;, t1 =&#8216;masculine&#8217; and t2 =&#8216;feminine&#8217;.
    The two entries (&#8216;blau-adjective-masculine&#8217;|&#8216;blue&#8217;) and (&#8216;blau-adjective-feminine&#8217;|&#8216;blue&#8217;) are hints for detecting gender as nonrelevant when translating adjectives into English.
