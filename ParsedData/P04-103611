ented with counts obtained from the BNC and the Brown corpus.
    The variation in counts had negligible affect on the results.
    3 The experimental results reported here are obtained using IC counts from the BNC corpus.
    All the results shown here are those with the size of thesaurus entries ( ) set to 50.
    4 We calculate the accuracy of finding the predominant sense, when there is indeed one sense with a higher frequency than the others for this word in SemCor ( ).
    We also calculate the WSD accuracy that would be obtained on SemCor, when using our first sense in all contexts ( ).
    The results in table 1 show the accuracy of the ranking with respect to SemCor over the entire set of 2595 polysemous nouns in SemCor with the jcn and lesk WordNet similarity measures.
    The random baseline for choosing the predominant sense over all these words ( ) is 32%.
    Both WordNet similarity measures beat this baseline.
    The random baseline for ( ) is 24%.
    Again, the automatic ranking outperforms
