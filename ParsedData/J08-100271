ort vector machines (Vapnik 1995), and presented its application to disambiguation in CFG parsing.
    Their algorithm resembles feature forest models; an optimization function is computed by a dynamic programing algorithm without unpacking packed forest structures.
    From the discussion in this article, it is evident that if the main part of an update formula is represented with (the exponential of) linear combinations, a method similar to feature forest models should be applicable.
    Before the advent of feature forest models, studies on probabilistic models of HPSG adopted conventional maximum entropy models to select the most probable parse from parse candidates given by HPSG grammars (Oepen, Toutanova, et al. 2002; Toutanova and Manning 2002; Baldridge and Osborne 2003).
    The difference between these studies and our work is that we used feature forests to avoid the exponential increase in the number of structures that results from unpacked parse results.
    These studies ignored the problem of ex
