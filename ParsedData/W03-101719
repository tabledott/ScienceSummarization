following block (the last block is considered to precede the first one), so that 100 of the 400 sentences appear in two blocks.
    Each of ten human evaluators (all with graduate training in computational linguistics) was presented with one block and asked to select a label for each sentence among the following: &#8220;fact&#8221;, &#8220;positive opinion&#8221;, &#8220;negative opinion&#8221;, &#8220;neutral opinion&#8221;, &#8220;sentence contains both positive and negative opinions&#8221;, &#8220;opinion but cannot determine orientation&#8221;, and &#8220;uncertain&#8221;.5 Since we have one judgment for 300 sentences and two judgments for 100 sentences, we created two gold standards for sentence classification.
    The first (Standard A) includes the 300 sentences with one judgment and a single judgment for the remaining 100 sentences.6 The second standard (Standard B) contains the subset of the 100 sentences for which we obtained identical labels.
    Statistics of these two standards are given in Table
