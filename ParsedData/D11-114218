 set of approximately 1.7 million distinct normalized relation phrases, which are stored in memory at extraction time.
    As an example of the extraction algorithm in action, consider the following input sentence: Hudson was born in Hampstead, which is a suburb of London.
    Step 1 of the algorithm identifies three relation phrases that satisfy the syntactic and lexical constraints: was, born in, and is a suburb of.
    The first two phrases are adjacent in the sentence, so they are merged into the single relation phrase was born in.
    Step 2 then finds an argument pair for each relation phrase.
    For was born in, the nearest NPs are (Hudson, Hampstead).
    For is a suburb of, the extractor skips over the NP which and chooses the argument pair (Hampstead, London).
    The final output is The extraction algorithm in the previous section has high recall, but low precision.
    Like with previous open extractors, we want way to trade recall for precision by tuning a confidence threshold.
    We use a logi
