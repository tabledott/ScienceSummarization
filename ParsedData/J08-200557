tests, and the probabilities of the remaining classes are set based on their occurrence frequencies in the training data.
  Then, we treat each possible final argument output as a single unit.
  Each probability estimation by a system can be viewed as evidence in the final probability estimation and, therefore, we can simply average their estimation.
  Formally, let Si be the argument set 277 Computational Linguistics Volume 34, Number 2 Figure 3 The output of two SRL systems: system A has two candidates, a1 = traders and a4 = the selling panic in both stocks and futures; system B has three argument candidates, b1 = traders, b2 = the selling panic, and b3 = in both stocks and futures.
  In addition, we create two phantom candidates a2 and a3 for system A that correspond to b2 and b3 respectively, and b4 for system B that corresponds to a4.
  output by system i, and S = ?k i=1 Si be the set of all arguments where k is the number of systems; let N be the cardinality of S. Our augmented objective function is the
