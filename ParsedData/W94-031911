s the overall task allows.
    If a process is not designed in this way a small change in one place will have consequences in many other places.
    This means that the process as a whole becomes extremely difficult to debug or improve, whether by a human designer or in the course of natural evolution, because a small chance to improve one part has to be accompanied by many simultaneous compensatory changes elsewhere.
    Marr argues that a modularized structure makes sense both for human engineers and for the evolutionary process that produced the human brain.
    The evidence is indeed strong that the human brain is highly modularized.
    This evidence comes from many sources (e.g., cognitive experiments and PET scans of brain activity), but I think perhaps the most convincing evidence is from studies of humans with brain damage.
    Such people tend to lose specific abilities, not suffer overall degradation that applies equally to all abilities.
