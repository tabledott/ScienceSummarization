 in many NLP applications such as summarization (Daum&#180;e III and Marcu, 2006), document alignment and segmentation (Chen et al., 2009), and inferring class-attribute hierarchies (Reisinger and Pasca, 2009).
    Our particular model, LinkLDA, has been applied to a few NLP tasks such as simultaneously modeling the words appearing in blog posts and users who will likely respond to them (Yano et al., 2009), modeling topic-aligned articles in different languages (Mimno et al., 2009), and word sense induction (Brody and Lapata, 2009).
    Finally, we highlight two systems, developed independently of our own, which apply LDA-style models to similar tasks.
    O&#180; S&#180;eaghdha (2010) proposes a series of LDA-style models for the task of computing selectional preferences.
    This work learns selectional preferences between the following grammatical relations: verb-object, nounnoun, and adjective-noun.
    It also focuses on jointly modeling the generation of both predicate and argument, and evaluation is pe
