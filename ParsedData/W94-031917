discourse and rhetorical relations between portions of the net; subsequent portions of the generator use these to generate discourse connectives (e.g., However), control formatting (e.g., the use of bulletized lists), etc.
    The systems examined use quite different contentdetermination mechanisms (i.e., there was no consensus); schemas [McKeown, 1985] were the most popular approach.
  
  
    Content determination in the systems examined basically performs two functions: Deep content determination: Determine what information should be communicated to the hearer.
    Rhetorical planning: Organize this information in a rhetorically coherent manner.
    Hovy [1988] has proposed an architecture where these tasks are performed separately (in particular, the application program performs deep content determination, while the generation system performs rhetorical planning).
    Among the systems examined, however, Hovy is unique in taking this approach; the builders of the other systems (including Moore and Paris [
