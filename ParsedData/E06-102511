ubjective or an Objective connotation, based on bootstrapping algorithms.
    The method identifies patterns for the extraction of subjective nouns from text, bootstrapping from a seed set of 20 terms that the authors judge to be strongly subjective and have found to have high frequency in the text collection from which the subjective nouns must be extracted.
    The results of this method are not easy to compare with the ones we present in this paper because of the different evaluation methodologies.
    While we adopt the evaluation methodology used in all of the papers reviewed so far (i.e. checking how good our system is at replicating an existing, independently motivated lexical resource), the authors do not test their method on an independently identified set of labelled terms, but on the set of terms that the algorithm itself extracts.
    This evaluation methodology only allows to test precision, and not accuracy tout court, since no quantification can be made of false negatives (i.e. the subjective t
