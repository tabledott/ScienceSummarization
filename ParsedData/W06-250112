two concepts.
    (Resnik, 1995) introduced a measure that is based on information content, which are numeric quantities that indicate the specificity of concepts.
    These values are derived from corpora, and are used to augment the concepts in WordNet&#8217;s is-a hierarchy.
    The measure of relatedness between two concepts is the information content of the most specific concept that both concepts have in common (i.e., their lowest common subsumer in the is-a hierarchy).
    (Jiang and Conrath, 1997) extends Resnik&#8217;s measure to combine the information contents of c1, c2 and their lowest common subsumer.
    (Lin, 1998) also extends Resnik&#8217;s measure, by taking the ratio of the shared information content to that of the individual concepts.
    (Banerjee and Pedersen, 2003) introduce Extended Gloss Overlaps, which is a measure that determines the relatedness of concepts proportional to the extent of overlap of their WordNet glosses.
    This simple definition is extended to take advantage of the
