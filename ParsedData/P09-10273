 the classification accuracy of polarity identification of Chinese product reviews.
    Unlabeled Chinese reviews can be fully leveraged in the proposed approach.
    First, machine translation services are used to translate English training reviews into Chinese reviews and also translate Chinese test reviews and additional unlabeled reviews into English reviews.
    Then, we can view the classification problem in two independent views: Chinese view with only Chinese features and English view with only English features.
    We then use the co-training approach to making full use of the two redundant views of features.
    The SVM classifier is adopted as the basic classifier in the proposed approach.
    Experimental results show that the proposed approach can outperform the baseline inductive classifiers and the more advanced transductive classifiers.
    The rest of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 introduces related work.
    The proposed co-training approach is described in detail in Section
