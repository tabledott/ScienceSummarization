long jump alignment grid is an NP-hard problem.
    Our experiments showed that the calculation of exact long jump distances becomes impractical for sentences longer than 20 words.
    A possible way to achieve polynomial runtime is to restrict the number of admissible block permutations.
    This has been implemented by (Leusch et al., 2003) in the inversion word error rate.
    Alternatively, a heuristic or approximative distance can be calculated, as in GTM by (Turian et al., 2003).
    An implementation of both approaches at the same time can be found in TER by (Snover et al., 2005).
    In this paper, we will present another approach which has a suitable run-time, while still maintaining completeness of the calculated measure.
    The idea of the proposed method is to drop some restrictions on the alignment path.
    The long jump distance as well as the Levenshtein distance require both reference and candidate translation to be covered completely and disjointly.
