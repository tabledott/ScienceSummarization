he search space is still a hypergraph, where we can adapt the methods presented in Sections 3 and 4.
    The data set is same as in Section 5.1, except that we also parsed the English-side using a variant of the Collins (1997) parser, and then extracted 24.7M tree-to-string rules using the algorithm of (Galley et al., 2006).
    Since our tree-to-string rules may have many variables, we first binarize each hyperedge in the forest on the target projection (Huang, 2007).
    All the three +LM decoding methods to be compared below take these binarized forests as input.
    For cube growing, we use a non-duplicate k-best method (Huang et al., 2006) to get 100-best unique translations according to &#8722;LM to estimate the lower-bound heuristics.4 This preprocessing step takes on average 0.12 seconds per sentence, which is negligible in comparison to the +LM decoding time.
    Figure 8(a) compares cube growing and cube pruning against full-integration under various beam settings in the same fashion of Figure 7(a).
