 since Yarowsky and Florian (2002) found this model to be the most accurate classifier in a comparative study on a subset of Senseval-2 English lexical sample data.
			The second model is a maximum entropy model (Jaynes, 1978), since Klein and Manning (Klein and Manning, 2002) found that this model yielded higher accuracy than na??ve Bayes in a subsequent comparison of WSD performance.
			The third model is a boosting model (Freund and Schapire, 1997), since boosting has consistently turned in very competitive scores on related tasks such as named entity classification.
			We also use the Adaboost.MH algorithm.
			The fourth model is a Kernel PCA-based model (Wu et al, 2004).
			Kernel Principal Component Analysis or KPCA is a nonlinear kernel method forextracting nonlinear principal components from vector sets where, conceptually, the n-dimensional input vectors are nonlinearly mapped from their origi nal space Rn to a high-dimensional feature space F where linear PCA is performed, yielding a transformby whi
