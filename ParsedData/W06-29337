erall does not differ significantly from the best one.
    The unlabeled score is less competitive, with only Turkish having the highest reported score, which indirectly indicates that the integration of labels into the parsing process primarily benefits labeled accuracy.
  
  
    An overall error analysis is beyond the scope of this paper, but we will offer a few general observations before we turn to Swedish and Turkish, focusing on recall and precision of root nodes, as a reflection of global syntactic structure, and on attachment score as a function of arc length.
    If we start by considering languages with a labeled attachment score of 85% or higher, they are characterized by high precision and recall for root nodes, typically 95/90, and by a graceful degradation of attachment score as arcs grow longer, typically 95&#8211;90&#8211;85, for arcs of length 1, 2 and 3&#8211;6.
    Typical examples are Bulgarian (Simov et al., 2005; Simov and Osenova, 2003), Chinese (Chen et al., 2003), Danish (Kromann, 20
