xtend this work is to develop algorithms for learning some of the specific knowledge that was programmed into the system described above.
    Consider the morphological adjustment rules according to which, for example, the final &amp;quot;e&amp;quot; of bite is deleted when the suffix -ing is added, yielding biting rather than *&amp;quot;biteing.&amp;quot; Lerner needs to know such rules in order to determine whether or not a given word occurs both with and without the suffix -ing.
    Experiments are under way on an unsupervised procedure that learns such rules from English text, given only the list of English verbal suffixes.
    This work is being extended further in the direction of discovering the morphemic suffixes themselves and discovering the ways in which these suffixes alternate in paradigms.
    The short-term goal is to develop algorithms that can learn the rules of inflection in English starting from only a corpus and a general notion of the nature of morphological regularities.
    Ultimately,
