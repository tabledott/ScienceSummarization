han S3 according to ROUGE-L.
    This example also illustrated that ROUGE-L can work reliably at sentence level.
    However, LCS only counts the main in-sequence words; therefore, other longest common subsequences and shorter sequences are not reflected in the final score.
    For example, consider the following candidate sentence: Where LCS(X,Y) is the length of a longest common subsequence of X and Y, and ,B = Plcs/Rlcs when aFlcs/aRlcs=aFlcs/aPlcs.
    We call the LCS-based Fmeasure, i.e.
    Equation 6, ROUGE-L. Notice that ROUGE-L is 1 when X = Y since LCS(X,Y) = m or n; while ROUGE-L is zero when LCS(X,Y) = 0, i.e. there is nothing in common between X and Y. Fmeasure or its equivalents has been shown to have met several theoretical criteria in measuring accuracy involving more than one factor (Van Rijsbergen 1979).
    The composite factors are LCS-based recall and precision in this case.
    Melamed et al. (2003) used unigram F-measure to estimate machine translation quality and showed that unigram F-
