d during the lexicon translation by accounting for the context of the ambiguous words, which is possible in a corpus-based approach.
    Additionally, we also hope to improve the recall of the classifier, by addressing those cases not covered by the lexicon-based approach.
    In the experiments reported in this section, we use a parallel corpus consisting of 107 documents from the SemCor corpus (Miller et al., 1993) and their manual translations into Romanian.3 The corpus consists of roughly 11,000 sentences, with approximately 250,000 tokens on each side.

    We then describe the automatic construction of a target-
