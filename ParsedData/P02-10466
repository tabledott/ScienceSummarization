lified and assumes non-abstaining binary rules.
    Theorem 2 For all F E W1, G E W2 that satisfy rule independence and are nontrivial predictors in the sense that minu Pr[F = u] &gt; Pr[F =&#65533; If F agrees with G on all but E unlabelled instances, then either F or F&#175; predicts Y with error no greater than E. A small amount of labelled data suffices to choose between F and F&#175;.
    I give a geometric proof sketch here; the reader is referred to the original paper for a formal proof.
    Consider figures 1 and 2.
    In these diagrams, area represents probability.
    For example, the leftmost box (in either diagram) represents the instances for which Y = +, and the area of its upper left quadrant represents Pr[F = +, G = +, Y = +].
    Typically, in such a diagram, either the horizontal or vertical line is broken, as in figure 2.
    In the special case in which rule independence is satisfied, both horizontal and vertical lines are unbroken, as in figure 1.
    Theorem 2 states that disagreement u
