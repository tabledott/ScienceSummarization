conjunction with other more linguistically motivated constraints on the class of grammars that could be inferred, such as 'headedness'; and secondly, initial probabilities were heavily biased in favor of manually coded, linguistically highly plausible rules.
    This approach resulted in a simple tag sequence grammar often able to assign coherent and semantically/pragmatically plausible analyses to tag sequences drawn from the Spoken English Corpus.
    By combining such techniques and relaxing the CNF constraint, for example, by adopting the trellis algorithm version of Baum-Welch re-estimation (Kupiec 1991), it might be possible to create a computationally tractable system operating with a realistic NL grammar that would only infer a new rule from a finite space of linguistically motivated possibilities in the face of parse failure or improbability.
    In the shorter term, such techniques combined with simple tag sequence grammars might yield robust phrase-level 'skeleton' parsers that could be used as cor
