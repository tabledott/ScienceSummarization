ulate the problem of finding the overall side of the post as an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) problem.
    The side that maximizes the overall side-score for the post, given all the N instances Ij, is chosen by maximizing the objective function Equations 5 and 6 implement binary constraints.
    Equation 7 enforces the constraint that each Ij can belong to exactly one side.
    Finally, Equations 8 and 9 ensure that a single side is chosen for the entire post.
    As described in Section 2, debate participants often acknowledge the opinions held by the opposing side.
    We recognize such discourse constructs using the Penn Discourse Treebank (Prasad et al., 2007) list of discourse connectives.
    In particular, we use the list of connectives from the Concession and Contra-expectation category.
    Examples of connectives in these categories are &#8220;while,&#8221; &#8220;nonetheless,&#8221; &#8220;however,&#8221; and &#8220;even if.&#8221; We use approximations to finding the arguments to the discourse
