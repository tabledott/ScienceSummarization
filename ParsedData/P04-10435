y the SVMs, i.e. argmaxiES Ci, where S is the target set of arguments.
    The discovery of relevant features is, as usual, a complex task, nevertheless, there is a common consensus on the basic features that should be adopted.
    These standard features, firstly proposed in (Gildea and Jurasfky, 2002), refer to a flat information derived from parse trees, i.e.
    Phrase Type, Predicate Word, Head Word, Governing Category, Position and Voice.
    Table 1 presents the standard features and exemplifies how they are extracted from the parse tree in Figure 1.
    For example, the Parse Tree Path feature represents the path in the parse-tree between a predicate node and one of its argument nodes.
    It is expressed as a sequence of nonterminal labels linked by direction symbols (up or down), e.g. in Figure 1, VTVPINP is the path between the predicate to give and the argument 1, a lecture.
    Two pairs &lt;p1, a1&gt; and &lt;p2, a2&gt; have two different Path features even if the paths differ only for a node in
