ng only the set of proposed tags as features reach about the same performance.
    They are clearly better than simple voting systems, at least as long as there is sufficient training data.
    In the absence of sufficient data, one has to fall back to less sophisticated combination strategies.
    Addition of word information does not lead to improved accuracy, at least with the current training set size.
    However, it might still be possible to get a positive effect by restricting the word information to the most frequent and ambiguous words only.
    Addition of context information does lead to improvements for most systems.
    WPDV and Maccent make the best use of the extra information, with WPDV having an edge for less consistent data (WSJ) and Maccent for material with a high error rate (Wotan).
    Although the results reported in this paper are very positive, many directions for research remain to be explored in this area.
    In particular, we have high expectations for the following two direction
