entence found within each number of edges.
    Figure 16 shows the results for the figures of merit from Section 3.
    Straight beta clearly shows little or no improvement over the &amp;quot;stack&amp;quot; parser using no figure of merit at all.
    The other figures of merit increase quickly to about 64%, the maximum recall attainable with our test grammar.
    The &amp;quot;stack&amp;quot; parser and the one using straight beta, on the other hand, do not reach this maximum level until about 50,000 edges.
    We have no explanation for the relatively poor performance of the parser using the trigram estimate compared to the other best-first parsers, as shown in Figures 16, 17, and 18.
    Figure 17 shows the recall values for the aL0 figures of merit from Section 4, and Figure 18 shows recall for the boundary figures of merit from Section 5.
    Since precision is not a useful measure, we have not included precision data for these figures of merit.
    These data confirm that the parser using the boundary t
