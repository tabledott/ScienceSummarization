lation but the fact that it was found in a text implies that the terms meanings are close.
  Connecting terms whose expressions are quite disparate but whose meanings are similar should be useful for improved synonym ex- pansion in information retrieval and for finding chains of semantically related phrases, as used in the ap- proach to recognition of topic boundaries of (Morris Hirst 1991).
  We observe that terms that occur in a list are often related semantically, whether they occur in a hyponymy relation or not.
  In the next section we outline a way to discover these lexico-syntactic patterns as well as illustrate those we have found.
  Section 3 shows the results of searching texts for a restricted version of one of the patterns and compares the results against a hand-built hesaurus.
  Section 4 is a discussion of the merits of this work and describes future directions.
  2 Lexico-Syntactic Patterns for Hyponymy Since only a subset of the possible instances of the hyponymy relation will appear in a part
