 time is consumed by word alignment (Koehn et al., 2007).
    Speeding up the word alignment step can dramatically reduces the overall training time, and in turn accelerates the development of SMT systems.
    With the rapid development of computing hardware, multi-processor servers and clusters become widely available.
    With parallel computing, processing time (wall time) can often be cut down by one or two orders of magnitude.
    Tasks, which require several weeks on a single CPU machine may take only a few hours on a cluster.
    However, GIZA++ was designed to be single-process and single-thread.
    To make more efficient use of available computing resources and thereby speed up the training of our SMT system, we decided to modify GIZA++ so that it can run in parallel on multiple CPUs.
    The word alignment models implemented in GIZA++, the so-called IBM (Brown et al., 1993) and HMM alignment models (Vogel et al., 1996) are typical implementation of the EM algorithm (Dempster et al., 1977).
