 techniques in an NLG realization module were Langkilde and Knight (1998a) and (1998b) (see also (Langkilde, 2000)).
    As is the case for stochastic approaches in natural language understanding, the research and development itself requires an effective intrinsic metric in order to be able to evaluate progress.
    In this paper, we discuss several evaluation metrics that we are using during the development of FERGUS (Flexible Empiricist/Rationalist Generation Using Syntax).
    FERGUS, a realization module, follows Knight and Langkilde's seminal work in using an n-gram language model, but we augment it with a tree-based stochastic model and a lexicalized syntactic grammar.
    The metrics are useful to us as relative quantitative assessments of different models we experiment with; however, we do not pretend that these metrics in themselves have any validity.
    Instead, we follow work done in dialog systems (Walker et al., 1997) and attempt to find metrics which on the one hand can be computed easily but o
