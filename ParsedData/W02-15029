st important difference between these types is in the treatment of the handle of the head daughter&#8217;s semantics, to distinguish intersective and scopal modification.
    In isect-mod-phrase, the top handles (TOP) of the head and non-head (i.e., modifier) daughters are identified (#hand).
    This allows for MRSs like (2) where the eps contributed by the head (&#8216;study-rel&#8217;) and the modifier (&#8216;on-rel&#8217;) take the same scope.
    The type scopal-mod-phrase bears no such constraint.
    This allows for MRSs like (3) where the modifier&#8217;s semantic contribution (&#8216;probably-rel&#8217;) takes the handle of the head&#8217;s semantics (&#8216;study-rel&#8217;) as its argument, so that the modifier outscopes the head.
    In both types of modifier phrase, a constraint inherited from the supertype ensures that the handle of the modifier is also the handle of the whole phrase.
    The constraints on the LOCAL value inside the modifier&#8217;s MOD value regulate which lexical items can a
