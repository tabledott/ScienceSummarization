To facilitate tuning the weights, we use two components of the co-occurrence model Co(W,T) to represent the co-occurrence probability of W and T, rather than use Co(W, T) itself.
    In the rest of the paper, we will call them labelling model and generating model respectively.
  
  
    Sequence segmentation and labelling problem can be solved through a viterbi style decoding procedure.
    In Chinese Joint S&amp;T, the mission of the decoder is to find the boundary-POS labelled sequence with the highest score.
    Given a Chinese character sequence C1:n, the decoding procedure can proceed in a left-right fashion with a dynamic programming approach.
    By maintaining a stack of size N at each position i of the sequence, we can preserve the top N best candidate labelled results of subsequence C1:i during decoding.
    At each position i, we enumerate all possible word-POS pairs by assigning each POS to each possible word formed from the character subsequence spanning length l = L. min(i, K) (K is assigned 20
