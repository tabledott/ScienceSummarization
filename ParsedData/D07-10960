	The CoNLL 2007 Shared Task on Dependency Parsing
		The Conference on Computational Natural Language Learning features a shared task, inwhich participants train and test their learn ing systems on the same data sets.
		In 2007, as in 2006, the shared task has been devoted to dependency parsing, this year with both a multilingual track and a domain adaptation track.
		In this paper, we define the tasks of the different tracks and describe how the data sets were created from existing treebanks for ten languages.
		In addition, we characterize the different approaches of the participating systems, report the test results, and provide a first analysis of these results.
	
	
			Previous shared tasks of the Conference on Compu tational Natural Language Learning (CoNLL) havebeen devoted to chunking (1999, 2000), clause iden tification (2001), named entity recognition (2002, 2003), and semantic role labeling (2004, 2005).
			In 2006 the shared task was multilingual dependency parsing, where participants had to train
