 has exactly 1Q12 states, H admits at least one cycle at some state (p1,p'i) labeled with a non-empty input string u2.
    This shows the existence of the factorization above and proves the lemma.
    0 Let TI = (Q1, E, 111F1, Ei, Ai, p1) be a string-to-weight transducer defined on the tropical semirirtg.
    If 7-1 has the twins property then it is determinizable.
    Proof Assume that 7- has the twins property.
    If the determinization algorithm does not halt, there exists at least one subset of 2, {q0, , q&#8222;,}, such that the algorithm generates an infinite number of distinct weighted subsets {(qo, c0), &#8226; &#8226; (q&#8222;&#8222; .
    Then we have necessarily m &gt; 1.
    Indeed, we mentioned previously that in any subset there exists at least one state qi with a residual output c, = 0.
    If the subset contains only one state go, then co = 0.
    So there cannot be an infinite number of distinct subsets { (go, co )} &#8226; Let A C E* be the set of strings w such that the states of 62(i2, w
