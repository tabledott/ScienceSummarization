rser reproduces the same accuracies as reported by both papers.
    In this table, w and p represents the word and POS-tag, respectively.
    For example, S0pN0wp represents the feature template that takes the word and POS-tag of N0, and combines it with the word of S0.
    In this short paper, we extend the baseline feature templates with the following: Distance between S0 and N0 Direction and distance between a pair of head and modifier have been used in the standard feature templates for maximum spanning tree parsing (McDonald et al., 2005).
    Distance information has also been used in the easy-first parser of (Goldberg and Elhadad, 2010).
    For a transition-based parser, direction information is indirectly included in the LeftArc and RightArc actions.
    We add the distance between S0 and N0 to the feature set by combining it with the word and POS-tag of S0 and N0, as shown in Table 2.
    It is worth noticing that the use of distance information in our transition-based model is different from that i
