 is seldom addressed.
  The possible conse- quences of this question for parsing are not fully investi- gated.
  We present how to lexicalize grammars uch as CFGs in a radical way, while possibly keeping the rules in their full generality.
  If one assumes that the input sentence is finite and that it cannot be syntactically infinitely am- biguous, the lexicalization simplifies the task of a parser.
  We say that a grammar formalism is lexicalized if it consists of: ?
  a finite set of structures to be associated with lexical items, which usually will be heads of these structures, ?
  an operation or operations for composing the structures.
  1 The finite set of structures define the domain of locality over which constraints are speci- fied and these are local with respect o their lexical heads.
  Not every grammar formalism in a given form is in a lexicalized form.
  For example, a CFG, in general, will not be in a lexicalized form.
  However, by extending its domain of locality, it can be lexicalized.
