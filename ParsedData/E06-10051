 also tested in the framework of multi-source and speech translation.
    On all tasks and conditions, we achieved significant improvements in translation quality, increasing e. g. the BLEU score by as much as 15% relative.
  
  
    In this work we describe a novel technique for computing a consensus translation from the outputs of multiple machine translation systems.
    Combining outputs from different systems was shown to be quite successful in automatic speech recognition (ASR).
    Voting schemes like the ROVER approach of (Fiscus, 1997) use edit distance alignment and time information to create confusion networks from the output of several ASR systems.
    Some research on multi-engine machine translation has also been performed in recent years.
    The most straightforward approaches simply select, for each sentence, one of the provided hypotheses.
    The selection is made based on the scores of translation, language, and other models (Nomoto, 2004; Paul et al., 2005).
    Other approaches combine l
