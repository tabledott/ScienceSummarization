ed examples, whose production requires a certain kind of expertise and, typically, a substantial commitment of resources.
    In unsupervised learning, model behavior is largely determined by the structure of the model.
    Designing models to exhibit a certain target behavior requires another, rare kind of expertise and effort.
    Unsupervised learning, while minimizing the usage of labeled data, does not necessarily minimize total effort.
    We therefore consider here how to learn models with the least effort.
    In particular, we argue for a certain kind of semi-supervised learning, which we call prototype-driven learning.
    In prototype-driven learning, we specify prototypical examples for each target label or label configuration, but do not necessarily label any documents or sentences.
    For example, when learning a model for Penn treebank-style part-of-speech tagging in English, we may list the 45 target tags and a few examples of each tag (see figure 4 for a concrete prototype list for this task
