e passing accuracy.
    This kind of gradual increase of training data and feature set will be another method for reducing the computational overhead.
  
  
    This paper proposes Japanese dependency analysis based on Support Vector Machines.
    Through the experiments with Japanese bracketed corpus, the proposed method achieves a high accuracy even with a small 3With AlphaServer 8400 (617Mhz), it took 15 days to train with 7958 sentences. training data and outperforms existing methods based on Maximum Entropy Models.
    The result shows that Japanese dependency analysis can be effectively performed by use of SVMs due to its good generalization and nonoverfitting characteristics.
