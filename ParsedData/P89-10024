 to that of Hirsh (1987).
    According to Martin Kay (personal communication), the STREP machine translation project at the Center for the Study of Language and Information uses a version of our algorithm to generate with respect to grammars based on head-driven phrase-structure grammar (HPSG).
    Finally, Calder et al. (1989) report on a generation algorithm for unification categorial grammar that appears to be a special case of ours.
  
  
    Existing generation algorithms have efficiency or termination problems with respect to certain classes of grammars.
    We review the problems of both top-down and bottom-up regimes in this section.
    Consider a naive top-down generation mechanism that takes as input the semantics to generate from and a corresponding syntactic category and builds a complete tree, top-down, left-to-right by applying rules of the grammar nondeterministically to the fringe of the expanding tree.
    This control regime is realized, for instance, when running a DCG &amp;quot;backwards
