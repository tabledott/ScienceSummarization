    The goal of computational modeling of analogy making is to understand how people form complex, structured analogies.
    SME takes representations of a source domain and a target domain and produces an analogical mapping between the source and target.
    The domains are given structured propositional representations, using predicate logic.
    These descriptions include attributes, relations, and higher-order relations (expressing relations between relations).
    The analogical mapping connects source domain relations to target domain relations.
    For example, there is an analogy between the solar system and Rutherford&#8217;s model of the atom (Falkenhainer, Forbus, and Gentner 1989).
    The solar system is the source domain and Rutherford&#8217;s model of the atom is the target domain.
    The basic objects in the source model are the planets and the sun.
    The basic objects in the target model are the electrons and the nucleus.
    The planets and the sun have various attributes, such as mass(
