possibilities.
			In another, more frequently occurring scenario, human annotators have chosen to tag all words in multi word names, such as titles, with the proper-noun tag, NNP (Figure 2b).
			This has the effect of adding noise to the set of tags for many closed-class words.
			Finally, we noticed that a certain number of frequently occurring words (e.g. a, to, of) are sometimes labeled with infrequently occurring tags (e.g. SYM, RB), as exemplified in Figure 2c.
			In the case of the HMM taggers, where we begin with uniform estimates of both the state transition probabilities and the lexical probabilities, the learner finds it difficult to distinguish between more and less probable tag assignments.
			We later discovered that previous implementations of UTBL involved limiting which possible part of speech assignments were placed into the lexicon1, which was not explicitly detailed in the published reports.
			We then simulated, in a similar fashion, the construction of higher quality lexicons by using rel
