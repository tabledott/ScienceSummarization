e, they never conflict.
    For purposes of invoking Pereira's heuristics, the derivation of a parse can be represented as the sequence of S's (Shift) and R's (Reduce) needed to construct the parse's unlabeled bracketing.
    Consider, for example, the choice between two unlabeled bracketings of (2a): There is a shift for each word and a reduce for each right bracket.
    Comparison of the two parses consists simply of pairing the moves in the shiftreduce derivation from left to right.
    Any parse making a shift move that corresponds to a reduce move loses by Right Association.
    Any parse making a reduce move that corresponds to a longer reduce loses by Minimal Attachment.
    In derivation (b) above, the third reduce move builds the constituent a song for Mary from two constituents, while the corresponding reduce in (a) builds sang a song for Mary from three constituents.
    Parse (b) thus loses by Minimal Attachment.
    Questions about the exact nature of parse preferences (and thus about the empiric
