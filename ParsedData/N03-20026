ion (i.e., does not sum to unity).
    Therefore, backoff weight computation can indeed be more expensive for certain g functions, but this appears not to be prohibitive as demonstrated in the next few sections.
  
  
    During the recent 2002 JHU workshop (Kirchhoff et al., 2003), significant extensions were made to the SRI language modeling toolkit (Stolcke, 2002) to support arbitrary FLMs and GPB procedures.
    This uses a graphicalmodel like specification language, and where many different backoff functions (19 in total) were implemented.
    Other features include: 1) all SRILM smoothing methods at every node in a backoff graph; 2) graph level skipping; and 3) up to 32 possible parents (e.g., 33-gram).
    Two of the backoff functions are (in the three parents case): where (call this g2) where N() is the count function.
    Implemented backoff functions include maximum/min (normalized) counts/backoff probabilities, products, sums, mins, maxs, (weighted) averages, and geometric means.
