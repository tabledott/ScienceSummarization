 an influence from the results of BioNLP-ST 2009.
    The last two teams, XABioNLP and HCMUS, who did not use syntactic analyses could not get a performance comparable to the others, which may suggest the importance of using syntactic analyses for a complex IE task like GE task.
  
  
    Table 6 shows the final evaluation results of Task 1.
    For reference, the reported performance of the two systems, UTurku09 and Miwa10 is listed in the top.
    UTurku09 was the winning system of Task 1 in 2009 (Bj&#168;orne et al., 2009), and Miwa10 was the best system reported after BioNLP-ST 2009 (Miwa et al., 2010b).
    Particularly, the latter made an impressive improvement with Binding events (44.41%&#8212;*52.62%).
    The best performance in Task 1 this time is achieved by the FAUST system, which adopts a combination model of UMass and Stanford.
    Its performance on the abstract collection, 56.04%, demonstrates a significant improvement of the community in the repeated GE task, when compared to both UTurku09, 5
