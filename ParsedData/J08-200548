  Note that because each verb is processed independently, a sentence is processed once for each verb in the sentence.
  Therefore, the words and constituents in each sentence are counted as many times as the number of verbs to be processed.
  As before, in order to compare the systems that use full parsing and shallow parsing information, we need to see the impact on the overall performance.
  There- fore, we built two semantic role systems based on full parsing
