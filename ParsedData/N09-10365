    This section informally introduces adaptor grammars using unsupervised word segmentation as a motivating application; see Johnson et al. (2007b) for a formal definition of adaptor grammars.
    Consider the problem of learning language from continuous speech: segmenting each utterance into words is a nontrivial problem that language learners must solve.
    Elman (1990) introduced an idealized version of this task, and Brent and Cartwright (1996) presented a version of it where the data consists of unsegmented phonemic representations of the sentences in the Bernstein-Ratner corpus of child-directed speech (Bernstein-Ratner, 1987).
    Because these phonemic representations are obtained by looking up orthographic forms in a pronouncing dictionary and appending the results, identifying the word tokens is equivalent to finding the locations of the word boundaries.
    For example, the phoneme string corresponding to &#8220;you w
