f the tree T in Figure 1 is: S ~ ASB --% aSB --h aABB --% aaBB -% aabB -A aabb (2) where the rule used to expand the i-th node of the tree is denoted by ri.
  Note that we have indexed the non- terminal (NT) nodes of the tree with this leftmost order.
  We denote by t~ the sentential form obtained just before we expand node i.
  Hence, t~ corresponds to the senten- tial form aSB or equivalently to the string rlr2.
  In a leftmost derivation we produce the words in left-to-right order.
  Using the one-to-one correspondence b tween leftmost derivations and parse trees, we can rewrite the joint S ~ ASBIAB A ~ a B ~ b a a b b Figure i: Grammar and parse tree for aabb.
  probability in (1) as: p(T, w~) = ~IP(r~]tf-) i=1 In a probabilistic ontext-free grammar (P-CFG), the probability of an expansion at node i depends only on the identity of the non-terminal N~, i.e., p(ri ITS-) -- p(r~).
  Thus p(T, w~) = l~P( r , ) i----1 So in P-CFG the derivation order does not affect the probabilistic model 1.
