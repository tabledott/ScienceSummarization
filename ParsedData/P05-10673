and some versions of synchronous grammars provide solutions for the non-isomorphic tree based transduction problem and hence possible solutions for MT.
    Synchronous Tree Adjoining Grammars, proposed by (Shieber and Schabes, 1990), were introduced primarily for semantics but were later also proposed for translation.
    Eisner (2003) proposed viewing the MT problem as a probabilistic synchronous tree substitution grammar parsing problem.
    Melamed (2003, 2004) formalized the MT problem as synchronous parsing based on multitext grammars.
    Graehl and Knight (2004) defined training and decoding algorithms for both generalized tree-to-tree and tree-to-string transducers.
    All these approaches, though different in formalism, model the two languages using tree-based transduction rules or a synchronous grammar, possibly probabilistic, and using multi-lemma elementary structures as atomic units.
    The machine translation is done either as a stochastic tree-to-tree transduction or a synchronous parsing pro
