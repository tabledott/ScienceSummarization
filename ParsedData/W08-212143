the semantic subtask measured as the ratio of the labeled F1 score and LAS.
    As previously mentioned, this score estimates the performance of the SRL component independent of the performance of the syntactic parser.
    This analysis is not a substitute for the actual experiment where the SRL components are evaluated using correct syntactic information but, nevertheless, it indicates several interesting facts.
    First, the ranking of the top three systems in Table 10 changes: the system of Che et al. (2008) is now ranked first, and the system of Johansson and Nugues (2008) is second.
    This shows that Che et al. have a relatively stronger SRL component, whereas Johansson and Nugues developed a better parser.
    Second, several other systems improved their ranking compared to Table 10: e.g., chen from position thirteenth to ninth and choi from sixteenth to eighth.
    This indicates that these systems were penalized in the official ranking mainly due to the relative poor performance of their parsers.
