    Using less simplification, the probability of generating the five children of Figure 9 is now 21 Originally, we had an additional mechanism that attempted to generate punctuation and conjunctions with conditional independence.
    One of our reviewers astutely pointed out that the mechanism led to a deficient model (the very thing we have been trying to avoid), and so we have subsequently removed it from our model.
    The removal leads to a 0.05% absolute reduction in F-measure (which in this case is also a 0.05% relative increase in error) on sentences of length &#8804; 40 words in Section 00 of the Penn Treebank.
    As this difference is not at all statistically significant (according to a randomized stratified shuffling test [Cohen 1995]), all evaluations reported in this article are with the original model.
    As shown in Section 8.1, this new parameterization yields virtually identical performance to that of the Collins model.22 As we have already seen, there are several ways in which base NPs are
