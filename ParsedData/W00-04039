is the sentence number within the cluster.
    INPUT: Cluster of d documents 3 with n sentences (compression rate = r) 3 Note that currently, MEAD requires that sentence boundaries be marked.
    The system performance S is one of the numbers6 described in the previous subsection.
    For {13), the value of S is 0.627 (which is lower than random).
    For {14}, S is 0.833, which is between R and J.
    In the example, only two of the six possible sentence selections, {14) and {24} are between R and J.
    Three others, {13}, (231, and {34) are below R. while {12} is better than J.
    To restrict system performance (mostly) between 0 and I, we use a mapping between R and J in such a way that when S = R, the normalized system performance, D, is equal to 0 and when S = J, D becomes I.
    The corresponding linear function7 is: Figure 2 shows the mapping &#8226;between system performance S on the left (a) and normalized system performance D on the right (b).
    A small part of the 0I segment is mapped to the en
