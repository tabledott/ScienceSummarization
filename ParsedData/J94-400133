: 'PARA' is the CS node, and the nodes accompanying '&lt;P&gt;' are the root nodes of the dependency trees for conjuncts).
    Next, the pre- and post-conjuncts [HYOUDAI(a title)/ &#8212;SAI-HENSEI-SHI(be reorganized),]- [SAKUIN-NO(of an index).
    &#8226; &#8226;KIROKU-SHITE-OKU(be recorded).] are analyzed and transformed into dependency trees, and another CS node is created (Figure 12b).
    Finally, the whole sentence is analyzed, and its dependency tree is obtained.
    Our method of detecting a CS cannot find where the pre-conjunct begins with complete certainty.
    For this reason, it is necessary to check whether some modifiers' (bunsetsus) to the left of the detected SB can be included in the CS in the stage of dependency analysis.
    This left-side extension is performed only on CSs containing PBs.
    This is because modifiers to the left of a CS containing no PB rarely depend on the preconjunct alone; usually they depend on the entire CS (this head-dependent relation is handled as the relation t
