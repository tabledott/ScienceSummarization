    To translate a source sentence, we first employ a parser to produce a source parse tree and then apply TATs to transform the tree into a target string.
    One advantage of our model is that TATs can be automatically acquired to capture linguistically motivated reordering at both low (word) and high (phrase, clause) levels.
    In addition, the training of TAT-based model is less computationally expensive than tree-to-tree models.
    Similarly to (Galley et al., 2004), the tree-to-string alignment templates discussed in this paper are actually transformation rules.
    The major difference is that we model the syntax of the source language instead of the target side.
    As a result, the task of our decoder is to find the best target string while Galley&#8217;s is to seek the most likely target tree.
  
  
    A tree-to-string alignment template z is a triple T, 5, A), which describes the alignment A between a source parse tree T = T(FJ' 1 ) 2 and a target string 5 = E&#65533;' is also comp
