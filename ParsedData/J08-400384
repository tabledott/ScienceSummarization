h the stack-based algorithm, which again shows that there is no straightforward correspondence between learning time and parsing time.
    Perhaps the most interesting result of all, as far as efficiency is concerned, is to be found in the often dramatic differences in parsing time between the strictly projective parsers and their pseudo-projective counterparts.
    Although we did not see any clear effect of the increased number of classes, hence classifiers, on learning time earlier, it is quite clear that there is a noticeable effect on parsing time, with the pseudo-projective parsers always being substantially slower.
    In fact, in some cases the pseudo-projective parsers are also slower than the non-projective list-based parser, despite the difference in time complexity that exists at least for the stack-based parsers.
    This result holds on average over all languages and for five out of thirteen of the individual languages and shows that the advantage of linear-time parsing complexity (for the stack
