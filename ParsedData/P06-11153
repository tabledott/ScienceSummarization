 whose semantic analysis is equivalent to fill ing a single semantic frame (Miller et al, 1996; Popescu et al, 2004).
			In this paper, we have tested KRISP on two real-world domains in which meaning representations are more complex withricher predicates and nested structures.
			Our experiments demonstrate that KRISP compares favor 913 NL: ?If the ball is in our goal area then our player 1 should intercept it.?

			We call the process of mapping natural language (NL) utterances into their computer-executablemeaning representations (MRs) as semantic pars ing.
			These MRs are expressed in formal languages which we call meaning representation languages(MRLs).
			We assume that all MRLs have deter ministic context free grammars, which is true for almost all computer languages.
			This ensures thatevery MR will have a unique parse
