  vieS[tense:] I I John t r ies Figure 6: Illustration of implementation f SA and QA constraints gorizes for an untensed sentence (or an infinitival clause) can be adjoined at the root node of this initial tree.
  This shows why only auxiliary tree such as fl can be adjoined, whereas an auxiliary tree corresponding to John thinks S can not be adjoined since the verb thinks subcategories for a tensed sentence.
  The example also serves to illustrate the implementa- tion of OA constraint at the root of a, since the t and b feature structures for this node are not unifiable.
  2.2.1 Comments  on the Imp lementat ion  f Constraints in FTAG In the TAG formalism, local constraints are specified by enumeration.
  However, specification by enumeration is not a linguistically attractive solution.
  In FTAG we associate with each node two feature structures which are declarations of linguistic facts about the node.
