sign no answer (equivalently, if both provide an 2 label).
    All the differences between Lesk and SSI are statistically significant (p &lt; 0.01).
    As a second experiment, we used two information-theoretic measures, namely entropy and purity (Zhao and Karypis, 2004), to compare an automatic clustering c(w) (i.e. the sense groups acquired for word w) with a manual clustering &#710;c(w).
    The entropy quantifies the distribution of the senses of a group over manually-defined groups, while the purity measures the extent to which a group contains senses primarily from one manual group.
    Given a word w, and a sense group G E c(w), the entropy of G is defined as: i.e., the entropy4 of the distribution of senses of group G over the groups of the manual clustering &#710;c(w).
    The entropy of an entire clustering c(w) is defined as: that is, the entropy of each group weighted by its size.
    The purity of a sense group G E c(w) is defined as: i.e., the normalized size of the largest subset of G contained
