 a detailed analysis of various design decisions of our statistical alignment system and evaluate these on training corpora of various sizes.
    An important result is that refined alignment models with a first-order dependence and a fertility model yield significantly better results than simple heuristic models.
    In the Appendix, we present an efficient training algorithm for the alignment models presented.
  
  
    We address in this article the problem of finding the word alignment of a bilingual sentence-aligned corpus by using language-independent statistical methods.
    There is a vast literature on this topic, and many different systems have been suggested to solve this problem.
    Our work follows and extends the methods introduced by Brown, Della Pietra, Della Pietra, and Mercer (1993) by using refined statistical models for the translation process.
    The basic idea of this approach is to develop a model of the translation process with the word alignment as a hidden variable of this process,
