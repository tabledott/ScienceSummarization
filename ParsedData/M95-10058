 is in the same key set.
  Once again, we proceed by generating a relative partition, in this case the partition of the response equivalence class S relative to key equivalence classes K1 .
  Elements of the response that are not found in the key once again generate implicit subsets, one per element.
  The number of missing elements is once again 1 less than the size of the partition .
  For the example above, we see that the response generates an equivalence class of size 3 , namely the set S = {A B C) .
  The key partitions this class into subsets {B C) and {A) , where the latter is implicit .
  The partition is of size 2, and so the minimal number of links that need to be added to reunite the partition is just 1 .
  Switching the figure and ground in the recall formula, the scoring arithmetic for precisio n works itself out as follows, where S is now an equivalence class from the response, an d p(S) is the partition of S vis-a-vis the key(s) .
  We then have : c(S) = (ISI ?
