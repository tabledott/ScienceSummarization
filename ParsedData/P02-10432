			This results in a smaller and less overgenerating grammar than standard PCFGs (ca.3,000 rules when instantiated with the above cate gories in sections 02-21, instead of &gt;12,400 in the original Treebank representation (Collins, 1999)).
	
	
			Since CCG produces unary and binary branching trees with a very fine-grained category set, CCG Parseval scores cannot be compared with scores of standard Treebank parsers.
			Therefore, we alsoevaluate performance using a dependency evaluation reported by Collins (1999), which counts word word dependencies as determined by local trees and their labels.
			According to this metric, a local tree with parent node P, head daughter H and non-head daughter S (and position of S relative to P, ie.
			leftor right, which is implicit in CCG categories) de fines a hP;H;Si dependency between the head word of S, wS, and the head word of H , wH.
			This measureis neutral with respect to the branching factor.
			Fur thermore, as noted by Hockenmaier (2001), it doesnot penaliz
