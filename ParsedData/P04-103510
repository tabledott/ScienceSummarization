    Each default documentlevel polarity classifier is trained and tested on the extracts formed by applying one of the sentencelevel subjectivity detectors to reviews in the polarity dataset.
    Subjectivity dataset To train our detectors, we need a collection of labeled sentences.
    Riloff and Wiebe (2003) state that &#8220;It is [very hard] to obtain collections of individual sentences that can be easily identified as subjective or objective&#8221;; the polarity-dataset sentences, for example, have not been so annotated.5 Fortunately, we were able to mine the Web to create a large, automaticallylabeled sentence corpus6.
    To gather subjective sentences (or phrases), we collected 5000 moviereview snippets (e.g., &#8220;bold, imaginative, and impossible to resist&#8221;) from www.rottentomatoes.com.
    To obtain (mostly) objective data, we took 5000 sentences from plot summaries available from the Internet Movie Database (www.imdb.com).
