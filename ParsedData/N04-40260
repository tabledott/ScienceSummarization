    The segmentation model uses a novel orientation component to handle swapping of neighbor blocks.
    During training, we collect block uncounts with we count how often a block occurs to the left or to the right of some predecessor block.
    The orientation model is shown to improve translation performance over two models: 1) no block re-ordering is used, and 2) the block swapping is controlled only by a language model.
    We show experimental results on a standard Arabic-English translation task.
