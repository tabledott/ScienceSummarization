erformance unattainable by statistically trained word- specific models.
  These advances are not without cost, as class-based models have diluted discriminating power and may not capture highly indicative collocations specific to only one word.
  Despite the inherent handicaps, the system performs better than several previous approaches, based on a direct comparison of results for the same words.
