mation in a collocation, we treat a collocation (head type modifier) as the conjunction of three events: The mutual information of a collocation is the logarithm of the ratio between the probability of the collocation and the probability of events A, B, and C co-occur if we assume B and C are conditionally independent given A: d type modifierlxl* type * = l og( I \ pe *Ixl* type modifier')
