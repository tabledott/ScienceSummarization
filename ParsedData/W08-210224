    &#8220;speed&#8221;: parsing time in min:sec for the TAG-based model (this figure does not include the time taken to calculate the marginals using the lower-order model); &#8220;F1&#8221;: score of predicted constituents. dictionary listing the spines that have been seen with this POS tag in training data; during parsing we only allow spines that are compatible with this dictionary.
    (For test or development data, we used the part-of-speech tags generated by the parser of (Collins, 1997).
    Future work should consider incorporating the tagging step within the model; it is not challenging to extend the model in this way.)
  
  
    Sections 2-21 of the Penn Wall Street Journal treebank were used as training data in our experiments, and section 22 was used as a development set.
    Sections 23 and 24 were used as test sets.
    The model was trained for 20 epochs with the averaged perceptron algorithm, with the development data performance being used to choose the best epoch.
