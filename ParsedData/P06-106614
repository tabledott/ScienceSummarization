rner.
    Each corner has four links in four directions: topright, topleft, bottomright, bottomleft, and each link links a set of blocks which have the corner as their vertex.
    The topright and bottomleft link blocks with the straight order, so we call them STRAIGHT links.
    Similarly, we call the topleft and bottomright INVERTED links since they link blocks with the inverted order.
    For convenience, we use b &#8592;&#65533; Z&#10003; to denote that block b is linked by the link Z.
    Note that the STRAIGHT links can not coexist with the INVERTED links.
    These definitions are illustrated in Figure 1.
    The reordering example extraction algorithm is shown in Figure 2.
    The basic idea behind this algorithm is to register all neighbor blocks to the associated links of corners which are shared by them.
    To do this, we keep an array to record link information of corners when extracting blocks.
    Line 4 and 5 are similar to the phrase extraction algorithm by Och (2003b).
