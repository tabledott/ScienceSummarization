ced from 4% to 0.7%.
    There were more errors on the English&#8212;French subcorpus than on the English&#8212;German subcorpus, showing that error rates will depend on the corpus considered; however, both were small enough to hope that the method will be useful for many language pairs.
    To further research on bilingual corpora, a much larger sample of Canadian Hansards (approximately 90 million words, half in English and and half in French) has been aligned with the align program and will be available through the Data Collection Initiative of the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL/DCI).
    In addition, in order to facilitate replication of the align program, an appendix is provided with detailed c-code of the more difficult core of the align program.
  
  
    Researchers in both machine translation (e.g., Brown et al. 1990) and bilingual lexicography (e.g., Klavans and Tzoukermann 1990) have recently become interested in studying bilingual corpora, bodies of text such as the Canadian Hansar
