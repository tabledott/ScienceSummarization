is skip-bigram-based F-measure (0 = 1) with maximum skip distance of N, PER is position independent word error rate, and WER is word error rate.
    GTM 10, 20, and 30 are general text matcher with exponents of 1.0, 2.0, and 3.0.
    (Note, only BLEU1, 4, and 12 are shown here to preserve space.) limit and with skip distant limits of 0, 4, and 9.
    Correlation analysis based on two different correlation statistics, Pearson&#8217;s p and Spearman&#8217;s p, with respect to adequacy and fluency are shown in Table 1.
    The Pearson&#8217;s correlation coefficient5 measures the strength and direction of a linear relationship between any two variables, i.e. automatic metric score and human assigned mean coverage score in our case.
    It ranges from +1 to -1.
    A correlation of 1 means that there is a perfect positive linear relationship between the two variables, a correlation of -1 means that there is a perfect negative linear relationship between them, and a correlation of 0 means that there is no linear r
