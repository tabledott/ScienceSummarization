, distributional synonyms, etc.
    ), we would like to test if the modelling of semantic compositionality is able to produce predictions that are as similar as possible to the originally observed data.
    A very desirable result would be if any predicted compositional A-N vector could be reliably used instead of the extracted bigram.
    This could only be achieved if a model&#8217;s predictions show a similar distributional behaviour with respect to the observed vector.
    To test this idea using our data, we took the 10 nearest neighbours of each of the observed AN pairs in the test set as gold standard.
    These gold neighbours were extracted from the observation testing subspace, thus excluding any modelled predictions.
    This is a very restrictive setting: it means that the gold standard for each of the 380 test items is composed of the 10 nearest neighbours from the same 380 items (which may turn out to be not very close at all).
    We then extracted the 10 nearest neighbours for each of the thre
