ure is then generalized using the POS tag of the head (as previously described).
    Third, there are features which encode rule instantiations&#8212;local trees consisting of a parent and one or two children&#8212;in the derivation.
    The first set of rule features encode the combining categories and the result category; the second set of features extend the first by also encoding the head of the result category; and the third set generalizes the second using POS tags.
    Table 1 gives an example for each of these feature types.
    The dependency model also has CCG predicate&#8211;argument dependencies as features, defined as 5-tuples as in Section 3.4.
    In addition these features are generalized in three ways using POS tags, with the word&#8211;word pair replaced with word&#8211;POS, POS&#8211;word, and POS&#8211;POS.
    Table 2 gives some examples.
    We extend the dependency features further by adding distance information.
    The distance features encode the dependency relation and the word asso
