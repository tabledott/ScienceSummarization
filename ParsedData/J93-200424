initial parse of the material.
  Annotators then hand correct he parsers output using a mouse-based interface implemented in GNU Emacs Lisp.
  Fidditch has three properties that make it ideally suited to serve as a preprocessor to hand correction: ?
  Fidditch always provides exactly one analysis for any given sentence, so that annotators need not search through multiple analyses.
  Fidditch never attaches any constituent whose role in the larger structure it cannot determine with certainty.
  In cases of uncertainty, Fidditch chunks the input into a string of trees, providing only a partial structure for each sentence.
  Fidditch has rather good grammatical coverage, so that the grammatical chunks that it does build are usually quite accurate.
  Because of these properties, annotators do not need to rebracket much of the parsers output--a relatively time-consuming task.
  Rather, the annotators main task is to "glue" together the syntactic hunks produced by the parser.
  Using a mouse-based interface, annota
