field indicating prosodic phrases with sentence-final contours, and the second field indicating phrase-final contours.2 Line spaces between prosodic phrases represent potential boundary sites.
    Note that a majority of subjects agreed on only 2 of the 11 possible boundary sites: after 3.3 (n=6) and after 8.4 (n=7).
    (The symbols NP, CUE and PAUSE will be explained later.)
    Figure 2 typifies our results.
    Agreement among subjects was far from perfect, as shown by the presence here of 4 boundary sites identified by only 1 or 2 subjects.
    Nevertheless, as we show in the following sections, the degree of agreement among subjects is high enough to demonstrate that segments can be reliably identified.
    In the next section we discuss the percent agreement among subjects.
    In the subsequent section we show that the frequency of boundary sites where a majority of subjects assign a boundary is highly significant.
  
  
    We measure the ability of subjects to agree with one another, using a figure
