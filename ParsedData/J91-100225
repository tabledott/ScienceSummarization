ated to words c and d?
    Consider this chain: {cow, sheep, wool, scarf, boots, hat, snow} .
    If unlimited transitivity were allowed, then cow and snow would be considered related, which is definitely counter intuitive.
    Our intuition was to allow one transitive link: word a is related to word c but not to word d. It seemed that two or more transitive links would so severely weaken the word relationship as to cause it to be nonintuitive.
    Our analysis of our sample texts supported this.
    To summarize, a transitivity of one link is sufficient to successfully compute the intuitive chains.
    An automated system could be used to test this out extensively, varying the number of transitive links and calculating the consequences.
    It is likely that it varies slightly with respect to style, author, or type of text.
    There are two ways in which a transitive relation involving one link can cause two words to be related.
    In the first way, if word a is related to word b, and word b is related to
