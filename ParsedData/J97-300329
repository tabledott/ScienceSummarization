task.
    For example, suppose that a word can take on one or more PUS-tags from the set of open-class POS-tags: (JJ NN NNS RB VB VBD VBG VBN VBZ).
    To see how well the guesser performs, we can compare the results of the guessing with the PUS-tags known to be true for the word (i.e., listed in the lexicon).
    Let us take, for instance, a lexicon entry [developed (JJ VBD VBN)].
    Suppose that the guesser categorized it as [developed (JJ NN RB VBD VBZ)].
    We can represent this situation as in Figure 2.
    The performance of the guesser can be measured in: The interpretation of these percentages is by no means straightforward, as there is no straightforward way of combining these different measures into a single one.
    For example, these measures assume that all combinations of Pips-tags will be equally hard to disambiguate for the tagger, which is not necessarily the case.
    Obviously, the most important measure is recall since we want all possible categories for a word to be guessed.
