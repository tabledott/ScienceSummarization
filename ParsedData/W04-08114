mputed a baseline of 60.9% precision and recall by using the first WordNet entry for the given word and part-of-speech.
    Bart Decadt, of the University of Antwerp and submitter of the GAMBL-AW system, provided a baseline of 62.4% using the same method (the 1.5% difference is most likely explained by how well the baseline systems dealt with multi-word constructions and hyphenated words).
  
  
    As with the SENSEVAL-2 English all-words task, the supervised systems fared much better than the unsupervised systems (Palmer et al., 2001).
    In fact, all of the seven systems reported as supervised scored higher than any of the nine systems reported as unsupervised in both precision and recall (using either of the two scoring criteria).
    The greatest difference between these results and those of the SENSEVAL-2 English all-words task is that a greater number of systems have now achieved scores at or above the baseline.
    While this result is encouraging, it seems that the best systems have a hit a wall in
