for the interested reader, we do include a relatively comprehensive list of references in this section for the work that is excluded from the survey.
    For one, we do not discuss paraphrasing techniques that rely primarily on knowledge-based resources such as dictionaries (Wallis 1993; Fujita et al. 2004), handwritten rules (Fujita et al.
    2007), and formal grammars (McKeown 1979; Dras 1999; Gardent, Amoia, and Jacquey 2004; Gardent and Kow 2005).
    We also refrain from discussing work on purely lexical paraphrasing which usually comprises various ways to cluster words occurring in similar contexts (Inoue 1991; Crouch and Yang 1992; Pereira, Tishby, and Lee 1993; Grefenstette 1994; Lin 1998; Gasperin et al. 2001; Glickman and Dagan 2003; Shimohata and Sumita 2005).1 Exclusion of general lexical paraphrasing methods obviously implies that other lexical methods developed just for specific applications are also excluded (Bangalore and Rambow 2000; Duclaye, Yvon, and Collin 2003; Murakami and Nasukawa 2004
