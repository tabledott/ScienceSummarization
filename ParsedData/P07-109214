    These bitexts were used for direct translation and triangulation.
    All experimental results were evaluated on the ACL/WMT 20053 set of 2,000 sentences, and are reported in BLEU percentage-points.
    Decoding Pharaoh (Koehn, 2003), a beamsearch decoder, was used to maximise: where T and S denote a target and source sentence respectively.
    The parameters, Aj, were trained using minimum error rate training (Och, 2003) to maximise the BLEU score (Papineni et al., 2002) on a 150 sentence development set.
    We used a standard set of features, comprising a 4-gram language model, distance based distortion model, forward and backward translation probabilities, forward and backward lexical translation scores and the phraseand word-counts.
    The translation models and lexical scores were estimated on the training corpus which was automatically aligned using Giza++ (Och et al., 1999) in both directions between source and target and symmetrised using the growing heuristic (Koehn et al., 2003).
