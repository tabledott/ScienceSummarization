ng rule: Here CSFi (1 &lt;_ i &lt;_ 4 ) is the set of antecedent candidates with the feature Fi on.
    The mark of &#8220;&gt;&gt;&#8221; denotes the preference relationship, that is, the candidates in CSF1 is preferred to those in CSF2, and to those in CSF3 and CSF4.
    Let CF2 and CF3 denote the class value of a leaf node &#8220;F2 = 1&#8221; and &#8220;F3 = 1&#8221;, respectively.
    It is possible that CF2 &lt; CF3, if the anaphors whose candidates all belong to CSF3 or CSF4 take the majority in the training data set.
    In this case, a candidate in CSF3 would be assigned a larger confidence value than a candidate in CSF2.
    This nevertheless contradicts the ranking rules.
    If during resolution, the candidates of an anaphor all come from CSF2 or CSF3, the anaphor may be wrongly linked to a candidate in CSF3 rather than in CSF2.
  
  
    Different from the single-candidate model, the twin-candidate model aims to learn the competition criterion for candidates.
    In this section, we will introduc
