odel using local features estimates the feature weights only using the top n consistent assignments, thus making the labels of different nodes non-independent according to the estimation procedure, which may be a cause of the improved performance.
    Another factor could be that the model JOINTLOCAL is a combination of two models as specified in Equation (4), which may lead to gains (as is usual for classifier combination).
    The label sequence features added in Model LABELSEQ result in another 1.5 points jump in F-Measure on all arguments.
    An additional .8 gain results from the inclusion of syntactic&#8211;semantic and repetition features.
    The error reduction of model ALLJOINT Performance of local and joint models on ID&amp;CLS on Section 23, using gold-standard parse trees.
    The number of features of each model is shown in thousands. over the local model is 36.8% in CORE arguments F-Measure, 33.3% in CORE arguments whole frame accuracy, 24.1% in ALL arguments F-Measure, and 21.7% in ALL argume
