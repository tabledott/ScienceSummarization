rary theory and linguistics, most directly Dole&#728;zel (1973), Uspensky (1973), Kuroda (1973, 1976), Chatman (1978), Cohn (1978), Fodor (1979), and Banfield (1982).
    We also mentioned existing knowledge resources such as affective lexicons (General-Inquirer 2000; Heise 2000) and annotations in more general-purpose lexicons (e.g., the attitude adverb features in Comlex [Macleod, Grishman, and Meyers 1998]).
    Such knowledge may be used in future work to complement the work presented in this article, for example, to seed the distributional-similarity process described in Section 3.4.
    There is also work in fields such as content analysis and psychology on statistically characterizing texts in terms of word lists manually developed for distinctions related to subjectivity.
    For example, Hart (1984) performs counts on a manually developed list of words and rhetorical devices (e.g., &#8220;sacred&#8221; terms such as freedom) in political speeches to explore potential reasons for public reactions.
