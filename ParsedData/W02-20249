urse principle.
    The authors expect a performance increase when the system has access to external entity lists but have not presented the results of this in detail (Spanish test set: F,3=1=77.15; Dutch test set: F/3=1=72.31).
    Wu, Ngai, Carpuat, Larsen and Yang (2002) have applied AdaBoost.MH to the shared task data and compared the performance with that of a maximum entropy-based named entity tagger.
    Their system used lexical and part-of-speech information, contextual and word-internal clues, capitalization information, knowledge about entity classes of previous occurrences of words and a small external list of named entity words.
    The boosting techniques operated on decision stumps, decision trees of depth one.
    They outperformed the maximum entropy-based named entity tagger (Spanish test set: F,3=1=76.61; Dutch test set: F,3=1=75.36).
    Florian (2002) employed three stacked learners for named entity recognition: transformation-based learning for obtaining base-level non-typed named entiti
