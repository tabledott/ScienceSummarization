ple, the ten most similar nouns to treaty in his corpus are agreement, plan, constitution, contract, proposal, accord, amendment, rule, law, and legislation.
    This work is very close in spirit to our own investigation here; the emphasis on syntactic co-occurrence enables Hindle to extract his similarity lists automatically; they are therefore easy to compile for different corpora, different sublanguages, etc.
    Here we are attempting to use these techniques together with a model of lexical meaning, to capture deeper lexical semantic collocations; e.g., the generalization that the list of objects occurring for the word drink contains only liquids.
    In the final part of this section, we turn to how the analysis of corpora can provide lexical semantic preferences for verb selection.
    As discussed above, there is a growing body of research on deriving collocations from corpora (cf.
