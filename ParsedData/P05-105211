) and the GLARF (Meyers et al., 2001) dependency analyzer produced by NYU.
    Based on treebank parsing, GLARF produces labeled deep dependencies between words (syntactic relations such as logical subject and logical object).
    It handles linguistic phenomena like passives, relatives, reduced relatives, conjunctions, etc.
    That's because Israel was expected to retaliate against Hezbollah forces in areas controlled by Syrian troops.
  
  
    In our model, kernels incorporate information from tokenization, parsing and deep dependency analysis.
    A relation candidate R is defined as where arg1 and arg2 are the two entity arguments which may be related; seq=(t1, t2, ..., tn) is a token vector that covers the arguments and intervening words; link=(t1, t2, ..., tm) is also a token vector, generated from seq and the parse tree; path is a dependency path connecting arg1 and arg2 in the dependency graph produced by GLARF. path can be empty if no such dependency path exists.
    The difference between link and
