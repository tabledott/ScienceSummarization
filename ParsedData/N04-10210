  A Smorgasbord Of Features For Statistical Machine Translation
  
    We describe a methodology for rapid experimentation in statistical machine translation which we use to add a large number of features to a baseline system exploiting features from a wide range of levels of syntactic representation.
    Feature values were combined in a log-linear model to select the highest scoring candidate from an list.
    Feature weights were optimized directly against the BLEU evaluation metric on held-out data.
    We present results for a small selection of features at each level of syntactic representation.
  
  
    Despite the enormous progress in machine translation (MT) due to the use of statistical techniques in recent years, state-of-the-art statistical systems often produce translations with obvious errors.
    Grammatical errors include lack of a main verb, wrong word order, and wrong choice of function words.
    Frequent problems of a less grammatical nature include missing content words and incorrect pu
