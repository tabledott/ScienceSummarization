e set of category labels that span from position i to position j in the input sentence.
    This is accomplished by finding a position k between i and j such that there is a phrase from i to k that can combine with another phrase from k to j.
    An implementation of the inner loop looks something like: Essentially, then, a chart parser is maintaining the invariant where addition and multiplication of matrix elements is related to parallel and series combination.
    Thus chart parsers are able to process very ambiguous sentences in polynomial time, as opposed to exponential (or Catalan) time.
    However, the examples above illustrate cases where chart parsers are not as efficient as they might be.
    In particular, chart parsers implement convolution the &amp;quot;long way,&amp;quot; by picking each possible dividing point k, and parsing from i to k and from k to j; they do not reduce the convolution of two Catalans as we did above.
    Similarly, chart parsers do not make use of the &amp;quot;every way am
