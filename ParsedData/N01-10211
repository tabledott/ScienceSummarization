proposed here observes three principles.
    Principle 1 The relation between the parser and grammar is one of strong competence.
    Strong competence holds that the human sentence processing mechanism directly uses rules of grammar in its operation, and that a bare minimum of extragrammatical machinery is necessary.
    This hypothesis, originally proposed by Chomsky (Chomsky, 1965, page 9) has been pursued by many researchers (Bresnan, 1982) (Stabler, 1991) (Steedman, 1992) (Shieber and Johnson, 1993), and stands in contrast with an approach directed towards the discovery of autonomous principles unique to the processing mechanism.
    Principle 2 Frequency affects performance.
    The explanatory success of neural network and constraint-based lexicalist theories (McClelland and St. John, 1989) (MacDonald et al., 1994) (Taboret al., 1997) suggests a statistical theory of language performance.
    The present work adopts a numerical view of competition in grammar that is grounded in probability.
