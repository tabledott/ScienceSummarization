    The semi-supervised learning literature generally addresses augmenting supervised learning tasks with unlabeled data (Seeger, 2000).
    In contrast, we augmented an unsupervised learning task with labeled data.
    We hope that Minimum Error / Maximum Likelihood training using the EMD algorithm can be used for a wide diversity of tasks where there is not enough labeled data to allow supervised estimation of an initial model of reasonable quality.
