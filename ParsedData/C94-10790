	PRINCIPAR - An Efficient Broad-Coverage Principle-Based Parser
		We present an efI\]cient, broad-coverage, principle-based parser for English.
		The parser has been implemented in C++ and runs on SUN Sparcstations with X-windows.
		It con- rains a lexicon with over 90,000 entries, con- structed automatically b applying a set of ex- traction and conversion rules to entries from machine readable dictionaries.
	
	
			Principle-based grammars, such as Govern- ment-Binding (GB) theory (Chomsky, 1981; Haegeman, 1991), offer many advantages over rule-based and unification-based grammars, such as the universality ofprinciples and mod- ularity of components in the grammar.
			Prin- ciples are constraints over X-bar structures.
			Most previous principle-based parsers, e.g., (Dorr, 1991; Font, 1991; Johnson, 1991), es- sentially generate all possible X-bar structures of a sentence and then use the principles to fil- ter out the illicit ones.
			The drawback of this approach is the inefficiency due 1;o the large numbe
