he remaining 9 nouns that have different predominant senses in the BC and WSJ data are: center, field, figure, interest, line, need, order, term, value.
    The row 9 nouns in Table 1 gives some information for this set of 9 nouns.
    To gauge the utility of this approach, we conduct experiments on these nouns by first assuming that we know the true predominant sense in the WSJ data.
    Assume that the WSJ predominant sense of a noun is sz and sz has nz examples in the BC data.
    We then gather BC examples for a noun to adhere to this WSJ predominant sense, by gathering only up to nz BC examples for each sense of this noun.
    This approach gives an average of 190 BC examples for the 9 nouns.
    This is higher than an average of 83 BC examples for these 9 nouns if BC examples are selected to follow the sense priors of WSJ evaluation data as described in the last subsection 6.2.
    For these 9 nouns, the average KL-divergence between the sense priors of the original BC data and WSJ evaluation data is 0.
