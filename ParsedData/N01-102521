no room for applying the voting schemes because of some real-world constraints (limited computation and memory capacity), the use of VC bound may allow to obtain the best accuracy.
    On the other hand, we find that the prediction ability of Leave-One-Out is worse than that of VC bound.
    Cross validation is the standard method to estimate the voting weights for different systems.
    However, Cross validation requires a larger amount of computational overhead as the training data is divided and is repeatedly used to obtain the voting weights.
    We believe that VC bound is more effective than Cross validation, since it can obtain the comparable results to Cross validation without increasing computational overhead.
    Tjong Kim Sang et al. report that they achieve accuracy of 93.86 for baseNP-S data set, and 94.90 for baseNP-L data set.
    They apply weighted voting of the systems which are trained using distinct chunk representations and different machine learning algorithms such as MBL, ME and IGTree(
