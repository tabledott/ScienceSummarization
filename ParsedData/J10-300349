tes for clusters of articles on the same topic.
    Such clusters contain the full text of each article and the dates and times of publication.
    After removing the mark-up, the authors discard any pair of sentences in a cluster where the difference in the lengths or the edit distance is larger than some stipulated value.
    This method yields a corpus containing approximately 140, 000 quasi-parallel sentence pairs {(E1, E2)}, where E1 = e11e21 ... em1 , E2 = e12e22 ... en2.
    The following examples show that the proposed method can work well: For more details on the creation of this corpus, we refer the reader to Dolan, Quirk, and Brockett (2004) and, more specifically, to Section 4.
    Algorithm 3 shows how to Algorithm 3 (Quirk, Dolan, and Brockett 2004).
