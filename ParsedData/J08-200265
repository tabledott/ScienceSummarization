AL model was ranked first by the re-ranking model ALLJOINT.
    For example, for 84.1% of the propositions, the re-ranking model chose the same assignment that the LOCAL model would have chosen.
    The second best assignment according to the LOCAL model was promoted to first 8.6% of the time.
    The figure shows statistics for the top ten assignments only.
    The rest of the assignments, ranked 11 through 15, were chosen as best by the re-ranking model for a total of 0.3% of the propositions.
    The labeling of the tree in Figure 9 is a specific example of the kind of errors fixed by the joint models.
    The local classifier labeled the first argument in the tree as ARG0 instead of ARG1, probably because an ARG0 label is more likely for the subject position.
  
  
    We now evaluate our models when trained and tested using automatic parses produced by Charniak&#8217;s parser.
    The Propbank training set Sections 2&#8211;21 is also the training set of the parser.
    The performance of the parser is th
