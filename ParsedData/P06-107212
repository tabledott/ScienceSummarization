At first glance broadening the hypothesis space to entertain all 2n&#8722;1 possible segmentations may seem expensive.
    In fact the dynamic programming computation is almost the same as summing or maximizing over connected dependency trees.
    For the latter, we use an inside-outside algorithm that computes a score for every parse tree by computing the scores of items, or partial structures, through a bottom-up process.
    Smaller items are built first, then assembled using a set of rules defining how larger items can be built.6 Now note that any sequence of partial trees over x can be constructed by combining the same items into trees.
    The only difference is that we are willing to consider unassembled sequences of these partial trees as hypotheses, in addition to the fully connected trees.
    One way to accomplish this in terms of yright(0) is to say that the root, $, is allowed to have multiple children, instead of just one.
    Here, these children are independent of each other (e.g., generated b
