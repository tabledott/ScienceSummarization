Determiners and Prepositions The SP modules for determiner and preposition choice are machine learned components.
			Ideally, one would train such modules on large data sets of annotated errors and corrected counterparts.
			Such a data set, however, is not currently available.
			As a substitute, we are using native English text for training, currently we train on the full text of the English Encarta encyclopedia (560k sentences) and a random set of 1M sentences from a Reuters news data set.
			The strategy behind these modules is similar to a contextual speller as described, for example, in (Golding and Roth 1999).
			For each potential insertion point of a determiner or preposition we extract context features within a window of six tokens to the right and to the left.
			For each token within the window we extract its relative position, the token string, and its part-of speech tag.
			Potential insertion sites are determined heuristically from the sequence of POS tags.
			Based on these features, we train
