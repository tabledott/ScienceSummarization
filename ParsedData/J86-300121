    The assumption that there are single such intentions will in the end prove too strong.
    However, this assumption allows us to describe the basic theory mare clearly.
    We must leave to future research (and a subsequent paper) the exploration and discussion of the complications that result from relaxing this assumption.
    Typically, an ICP will have a number of different kinds of intentions that lead to initiating a discourse.
