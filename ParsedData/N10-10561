 simpler versions promise to make information available to a broader audience, such as non-native speakers, children, laypeople, and so on.
    One major effort to produce such text is the Simple English Wikipedia (henceforth SimpleEW)1, a sort of spin-off of the well-known English Wikipedia (henceforth ComplexEW) where human editors enforce simplicity of language through rewriting.
    The crux of our proposal is to learn lexical simplifications from SimpleEW edit histories, thus leveraging the efforts of the 18K pseudonymous individuals who work on SimpleEW.
    Importantly, not all the changes on SimpleEW are simplifications; we thus also make use of ComplexEW edits to filter out non-simplifications.
    Related work and related problems Previous work usually involves general syntactic-level transformation rules [1, 9, 10].2 In contrast, we explore data-driven methods to learn lexical simplifications (e.g., &#8220;collaborate&#8221; &#8594; &#8220;work together&#8221;), which are highly specific to the lex
