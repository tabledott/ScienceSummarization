    Brent's observation is very much in line with the spirit of the present analysis: &amp;quot;The input lexicons contained thousands of non-morphemic endings and mere dozens of morphemic suffixes, but the output contained primarily morphemic suffixes in all cases but one.
    Thus, the effects of non-morphemic regularities are minimal&amp;quot; (p. 35).
    Brent's corpora were quite different from those used in the experiments reported below; his were based on choosing the n most common words in a Wall Street Journal corpus, while the present study has used large and heterogeneous sources for corpora, which makes for a considerably more difficult task.
    In addition, Brent scored his algorithm solely on how well it succeeded in identifying suffixes (or combinations of suffixes), rather than on how well it simultaneously analysed stem and suffix for each word, the goal of the present study.&amp;quot; Brent makes clear the relevanc
