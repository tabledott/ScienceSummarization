e Prediction Step to restrict the top-down information before unif&#9632; lug it into the rule's dag.
    Predictor step: For each item ending at i of the form 1h, i, X0 &#8212; D) and each rule of the form,(X0 &#8212; E), add an edge of the form 11,1, X0 &#8212; E u (D(X1)1`4:)1 if the unification succeeds and this edge is not subsumed by another edge.
    This step predicts top-down all rules frh,,se left-hand side matches the restricted dag of some constituent being looked for.
    This algorithm on the previous grammar, using a restrictor that allows through only the cat feature of a dag, operates as before, but predicts the first time around the more general edge: Another round of prediction yields this same edge so the process terminates immediately. duck Because the predicted edge is more general than (i.e., subsumes) all the infinite number of edges it replaced that were predicted under the nonterminating extension, it preserves completeness.
    On the other hand, because the predicted edge is not mo
