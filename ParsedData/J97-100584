 multiple linguistic features.
    The first method, error analysis, tunes features and algorithms based on analysis of training errors.
    The second method, machine learning, automatically induces decision trees from coded corpora.
    Both methods rely on an enriched set of input features compared to our previous work.
    With each method, we have achieved marked improvements in performance compared to our previous work and are approaching human performance.
    Quantitatively, the machine learning versus EA methods differ only on certain metrics, and bear a somewhat inverse relation to one another for boundaries defined by T &gt; 4 versus T &gt; 3.
    Table 12, which shows comparisons between EA and the two machine learning conditions, indicates which differences are statistically significant by indicating the probability of a paired comparison on each of the 5 test narratives using Student's t test.
    For the T = 4 boundaries, the superior recall of EA compared with conditions 1 and 2 of the automat
