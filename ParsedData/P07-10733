iven to the learning algorithm is a small set of pairs of named entities that are known to belong (positive) or not belong (negative) to the given relationship.
    Table 1 shows four positive and two negative example pairs for the corporate acquisition relationship.
    For each pair, a bag of sentences containing the two arguments can be extracted from a corpus of text documents.
    The corpus is assumed to be sufficiently large and diverse such that, if the pair is positive, it is highly likely that the corresponding bag contains at least one sentence that explicitly asserts the relationship R between the two arguments.
    In Section 6 we describe a method for extracting bags of relevant sentences from the web.
    Using a limited set of entity pairs (e.g. those in Table 1) and their associated bags as training data, the aim is to induce a relation extraction system that can reliably decide whether two entities mentioned in the same sentence exhibit the target relationship or not.
    In particular, when
