nteraction of such features, as had often been the case with hand-crafted NLP systems.
    The success of statistical methods in particular has been quite evident in the area of syntactic parsing, most recently with the outstanding results of (Charniak, 2000) and (Collins, 2000) on the now-standard English test set of the Penn rkeebank (Marcus et al., 1993).
    A significant trend in parsing models has been the incorporation of linguistically-motivated features; however, it is important to note that &amp;quot;linguistically-motivated&amp;quot; does not necessarily mean language-dependent&amp;quot;--often, it means just the opposite.
    For example, almost all statistical parsers make use of lexicalized nonterminals in some way, which allows lexical items' indiosyncratic parsing preferences to be modeled, but the paring between head words and their parent nonterminals is determined almost entirely by the training data, thereby making this feature&#8212;which models preferences of particular words of a partic
