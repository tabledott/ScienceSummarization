 bytes of text available just through this one Web server to over 20 terabytes from directly accessible Web pages.
    At an average of 10 bytes per word, a generous estimate for Latin-alphabet languages, that suggests two thousand billion words.
    The Web is clearly a multilingual corpus.
    How much of it is English?
    Xu (2000) estimated that 71% of the pages (453 million out of 634 million Web pages indexed by the Excite engine at that time) were written in English, followed by Japanese (6.8%), German (5.1%), French (1.8%), Chinese (1.5%), Spanish (1.1%), Italian (0.9%), and Swedish (0.7%).
    We have measured the counts of some English phrases according to various search engines over time and compared them with counts in the BNC, which we know has 100 million words.
    Table 1 shows these counts in the BNC, on AltaVista in 1998 and in 2001, and then on Alltheweb in 2003.
    For example, the phrase deep breath appears 732 times in the BNC.
    It was indexed 54,550 times by AltaVista in 1998.
