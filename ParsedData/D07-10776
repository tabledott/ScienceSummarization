			Xia and McCord (2004) describe an approach for French, where reordering rules that operate on context-free rule productions are acquired au 738tomatically.
			Niessen and Ney (2004) describe an ap proach for translation from German to English that combines verbs with associated particles, and alsoreorders questions.
			Collins et al (2005) also describe an approach for German, concentrating on re ordering German clauses, which have quite different word order from clauses in English.
			Our approach is most similar to that of Collins et al (2005).
			Most SMT systems employ some mechanism that allows reordering of the source language during translation (i.e., non-monotonic decoding).
			TheMOSES phrase-based system that we use has a rel atively simple reordering model which has a fixed penalty for reordering moves in the decoder.
			Moresophisticated models include reordering parameters that are sensitive to lexical information (Till mann, 2004; Kumar and Byrne, 2005; Koehn et al., 2005).
