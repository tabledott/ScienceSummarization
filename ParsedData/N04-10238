ne is the PRank algorithm, a variant of the perceptron algorithm, that uses multiple biases to represent the boundaries between every two consecutive ranks (Crammer and Singer, 2001; Harrington, 2003).
    However, as we will show in section 3.7, the PRank algorithm does not work on the reranking tasks due to the introduction of global ranks.
    The other approach is to reduce the ranking problem to a classification problem by using the method of pairwise samples (Herbrich et al., 2000).
    The underlying assumption is that the samples of consecutive ranks are separable.
    This may become a problem in the case that ranks are unreliable when ranking does not strongly distinguish between candidates.
    This is just what happens in reranking for machine translation.
  
  
    The reranking approach for MT is defined as follows: First, a baseline system generates -best candidates.
    Features that can potentially discriminate between good vs. bad translations are extracted from these -best candidates.
