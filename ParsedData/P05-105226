ient to capture semantic similarity of words.
    One solution is to use general purpose corpora to create clusters of similar words; another option is to use available resources like WordNet.
    These word similarities can be readily incorporated into the kernel framework.
    To deal with sparse data, we can also use deeper text analysis to capture more regularities from the data.
    Such analysis may be based on newly-annotated corpora like PropBank (Kingsbury and Palmer, 2002) at the University of Pennsylvania and NomBank (Meyers et al., 2004) at New York University.
    Analyzers based on these resources can generate regularized semantic representations for lexically or syntactically related sentence structures.
    Although deeper analysis may even be less accurate, our framework is designed to handle this and still obtain some improvement in performance.
