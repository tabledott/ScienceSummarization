ranching Factor and UnTok is percentage unary of local tree tokens.
    CTB rewrite rules are unary (Table 1).2 This is consonant with the behavior of simple PCFGs on training data, as shown in Table 2.
    Parent and grandparent annotation (Johnson, 1998) has a much stronger effect on training-data parsing for ETB than for CTB.
    We believe that the greater precision/recall split seen here for CTB is also due to its lower branching factor.
  
  
    We use the factored parsing model of (Klein and Manning, 2002).
    Parsing in this model involves combining two independent parses: one of a non-lexicalized, maximum likelihoodestimated (MLE) PCFG model and another of a constituent-free dependency parse.
    In addition to simplifying the parameterization of the parsing model and maintaining exactness, this 2WSJ-small is a randomly selected tenth of the full English Wall Street Journal corpus. model offers the prospect of increased flexibility in tuning the individual parse models.
