te.
    We take the entity to span words inclusive in the candidate. is seen from words to inclusive in a segmentation.
    Then the WE feature described in the previous section can be generated by the template WE= Applying this template to the three entities in the running example generates the three feature strings described in the previous section.
    As another example, consider the template FF= .
    This will generate a feature string for each of the entities in a candidate, this time using the values rather than .
    For the full set of feature templates that are anchored around entities, see figure 1.
    A second set of feature templates is anchored around quotation marks.
    In our corpus, entities (typically with long names) are often seen surrounded by quotes.
    For example, &#8220;The Day They Shot John Lennon&#8221;, the name of a band, appears in the running example.
    Define to be the index of any double quotation marks in the candidate, to be the index of the next (matching) double quo
