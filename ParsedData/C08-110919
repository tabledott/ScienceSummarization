mul tiple annotators were used.
			we trained two native English speakers with prior NLP annotation experience to annotate prepositionerrors in ESL text.
			The training was very extensive: both raters were trained on 2000 preposition contexts and the annotation manual was it eratively refined as necessary.
			To summarize the procedure, the two raters were shown sentences randomly selected from student essays with each preposition highlighted in the sentence.
			They marked each context (?2-word window around thepreposition, plus the commanding verb) for gram mar and spelling errors, and then judged whether the writer used an incorrect preposition, a correct preposition, or an extraneous preposition.

			Each rater judged approximately 18,000 prepo sitions contexts, with 18 sets of 100 contextsjudged by both raters for purposes of com
