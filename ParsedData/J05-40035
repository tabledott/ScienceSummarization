    Using this classifier, we extract parallel sentences from very large comparable corpora of newspaper articles.
    We demonstrate the quality of our A pair of comparable texts. extracted sentences by showing that adding them to the training data of an SMT system improves the system&#8217;s performance.
    We also show that language pairs for which very little parallel data is available are likely to benefit the most from our method; by running our extraction system on a large comparable corpus in a bootstrapping manner, we can obtain performance improvements of more than 50% over a baseline MT system trained only on existing parallel data.
    Our main experimental framework is designed to address the commonly encountered situation that exists when the MT training and test data come from different domains.
    In such a situation, the test data is in-domain, and the training data is out-of-domain.
    The problem is that in such conditions, translation performance is quite poor; the ou
