com tends to select &#8220;snippets&#8221; from the end of movie reviews (Beineke et al., 2004).
    Finally, as a sanity check, we include results from the N least subjective sentences according to Naive Bayes.
    Figure 4 shows the polarity classifier results as N ranges between 1 and 40.
    Our first observation is that the NB detector provides very good &#8220;bang for the buck&#8221;: with subjectivity extracts containing as few as 15 sentences, accuracy is quite close to what one gets if the entire review is used.
    In fact, for the NB polarity classifier, just using the 5 most subjective sentences is almost as informative as the Full review while containing on average only about 22% of the source reviews&#8217; words.
    Also, it so happens that at N = 30, performance is actually slightly better than (but statistically indistinguishable from) Full review even when the SVM default polarity classifier is used (87.2% vs. 87.15%).12 This suggests potentially effective extraction alternatives other tha
