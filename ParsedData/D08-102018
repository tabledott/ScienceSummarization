 in the articles, we compute average cosine similarity (F8), word overlap (F9) and word overlap over just nouns and pronouns (F10) between pairs of adjacent sentences5.
    Each sentence is turned into a vector of word-types, where each type&#8217;s value is its tf-idf (where document frequency is computed over all the articles in the WSJ corpus).
    The cosine similarity metric is then: None of these features correlate significantly with readability as can be seen from the results in Table 4.
    The overlap features are particularly bad predictors of readability, with average word/cosine overlap in fact being negatively correlated with readability.
    The form of reference&#8212;use of pronouns and definite descriptions&#8212;exhibit a higher correlation with readability (0.23), but these values are not significant for the size of our corpus.
    We use the Brown Coherence Toolkit6 to compute entity grids (Barzilay and Lapata, 2008) for each article.
    In each sentence, an entity is identified as the su
