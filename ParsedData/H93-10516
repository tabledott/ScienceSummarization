 only information used by the three classifiers is co- occurrence of character strings in the contexts.
  They use no other cues, such as syntactic tags or word order.
  Nor do they require any augmentation of the training contexts that is not fully automatic.
  A Bayes ian  Approach The Bayesian classifier, developed by Gale, Church and Yarowsky [5], uses Bayes decision theory for weighting tokens that co-occur with each sense of a polysemous target.
  Their work is inspired by Mosteller and Wallace [6], who applied Bayes theorem to the problem of au- thor discrimination.
  The main component of the model, a token, was defined as any character string: a word, number, symbol, punctuation or any combination.
  The entire token is significant, so inflected forms of a base word (wait vs. waiting) and mixed case strings (Bush vs. bush) are distinct tokens.
  Associated with each to- ken is a set of saliences, one for each sense, calculated from the training data.
  The salience of a token for a given sense is Pr(
