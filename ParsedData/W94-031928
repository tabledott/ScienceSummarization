 about elegant declarative formalisms or 'proper' (as opposed to chacky') handling of special cases; evolution's goal is to maximize performance in real-world situations, while maintaining an architecture that can be easily tinkered with by future evolutionary processes.
    In short, evolution is an engineer, not a mathematician.4 It is thus perhaps not surprising if NL generation systems designed to be used in real-world applications end up with an architecture that seem to bear some resemblance to the architecture of the human language processor;5 and future attempts to build applications-oriented generation systems may end up giving us real insights into how language processing works in humans, even if this is not the main purpose of these systems.
    Similarly, psycholinguistic knowledge of how the human language generator works may suggest useful algorithms for NL engineers; one such case is described in [Reiter and Dale, 1992].
    Cross-fertilization between psycholinguistics and NL engineering will
