dition, we report the accuracy score for all three types of ACE mentions, namely pronouns, common nouns and proper names.
    Accuracy is the percentage of REs of a given mention type correctly resolved divided by the total number of REs of the same type given in the key.
    A RE is said to be correctly resolved when both it and its direct antecedent are placed by the key in the same coreference class.
    6During prototyping we experimented unpairing the arguments from the predicates, which yielded worse results.
    This is supported by the PropBank arguments always being defined with respect to a target predicate.
    Binarizing the features &#8212; i.e. do REi and REj have the same argument or predicate label with respect to their closest predicate?
    &#8212; also gave worse results.
    For determining the relevant feature sets we follow an iterative procedure similar to the wrapper approach for feature selection (Kohavi &amp; John, 1997) using the development data.
    The feature subset selection al
