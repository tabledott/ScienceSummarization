	Learning Entailment Rules for Unary Templates
		Most work on unsupervised entailment rule acquisition focused on rules between templates with two variables, ignoring unary rules - entailment rules betweentemplates with a single variable.
		In this paper we investigate two approaches for unsupervised learning of such rules and com pare the proposed methods with a binary rule learning method.
		The results show that the learned unary rule-sets outperform the binary rule-set.
		In addition, a novel directional similarity measure for learning entailment, termed Balanced-Inclusion, is the best performing measure.
	
	
			In many NLP applications, such as Question An swering (QA) and Information Extraction (IE), it is crucial to recognize whether a specific target meaning is inferred from a text.
			For example, a QA system has to deduce that ?SCO sued IBM?
			is inferred from ?SCO won a lawsuit against IBM?
			to answer ?Whom did SCO sue??.
			This type of reasoning has been identified as a core semanticinference
