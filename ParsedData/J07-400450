ising a single derivation.
    Thus, the probability of a dependency structure, &#960;, given a sentence, S, is defined as follows: where O(&#960;) is the set of derivations which lead to &#960;.
    This approach is different from that of Clark, Hockenmaier, and Steedman (2002), who define the probability of a dependency structure simply in terms of the dependencies.
    One reason for modeling derivations (either one distinguished derivation or a set of derivations), in addition to predicate&#8211;argument dependencies, is that derivations may contain useful information for inferring the correct dependency structure.
    For both the dependency model and the normal-form model, the probability of a parse is defined using a log-linear form.
    However, the meaning of parse differs in the two cases.
    For the dependency model, a parse is taken to be a (d, &#960;) pair, as in Equation (13).
    For the normal-form model, a parse is simply a (head-lexicalized) derivation.2 We define a conditional log-linear m
