at works as a binary classifier, since the cascaded chunking model parses a sentence deterministically only deciding whether or not the current segment modifies the segment on its immediate right hand side.
    Probabilities of dependencies are not always necessary for the cascaded chunking model.
    Linguistic features that are supposed to be effective in Japanese dependency analysis are: head words and their parts-of-speech tags, functional words and inflection forms of the words that appear at the end of segments, distance between two segments, existence of punctuation marks.
    As those are solely defined by the pair of segments, we refer to them as the static features.
    Japanese dependency relations are heavily constrained by such static features since the inflection forms and postpositional particles constrain the dependency relation.
    However, when a sentence is long and there are more than one possible dependency, static features, by themselves cannot determine the correct dependency.
