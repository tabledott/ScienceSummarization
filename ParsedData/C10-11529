			SBAR 2 false 0.9165 Table 3: Segmentation Feature Table (SFT) Actually, we do not use the direct constituent of a word in the parse tree.
			In our example, the directconstituent of the word ?which?
			is ?WHNP?.
			In stead, we use Alg.
			1 to calculate the constituentof a word.
			Alg.
			1 returns ?SBAR?
			as the adjusted constituent for ?which?.
			Moreover, di rectly using the length of the complex sentenceis affected by the data sparseness problem.
			In stead, we use iLength as the feature which is calculated as iLength = ceiling( comLengthavgSimLength), where comLength is the length of the complex sentence and avgSimLength is the average length of simple sentences in the training dataset.
			The ?Prob.?
			column shows the probabilities obtained after training on our dataset.
