cision and recall of the systems as a func tion of the corpus size.
			5.1 Experimental Setup.
			We use a 15GB newspaper corpus consisting of TREC9, TREC 2002, Yahoo!
			News ~0.5GB, AP newswire ~2GB, New York Times ~2GB, Reuters ~0.8GB, Wall Street Journal ~1.2GB, and various online news website ~1.5GB.
			For our experiments, we extract from this corpus six data sets of differ ent sizes: 1.5MB, 15 MB, 150 MB, 1.5GB, 6GB and 15GB.
			For the co-occurrence model, we used Minipar (Lin 1994), a broad coverage parser, to parse each data set.
			We collected the frequency counts of the grammatical relationships (contexts) output by Minipar and used them to compute the pointwise mutual information vectors described in Section 3.1.
			For the pattern-based approach, we use Brill?s. POS tagger (1995) to tag each data set.
			5.2 Precision.
			We performed a manual evaluation to estimate the precision of both systems on each dataset.
			For each dataset, both systems extracted a set of is-a Table 3.
