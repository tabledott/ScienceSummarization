meters Our transductive learning algorithm, Algorithm 1, based on L U T, then we have a semi-supervised alis inspired by the Yarowsky algorithm (Yarowsky, gorithm that re-trains a model on the original train1995; Abney, 2004).
    The algorithm works as fol- ing data L plus the sentences decoded in the last itlows: First, the translation model is estimated based eration.
    The size of L can be controlled by filtering on the sentence pairs in the bilingual training data L. the training data (see Section 3.5).
    Then, a set of source language sentences, U, is trans- Additional Phrase Table: If, on the other hand, a lated based on the current model.
    A subset of good new phrase translation table is learned on T only translations and their sources, Ti, is selected in each and then added as a new component in the log-linear 26 model, we have an alternative to the full re-training Algorithm 1 Transductive learning algorithm for statistical machine translation of the model on labeled and unlabeled data which
