    As is common in this field (e.g.
    Lee, 1999), we study similarity between nouns based on their co-occurrences with verbs in the direct object relation.
    We study similarity between high and low frequency nouns since we want to investigate any associations between word frequency and quality of neighbours found by the measures but it is impractical to evaluate a large number of similarity measures over all nouns.
    2,852,300 lemmatised (noun-verb) directobject pairs were extracted from the BNC using a shallow parser (Briscoe and Carroll, 1995; Carroll and Briscoe, 1996).
    From those nouns also occurring in WordNet, we selected the 1000 most frequent3 nouns and a set of 1000 low frequency4 nouns.
    For each noun, 80% of the available data was randomly selected as training data and the other 20% set aside as test data.
    Precision and recall were computed for each pair of nouns using the combinatorial and MI models.
