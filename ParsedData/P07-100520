    Ideally, the WSD system should be suggesting highquality translations which are frequently part of the reference sentences.
    To determine this, we note the set of grammar rules used in the best derivation for translating each test sentence.
    From the rules of each test sentence, we tabulated the set of translations proposed by the WSD system and check whether they are found in the associated reference sentences.
    On the entire set of NIST MT 2003 evaluation test sentences, an average of 10.36 translations proposed by the WSD system were used for each sentence.
    When limited to the set of 374 sentences which were judged by the Collins sign-test to have better translations from Hiero+WSD than from Hiero, a higher number (11.14) of proposed translations were used on average.
    Further, for the entire set of test sentences, 73.01% of the proposed translations are found in the reference sentences.
    This increased to a proportion of 73.22% when limited to the set of 374 sente
