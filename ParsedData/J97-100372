gorithm is shown at the recall level obtained by the judges, on average.
    This is computed as follows for each version of the algorithm: The depth scores are examined in order of their strength.
    For each depth score, if it corresponds to a true boundary, the count of correct boundaries is incremented, otherwise the count of incorrect boundaries is incremented.
    Precision and recall are computed after each correct boundary encountered.
    When the recall equals that of the judges' average recall, the corresponding precision of the algorithm is returned.
    If the recall level exceeds that of the judges', then the value of the precision is estimated as a linear interpolation between the two precision scores whose recall scores most closely surround that of the judges' average recall.
    (This assumption of a linear interpolation is justified because in most cases, although not all, precision changes monotonically.)
    In some cases the algorithm does not produce a recall level as high as that foun
