e easily apply techniques better suited towards each task.
    For example, we are able to use discriminative methods for named entity segmentation and distantly supervised approaches for classification.
    While it might be beneficial to jointly model segmentation and (distantly supervised) classification using a joint sequence labeling and topic model similar to that proposed by Sauper et al. (2010), we leave this for potential future work.
    Because most words found in tweets are not part of an entity, we need a larger annotated dataset to effectively learn a model of named entities.
    We therefore use a randomly sampled set of 2,400 tweets for NER.
    All experiments (Tables 6, 8-10) report results using 4-fold cross validation. they can refer to people or companies), we believe they could be more easily classified using features of their associated user&#8217;s profile than contextual features of the text.
