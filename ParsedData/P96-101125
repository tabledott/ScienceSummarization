    These normal-form results for pure CCG lead directly to useful parsers for real, restricted CCG grammars.
    Two parsing algorithms have been presented for practical use.
    One algorithm finds only normal forms; this simply and safely eliminates spurious ambiguity under most real CCG grammars.
    The other, more complex algorithm solves the spurious ambiguity problem for any CCG grammar, by using normal forms as an efficient tool for grouping semantically equivalent parses.
    Both algorithms are safe, complete, and efficient.
    In closing, it should be repeated that the results provided are for the TAG-equivalent Bn (generalized composition) formalism of (Joshi et al., 1991), optionally extended with the S (substitution) rules of (Szabolcsi, 1989).
    The technique eliminates all spurious ambiguities resulting from the interaction of these rules.
    Future work should continue by eliminating the spurious ambiguities that arise from grammatical or lexical type-raising.
