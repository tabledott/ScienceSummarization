   A pair is included in the table at the beginning of a pass if that pair is a candidate for association by the algorithm in that pass.
    Word Alignment Table (WAT).
    This is a list of pairs of words, together with similarities and frequencies in their respective texts, that have been aligned by comparing their distributions in the texts.
    Sentence Alignment Table (SAT).
    This is a table that records for each pair of sentences how many times the two sentences were set in correspondence by the algorithm.
    Some additional data structures were used to improve performance in our implementation of the algorithm, but they are not essential to an understanding of the method as a whole.
    At the beginning of each cycle, an AST is produced that is expected to contain the eventual set of alignments, generally amongst others.
    It pairs the first and last sentences of the two texts with a small number of sentences from the beginning and end of the other text.
    Generally speaking, the closer a sente
