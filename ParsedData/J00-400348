ystem in relation to the number of cases indicated by the annotated corpus: R number of correct responses number of cases whereas precision is the percentage of correctly reported results in relation to the total reported: p number of correct responses number of responses These two measures may be combined to form one measure of performance, the F measure, which is computed as follows: W represents the relative weight of recall to precision and typically has the value 1.
    A single measure gives us a balance between the two results; 100% of recall may be due to a precision of 0% and vice versa.
    The F measure penalizes both very low recall and very low precision. and recall figures for the different variants of the system were obtained by comparing the classification produced by each version with a standardized annotation, extracted from the annotations produced by our human annotators by majority judgement: whenever at least two of the three coders agreed on a class, that class was chosen.
