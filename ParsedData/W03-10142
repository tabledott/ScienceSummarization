 variety of words and phrases.
    In addition, many subjective terms occur infrequently, such as strongly subjective adjectives (e.g., preposterous, unseemly) and metaphorical or idiomatic phrases (e.g., dealt a blow, swept off one&#8217;s feet).
    Consequently, we believe that subjectivity learning systems must be trained on extremely large text collections before they will acquire a subjective vocabulary that is truly broad and comprehensive in scope.
    To address this issue, we have been exploring the use of bootstrapping methods to allow subjectivity classifiers to learn from a collection of unannotated texts.
    Our research uses high-precision subjectivity classifiers to automatically identify subjective and objective sentences in unannotated texts.
    This process allows us to generate a large set of labeled sentences automatically.
    The second emphasis of our research is using extraction patterns to represent subjective expressions.
    These patterns are linguistically richer and more flexi
