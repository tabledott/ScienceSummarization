he sake of the argument, assume that we are able to break text (1) into textual units as labelled above and that we are interested now in finding rhetorical relations between these units.
    Assume now that we can infer that Although marks a CONCESSIVE relation between satellite 1 and nucleus either 2 or 3, and the colon, an ELABORATION between satellite 3 and nucleus either 1 or 2.
    If we use the convention that hypotactic relations are represented as first-order predicates having the form rhet_rel(NAME, satellite, nucleus) and that paratactic relations are represented as predicates having the form rhet_rel(NAmE, nucleus', nucleus2), a correct representation for text (1) is then the set of two disjunctions given in (2): (2) rhet_re/(coNcEssioN, 1,3) rhet _rel(ELABORATION , 3, 1) V rhet_re/(ELABORATION, 3,2) Despite the ambiguity of the relations, the overall rhetorical structure constraints will associate only one discourse tree with text (1), namely the tree given in figure 1: any discourse tree configu
