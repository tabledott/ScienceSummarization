    3.2.4 Enumeration or generation?
    The development of generative lexicons (Pustejovsky 1995) provides a view of word senses that is very different from that of almost all WSD work to date.
    The enumerative approach assumes an a priori, established set of senses that exist independent of context&#8212;fundamentally the Aristotelian view.
    The generative approach develops a discourse-dependent representation of sense, assuming only underspecified sense assignments until context is taken into account, and bears closer relation to distributional and situational views of meaning.
    Considering the difficulties of determining an adequate and appropriate set of senses for WSD, it is surprising that little attention has been paid to the potential of the generative view in WSD research.
    As larger and more complete generative lexicons become available, there is merit to exploring this approach to sense assignment.
    Given the variety in the studies cited throughout the pre
