 system that is identical to the contextual classifiers, except it is trained using features derived from all lexicons.
    Results are shown in the last row of Table 4 and precision-recall curves are shown in Figure 5.
    Not surprisingly, this system has the best performance in terms of average precision as it has access to the largest amount of information, though its performance is only slightly better than the contextual classifier for the web-derived lexicon.
  
  
    In this paper we examined the viability of sentiment lexicons learned semi-automatically from the web, as opposed to those that rely on manual annotation and/or resources such as WordNet.
    Our qualitative experiments indicate that the web derived lexicon can include a wide range of phrases that have not been available to previous systems, most notably spelling variations, slang, vulgarity, and multiword expressions.
    Quantitatively, we observed that the web derived lexicon had superior performance to previously published lexicons f
