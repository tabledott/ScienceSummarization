l chart[s, A, s +1] := chart[s, A, s +1] V chart[s,B, s+t] A chart[s+t,C, s +1] A TRUE; larger changes would be necessary to create the inside algorithm.
    Besides recognition, four other quantities are commonly computed by parsing algorithms: derivation forests, Viterbi scores, number of parses, and outside probabilities.
    The first quantity, a derivation forest, is a data structure that allows one to efficiently compute the set of legal derivations of the input string.
    The derivation forest is typically found by modifying the recognition algorithm to keep track of &amp;quot;back pointers&amp;quot; for each cell of how it was produced.
    The second quantity often computed is the Viterbi score, the probability of the most probable derivation of the sentence.
    This can typically be computed by substituting x for A and max for V. Less commonly computed is the total number of parses of the sentence, which, like the inside values, can be computed using multiplication and addition; unlike for the ins
