    The phonetic-based and spelling-based models can be linearly combined into a single transliteration model.
    The transliteration score for an English word w given an Arabic word a is a linear combination of the phonetic-based and the spelling-based transliteration scores as follows:7
  
  
    In this section we discuss two different techniques that were used to improve the transliteration accuracy.
    In the first technique, the given word to be transliterated is pre-processed to correct any typos and spelling errors.
    The spelling correction model described in Section 7.1 is also implemented using a finite state machine which can be easily added to the transliteration composition pipeline.
    In the second technique to improve transliterations, transliterations are post-processed to filter any unlikely transliterations as described in Section 7.2.
    Typos and misspellings are very com
