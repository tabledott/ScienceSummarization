ing the estimate for p(nc|ac,gr) and selecting the nc that maximizes the p(ac|nc,gr) estimate.
    There is a significant limitation to the word tokens that can be disambiguated using selectional preferences, in that they are restricted to those that occur in the specified grammatical relations and in argument head position.
    Moreover, we have TCMs only for adjective and verb classes in which there was at least one adjective or verb member that met our criteria for training (having no more than a threshold of 10 senses in WordNet and a frequency of 20 or more occurrences in the BNC data in the specified grammatical relationship).
    We chose not to apply TCMs for disambiguation where we did not have TCMs for one or more classes for the verb or adjective.
    To increase coverage, we experimented with applying the one-sense-per-discourse (OSPD) heuristic (Gale, Church, and Yarowsky 1992).
    With this heuristic, a sense tag for a given word is propagated to other occurrences of the same word within the cu
