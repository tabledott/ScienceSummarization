c relatedness: one is correlation to human judgment, the other is the relative per formance gains of a task-driven system when it uses the measure.
			The evaluation here focuses on correlation with human judgments of relatedness.
			For consistency with previous literature, we use rank correlation (Spearman?s? coefficient) rather than linear correlation when comparing sets of relatedness judgments because the rank corre lation captures information about the relative ordering ofthe scores.
			However, it is worth noting that many applica tions that make use of lexical relatedness scores (e.g. as features to a machine learning algorithm) would better be served by scores on a linear scale with human judgments.
			Rubenstein and Goodenough (1965) solicited humanjudgments of semantic similarity for 65 pairs of com mon nouns on a scale of zero to four.
			Miller and Charles (1991) repeated their experiment on a subset of 29 nounpairs (out of 30 total) and found that although indi viduals varied among their judgmen
