e in linear time O(k).
			Then, we only need to rewrite line 4 of the Viterbi algorithm (Figure 3) to extend it to the k-best case: 4: D?(v) ? merge?k(D?(v),mult?k(e)) and the time complexity for this line is O(|e|k|e| log k),making the overall complexity O(|E|ka log k) if we con sider the arity a of the hypergraph to be constant.2 The overall space complexity is O(|V |k) since for each vertex we need to store a vector of length k. In the context of CKY parsing for CFG, the 1-bestViterbi algorithm has complexity O(n3|P|) while the kbest version is O(n3|P|k2 log k), which is slower by a fac tor of O(k2 log k).
			4.2 Algorithm 1: speed up mult?k. First we seek to exploit the fact that input vectors are all sorted and the function f is monotonic; moreover, we areonly interested in the top k elements of the k|e| possibili ties.Define 1 to be the vector whose elements are all 1; de fine bi to be the vector whose elements are all 0 exceptbii = 1.As we compute pe = mult?k(e), we maintain a candi date set C of deriv
