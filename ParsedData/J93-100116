    The channel probability, Pr(0 I I), is the probability that 0 will appear at the output of the channel when I is presented at the input; it is large if I is similar, in some appropriate sense, to 0, and small, otherwise.
    The channel probability depends on the application.
    In speech recognition, for example, the output for the word &amp;quot;writer&amp;quot; may look similar to the word &amp;quot;rider&amp;quot;; in character recognition, this will not be the case.
    Other examples are shown in Table 1.
    Rather than rely on guesses for the values of the bonuses and penalties as the Raleigh group had done, the Yorktown group used three levels of hidden Markov models (HMMs) to compute the conditional probabilities necessary for the noisy channel.
    A Markov model is a finite state machine with probabilities governing transitions between states and controlling the emission of output symbols.
    If the sequence of state transitions cannot be determined when the sequence of o
