 for each product feature, they annotated the opinion expression which has relation with it.
    Finally, one Features for match function where agr(a||b) represents the inter-annotator agreement between annotator a and b, A and B are the sets of anchors annotated by annotators a and b. agr(A1||A2) was 85.9% and agr(A2||A1) was 89.5%.
    It indicates that the reliability of our annotated corpus is satisfactory.
    Results of extracting product features and opinion expressions are shown in Table 2.
    We use precision, recall and F-measure to evaluate performances.
    The candidate product features are extracted by the method described in Section 2.2, whose result is in the first row.
    6760 of 24414 candidate product features remained after the filtering, which means we cut 72% of irrelevant candidates with a cost of 14.5%(1-85.5%) loss in true answers.
    Similar to the product feature extraction, the precision of extracting opinion expression is relatively low, while the recall is 75.2%.
