			Although the number was small, there were disagreements on how to annotate a mathematical formula such as ?n=2?
			embedded in the sen tence, since mathematical formulae were outside the scope of the original PTB scheme.
			One annotator annotated this kind of phrase consis tently as a phrase with ?=?
			as an adjective, the other annotated as phrase with ?=?
			as a verb.
			There were 6 such cases.
			Another disagreement particular to abstracts is a treatment of labeled sentences.
			There were 8 sentences in two ab stracts where there is a label like ?Background:?.
			One annotator included the colon (?:?)
			in the la bel, while the other did not.
			Yet another is that one regarded the phrase ?Author et al as coor dination, and the other regarded ?et al as a modifier.
