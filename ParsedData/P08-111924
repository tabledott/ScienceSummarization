    In retrospect, we realized that we should have searched for &#8220;U.S. states&#8221; instead ofjust &#8220;states&#8221;.
    This example illustrates the power of the doubly-anchored hyponym pattern to correctly identify our intended semantic class by disambiguating our class name based on the seed class member.
    The algorithms also seem to be robust with respect to initial seed choice.
    For the states, countries, and singers categories, we ran experiments with 5 different initial seeds, which were randomly selected.
    The 5 country seeds represented a diverse set of nations, some of which are rarely mentioned in the news: Brazil, France, Guinea-Bissau, Uganda, and Zimbabwe.
    All of these seeds obtained &gt; 92% recall with &gt; 90% precision.
    We examined the incorrect instances produced by our algorithms and found that most of them fell into five categories.
    Type 1 errors were caused by incorrect proper name extraction.
    For example, in the sentence &#8220;states such as Georg
