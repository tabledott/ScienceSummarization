d at Lund University in the 1970?s and consistingmainly of informative texts from official sources (Einars son, 1976).
			Although the original annotation scheme isan eclectic combination of constituent structure, depen dency structure, and topological fields (Teleman, 1974), it has proven possible to convert the annotated sentences to dependency graphs with fairly high accuracy.In the conversion process, we have reduced the orig inal fine-grained classification of grammatical functions to a more restricted set of 16 dependency types, whichare listed in Table 2.
			We have also replaced the origi nal (manual) part-of-speech annotation by using the same automatic tagger that is used for preprocessing in the parser.
			This is a standard probabilistic tagger trained on the Stockholm-Umea?
			Corpus of written Swedish (SUC, 1997) and found to have an accuracy of 95?96% when tested on held-out data.
			Since the function we want to learn is a mapping from parser states to transitions (and dependency types), the t
