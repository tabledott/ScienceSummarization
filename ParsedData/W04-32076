scriminative training (as we do for the English model, &#167;3.1) or as if they were log-probabilities, using smoothed maximum likelihood estimation (as we do for the Korean model, &#167;3.3).
    Because we use this model only for inference, it is not necessary to compute a partition function for the combined log-linear model.
    In addition to the two monolingual syntax models, we add a word-to-word translation model to the mix.
    In this paper we use a translation model to induce only a single best word matching, but in principle the translation model could be used to weight all possible wordword links, and the parser would solve the joint alignment/parsing problem.2 As a testbed for our experiments, the Penn Korean Treebank (KTB; Han et al., 2002) provides 5,083 Korean constituency trees along with English translations and their trees.
    The KTB also analyzes Korean words into their component morphemes and morpheme tags, which allowed us to train a morphological disambiguation model.
