ency transformation is more difficult than these examples suggest.
    The first problem is that the mapping from CCG dependencies to GRs is many-to-many.
    For example, the transitive verb category (S[dcl]\NP)/NP applies to the copula in sentences like Imperial Corp. is the parent ofImperial Savings &amp; Loan.
    With the default annotation, the relation between is and parent would be dobj, whereas in DepBank the argument of the copula is analysed as an xcomp.
    Table 3 gives some examples of how we attempt to deal with this problem.
    The constraint in the first example means that, whenever the word associated with the transitive verb category is a form of be, the second argument is xcomp, otherwise the default case applies (in this case dobj).
    There are a number of categories with similar constraints, checking whether the word associated with the category is a form of be.
    The second type of constraint, shown in the third line of the table, checks the lexical category of the word filling the
