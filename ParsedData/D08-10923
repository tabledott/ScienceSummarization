gnments are not present and so are induced as latent variables using an iterative training procedure.
    To make the process efficient and modular to existing monolingual parsers, we introduce several approximations: use of k-best lists in candidate generation, an adaptive bound to avoid considering all k2 combinations, and Viterbi approximations to alignment posteriors.
    We evaluate our system primarily as a parser and secondarily as a component in a machine translation pipeline.
    For both English and Chinese, we begin with the state-of-the-art parsers presented in Petrov and Klein (2007) as a baseline.
    Joint parse selection improves the English trees by 2.5 F1 and the Chinese trees by 1.8 F1.
    While other Chinese treebank parsers do not have access to English side translations, this Chinese figure does outperform all published monolingual Chinese treebank results on an equivalent split of the data.
    As MT motivates this work, another valuable evaluation is the effect of joint selection on d
