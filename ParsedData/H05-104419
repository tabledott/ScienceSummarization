 one feature, the word token.
			The second row showsthe results for a classifier that uses both the word to ken and the word?s prior polarity as features.
			The results for the 28-feature classifier are listed in thelast row.
			The 28-feature classifier performs signifi cantly better (1-tailed t-test, p ? .05) than the two simpler classifiers, as measured by accuracy, polar F-measure, and neutral F-measure (?
			= 1).
			It has an accuracy of 75.9%, with a polar F-measure of 63.4 and a neutral F-measure of 82.1.
			Focusing on the metrics for polar expressions, it?s interesting to note that using just the word token as a feature produces a classifier with a precision slightly better than the 28-feature classifier, but with a recall that is 20% lower.
