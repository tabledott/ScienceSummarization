ty's method was significantly more accurate for chief, common, public, and help regardless of the feature set.
    Despite this consistency, there were some observable trends associated with changes in feature set.
    For example, McQuitty's method was significantly more accurate overall in combination with feature set C while the EM algorithm was more accurate with Feature Set A, and the accuracy of Ward's method was the least favorable with Feature Set B.
    For the nouns, there was no significant difference between Feature Sets A and B when using the EM algorithm.
    For the verbs there was no significant difference between the three feature sets when using McQuitty's method.
    The adjectives were significantly more accurate when using McQuitty's method and Feature Set C. One possible explanation for the consistency of results as feature sets varied is that perhaps the features most indicative of word senses are included in all the sets due to the selection methods and the commonality of feature types
