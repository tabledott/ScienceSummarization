			The lexicographer annotated an overall numberof 2,316 content words.
			47 (2%) of them were excluded because no WordNet sense was deemed ap propriate.
			The remaining 2,269 content words thusconstituted the test data set.
			Only 8 of them were as signed more than one sense: specifically, two coarse senses were assigned to a single word instance4 and two distinct fine-grained senses were assigned to 7 word instances.
			This was a clear hint that the sense clusters were not ambiguous for the vast majority of words.In Table 2 we report information about the polysemy of the word instances in the test set.
			Over all, 29.88% (678/2269) of the word instances weremonosemous (according to our coarse sense inven tory).
			The average polysemy of the test set with the coarse-grained sense inventory was 3.06 compared to an average polysemy with the WordNet inventory 4d005.s004.t015 31 polysemy N V A R all monosemous 358 86 141 93 678 polysemous 750 505 221 115 1591 total 1108 591 362 208 2269 Table 2: Statistics
