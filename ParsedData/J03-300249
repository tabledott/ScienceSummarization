o divide the task.
    The p2 tool divides up tasks intelligently, invoking each parallel computation on the local machine where the data reside.
    In adapting STRAND&#8217;s three-stage process to the Internet Archive, the primary challenge was in the first two steps, locating possible translations and matching them up to produce candidate document pairs.
    Structural filtering remained essentially unchanged.
    Generating candidate pairs on the Archive involves the following steps: Steps 1 and 2 are performed via a parallel search operation plus combination of results; for example, extracting all URLs in the Hong Kong, Taiwan, or China domains (and their associated bookkeeping data) using a pattern like /(.hk|.tw|.cn)/.16 Step 3 is potentially tricky owing to computational complexity issues.
    As noted in Section 2.1.2, examining the cross product of a site&#8217;s page sets in two different languages is potentially very expensive, and matching documents by similarity of URLs can represent a combinat
