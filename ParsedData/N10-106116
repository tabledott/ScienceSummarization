   Hypotheses are extended via adding a new mention to an existing entity or creating a new one.
    For our experiments, we limited the number of hypotheses on the beam to the top fifty and did not notice an improvement in model score from increasing beam size.
    Updating pronominal antecedents ri(A?
    'i ) and entity types qk(Tk): These updates are straightforward instantiations of the mean-field update (2).
    To produce our final coreference partitions, we assign each referring mention to the entity given by the &#948;r factor and each pronoun to the most likely entity given by the ri.
    In order to facilitate learning, some factors are initially set to fixed heuristic values and only learned in later iterations.
    Initially, the assignment factors &#948;r and {ri} are fixed.
    For &#948;r, we use a deterministic entity assignment Zr, similar to the Haghighi and Klein (2009)&#8217;s SYN-CONSTR setting: each referring mention is coreferent with any past mention with the same head or in a determi
