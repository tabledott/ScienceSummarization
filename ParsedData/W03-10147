 the sentences as subjective or objective, they will still produce a large collection of labeled sentences.
    Most importantly, the high-precision classifiers can generate a much larger set of labeled sentences than are currently available in manually created data sets.
    Information extraction (IE) systems typically use lexicosyntactic patterns to identify relevant information.
    The specific representation of these patterns varies across systems, but most patterns represent role relationships surrounding noun and verb phrases.
    For example, an IE system designed to extract information about hijackings might use the pattern hijacking of &lt;x&gt;, which looks for the noun hijacking and extracts the object of the preposition of as the hijacked vehicle.
