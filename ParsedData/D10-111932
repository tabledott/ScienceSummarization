    This paper has presented a method for inducing probabilistic CCGs from sentences paired with logical forms.
    The approach uses higher-order unification to define the space of possible grammars in a language- and representation-independent manner, paired with an algorithm that learns a probabilistic parsing model.
    We evaluated the approach on four languages with two meaning representations each, achieving high accuracy across all scenarios.
    For future work, we are interested in exploring the generality of the approach while extending it to new understanding problems.
    One potential limitation is in the constraints we introduced to ensure the tractability of the higher-order unification procedure.
    These restrictions will not allow the approach to induce lexical items that would be used with, among other things, many of the type-raised combinators commonly employed in CCG grammars.
    We are also interested in developing
