SPafter automatically filtering out negations and antonyms (using WordNet).
    In addition we demonstrate LDA-SP&#8217;s ability to rank inference rules by measuring the Kullback Leibler Divergence6 between the topicdistributions of the antecedent and consequent, Br1 and Bre respectively.
    Table 3 shows the top 10 and bottom 10 rules out of the 26,000 ranked by KL Divergence after automatically filtering antonyms (using WordNet) and negations.
    For slight variations in rules (e.g., symmetric pairs) we mention only one example to show more variety.
    Finally we explore LDA-SP&#8217;s ability to produce a repository of human interpretable class-based selectional preferences.
    As an example, for the relation was born in, we would like to infer that the plausible arguments include (person, location) and (person, date).
    Since we already have a set of topics, our task reduces to mapping the inferred topics to an equivalent class in a taxonomy (e.g., WordNet).
    We experimented with automatic metho
