    Two monolingual parses are better than one (synchronous parse).
    In Proc. of HLT-NAACL. cdec continues to be under active development.
    We are taking advantage of its modular design to study alternative algorithms for language model integration.
    Further training pipelines are under development, including minimum risk training using a linearly decomposable approximation of BLEU (Li and Eisner, 2009), and MIRA training (Chiang et al., 2009).
    All of these will be made publicly available as the projects progress.
    We are also improving support for parallel training using Hadoop (an open-source implementation of MapReduce).
