he CoNLL data set and evaluation measure shows that our upper bound in performance because of this rule is approximately 99.0 F-Measure on ALL arguments.
  
  
    We proceed to describe our models incorporating dependencies between labels of nodes in the parse tree.
    As we discussed briefly before, the dependencies we would like to model are highly non-local.
    A factorized sequence model that assumes a finite Markov horizon, such as a chain CRF (Lafferty, McCallum, and Pereira 2001), would not be able to encode such dependencies.
    We define a CRF with a much richer dependency structure.
    Motivation for Re-Ranking.
    For argument identification, the number of possible assignments for a parse tree with n nodes is 2n.
    This number can run into the hundreds of billions for a normal-sized tree.
    For argument labeling, the number of possible assignments is &#8776; 20m, if m is the number of arguments of a verb (typically between 2 and 5), and 20 is the approximate number of possible labels if c
