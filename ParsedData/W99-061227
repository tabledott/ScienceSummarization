ies, using a training seed set of 300 names (115 first names, 125 last names, and 60 city/country names).
    The baseline measures and default system (a) are as described above.
    In configuration (b), the based parameters of the system have been optimized for Romanian, using greedy search on an independent development test (devtest) set, yielding a slight increase in F-measure.
    Configuration (c) used the default parameters, but the more conservative &amp;quot;dominant&amp;quot; criterion was utilized, clearly favoring precision at the expense of recall.
    Configuration (d), which is relevant for the ENAMEX task, represents the performance of the system when classes &amp;quot;first name&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;last name&amp;quot; are combined into &amp;quot;person&amp;quot; (whenever two or more such entities are adjacent, we consider the whole group as a &amp;quot;person&amp;quot; entity).
    Configuration (e) shows contrastive performance when using standard continuous EM smoothing on the same dat
