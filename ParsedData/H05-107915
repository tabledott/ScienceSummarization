 631 Example: 1049 (TRUE) T: Four Venezuelan firefighters who were traveling to a training course in Texas were killed when their sport utility vehicle drifted onto the shoulder of a highway and struck a parked truck.
			H: Four firefighters were killed in a car accident.Although this example is judged as a true entail ment, Vampire doesn?t find a proof because it lacks the background knowledge that one way of causing acar accident is to drift onto the shoulder of the high way and strike something.
			It generates a model withdomain size 11 for fol(drs(T)), and a model with do main size 12 for fol((drs(T);drs(H))).
			The absolute difference in domain sizes is small, and thereforelikely to indicate an entailment.
			Apart from the absolute difference we also compute the difference rel ative to the domain size.
			For the example above the relative domain size yields 1/12 = 0.083.
			The domain size only tells us something about the number of entities used in a model?not about the number of established relatio
