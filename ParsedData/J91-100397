    Moreover, the details of the process match well Aristotle's two basic principles for finding the ground of a metaphor in that both terms in a metaphorical relation belong to a common category (in the example above, the common categories are it1, ingest1, and liquidl) and an analogy is found between them.
    The collation process also takes care of many of the problems Tourangeau and Sternberg (1980) note with the comparison view.
