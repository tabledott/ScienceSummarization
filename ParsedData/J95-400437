tributional behavior of unknown words is quite different from that of known words, and transformations are not English-specific, the set of transformation templates would have to be extended to process languages with dramatically different morphology. since a transformation that does not increase unknown-word tagging accuracy can still be beneficial to overall tagging accuracy, the contextual transformations learned are not optimal in the sense of leading to the highest tagging accuracy on unknown words.
    Better unknown-word accuracy may be possible by training and using two sets of contextual rules, one maximizing known-word accuracy and the other maximizing unknown-word accuracy, and then applying the appropriate transformations to a word when tagging, depending upon whether the word appears in the lexicon.
    We are currently experimenting with this idea.
    In Weischedel et al. (1993), a statistical approach to tagging unknown words is shown.
    In this approach, a number of suffixes and important f
