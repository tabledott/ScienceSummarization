variables.
    Returning to our previous example, the maximum likelihood estimate for E[x] is, for all i, j, k, m, n: Expressing the population parameters as probabilities instead of expected counts, the equation above can be rewritten as follows, where the sample marginal relative frequencies are the maximum likelihood estimates of the population marginal probabilities.
    For all The degree to which the data is approximated by a model is called the fit of the model.
    In this work, the likelihood ratio statistic, G2, is used as the measure of the goodness-of-fit of a model.
    It is distributed asymptotically as X2 with degrees of freedom corresponding to the number of interactions (and/or variables) omitted from (unconstrained in) the model.
    Accessing the fit 'The marginal distributions can be represented in terms of counts or relative frequencies, depending on whether the parameters are expressed as expected frequencies or probabilities, respectively. of a model in terms of the significance of its
