estion-answer pairs, and S1,2On is the percentage of queries with at least one adequate or material answer in the top n results.
    This evaluation measure accounts for improvements in coverage, i.e., it rewards cases where answers are found for queries that did not have an adequate or material answer before.
    In contrast, the mean reciprocal rank (MRR) measure standardly used in QA can have the effect of preferring systems that find answers only for a small set of queries, but rank them higher than systems with higher coverage.
    This makes MRR less adequate for the low-recall setup of FAQ retrieval.
    Table 3 shows success rates at 10 and 20 retrieved question-answer pairs for five different systems.
    The results for the baseline tfidf system, following Jijkoun and de Rijke (2005), are shown in row 2.
    Row 3 presents results for our variant of local expansion by pseudo-relevance feedback (Xu and Croft, 1996).
    Results for SMT-based expansion are given in row 4.
