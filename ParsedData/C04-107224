 traditional approaches that require human judgments on adequacy or fluency, ORANGE requires no extra human involvement other than the availability of reference translations.
			It also streamlines the process of design and error analysis for developing new automatic metrics.
			Using ORANGE, we have only one parameter, i.e. ORANGE itself, to optimize vs. two in correlation analysis using human assigned adequacy and fluency.
