 Expansion versus Other.
    However, since Expansion forms the largest class of relations, its f-score is still the highest overall.
    We discuss the results per relation class next.
    Comparison We expected that polarity features would be especially helpful for identifying Comparison relations.
    Surprisingly, polarity was actually one of the worst classes of features for Comparison, achieving an f-score of 16.33 (in contrast to using the first, last and first three words of the sentences as features, which leads to an f-score of 21.01).
    We examined the prevalence of positivenegative or negative-positive polarity pairs in our training set.
    30% of the Comparison examples contain one of these opposite polarity pairs, while 31% of the Other examples contain an opposite polarity pair.
    To our knowledge, this is the first study to examine the prevalence of polarity words in the arguments of discourse relations in their natural distributions.
    Contrary to popular belief, Comparisons do not ten
