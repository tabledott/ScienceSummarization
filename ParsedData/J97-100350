jacent blocks have in common.
    The second, the vocabulary introduction method, assigns a score to a token-sequence gap based on how many new words were seen in the interval in which it is the midpoint.
    5.2.1 Blocks.
    In the block comparison algorithm, adjacent pairs of blocks of tokensequences are compared for overall lexical similarity.
    The block size, labeled k, is the number of token-sequences that are grouped together into a block to be compared against an adjacent group of token-sequences.
    This value is meant to approximate the average paragraph length.
    Actual paragraphs are not used because their lengths can be highly irregular, leading to unbalanced comparisons, but perhaps with a clever normalizing scheme, &amp;quot;real&amp;quot; paragraphs could be used (analogous to the substitution of token-sequences for real sentences).
    Similarity values are computed for every token-sequence gap number; that is, a score is assigned to token-sequence gap i corresponding to how similar the
