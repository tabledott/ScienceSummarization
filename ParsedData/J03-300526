ms: Page counts and n-gram counts are highly correlated on a log-log scale.
    This result is based on Zhu and Rosenfeld&#8217;s queries to AltaVista, a search engine that at the time of their research returned both the number of pages and the overall number of matches for a given query.4 Another important limitation of our approach arises from the fact that both Google and AltaVista disregard punctuation and capitalization, even if the search term is placed within quotation marks.
    This can lead to false positives, for instance, if the match crosses a phrase boundary, such as in (5), which matches hungry prey.

    Instead we rely on the simple adjacency of the search terms, which is enforced by using queries enclosed wi
