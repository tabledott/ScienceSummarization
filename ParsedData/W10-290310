esponse and provide a judgement.
    The general form of the teacher&#8217;s feedback is provided by a function For the Geoquery domain this amounts to whether the logical form produces the correct response r for the input sentence.
    Geoquery has the added benefit that the teacher can be automated if we have a dataset consisting of input sentences and response pairs {(xl, rl)}Nl=1.
    Feedback evaluates whether a logical form produces a response matching r: We are now ready to present our learning with feedback algorithms that operate in situations where input sentences, {xl}N l=1, and a teacher feedback mechanism, Feedback, are available.
    We do not assume the availability of logical forms.
    In general, a weight vector can be considered good if when used in the inference problem (Equation (1)) it scores the correct logical form and alignment (which may be hidden) higher than all other logical forms and alignments for a given input sentence.
    The intuition behind the direct approach is that the f
