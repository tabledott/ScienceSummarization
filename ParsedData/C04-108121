is 94.2%.
			This gives some empirical evidenceof the advantages of linear-chain CRFs over sliding window maximum entropy models, however, this comparison still requires further investigation sincethere are many factors that could affect the performance such as different features used in both sys tems.
			To further study the robustness of our approach to segmentation, we perform cross-testing?that is, training on one dataset and testing on other datasets.
			Table 5 summarizes these results, in which the rows are the training datasets and the columns are thetesting datasets.
			Not surprisingly, cross testing re sults are worse than the results using the same ASc ASo CTBc CTBo HKc HKo PKc PKo SITE-AVG OUR-AVG S01 93.8 88.1 88.1 90.1 95.1 95.3 91.8 91.9 S02 87.4 91.2 89.3 87.2 S03 87.2 82.9 88.6 92.5 87.8 93.6 S04 93.9 93.7 93.8 94.4 S05 94.2 73.2 89.4 85.6 91.5 S06 94.5 82.9 92.4 92.4 90.6 91.9 S07 94.0 94.0 94.6 S08 90.4 95.6 93.6 93.8 93.4 94.0 S09 96.1 94.6 95.4 94.9 S10 83.1 90.1 94.7 95.9 91.0 90.8 S11
