other for gi (*), another for gu (Y), etc.
    So the way to write golfbag in katakana is =*)1., 7 7 roughly pronounced goruhubaggu.

    Also, a dot-separator ( &#8226; ) is used to separate words, but not consistently.
    And transliteration is clearly an information-losing operation: aisukuri imu loses the distinction between ice cream and I scream.
    Transliteration is not trivial to automate, but we will be concerned with an even more challenging problem&#8212;going from katakana back to English, i.e., back-transliteration.
    Automating backtransliteration has great practical importance in Japanese/English machine translation.
    Katakana phrases are the largest source of text phrases that do not appear in bilingual dictionaries or training corpora (a.k.a.
    &amp;quot;not-found words&amp;quot;).
    However, very little computational work has b
