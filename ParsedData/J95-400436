n are not considered is 86.4%.
    However, it is difficult to compare taggers using this figure, as the accuracy of the system depends on the particular lexicon used.
    For instance, in our training set the word the was tagged with a number of different tags, and so according to our lexicon the is ambiguous.
    If we instead used a lexicon where the is listed unambiguously as a determiner, the baseline accuracy would be 84.6%.
    For tagging unknown words, each word is initially assigned a part-of-speech tag based on word and word-distribution features.
    Then, the tag may be changed based on contextual cues, via contextual transformations that are applied to the entire corpus, both known and unknown-words.
    When the contextual rule learner learns transformations, it does so in an attempt to maximize overall tagging accuracy, and not unknown-word tagging accuracy.
    Unknown words account for only a small percentage of the corpus in our experiments, typically two to three percent.
    Since the dis
