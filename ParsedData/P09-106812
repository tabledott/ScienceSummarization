rom this set, we count workers.
    In this example, the pair (X find) and (X apply) shares an argument (they and workers).
    The pair ((X find),(X apply)) is counted once for narrative chain induction, and ((X find), (X apply), workers) once for argument induction.
    Figure 1 shows the top occurring words across all event slot pairs in a criminal scenario chain.
    This chain will be part of a larger narrative schema, described in section 3.4.
    We now formalize event slot similarity with arguments.
    Narrative chains as defined in (Chambers and Jurafsky, 2008) score a new event slot (f, g) against a chain of size n by summing over the scores between all pairs: where C is a narrative chain, f is a verb with grammatical argument g, and sim(e, e') is the pointwise mutual information pmi(e, e').
    Growing a chain by one adds the highest scoring event.
    We extend this function to include argument types by defining similarity in the context of a specific argument a: where A is a constant weighting f
