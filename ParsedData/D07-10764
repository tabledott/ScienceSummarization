span in relation extraction.
			Zhang et al(2006) explored five tree spans in relation extraction and it was a bit sur prising to find that the Shortest Path-enclosed Tree (SPT, i.e. the sub-tree enclosed by the shortest path linking two involved entities in the parse tree) performed best.
			This is contrast to our intuition.
			For ex ample, ?got married?
			is critical to determine the relationship between ?John?
			and ?Mary?
			in the sen tence ?John and Mary got married?
			as shown in Figure 1(e).
			It is obvious that the information con tained in SPT (?John and Marry?)
			is not enough to determine their relationship.
			This paper proposes a context-sensitive convolu tion tree kernel for relation extraction to resolve the above two problems.
			It first automatically determines a dynamic context-sensitive tree span for relation ex traction by extending the Shortest Path-enclosed Tree (SPT) to include necessary context information outside SPT.
			Then it proposes a context-sensitive convolution tree
