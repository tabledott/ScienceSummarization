common translation patterns fall outside the scope of the child-reordering model.
    This is true even for languages as similar as English and French.
    For example, English adverbs tend to move outside the local parent/children in environment.
    The English word &#8220;not&#8221; translates to the discontiguous pair &#8220;ne ... pas.&#8221; English parsing errors also cause trouble, as a normally well-behaved re-ordering environment can be disrupted by wrong phrase attachment.
    For other language pairs, the divergence is expected to be greater.
    In the face of these problems, we may choose among several alternatives.
    The first is to abandon syntax in statistical machine translation, on the grounds that syntactic models are a poor fit for the data.
    On this view, adding syntax yields no improvement over robust phrasesubstitution models, and the only question is how much does syntax hurt performance.
    Along this line, (Koehn et al., 2003) present convincing evidence that restricting phras
