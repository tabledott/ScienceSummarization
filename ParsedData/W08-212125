    NomBank and Penn Treebank annotators sometimes disagree about constituent structure.
    NomBank annotators are in effect assuming that the constituents provided form a phrase.
    In this case, the constituents are adjacent to each other.
    For example, consider the NP the human rights discussion.
    In this case, the Penn Treebank would treat each of the four words the, human, rights, discussion as daughters of a single NP node.
    However, NomBank would treat human rights as a single ARG1 of discussion.
    Since noun noun modification constructions are head final, we can easily determine (via GLARF) that rights is the markable dependent of discussion.
    Finally, NomBank&#8217;s encoding of support chains is handled as chains of dependencies in the data (although these are not scored).
    For example, given Mary took dozens of walks, where Mary is the ARG0 of walks, th
