   Using the above evaluation metric for RS trees, we have experimented with a range of stochastic search methods.
    Space does not permit us to discuss more than one initial experiment in this section.
    In the next section, we describe a couple of methods based on genetic algorithms which proved more productive.
    The subtree swapping approach produces new trees by swapping random subtrees in a candidate solution.
    It works as follows: When two subtrees are swapped over in an RS tree, some of the relations indicated in the tree no longer apply (i.e. those higher relations that make use of the nuclei of the subtrees).
    These are &amp;quot;repaired&amp;quot; by in each case selecting the &amp;quot;best&amp;quot; valid relation that really relates the top nuclei (i.e. a non-elaboration relation is chosen if possible, otherwise an elaboration if that is valid, with &amp;quot;joint&amp;quot; as a last resort).
    We investigated variations on this algorithm, including having initial random balanced
