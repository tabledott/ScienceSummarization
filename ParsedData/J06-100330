If some particular NLP system requires a measure of semantic relatedness, we can compare different measures by seeing which one the system is most effective with, while holding all other aspects of the system constant.
  In the remainder of this paper, we will use the second and the third methods to compare several different measures (Sections 4 and 5 respectively).
  We focus on measures that use WordNet (Fellbaum 1998) as their knowledge source (to keep that as a constant) and that permit straightforward implementation as functions in a 23 Computational Linguistics Volume 32, Number 1 programming language.
  Therefore, we select the following five measures: Hirst and St-Onge?s (Section 2.4), Jiang and Conrath?s (Section 2.6.2), Leacock and Chodorow?s (Section 2.5.3), Lin?s (Section 2.6.3), and Resnik?s (Section 2.6.1).5 The first is claimed as a measure of semantic relatedness because it uses all noun relations in WordNet; the others are claimed only as measures of similarity because they use only the hypon
