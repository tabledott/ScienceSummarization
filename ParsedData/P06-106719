del described in (Bahl et al., 1983).
    The language model is trained on the LDC English GigaWord Corpus.
    The test set used in the experiments in this section is the 2003 NIST MT Evaluation test set (which is not part of the training data).
    In the experiments in this section, we show the utility of a trigram language model in restoring the correct word order for English.
    The task is a simplified translation task, where the input is reordered English (English written in Arabic word order) and the output is English in the correct order.
    The source sentence is a reordered English sentence in the same manner we described in Section 3.
    The objective of the decoder is to recover the correct English order.
    We use the same phrase-based decoder we use for our SMT experiments, except that only the language model cost is used here.
    Also, the phrase dictionary used is a one-to-one function that maps every English word in our vocabulary to itself.
