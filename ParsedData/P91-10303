   Unfortunately, it is not clear where the necessary information about lexical preferences is to be found.
    In the Whittemore et al. study, the judgement of attachment preferences had to be made by hand for exactly the cases that their study covered; no precompiled list of lexical preferences was available.
    Thus, we are posed with the problem: how can we get a good list of lexical preferences.
    Our proposal is to use cooccurrence of with prepositions in text as an indicator of lexical preference.
    Thus, for example, the preposition to occurs frequently in the context send NP &#8212;, i.e., after the object of the verb send, and this is evidence of a lexical association of the verb send with to.
    Similarly, from occurs frequently in the context withdrawal &#8212;, and this is evidence of a lexical association of the noun withdrawal with the preposition from.
    Of course, this kind of association is, unlike lexical selection, a symmetric notion.
    Cooccurrence provides no indication of whet
