and how to pack multiple derivations, including interpretations of unaligned words, into derivation forests.
			We presented some theoretical argumentsfor not limiting extraction to minimal rules, val idated them on concrete examples, and presented experiments showing that contextually richer rulesprovide a 3.63 BLEU point increase over the min imal rules of (Galley et al, 2004).
