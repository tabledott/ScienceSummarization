s the generalized vertex vnew g with all the vertices which are connected with vg and vp.
    As an optimization step, we merge only vertices and edges that are included in equal spanning templates.
    Extracting the templates GSL extracts all maximal most general templates from the final compact representation Gn using the following sub-algorithm: In Figure 2 the maximal most general template in obj As a last step, names and numbers are filtered out from the templates.
    Moreover, TE removes those templates which are very long or which appear with just one anchor set and in less than four sentences.
    Finally, the templates are sorted first by the number of anchor sets with which each template appeared, and then by the number of sentences in which they appeared.
  
  
    We evaluated the results of the TE/ASE algorithm on a random lexicon of verbal forms and then assessed its performance on the extracted data through human-based judgments.
    The test set for human evaluation was generated by picking
