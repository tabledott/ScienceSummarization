cal lexicon models.
    These models are able to infer translations of word forms from the translations of other word forms of the same lemma.
    Furthermore, they use morpho-syntactic information to resolve categorial ambiguity.
    In Section 5, we describe how disambiguation between different readings and their corresponding translations can be performed when no context is available, as is typically the case for conventional electronic dictionaries.
    Section 6 provides an overview of our procedure for training model parameters for statistical machine translation with scarce resources.
    Experimental results are reported in Section 7.
    Section 8 concludes the presentation with a discussion of the achievements of this work.
    In statistical machine translation, every target language string eI1 = e1 &#183; &#183; &#183; eI is assigned a probability Pr(eI1) of being a valid word sequence in the target language and a probability Pr(eI1|f J1) of being a translation for the given source language string
