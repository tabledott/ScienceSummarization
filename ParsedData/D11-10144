    The dataset consists of very personal confessions anonymously made by people on the experience project website www.experienceproject.com.
    Confessions are labeled with a set of five reactions by other users.
    Reaction labels are you rock (expressing approvement), tehee (amusement), I understand, Sorry, hugs and Wow, just wow (displaying shock).
    For evaluation on this dataset we predict both the label with the most votes as well as the full distribution over the sentiment categories.
    On both tasks our model outperforms competitive baselines.
    A set of over 31,000 confessions as well as the code of our model are available at www.socher.org.
    After describing the model in detail, we evaluate it qualitatively by analyzing the learned n-gram vector representations and compare quantitatively against other methods on standard datasets and the EP dataset.
  
  
    Our model aims to find vector representations for variable-sized phrases in either unsupervised or semi-supervised training r
