on is performed using a gradient-based search; the gradients are dervied by Minka (2003).
    This procedure is iterated until convergence or a maximum of twenty iterations.
  
  
    One of the key advantages of a Bayesian framework for topic segmentation is that it permits the principled combination of multiple data sources, even without labeled data.
    We are especially interested in cue phrases, which are explicit markers for discourse structure, such as &#8220;now&#8221; or &#8220;first&#8221; (Grosz and Sidner, 1986; Hirschberg and Litman, 1993; Knott, 1996).
    Cue phrases have previously been used in supervised topic segmentation (e.g., Galley et al. 2003); we show how they can be used in an unsupervised setting.
    The previous section modeled lexical cohesion by treating the bag of words in each sentence as a series of draws from a multinomial language model indexed by the topic segment.
    To incorporate cue phrases, this generative model is modified to reflect the idea that some of the text w
