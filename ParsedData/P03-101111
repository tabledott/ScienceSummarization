computational complexity as well as data sparsity prevent us from considering arbitrarily large elementary trees, and the number of nodes considered at once still limits the possible alignments.
    For example, with our maximum of two nodes, no transformation of the tree the generative probability model should be thought of as only generating single nodes on the target side.
    Thus, the alignment algorithm is constrained by the bracketing on the target side, but does not generate the entire target tree structure.
    While the probability model for tree transformation operates from the top of the tree down, probability estimation for aligning two trees takes place by iterating through pairs of nodes from each tree in bottom-up order, as sketched below: for all nodes &#949;a in source tree Ta in bottom-up order do for all elementary trees ta rooted in &#949;a do for all nodes &#949;b in target tree Tb in bottom-up order do for all elementary trees tb rooted in &#949;b do The outer two loops, iterating over
