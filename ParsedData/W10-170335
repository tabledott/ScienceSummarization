removing workers this way, to choose a cutoff carefully so that no criterion is degraded dramatically.
    In Appendix A, after reporting head-to-head comparisons using only the expert data, we also report head-to-head comparisons using the expert 15In retrospect, we should have performed this type of analysis as the data was being collected, since such workers could have been identified early on and blocked. data combined with the MTurk data, in order to be able to detect more significant differences between the systems.
    We choose the 300-worker point as a reasonable cutoff point before combining the MTurk data with the expert data, based on the characteristics of the MTurk data at that point: a high reference preference rate, high interannotator agreement, and, critically, a kappa coefficient vs. expert data of 0.449, which is close to the expert inter-annotator kappa coefficient of 0.439.
    In the previous subsection, we outlined an approach by which MTurk data can be filtered out using expert data.
