 pattern and built a gold standard for them (by manually tagging each instance as correct or incorrect).
    We then sorted the 100 instances according to the scoring formula S(i) derived in Section 3.3 and computed the average precision, recall, and F-score of each top-K ranked instances for each pattern5.
    Due to lack of space, we only present the graphs for four of the 22 generic patterns: &#8220;X is a Y&#8221; for the is-a relation of Table 2, &#8220;X in the Y&#8221; for the part-of relation of Table 4, &#8220;X in Y&#8221; for the part-of relation of Table 5, and &#8220;X and Y&#8221; for the reaction relation of Table 7.
    Figure 1 illustrates the results.
    In each figure, notice that recall climbs at a much faster rate than precision decreases.
    This indicates that the scoring function of Section 3.3 effectively separates correct and incorrect instances.
    In Figure 1a), there is a big initial drop in precision that accounts for the poor precision reported in Table 1.
    Recall that the
