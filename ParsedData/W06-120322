considered local word sequences.
    Certainly some recognition of the syntactic structure would improve results.
    These are, however, more general issues associated with MWE processing.
    Rather promising results were attained using only local context, however.
    Our study shows that the F-score measure is maximized by taking as threshold for distinguishing non-compositional phrases from compositional ones a cosine similarity value somewhere between 0.1-0.2.
    An important point to be explored is that compositionality appears to come in degrees.
    As Bannard and Lascarides (2003) have noted, MWEs &#8220;do not fall cleanly into the binary classes of compositional and non-compositional expressions, but populate a continuum between the two extremes.&#8221; While our experiment was designed to classify MWEs, the technique described here, of course, provides a means, if rather a blunt one, for quantifying the degreee of compositonality of an expression.
