on between OWN, OTHER, and BACKGROUND material) is an important part of our annotation scheme, we conducted a second experiment measuring how well our annotators could distinguish just these three roles, using the same annotators and 22 different articles.
    We wrote seven pages of new guidelines describing the semantics of the three categories.
    Results show higher stability compared to the full annotation scheme (K = .83, .79, .81; N = 1,248; k = 2) and higher reproducibility (K = .78, N = 4,031, k = 3), corresponding to 94%, 93%, and 93% agreement (stability) and 93% (reproducibility).
    It is most remarkable that agreement of annotation of intellectual attribution in the abstracts is almost perfect: K = .98 (N = 89, k = 3), corresponding to 99% agreement.
    This points to the fact that authors, when writing abstracts for their papers, take care to make it clear to whom a certain statement is attributed.
    This effect also holds for the annotation with the full scheme with all seven categories:
