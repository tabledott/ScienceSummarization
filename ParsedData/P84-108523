    (For longer lists of discourse marking devices, and somewhat more discussion of their functioning, see Reichman (1981) and Polanyi and Scha(1983b).)
    In terms of our ATN description of discourse structure, the PUSH- and POP-markers do almost exactly what their names suggest.
    A PUSH-marker signals the creation of a new embedded discourse constituent, while a POP-marker signals a return to an embedding constituent (though not necessarily the immediately embedding one), closing off the current constituent and all the intermediate ones.
    The fact that one POP-marker may thus create a whole cascade of discourse-POPs was one of Reichman's (1981) argume
