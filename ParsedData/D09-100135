    This paper introduces the first unsupervised approach to learning semantic parsers.
    Our USP system is based on Markov logic, and recursively clusters expressions to abstract away syntactic variations of the same meaning.
    We have successfully applied USP to extracting a knowledge base from biomedical text and answering questions based on it.
    Directions for future work include: better handling of antonyms, subsumption relations among expressions, quantifier scoping,
