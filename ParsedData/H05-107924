There is hardly any overall difference in accuracybetween the shallow and the deep classifier.
			How ever, it seems that the shallow classifier in its currentform has very little potential outside of the CD subset whereas the deep classifier shows a more promis ing performance for several subsets.
			Experiment 5: Hybrid classification As shallow and deep classifiers seem to perform differently on differently designed
