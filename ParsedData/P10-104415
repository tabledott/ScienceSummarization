ble pairs of multinomials (Qz, -yz), LinkLDA allows the arguments of a given extraction to be generated from IZ12 possible pairs.
    Thus, instead of imposing a hard constraint that z1 = z2 (as in JointLDA), LinkLDA simply assigns a higher probability to states in which z1 = z2, because both hidden variables are drawn from the same (sparse) distribution 0r.
    LinkLDA can thus re-use argument classes, choosing different combinations of topics for the arguments if it fits the data better.
    In Section 4 we show experimentally that LinkLDA outperforms JointLDA (and IndependentLDA) by wide margins.
    We use LDA-SP to refer to LinkLDA in all the experiments below.
    For all the models we use collapsed Gibbs sampling for inference in which each of the hidden variables (e.g., zr,i,1 and zr,i,2 in LinkLDA) are sampled sequentially conditioned on a fullassignment to all others, integrating out the parameters (Griffiths and Steyvers, 2004).
    This produces robust parameter estimates, as it allows computation
