 two methods, we not only (implicitly) apply the phonetic filter, but also exploit the discriminative power provided by the phonetic correspondence scores and this is shown to bring in additional benefit, giving the best performance among all the methods.
    From the results above, we see that the MRRs for the core English names are substantially higher than those for all the English names.
    This means that our methods perform very well whenever we have the answer in our candidate list, but we have also missed the answers for many English names.
    The missing of an answer in the candidate list is thus a major source of errors.
    To further understand the upper bound of our method, we manually add the missing correct answers to our candidate set and apply all the methods to rank this augmented set of candidates.
    The performance is reported in Table 4 with the corresponding performance on the original candidate set.
    We see that, as expected, the performance on the augmented candidate list, which
