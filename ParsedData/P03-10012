elations that we extract.
    Our strategy is to collect a large sample of newspaper text (15GB) and use multiple part of speech patterns to extract the semantic relations.
    We then filter out the noise from these extracted relations using a machine-learned classifier.
    This process generates a high precision repository of information that can be accessed quickly and easily.
    We test the feasibility of this strategy on one semantic relation and a challenging subset of questions, i.e., &#8220;Who is ...&#8221; questions, in which either a concept is presented and an instance is requested (e.g., &#8220;Who is the mayor of Boston?&#8221;), or an instance is presented and a concept is requested (e.g., &#8220;Who is Jennifer Capriati?&#8221;).
    By choosing this subset of questions we are able to focus only on answers given by concept-instance relationships.
    While this paper examines only this type of relation, the techniques we propose are easily extensible to other question types.
