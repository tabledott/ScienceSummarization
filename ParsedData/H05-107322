his fact also illustrated that fea tures work together; removing any group degraded performance because features interact and there isno true independence.
			It was observed that features?

			Clearly, further work on developing features which fit the TEP problem is needed.
	
	
			This was a ?first pass?

			At this point, the annotation project is still on-going, and we only had a fairly small data set to draw on.Nevertheless, results indicate that our learning ap proach benefits emotion recognition.
			For example, the following instances, also labeled with the same valence by both annotators, were correctly classifiedboth in the binary (N vs. E) and the tripartite polar ity task (N, NE, PE), given the separated tuning and evaluation data condition, and using all features: (1a) E/NE: Then he offered the dwarfs money, and prayed and besought them to let him take her away; but they said, ?We will not part with her for all the g
