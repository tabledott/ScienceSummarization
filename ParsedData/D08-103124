se coreference value rather than implicitly incorporating distance by linking only the closest pair whose score is above a threshold, as done by e.g.
    Soon et al. (2001).
    Looking at examples, we find that adding distances allows the system to associate the pronoun it with this missile not separated by any mentions, rather than Tehran, which is separated from it by many mentions.
    Predicted Entity Types Since no two mentions can have different entity types (person, organization, geo-political entity, etc.) and be coreferential, this feature has strong discriminative power.
    When the entity types match, 13% of examples are positive compared to only 6% of examples in general.
    Qualitatively, the entity type prediction correctly recognizes the Gulf region as a geo-political entity, and He as a person, and thus prevents linking the two.
    Likewise, the system discerns Baghdad from ambassador due to the entity type.
    However, in some cases an identity type match can cause the system to be overl
