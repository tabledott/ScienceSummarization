			In this paper, we in troduce a measure of semantic relatedness based on thedivergence of the distinct stationary distributions result ing from random walks centered at different positions in the word graph.
			We believe we are the first to define such a measure.
	
	
			Our model is based on a random walk of a particle through a simple directed graphG = (V,E)whose nodes V and edges E are extracted from WordNet version 2.1.
			Formally, we define the probability n(t)i of finding the particle at node ni ? V at time t as the sum of all ways in which the particle could have reached ni from any other node at the previous time-step: n(t)i = ? nj?V n(t?1)j P (ni | nj)where P (ni | nj) is the conditional probability of moving to ni given that the particle is at nj . In partic ular, we construct the transition distribution such that P (ni | nj) &gt; 0 whenever WordNet specifies a local link relationship of the form j ? i. Note that this randomwalk is a Markov chain because the transition probabilities at
