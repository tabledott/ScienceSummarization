    Word cluster features have been shown to be useful in various tasks in natural language processing, including syntactic dependency parsing (Koo et al., 2008; Haffari et al., 2011; Tratz and Hovy, 2011), syntactic chunking (Turian et al., 2010), and NER (Freitag, 2004; Miller et al., 2004; Turian et al., 2010; Faruqui and Pad&#180;o, 2010).
    Intuitively, the reason for the effectiveness of cluster features lie in their ability to aggregate local distributional information from large unlabeled corpora, which aid in conquering data sparsity in supervised training regimes as well as in mitigating cross-domain generalization issues.
    While the use of class-to-class transitions can lead to more compact models, which is often useful for conquering data sparsity, when clustering large data sets we can get reliable statistics directly on the wordto
