ed by the maximum distance from the origin.
    2.
    We consider two parsing directions (Forward/Backward) for each representation, i.e. systems for a single training data set.
    Then, we employ SVMs training using these independent chunk representations.
    Leave-One-Out bound for each of 8 systems.
    As for cross validation, we employ the steps 1 and 2 for each divided training data, and obtain the weights.
    4.
    We test these 8 systems with a separated test data set.
    Before employing weighted voting, we have to convert them into a uniform representation, since the tag sets used in individual 8 systems are different.
    For this purpose, we re-convert each of the estimated results into 4 representations (IOB1/IOB2/IOE2/IOE1).
    5.
    We employ weighted voting of 8 systems with respect to the converted 4 uniform representations and the 4 voting schemes respectively.
    Finally, we have (types of uniform representations) 4 (types of weights) results for our experiments.
    Although we ca
