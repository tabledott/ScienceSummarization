rpus, and armed with that knowledge, we will be able to compute the compressed length of the corpus.
    The morphology assigns a probability to each word w as the product of the probability of w's signature times w's stem, given its signature, and w's suffix, given its signature: prob (w = t +f) = prob (a) prob (t I a) prob (f I a), where a is the signature associated with t: a = sig(t).
    Thus while stems and suffixes, which are defined relative to a particular morphological model, are assigned their empirical frequency as their probability, words are assigned a probability based on the model, one which will always depart from the empirical frequency.
    The compression to the corpus is thus worse than would be a compression based on word frequency alone,' or to put it another way, the morphological analysis in which all words are unanalyzed is the analysis in which each word is trivially assigned its own empirical frequency (since the word equals the stem).
    But this decrease in compression that come
