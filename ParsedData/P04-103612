this by a large margin.
    The first sense in SemCor provides an upperbound for this task of 67%.
    Since both measures gave comparable results we restricted our remaining experiments to jcn because this gave good results for finding the predominant sense, and is much more efficient than lesk, given the precompilation of the IC files.
    From manual analysis, there are cases where the acquired first sense disagrees with SemCor, yet is intuitively plausible.
    This is to be expected regardless of any inherent shortcomings of the ranking technique since the senses within SemCor will differ compared to those of the BNC.
    For example, in WordNet the first listed sense ofpipe is tobacco pipe, and this is ranked joint first according to the Brown files in SemCor with the second sense tube made of metal or plastic used to carry water, oil or gas etc....
    The automatic ranking from the BNC data lists the latter tube sense first.
    This seems quite reasonable given the nearest neighbours: tube, cable, wi
