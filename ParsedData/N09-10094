ed as follows.
    In &#167;2, we give a brief explanation of probabilistic grammars and introduce some notation for the specific type of dependency grammar used in this paper, due to Klein and Manning (2004).
    In &#167;3, we present our model and a variational inference algorithm for it.
    In &#167;4, we report on experiments for both monolingual settings and a bilingual setting and discuss them.
    We discuss future work (&#167;5) and conclude in &#167;6.
  
  
    A probabilistic grammar defines a probability distribution over grammatical derivations generated through a step-by-step process.
    HMMs, for example, can be understood as a random walk through a probabilistic finite-state network, with an output symbol sampled at each state.
    Each &#8220;step&#8221; of the walk and each symbol emission corresponds to one derivation step.
    PCFGs generate phrase-structure trees by recursively rewriting nonterminal symbols as sequences of &#8220;child&#8221; symbols (each itself either a nonterminal s
