work (Raybaud et al., 2011), amounting to 66 features.
    A feature selection algorithm is used in order to remove non-informative features.
    No additional data other than that provided for the shared task is considered.
    The training data is split into a training part (1000 sentences) and a development part (832 sentences) to learn the regression model and optimise the parameters of the regression and for feature selection.
    UPC (R, S): The systems use several features on top of the baseline features.
    These are mostly based on different language models estimated on reference and automatic Spanish translations of the news-v7 corpus.
    The automatic translations are generated by the system used for the shared task.
    N-gram LMs are estimated on word forms, POS tags, stop words interleaved by POS tags, stop-word patterns, plus variants in which the POS tags are replaced with the stem or root of each target word.
    The POS tags on the target side are obtained by projecting source side annotat
