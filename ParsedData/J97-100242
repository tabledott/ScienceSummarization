scribe the route using the swamp) and attempts by the route follower to move on (such as &amp;quot;Where do I go now?&amp;quot;).
    Both of these confusions can be corrected by clarifying the instructions.
    In addition, there were a few cases where coders were allowed to place a boundary on either side of a discourse marker, but the coders did not agree.
    Using the speech would probably help, but most uses of transaction coding would not require boundary placement this precise.
    OVERVIEW transactions were too rare to be reliable or useful and should be dropped from future coding systems.
    Finally, coders had a problem with &amp;quot;grain size&amp;quot;; one coder had many fewer transactions than the other coders, with each transaction covering a segment of the route which other coders split into two or more transactions, indicating that he thought the route givers were planning ahead much further than the other coders did.
    This is a general problem for discourse and dialogue segmentation.
