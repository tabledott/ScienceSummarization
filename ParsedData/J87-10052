 a branch of computer science, ought to be the design of algorithms.
    A large number of algorithms have undoubtedly been devised for dealing with problems every researcher has to face in constructing a natural language system, but they simply have not received wide circulation.
    These algorithms are part of the &amp;quot;folk culture&amp;quot;, buried in the most technical, unreadable portions of theses, passed among colleagues informally at best, and often reinvented.
    It should be a practice to publish these algorithms in isolation, independent of a particular implementation or system.
    This paper constitutes an effort to initiate such a practice.
    A problem that many natural-language efforts have faced is the recovery of implicit semantic scope dependency possibilities &#8212; such as those manifest in quantifiers and modals &#8212; from predicate-argument relations and relations of grammatical subordination, which are more or less transparently conveyed by the syntactic structure of sentenc
