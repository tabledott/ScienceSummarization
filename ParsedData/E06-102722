= 8.
			Defined this way, the S-function assigns highest degree of membership (=1) to words that have the the Net Overlap Score u ? 15.
			The accuracy vs. GI-H4 on this subset is 100%.
			The accuracy goes down as the degree of membership decreases and reaches 59% for values with the lowest degrees of membership.
	
	
			This paper contributes to the development of NLP and semantic tagging systems in several respects.
			The structure of the semantic category of sentiment.
			The analysis of the category of sentiment of English adjectives presented here suggests that this category is structured as a fuzzy set: the distance from the coreof the category, as measured by Net Over lap scores derived from multiple STEP runs,is shown to affect both the level of interannotator agreement and the system perfor mance vs. human-annotated gold standard.
			The list of sentiment-bearing adjectives.
			The list produced and cross-validated by multipleSTEP runs contains 7, 814 positive and negative English adjectives, with a
