    The parser we deploy, like the XLE one, is based on a manually-defined feature-based unification grammar.
    However, the approach is somewhat different, making maximal use of more generic structural rather than lexical information, both within the grammar and the probabilistic parse selection model.
    Here we compare the accuracy of our parser with Kaplan et al.&#8217;s results, by repeating their experiment with our parser.
    This comparison is not straightforward, given both the systemspecific nature of some of the annotation in DepBank and the scoring reported.
    We, therefore, extend DepBank with a set of grammatical relations derived from our own system output and highlight how issues of representation and scoring can affect results and their interpretation.
    In &#167;2, we describe our development methodology and the resulting system in greater detail.
    &#167;3 describes the extended Depbank that we have developed and motivates our additions.
