lassifier using only the content features achieves the worst accuracy (78.8%).
    Sentiment lexicon features are shown to be very helpful for improving the performance.
    Similarly, we re-implemented the method proposed by (Barbosa and Feng, 2010) in this experiment.
    The results show that our system using both content features and sentiment lexicon features performs slightly better than (Barbosa and Feng, 2010).
    The reason may be same as that we explained above.
    Again, the classifier using all features achieves the best performance.
    Both the classifiers with all features and with the combination of content and sentiment lexicon features are significantly better than that with only the content features (p &lt; 0.01).
    However, the classifier with all features does not significantly outperform that using the combination of content and sentiment lexicon features.
    We also note that the improvement by target-dependent features here is not as large as that in subjectivity classification.
