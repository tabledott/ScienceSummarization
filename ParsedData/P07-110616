ond international Chinese word segmentation bakeoffs (Sproat and Emerson, 2003; Emerson, 2005).
    The accuracies are compared to other models in the literature.
    F-measure is used as the accuracy measure.
    Define precision p as the percentage of words in the decoder output that are segmented correctly, and recall r as the percentage of gold standard output words that are correctly segmented by the decoder.
    The (balanced) F-measure is 2pr/(p + r).
    CWS systems are evaluated by two types of tests.
    The closed tests require that the system is trained only with a designated training corpus.
    Any extra knowledge is not allowed, including common surnames, Chinese and Arabic numbers, European letters, lexicons, part-of-speech, semantics and so on.
    The open tests do not impose such restrictions.
    Open tests measure a model&#8217;s capability to utilize extra information and domain knowledge, which can lead to improved performance, but since this extra information is not standardized, direc
