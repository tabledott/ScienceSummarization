as habitats are yet to be normalized by the field community, presents an opportunity for the BioNLP community to contribute to the standardization effort.
    The BI task (Jourde et al., 2011) is devoted to the extraction of bacterial molecular interactions and regulations from publication abstracts.
    Mainly focused on gene transcriptional regulation in Bacillus subtilis, the BI corpus is provided to participants with rich semantic annotation derived from a recently proposed ontology (Manine et al., 2009) defining ten entity types such as gene, protein and derivatives as well as DNA sites/motifs.
    Their interactions are described through ten relation types.
    The BI corpus consists of the sentences of the LLL corpus (N&#180;edellec, 2005), provided with manually checked linguistic annotations.
    The main tasks are characterized in Table 1.
    From the text type perspective, BioNLP-ST 2011 generalizes from abstracts in 2009 to full papers (GE and ID) and web pages (BB).
    It also includes data col
