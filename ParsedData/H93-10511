greater than 70%.
  Furthermore, the response patterns of the classifiers are, for the most part, statistically indistinguishable from one another.
  Comparison of the two tasks suggests that the degree of difficulty involved in resolving individual senses is a greater performance factor than the degree of polysemy.
  INTRODUCTION The goal of this study is to systematical ly explore the effects of such variables as the number of  senses per word and the number of training examples per sense on corpus-based statistical sense resolution methods.
  To en- able us to study the effects of  the number of word senses, we selected the highly polysemous noun line, which has 25 senses in WordNet.
  1 Automat ic  sense resolution systems need to resolve highly polysemous words.
  As Zipf [2] pointed out in 1945, frequently occurring words tend to be polysemous.
  The words encountered in a given text will have far greater polysemy than one would assume by simply tak- ing the overall percentage of po]ysemous words in the
