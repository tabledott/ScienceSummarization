ng correction.
    This paper describes an improvement to noisy channel spelling correction via a more powerful model of spelling errors, be they typing mistakes or cognitive errors, than has previously been employed.
    Our model works by learning generic string to string edits, along with the probabilities of each of these edits.
    This more powerful model gives significant improvements in accuracy over previous approaches to noisy channel spelling correction.
  
  
    This paper will address the problem of automatically training a system to correct generic single word spelling errors.1 We do not address the problem of correcting specific word set confusions such as {to,too,two} (see (Golding and Roth 1999)).
    We will define the spelling correction problem abstractly as follows: Given an alphabet &#931; , a dictionary D consisting of strings in &#931; * and a string s, where s &#8713; D and s &#8712; &#931; *, find the word w&#8712; D that is most likely to have been erroneously input as s. The requi
