istics Volume 19, Number 2 the POS tagging phase is automatically parsed and simplified to yield a skeletal syn- tactic representation, which is then corrected by human annotators.
  After presenting the set of syntactic tags that we use, we illustrate and discuss the bracketing process.
  In particular, we will outline various factors that affect the speed with which annotators are able to correct bracketed structures, a task that--not surprisingly--is considerably more difficult than correcting POS-tagged text.
  Finally, Section 5 describes the com- position and size of the current Treebank corpus, briefly reviews some of the research projects that have relied on it to date, and indicates the directions that the project is likely to take in the future.
  Part-of-Speech Tagging 2.1 A Simplified POS Tagset for English The POS tagsets used to annotate large corpora in the past have traditionally been fairly extensive.
  The pioneering Brown Corpus distinguishes 87 simple tags (Francis 1964; Francis and Ku~era
