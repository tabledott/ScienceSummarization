currences of patterns A and B) is independently and identically distributed (iid).
    We have found this assumption reasonable, but its breakdown has led to a few errors.
    In particular, a drawback of the NANC is the occurrence of repeated articles; since the corpus consists of all of the articles that come over the wire, some days include multiple, updated versions of the same story, containing identical paragraphs or sentences.
    We wrote programs to weed out such cases, but ultimately found them of little use.
    First, &amp;quot;update&amp;quot; articles still have substantial variation, so there is a continuum between these and articles that are simply on the same topic.
    Second, our data is so sparse that any such repeats are very unlikely to manifest themselves as repeated examples of part-type patterns.
    Nevertheless since two or three occurrences of a word can make it rank highly, our results have a few anomalies that stem from failure of the lid assumption (e.g., quite appropriately, &a
