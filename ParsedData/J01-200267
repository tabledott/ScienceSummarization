    Combination of ensembles of classifiers, although well-established in the machine learning literature, has only recently been applied as a method for increasing accuracy in natural language processing tasks.
    There has of course always been a lot of research on the combination of different methods (e.g., knowledge-based and statistical) in hybrid systems, or on the combination of different information sources.
    Some of that work even explicitly uses voting and could therefore also be counted as an ensemble approach.
    For example, Rigau, Atserias, and Agirre (1997) combine different heuristics for word sense disambiguation by voting, and Agirre et al. (1998) do the same for spelling correction evaluation heuristics.
    The difference between single classifiers learning to combine information sources, i.e., their input features (see Roth [1998] for a general framework), and the combination of ensembles of classifiers trained on subsets of those features is not always ve
