ese two amounts is taken to be the information contained in 11w, r, w' II =c&#8226; An occurrence of a dependency triple (w, r, w') can be regarded as the co-occurrence of three events: A: a randomly selected word is w; B: a randomly selected dependency type is r; C: a randomly selected word is w1.
    When the value of II w, r, w' II is unknown, we assume that A and C are conditionally independent given B.
    The probability of A, B and C cooccurring is estimated by where PALE is the maximum likelihood estimation of a probability distribution and II cell, obj -of, bludgeon11=1 lIcell, obj-of, cal111.11 cell, obj-of, come from11=3 When the value of II w, r, w' II is known, we can obtain PALE (A, B, C) directly: Let /(w, r, w') denote the amount information contained in 11w, r, w1 II=c.
    Its value can be cornIt is worth noting that 1(w,r,w') is equal to the mutual information between w and w' (Hindle, 1990).
    Let T(W) be the set of pairs (r, w') such that log x 1,r,is positive.
    We define the similar
