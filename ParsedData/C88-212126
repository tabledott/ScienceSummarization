cally mo- tivated structures.
  TAGs have been shown to be naturally lexicalized.
  Then we gave an overview of the specific lex- icon of TAGs.
  The %xicalization ~ of grammar lead us to introduce a two step parsing strategy.
  The first step picks up the set of structures corresponding to each word in the sentence.
  The second step puts the argument structures into predicate structures.
  Therefore, the relationship be- tween the morphological nd syntactic analyses has been modified.
  In the first step, structures instead of categories are associated with lexical items.
  The strategy has been shown to be able to use non-local information in the in- put string.
  Also problems due to recursion are eliminated.
  The grammar of the parser has been reduced to a set of structures whose size is proportional to the length Of the input sentence.
  Furthermore, the parsing strategy applies to any parsing algorithm; in particular top-down.
  It can be formalized into a decidable deduction system that has finite se
