e length increased, the parsing performance also improved.
  
  
    Our work most closely relates to Hwa et al. (2005), who proposed to learn generative dependency grammars using Collins&#8217; parser (Collins, 1999) by constructing full target parses via projected dependencies and completion/transformation rules.
    Hwa et al. (2005) found that transferring dependencies directly was not sufficient to get a parser with reasonable performance, even when both the source language parses and the word alignments are performed by hand.
    They adjusted for this by introducing on the order of one or two dozen language-specific transformation rules to complete target parses for unaligned words and to account for diverging annotation rules.
    Transferring from English to Spanish in this way, they achieve 72.1% and transferring to Chinese they achieve 53.9%.
    Our learning method is very closely related to the work of (Mann and McCallum, 2007; Mann and McCallum, 2008) who concurrently developed the idea of using
