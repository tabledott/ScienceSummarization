  In applying active learning for domain adaptation, Zhang et al. (2003) presented work on sentence boundary detection using generalized Winnow, while Tur et al.
    (2004) performed language model adaptation of automatic speech recognition systems.
    In both papers, out-of-domain and indomain data were simply mixed together without MAP estimation such as count-merging.
    For WSD, Fujii et al. (1998) used selective sampling for a Japanese language WSD system, Chen et al.
    (2006) used active learning for 5 verbs using coarse-grained evaluation, and H. T. Dang (2004) employed active learning for another set of 5 verbs.
    However, their work only investigated the use of active learning to reduce the annotation effort necessary for WSD, but did not deal with the porting of a WSD system to a different domain.
    Escudero et al. (2000) used the DSO corpus to highlight the importance of the issue of domain dependence of WSD systems, but did not propose methods such as active learning or countmerging to add
