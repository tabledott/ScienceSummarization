  Table 6 shows our results.
    With groups, we achieve an F1 of 53.2.
    Though we still trail supervised techniques, which attain numbers in the 68&#8211;80 range, we have made substantial progress over our baseline using an unsupervised method.
    Furthermore, our model provides a more detailed analysis of the correspondence between the world state and text, rather than just producing a single alignment decision.
    Most of the remaining errors made by our model are due to a lack of calibration.
    Sometimes, our false positives are close calls where a sentence indirectly references a record, and our model predicts the alignment whereas the annotation standard does not.
    We believe that further progress is possible with a richer model.
  
  
    We have presented a generative model of correspondences between a world state and an unsegmented stream of text.
    By having a joint model of salience, coherence, and segmentation, as well as a detailed rendering of the values in the world state into word
