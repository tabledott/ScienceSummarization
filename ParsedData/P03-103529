esults.
    We picked 933 sentences at random containing 22,833 words (including 329 PNs, 617 LNs, and 435 ONs) for testing.
    We also did not differentiate LNs and ONs in evaluation.
    That is, we only checked the word boundaries of LNs and ONs and treated both tags exchangeable.
    The results are shown in Table 2.
    We can see that in this small test set SCM achieves the best overall performance of NER and the best performance of resolving OAS.
  
  
    The contributions of this paper are three-fold.
    First, we formulate the Chinese word segmentation problem as a set of correlated problems, which are better solved simultaneously, including word breaking, morphological analysis, factoid detection and NER.
    Second, we present a unified approach to these problems using the improved source-channel models.
    The models provide a simple statistical framework to incorporate a wide variety of linguistic knowledge and statistical models in a unified way.
    Third, we evaluate the system&#8217;s per
