general relation of interest.
    To ensure high-levels of coverage on a perrelation basis, we need, for example to deduce that &#8220; &#8217;s headquarters in&#8221;, &#8220;is headquartered in&#8221; and &#8220;is based in&#8221; are different ways of expressing HEADQUARTERS(X,Y).
    Second, a relation-independent extraction process makes it difficult to leverage the full set of features typically used when performing extraction one relation at a time.
    For instance, the presence of the words company and headquarters will be useful in detecting instances of the HEADQUARTERS(X,Y) relation, but are not useful features for identifying relations in general.
    Finally, RE systems typically use named-entity types as a guide (e.g., the second argument to HEADQUARTERS should be a LOCATION).
    In Open IE, the relations are not known in advance, and neither are their argument types.
    The unique nature of the open extraction task has led us to develop O-CRF, an open extraction system that uses the power of
