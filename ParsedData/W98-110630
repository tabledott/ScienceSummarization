semantic preferences.
    These conceptual roles are assigned automatically based on a pattern's semantic profile.
    This process eliminates the need for a human to assign roles to the extraction patterns by hand, as had been necessary when using AutoSlog or AutoSlog-TS by themselves.
    For example, the pattern &amp;quot;machinegunned &lt;direct-obj&gt;&amp;quot; had strong semantic preferences for BUILDING, CIVILIAN, LOCATION, and VEHICLE, so it was expanded to have three conceptual roles with four selectional restrictions.
    The expanded extraction pattern for &amp;quot;machinegunned &lt;direct-obj&gt;&amp;quot; is: Only semantic categories that were associated with a pattern are included as selectional restrictions.
    For example, the GOVOFFICIAL category also represents possible terrorism victims, but it was not strongly associated with the pattern.
    Our rationale is that an individual pattern may have a strong preference for only a subset of the categories that can be associated with a role.
