    We use the phrase-based SMT system, Portage (Sadat et al., 2005).
    For training, Portage uses IBM word alignment models (models 1 and 2) trained in both directions to extract phrase tables.
    Maximum phrase size used is 8.
    Trigram language models are implemented using the SRILM toolkit (Stolcke, 2002).
    Decoding weights are optimized using Och&#8217;s algorithm
