pretation in limited domains by &amp;quot;shallow&amp;quot; systems that avoid complex feature structures, and often perform only shallow syntactic analysis.
    For example, in the context of the Air Traveler Information System (ATIS) for spoken dialogue, Miller et al. (1996) computed the probability that a constituent such as &amp;quot;Atlanta&amp;quot; filled a semantic slot such as DESTiNATioN in a semantic frame for air travel.
    In a data-driven approach to information extraction, Riloff (1993) builds a dictionary of patterns for filling slots in a specific domain such as terrorist attacks, and Riloff and Schmelzenbach (1998) extend this technique to automatically derive entire case frames for words in the domain.
    These last systems make use of a limited amount of hand labor to accept or reject automatically generated hypotheses.
    They show promise for a more sophisticated approach to generalize beyond the relatively small number of frames considered in the tasks.
