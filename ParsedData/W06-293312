d Oflazer, 2006).
    It is then important to remember that an unlabeled attachment score of 75.8% corresponds to a word-to-word score of 82.7%, which puts Turkish on a par with languages like Czech, Dutch and Spanish.
    Moreover, when we break down the results according to whether the head of a dependency is part of a multiple-IG word or a complete (single-IG) word, we observe a highly significant difference in accuracy, with only 53.2% unlabeled attachment score for multiple-IG heads versus 83.7% for single-IG heads.
    It is hard to say at this stage whether this means that our methods are ill-suited for IG-based parsing, or whether it is mainly a case of sparse data for multiple-IG words.
    When we break down the results by dependency type, we can distinguish three main groups.
    The first consists of determiners and particles, which have an unlabeled attachment score over 80% and which are found within a distance of 1&#8211;1.4 IGs from their head.7 The second group mainly contains subjects, objec
