credentials are nothing which should be laughed at,&amp;quot; and makes the single mistake of attaching the relative clause at the sentential level, translating the sentence as &amp;quot;His credentials are nothing, which should make you laugh.&amp;quot; While the human translator must make some changes, he certainly needs to do less editing than he would if the sentence were completely misparsed.
    The more errors there are, the more editing the human translator needs to do.
    Thus, a criterion such as the Labelled Recall criterion is appropriate for this task, where the number of incorrect constituents correlates to application performance.
  
  
    Consider writing a parser for a domain such as machine assisted translation.
    One could use the Labelled Tree Algorithm, which would maximize the expected number of exactly correct parses.
    However, since the number of correct constituents is a better measure of application performance for this domain than the number of correct trees, perhaps one shou
