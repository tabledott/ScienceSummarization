ts.
  But this ignores the fact that utterances (1) and (5) have closely related propositional content in the first example, and that the plural pronoun straddles the central subsegment with the same referents be- ing picked out by they and their in the second ex- ample.
  Thus we allowed for hierarchical segments by treating the interruptions of 2-4 as subsegments, and utterances 1 and 5 as related parts of the parent segments.
  All interruptions were treated as embed- dings in this way.
  However the relationship of the segment after the interruption to the segment be- fore must be determined on independent grounds such as topic or intentional structure.
  3.2 Distr ibution Once we extended the control framework to allow for the embedding of interrupts, we coded every anaphor with respect o whether its antecedent lay outside or within the current segment.
  These are la- belled X (cross segment boundary antecedent) NX (no cross segment boundary), in Figure 1.
  In addi- tion we break these down as to which
