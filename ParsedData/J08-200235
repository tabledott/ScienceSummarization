mmed from cases such as those illustrated in Figure 4, where arguments were dislocated by raising or control verbs.
    Here, the predicate, expected, does not have a subject in the typical position&#8212; indicated by the empty NP&#8212;because the auxiliary is has raised the subject to its current position.
    In order to capture this class of examples, we use a binary feature, MISSING SUBJECT, indicating whether the predicate is &#8220;missing&#8221; its subject, and use this feature in conjunction with the PATH feature, so that we learn typical paths to raised subjects conditioned on the absence of the subject in its typical position.6 In the particular case of Figure 4, there is another instance of an argument being quite far from its predicate.
    The predicate widen shares the phrase the trade gap with expect as an ARG1 argument.
    However, as expect is a raising verb, widen&#8217;s subject is not in its typical position either, and we should expect to find it in the same position as expected&#8217
