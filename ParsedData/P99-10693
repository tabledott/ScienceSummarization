us a constant).
    PCFGs, Gibbs distributions, Maximum-Entropy distributions and Markov Random Fields are all examples of log-linear models.
    A log-linear model associates each feature f3 with a real-valued parameter 03.
    A log-linear model with m features is one in which the likelihood P(w) of an analysis w is: While the estimators described below make no assumptions about the range of the f, in the models considered here the value of each feature f2 (w) is the number of times a particular structural arrangement or configuration occurs in the analysis (..v, so fi(co) ranges over the natural numbers.
    For example, the features of a PCFG are indexed by productions, i.e., the value f(w) of feature f, is the number of times the ith production is used in the derivation w. This set of features induces a tree-structured dependency graph on the productions which is characteristic of Markov Branching Processes (Pearl, 1988; Frey, 1998).
    This tree structure has the important consequence that simple &amp;
