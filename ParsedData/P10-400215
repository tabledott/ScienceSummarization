erformance of cdec, Hiero, and Joshua 1.3 (running with 1 or 8 threads) decoding using a hierarchical phrase-based translation grammar and identical pruning settings.4 Figure 4 shows the cdec configuration and weights file used for this test.
    The workstation used has two 2GHz quad-core Intel Xenon processors, 32GB RAM, is running Linux kernel version 2.6.18 and gcc version 4.1.2.
    All decoders use SRI&#8217;s language model toolkit, version 1.5.9 (Stolcke, 2002).
    Joshua was run on the Sun HotSpot JVM, version 1.6.0 12.
    A hierarchical phrase-based translation grammar was extracted for the NIST MT03 Chinese-English translation using a suffix array rule extractor (Lopez, 2007).
    A non-terminal span limit of 15 was used, and all decoders were configured to use cube pruning with a limit of 30 candidates at each node and no further pruning.
    All decoders produced a BLEU score between 31.4 and 31.6 (small differences are accounted for by different tie-breaking behavior and OOV handling). formali
