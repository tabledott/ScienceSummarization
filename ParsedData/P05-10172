on, a notion in statistical physics.
    Magnetization indicates the global tendency of polarization.
    We empirically show that the proposed method works well even with a small number of seed words.
  
  
    Turney and Littman (2003) proposed two algorithms for extraction of semantic orientations of words.
    To calculate the association strength of a word with positive (negative) seed words, they used the number of hits returned by a search engine, with a query consisting of the word and one of seed words (e.g., &#8220;word NEAR good&#8221;, &#8220;word NEAR bad&#8221;).
    They regarded the difference of two association strengths as a measure of semantic orientation.
    They also proposed to use Latent Semantic Analysis to compute the association strength with seed words.
    An empirical evaluation was conducted on 3596 words extracted from General Inquirer (Stone et al., 1966).
    Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown (1997) focused on conjunctive expressions such as &#8220;simple and well-received&#8221;
