rce (1998)), memory-based sequence learning (e.g.
    Argamon et al. (1999)), and memory-based learning (e.g.
    Sang and Veenstra (1999)), among others.
    Our case study employs a well-known bracket representation, introduced by Ramshaw and Marcus, wherein each word of a sentence is tagged with one of the following tags: I, meaning the word is within a bracket (inside); 0, meaning the word is not within a bracket (outside); or B, meaning the word is within a bracket, but not the same bracket as the preceding word, i.e. the word begins a new bracket.
    Thus, the bracketing task is transformed into a word tagging task.
    Figure 2b repeats the example sentence, showing the JOB tag representation.
    Training examples for JOB tagging have the form where wo is the focus word (i.e. the word whose tag is to be learned) and to is its syntactic category (i.e. part-of-speech) tag.
    Words to the left and right of the focus word are included for context.
    Finally, / is the JOB tag of wo.
