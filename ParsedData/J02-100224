   We argue that this kind of error is less detrimental than the errors made by Pk.
    WindowDiff successfully distinguishes the near-miss error as a separate kind of error and penalizes it a different amount, something that Pk is unable to do.
    We explored a weighted version of WindowDiff, in which the penalty is weighted by the difference |ri &#8722; ai|.
    However, the results of the simulations were nearly identical with those of the nonweighted version of this metric, so we do not consider the weighted version further.
  
  
    This section describes a set of simulations that verify the theoretical analysis of the Pk metric presented above.
    It also reports the results of simulating two alternatives, including the proposed solution just described.
    For the simulation runs described below, three metrics were implemented: In these studies, a single trial consists of generating a reference segmentation of 1,000 segments with some distribution, generating different experimental segmentations of
