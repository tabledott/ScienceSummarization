rnel function detects if a tree subpart (common to both trees) belongs to the feature space that we intend to generate.
    For such purpose, the fragment types need to be described.
    We consider two important characterizations: the subtrees (STs) and the subset trees (SSTs).
    In our study, we consider syntactic parse trees, consequently, each node with its children is associated with a grammar production rule, where the symbol at left-hand side corresponds to the parent node and the symbols at right-hand side are associated with its children.
    The terminal symbols of the grammar are always associated with the leaves of the tree.
    For example, Figure 1 illustrates the syntactic parse of the sentence &amp;quot;Mary brought a cat to school&amp;quot;.
    We define as a subtree (ST) any node of a tree along with all its descendants.
    For example, the line in Figure 1 circles the subtree rooted in the NP node.
    A subset tree (SST) is a more general structure.
