    QA has approached the problem of the lexical gap by various techniques for question reformulation, including rule-based syntactic and semantic reformulation patterns (Hermjakob et al., 2002), reformulations based on shared dependency parses (Lin and Pantel, 2001), or various uses of the WordNet ontology to close the lexical gap word-by-word (Hovy et al., 2000; Prager et al., 2001; Harabagiu et al., 2001).
    Another use of natural language processing has been the deployment of SMT models on question-answer pairs for (re)ranking candidate answers which were either assumed to be contained in FAQ pages (Berger et al., 2000) or retrieved by baseline systems (Echihabi and Marcu, 2003; Soricut and Brill, 2006).
    IR has approached the term mismatch problem by various approaches to query expansion (Voorhees, 1994; Qiu and Frei, 1993; Xu and Croft, 1996).
    Inconclusive results have been reported for techniques that expand query terms separately by adding strongly related terms from an external thes
