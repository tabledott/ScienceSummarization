 has suggested the use of bootstrap tests (Efron and Tibshirani, 1993) for the calculation of confidence intervals for Bleu scores.
    (Koehn, 2004) gives empirical evidence that these give accurate estimates for Bleu statistics.
    However, correctness of the bootstrap method relies on some technical properties of the statistic (e.g., Bleu scores) being used (e.g., see (Wasserman, 2004) theorem 8.3); (Koehn, 2004; Zhang and Vogel, 2004) do not discuss whether Bleu scores meet any such criteria, which makes us uncertain of their correctness when applied to Bleu scores.
    .
    We can also calculate confidence intervals for the results.
    Define to be the probability that the reordered system improves on the baseline system, given that the two systems do not have equal performance.
    The relative frequency estimate of is .
    Using a normal approximation (e.g., see Example 6.17 from (Wasserman, 2004)) a 95% confidence interval for a sample size of 1785 is , giving a 95% confidence interval of for .
