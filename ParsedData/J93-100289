1983) describe an approach to parsing such examples based on parse 'fitting' or rule 'relaxation' to deal with 'ill-formed' input.
    An approach of this type might work with input that receives no parse, but cannot help with the identification of those that only receive an incorrect one.
    In addition, it involves annotating each grammar rule about what should be relaxed and requires that semantic interpretation can be extended to 'fitted' or partial parses (e.g.
    Pollack and Pereira 1988).
    Sampson, Haigh, and Atwell (1989) propose a more thorough-going probabilistic approach in which the parser uses a statistically defined measure of 'closest fit' to the set of analyses contained in a 'tree bank' of training data to assign an analysis.
    This approach attempts to ensure that analyses of new data will conform as closely as possible to existing ones, but does not require that analyses assigned are well formed with respect to any given generative grammar implicit in the tree bank analyses.
