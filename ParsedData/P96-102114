y means that certain translations are not considered.
    For the remainder of the paper, we take advantage of a convenient normal-form theorem (Wu, 1995a) that allows us to assume without loss of generality that the BTG only contains the binary-branching form for the non-lexical productions.4
  
  
    A first approach to improving the translation search is to limit the allowed word alignment patterns to those permitted by a BTG.
    In this case, Equation (2) is kept as the objective function and the translation channel can be parameterized similarly to Dagan ei al. (Dagan, Church, and Gale, 1993).
    The effect of the BTG restriction is just to constrain the shapes of the word-order distortions.
    A BTG rather than ITG is used since, as we discussed earlier, pure channel translation models operate without explicit grammars, providing no constituent categories around which a more sophisticated ITG could be structured.
    But the structural constraints of the BTG can improve search efficiency, even witho
