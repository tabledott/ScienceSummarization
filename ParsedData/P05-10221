 quality parses; the maximum probability parse trees (according to the parser&#8217;s model) have an f-score of 0.897 on section 23 of the Penn Treebank (Charniak, 2000), which is still state-of-the-art.
    However, the 50 best (i.e., the 50 highest probability) parses of a sentence often contain considerably better parses (in terms of f-score); this paper describes a 50-best parsing algorithm with an oracle f-score of 96.8 on the same data.
    The reranker attempts to select the best parse for a sentence from the 50-best list of possible parses for the sentence.
    Because the reranker only has to consider a relatively small number of parses per sentences, it is not necessary to use dynamic programming, which permits the features to be essentially arbitrary functions of the parse trees.
    While our reranker does not achieve anything like the oracle f-score, the parses it selects do have an f-score of 91.0, which is considerably better than the maximum probability parses of the n-best parser.
