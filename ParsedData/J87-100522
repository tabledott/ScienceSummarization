    Computational Linguistics, Volume 13, Numbers 1-2, January-June 1987 51 Jerry R. Hobbs and Stuart M. Shieber An Algorithm for Generating Quantifier Seopings The function apply(term, form) returns a wff consisting of the given complex term term applied to a form form in which it occurs.
    In addition, the restriction of the complex term is recursively scoped. function apply(term,form); let &lt;quant var restrict&gt; := term return wff(quant, var, pull(restrict,false), subst(var,term,form)).
    For the deterministic version of the algorithm, there are five special language constructs.
    The unary predicate empty(set) returns true if and only if set is empty.
    Paired braces &amp;quot;I ... I&amp;quot; constitute a set-forming operator.
    The binary function union applies its second argument (a lambda expression) to each of the elements of its first argument (a set).
    It returns a corresponding set of the values of the individual applications.
    The binary infix operator U returns th
