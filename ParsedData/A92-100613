itself, i.e. the pre-linguistic representation of text content and structure, that is subject to revision.
    Instead of being templates that limit the structure of the text to certain preconceived types, the schemas are now an explicit and compact representation of domain communication knowledge.
  
  
    The sentence planner combines all those planning tasks that are specific to the target language.
    It receives propositions from the text planner and sends the DSyntR of complete sentences to the realizer for processing.
    It has two main tasks: first, it chooses lexical and syntactic realizations by consulting the Conceptual/English dictionary; second, it determines sentence scope by merging the DSyntR of individual propositions.
    We will discuss each of these steps in turn.
    The Conceptual/English dictionary is implemented as a set of procedures that operate on the propositions.
    Each proposition is mapped into the DSyntR of a clause (i.e., its root is a verb).
    Lexicalization can take p
