			A hypergraph H is said to be acyclic if its graph projection G is a directed acyclic graph; then a topological ordering of H is an ordering of V that is a topological ordering in G (from sources to target).
			We assume the input hypergraph is acyclic so that we can use its topological ordering to traverse it.
			In practice the hypergraph is typically not known in advance, but the1Note that although we have defined the weight of a deriva tion as a function on derivations, in practice one would store a derivation?s weight inside the dbp itself, to avoid recomputing it over and over.
