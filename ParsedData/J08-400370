ective one.
    Comparing non-projective parsing to pseudo-projective parsing, it seems clear that both can improve parsing accuracy in the presence of significant amounts of nonprojective dependencies, but the former appears to be more stable in that it seldom or never hurts performance, whereas the latter can be expected to have a negative effect on accuracy when the amount of training data or non-projective dependencies (or both) is not high enough.
    Moreover, the non-projective parser tends to outperform the best pseudo-projective parsers, both on average and for individual languages.
    In fact, the pseudo-projective technique outperforms the non-projective parser only in combination with the arc-standard, stack-based parsing algorithm, and this seems to be due more to the arc-standard parsing strategy than to the pseudo-projective technique as such.
    The relevant question here is therefore why arc-standard parsing seems to work particularly well for some languages, with or without pseudo-projecti
