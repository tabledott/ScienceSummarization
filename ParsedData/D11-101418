e average number of votes per entry is 2.4 (with a variance of 33).
    For the five categories, the numbers of votes are [14, 816;13, 325;10, 073; 30, 844; 5, 801].
    Since an entry with less than 4 votes is not very well identified, we train and test only on entries with at least 4 total votes.
    There are 6,129 total such entries.
    The distribution over total votes in the 5 classes is similar: [0.22; 0.2; 0.11; 0.37; 0.1].
    The average length of entries is 129 words.
    Some entries contain multiple sentences.
    In these cases, we average the predicted label distributions from the sentences.
    Table 1 shows statistics of this and other commonly used sentiment datasets (which we compare on in later experiments).
    Table 2 shows example entries as well as gold and predicted label distributions as described in the next sections.
    Compared to other datasets, the EP dataset contains a wider range of human emotions that goes far beyond positive/negative product or movie reviews.
