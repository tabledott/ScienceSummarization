 we aggregate this information across the sentence.
    To determine which words are semantically oriented, in what direction, and the strength of their orientation, we measured their co-occurrence with words from a known seed set of semantically oriented words.
    The approach is based on the hypothesis that positive words co-occur more than expected by chance, and so do negative words; this hypothesis was validated, at least for strong positive/negative words, in (Turney, 2002).
    As seed words, we used subsets of the 1,336 adjectives that were manually classified as positive (657) or negative (679) by Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown (1997).
    In earlier work (Turney, 2002) only singletons were used as seed words; varying their number allows us to test whether multiple seed words have a positive effect in detection performance.
    We experimented with seed sets containing 1, 20, 100 and over 600 positive and negative pairs of adjectives.
    For a given seed set size, we denote the set of positive seeds
