ve rare occurring pairs of verbs.
    The final results use a baseline where all pairs occurring less than 10 times in the training data are removed.
    Since the verb-only baseline does not use typed dependencies, our narrative model cannot directly compare to this abstracted approach.
    We thus modified the narrative model to ignore typed dependencies, but still count events with shared arguments.
    Thus, we calculate the PMI across verbs that share arguments.
    This approach is called Protagonist.
    The full narrative model that includes the grammatical dependencies is called Typed Deps.
  
  
    Experiments with varying sizes of training data are presented in figure 3.
    Each ranked list of candidate verbs for the missing event in Baseline/Protagonist contained approximately 9 thousand candidates.
    Of the 740 cloze tests, 714 of the removed events were present in their respective list of guesses.
    This is encouraging as only 3.5% of the events are unseen (or do not meet cutoff thresholds
