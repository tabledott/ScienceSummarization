disambiguation is presented to the user to be classified and the feedback used for bootstrapping.
    The selection of candidate examples for tagging would be based on both the unassigned probability mass and the frequency of occurrence.
    Active learning strategies (Lewis and Gale, 1994) are a natural path for efficiently selecting contexts for human annotation.
  
  
    This paper has presented an algorithm for the minimally supervised learning of named entity recognizers given short name lists as seed data (typically 40100 example words per entity class).
    The algorithm uses hierarchically smoothed trie structures for modeling morphological and contextual probabilities effectively in a language independent framework, overcoming the need for fixed token boundaries or history lengths.
    The combination of relatively independent morphological and contextual evidence sources in an iterative bootstrapping framework converges upon a successful named entity recognizer, achieving a competitive 70.5%-75.4%
