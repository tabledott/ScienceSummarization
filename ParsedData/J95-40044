    A vast amount of on-line text is now available, and much more will become available in the future.
    Useful tools, such as large aligned corpora (e.g., the aligned Hansards (Gale and Church 1991)) and semantic word hierarchies (e.g., Wordnet (Miller 1990)), have also recently become available.

    For example, one could accurately assign a part-of-speech tag to the word race in (1-3) without any reference to phrase structure or constituent movement: One would only h
