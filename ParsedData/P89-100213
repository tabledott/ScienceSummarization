t is identical to the semantics of the left-hand side.
    The right-hand-side element will be called the rule's semantic head.4 The traversal, then, will work top-down from the pivot using a nonchain rule, for if a chain rule were used, the pivot would not be the lowest node sharing semantics with the root.
    Instead, the pivot's semantic head would be.
    After the nonchain rule 4 In case there are two right-hand-side elements that are semantically identical to the left-hand side, there is some freedom in choosing the semantic head, although the choice is not without ramifications.
    For instance, in some analyses of NP structure, a rule such as np/NP --&gt; det/NP , nbar/NP . is postulated.
    In general, a chain rule is used bottom-up from its semantic head and top-down on the non-semantichead siblings.
    Thus, if a non-semantic-head subconstituent has the same semantics as the left-hand-side, a recursive top-down generation with the same semantics will be invoked.
    In theory, this can lead to
