    Section 3 presents the main contribution of this paper&#8212;the statistical model and experiments supporting its effectiveness.
    Finally, Section 4 draws conclusions and lays out a research program in machine learning of natural language.
  
  
    This section describes the local morpho-syntactic cues that Lerner uses to identify likely examples of particular syntactic frames.
    These cues must address two problems: finding verbs in the input and identifying phrases that represent arguments to the verb.
    The next two subsections present cues for these tasks.
    The cues presented here are not intended to be the last word on local cues to structure in English; they are merely intended to illustrate the feasibility of such cues and demonstrate how the statistical model accommodates their probabilistic correspondence to the true syntactic structure of sentences.
    Variants of these cues are presented in Brent (1991a, 1991b).
    The final subsection summarizes the procedure for collecting obse
