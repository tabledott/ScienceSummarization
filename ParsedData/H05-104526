			We have described a hybrid approach to the problem of extracting sources of opinions in text.
			We cast this problem as an information extraction task, using both CRFs and extraction patterns.
			Our research is the first to identify both direct and indirect sources for all types of opinions, emotions, and sentiments.Directions for future work include trying to in crease recall by identifying relationships between opinions and sources that cross sentence boundaries,and relationships between multiple opinion expres sions by the same source.
			For example, the fact that a coreferring noun phrase was marked as a source in one sentence could be a useful clue for extracting the source from another sentence.
			The probability or the strength of an opinion expression may also play a useful role in encouraging or suppressing source extraction.
