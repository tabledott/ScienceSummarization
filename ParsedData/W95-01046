 was not done in the work reported here is that setting this confidence threshold involves a certain subjective factor (which depends on the user's &amp;quot;irritability threshold&amp;quot;).
    Our simplifying assumption allows us to measure performance objectively, by the single parameter of prediction accuracy.
  
  
    This section presents a progression of five methods for context-sensitive spelling correction: Baseline An indicator of &amp;quot;minimal competency&amp;quot; for comparison with the other methods Context words Tests for particular words within &#177;k words of the ambiguous target word Collocations Tests for syntactic patterns around the ambiguous target word Decision lists Combines context words and collocations via decision lists Bayesian classifiers Combines context words and collocations via Bayesian classifiers.
    Each method will be described in terms of its operation on a single confusion set C = {wi, &#8226; &#8226; &#8226; , wn}; that is, we will say how the method disambigua
