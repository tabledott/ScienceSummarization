    Second, we have developed a method that functions over pairs of small units of text, so the size of the input text to be compared is different.
    This differs from document-to-document 204 or query-to-document comparison.
    A closely related problem is that of matching a query to the relevant segment from a longer document [Callan 1994; Kaszkiel and Zobel 1998], which primarily involves determining which segment of a longer document is relevant to a query, whereas our focus is on which segments are similar to each other.
    In both cases, we have less data to compare, and thus have to explore additional or more informative indicators of similarity.
    4 Methodology compute a feature vector over a pair of texunits, where features are either of one characteristic, or consisting of pairs of primitive features.
    4.1 Primitive Features draw on a number of linguistic approaches to text analysis, and are based on both single words and simplex noun phrases (head preceded by optional premodifiers wi
