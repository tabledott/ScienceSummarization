    The implementation details for using the full set of IBM-4 model parameters are given in Section 3.9.2.
    In this section, we give a short overview of search procedures used in statistical MT: Brown et al. (1990) and Brown et al.
    (1993) describe a statistical MT system that is based on the same statistical principles as those used in most speech recognition systems (Jelinek 1976).
    Berger et al. (1994) describes the French-to-English Candide translation system, which uses the translation model proposed in Brown et al.
    (1993).
    A detailed description of the decoder used in that system is given in Berger et al. (1996) but has never been published in a paper: Throughout the search process, partial hypotheses are maintained in a set of priority queues.
    There is a single priority queue for each subset of covered positions in the source string.
    In practice, the priority queues are initialized only on demand; far fewer than the full number of queues possible are actually used.
