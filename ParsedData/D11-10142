he vectors at each node are used as features to predict a distribution over sentiment labels.
    2010) that can capture such phenomena use many manually constructed resources (sentiment lexica, parsers, polarity-shifting rules).
    This limits the applicability of these methods to a broader range of tasks and languages.
    Lastly, almost all previous work is based on single, positive/negative categories or scales such as star ratings.
    Examples are movie reviews (Pang and Lee, 2005), opinions (Wiebe et al., 2005), customer reviews (Ding et al., 2008) or multiple aspects of restaurants (Snyder and Barzilay, 2007).
    Such a one-dimensional scale does not accurately reflect the complexity of human emotions and sentiments.
    In this work, we seek to address three issues.
    (i) Instead of using a bag-of-words representation, our model exploits hierarchical structure and uses compositional semantics to understand sentiment.
    (ii) Our system can be trained both on unlabeled domain data and on supervis
