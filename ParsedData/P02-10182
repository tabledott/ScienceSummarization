t object of the verb likes is indicated in Penn treebank notation by empty nodes and coindexation as shown in Figure 1 (see the next section for an explanation of why likes is tagged VBZ t rather than the standard VBZ).
    The broad-coverage statistical parsers just mentioned produce a simpler tree structure for such a relative clause that contains neither of the empty nodes just indicated.
    Rather, they produce trees of the kind shown in Figure 2.
    Unlike the tree depicted in Figure 1, this type of tree does not explicitly represent the relationship between likes and the man.
    This paper presents an algorithm that takes as its input a tree without empty nodes of the kind shown in Figure 2 and modifies it by inserting empty nodes and coindexation to produce a the tree shown in Figure 1.
    The algorithm is described in detail in section 2.
    The standard Parseval precision and recall measures for evaluating parse accuracy do not measure the accuracy of empty node and antecedent recovery, but ther
