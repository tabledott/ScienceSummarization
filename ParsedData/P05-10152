    Therefore, in this paper we consider generalizing to finer-grained scales: rather than just determine whether a review is &#8220;thumbs up&#8221; or not, we attempt to infer the author&#8217;s implied numerical rating, such as &#8220;three stars&#8221; or &#8220;four stars&#8221;.
    Note that this differs from identifying opinion strength (Wilson, Wiebe, and Hwa, 2004): rants and raves have the same strength but represent opposite evaluations, and referee forms often allow one to indicate that one is very confident (high strength) that a conference submission is mediocre (middling rating).
    Also, our task differs from ranking not only because one can be given a single item to classify (as opposed to a set of items to be ordered relative to one another), but because there are settings in which classification is harder than ranking, and vice versa.
    One can apply standard-ary classifiers or regression to this rating-inference problem; independent work by Koppel and Schler (2005) considers suc
