endence and a symmetric table, nii = Ai+ x A+i x Aii, such that Aij = ii.In this formula, Ai+ x A+3 is the model for independence and Ai3 is the symmetric interaction term.
    Intuitively, Aii represents the difference between the actual counts and those predicted by independence.
    This model can be evaluated using CoCo as described on pages 289-290 of Bishop et al. (1975).
    We use the latent class model to correct symmetric disagreements that appear to result from bias.
    The latent class model was first introduced by Lazarsfeld (1966) and was later made computationally efficient by Goodman (1974).
    Goodman's procedure is a specialization of the EM algorithm (Dempster et al., 1977), which is implemented in the freeware program CoCo (Badsberg, 1995).
    Since its development, the latent class model has been widely applied, and is the underlying model in various unsupervised machine learning algorithms, including AutoClass (Cheeseman and Stutz, 1996).
    The form of the latent class model is that
