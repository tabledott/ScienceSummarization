ave a relatively small number of training and test instances (around 50-200).
    However, the Line, Hard and Serve data is much larger, where each contains around 4200 training and test instances combined.
    Mixed word are unique because they combined the instances of multiple target words and thereby have a larger number of senses to discriminate.
    Each type of data brings with it unique characteristics, and sheds light on different aspects of our experiments.
    Table 2 compares PB1 against PB3, and SC1 against SC3, when these methods are used to discriminate the 24 SENSEVAL-2 words.
    Our objective is to study the effect of using bigram features against co&#8211;occurrences in first (PB) and second (SC) order context vectors while using relatively small amounts of training data per word.
    Note that PB1 and SC1 use co&#8211;occurrence features, while PB3 and SC3 rely on bigram features.
    This table shows the number of nouns (N), adjectives (A) and verbs (V) where bigrams were more effective t
