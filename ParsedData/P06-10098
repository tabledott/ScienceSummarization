ur CRF alignment model, we must first specify the feature set &#8211; the functions hk in (1).
    Typically CRFs use binary indicator functions as features; these functions are only active when the observations meet some criteria and the label at (or label pair, (at&#8722;1, at)) matches a pre-specified label (pair).
    However, in our model the labellings are word indices in the target sentence and cannot be compared readily to labellings at other sites in the same sentence, or in other sentences with a different length.
    Such naive features would only be active for one labelling, therefore this model would suffer from serious sparse data problems.
    We instead define features which are functions of the source-target word match implied by a labelling, rather than the labelling itself.
    For example, from the sentence in Figure 1 for the labelling of f24 = de with a24 = 16 (for e16 = of) we might detect the following feature: h(t, at&#8722;1, at, f, e) = Note that it is the target word indexed by at,
