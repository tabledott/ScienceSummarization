topics and global topics will capture properties of reviewed items.
    For example, consider an extract from a review of a London hotel: &#8220;... public transport in London is straightforward, the tube station is about an 8 minute walk ... or you can get a bus for &#163;1.50&#8221;.
    It can be viewed as a mixture of topic London shared by the entire review (words: &#8220;London&#8221;, &#8220;tube&#8221;, &#8220;&#163;&#8221;), and the ratable aspect location, specific for the local context of the sentence (words: &#8220;transport&#8221;, &#8220;walk&#8221;, &#8220;bus&#8221;).
    Local topics are reused between very different types of items, whereas global topics correspond only to particular types of items.
    In MG-LDA a document is represented as a set of sliding windows, each covering T adjacent sentences within a document.4 Each window v in document d has an associated distribution over local topics &#65533;loc d,v and a distribution defining preference for local topics versus global topics 7rd,
