ht major classes developed by Roget in 1852: abstract relations, space, physics, matter, sensation, intellect, volition, and affections.
    Each class is divided into (roman-numbered) subclasses, and under each subclass there is a (capitalletter-sequenced) sub-subclass.
    These in turn are divided into the basic categories.
    Where applicable, categories are organized into antonym pairs.
    For example, category 407 is Life, and category 408 is Death.
    Each category contains a series of numbered paragraphs to group closely related words.
    Within each paragraph, still finer groups are marked by semicolons.
    In addition, a semicolon group may have cross-references or pointers to other related categories or paragraphs.
    A paragraph contains words of only one syntactic category.
    The noun paragraphs are grouped at the start of a category, followed by the paragraphs for The structure of Roget's Thesaurus Index entry for the word lid verbs, adjectives, and so on.
