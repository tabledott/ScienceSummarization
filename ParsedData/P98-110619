 the parse matrix.
    This involves these steps: 1.
    For every lifting condition in LM, we ensure that it is compatible with the category of 77.
    This is done by moving the dot leftwards in accordance with the category of (The dot is moved leftwards since we are doing bottom-up recognition.)
    The obvious special provisions deal with the Kleene star and optional elements.
    If the category matches a catgeory with Kleene start in the lifting condition, we do not move the dot.
    If the category matches a category which is to the left of an optional category, or to the left of category with Kleene star, then we can move the dot to the left of that category.
    If the dot cannot be placed in accordance with the category of ij, then no new entry is made in the parse matrix for n. 2.
    We then choose a multiset of s-, m-, and 1rules whose left-hand side is the category of n. For every dependent of n introduced by an 1-rule, the dependent must be compatible with an instance of a lifting condition in
