ration that uses relations rhet_re/(coNCESSioN, 1,3) and rhet_re/(ELABoRATIoN , 3, 1) will be ruled out.
    For example, relation rhet_re/(ELABoRATIoN, 3, 1) will be ruled out because unit 1 is not an important unit for span [1,2] and, as mentioned at the beginning of this section, a rhetorical relation that holds between two spans of a valid text structure must also hold between their most important units: the important unit of span [1,2] is unit 2, i.e., the nucleus of the relation r het fel(cONCESSION , 1,2).
  
  
    We used previous work on cue phrases (Halliday and Hasan, 1976; Grosz and Sidner, 1986; Martin, 1992; Hirschberg and Litman, 1993; Knott, 1995; Fraser, 1996) to create an initial set of more than 450 potential discourse markers.
    For each potential discourse marker, we then used an automatic procedure that extracted from the Brown corpus a set of text fragments.
    Each text fragment contained a &amp;quot;window&amp;quot; of approximately 200 words and an emphasized occurrence of a mark
