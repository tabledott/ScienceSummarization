    To allow for some degree of movement during translation, non-terminal productions are allowed to be either straight or inverted.
    Straight productions, with their non-terminals inside square brackets [...], produce their symbols in the same order on both streams.
    Inverted productions, indicated by angled brackets (...), have their nonterminals produced in the given order on the English stream, but this order is reversed in the Foreign stream. the tax causes unrest l' impTMt cause le malaise An ITG chart parser provides a polynomialtime algorithm to conduct a complete enumeration of all alignments that are possible according to its grammar.
    We will use a binary bracketing ITG, the simplest interesting grammar in this formalism: A &#8212; [AA]  |(AA)  |e/f This grammar enforces its own weak cohesion constraint: for every possible alignment, a corresponding binary constituency
