tions to represent the various aspect of the role x, assuming that x is an rl-role of the word i: Specifically, we call a, subformula P, a 'unary constraint when P, contains only one variable, and a binary constraint when P, contains exactly two variables.
    ,def , We also define word(i) as the terminal symbol occurring at the position i.1 An individual grammar G =&lt; E, R, L, C &gt; in the CDG theory determines a set of possible assignments of a given sentence, where where the variables xi, x2, ..., xp range over the set of roles in an assignment A and each subformula P consists only of the following vocabulary: The semantics of the functions have been defined above.
    The semantics of the predicates and the logical connectors are defined as usual, except that comparing an expression containing nil with another value by the inequality predicates always yields the truth value false.
    These conditions guarantee that, given an assignment A, it is possible to compute whether the values of xl, x2, ,x sati
