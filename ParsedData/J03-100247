othing parameters (top: 34K Verbmobil task, bottom: 128K Hansards task). eters, we obtain a lower alignment error rate, overfitting occurs later in the process, and its effect is smaller.
    Tables 11 and 12 show the effects of including a dependence on word classes in the alignment model, as described in Section 2.3.
    The word classes are always trained on the same subset of the training corpus as is used for the training of the alignment models.
    We observe no significant improvement in performance as a result of including dependence on word classes when a small training corpus is used.
    A possible reason for this lack of improvement is that either the word classes themselves or the resulting large number of alignment parameters cannot be estimated reliably using a small training corpus.
    When a large training corpus is used, however, there is a clear improvement in performance on both the Verbmobil and the Hansards tasks.
    Tables 13 and 14 show the effect of using a conventional bilingual d
