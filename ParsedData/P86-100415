tic roles include: agent,instrument,theme, objecti,object2, symptom and mod.
    Semantic roles can be filled either by a syntactic constituent supplied by a mapping rule or by reference resolution, requiring close cooperation between semantics and reference resolution.
    Certain semantic roles are categorized as ESSENTIAL, so that pragmatics knows that they need to be filled if there is no syntactic constituent available.

    This section explains the decompositions of the verbs relevant to the example, and identifies the important semantic roles.
    The decomposition of have is very domain specific.
