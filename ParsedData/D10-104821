    We present the results of our approach and other relevant prior work in Table 3.
    We include in the table all recent systems that report results under the same conditions as our experimental setup (i.e., using gold mentions) and use the same corpora.
    We exclude from this analysis two notable works that report results only on a version of the task that includes finding mentions (Haghighi and Klein, 2010; Stoyanov, 2010).
    The Haghighi and Klein (2009) numbers have two variants: with semantics (+S) and without (&#8722;S).
    To measure the contribution of our multi-pass system, we also present results from a single-pass variant of our system that uses all applicable features from the multi-pass system (marked as &#8220;single pass&#8221; in the table).
    Our sieve model outperforms all systems on two out of the four evaluation corpora (ACE2004ROTH-DEV and ACE2004-NWIRE), on all metrics.
    On the corpora where our model is not best, it ranks a close second.
    For example, in ACE200
