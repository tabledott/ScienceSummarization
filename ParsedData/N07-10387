th the exception of the new definition for the scoring function.2 While this model shares information between the different ranking problems, it fails to explicitly model relations between the rank predictions.
    In contrast, our algorithm uses an agreement model to learn such relations and inform joint predictions.
  
  
    The goal of our algorithm is to find a rank assignment that is consistent with predictions of individual rankers and the agreement model.
    To this end, we develop the Good Grief decoding procedure that minimizes the dissatisfaction (grief) of individual components with a joint prediction.
    In this section, we formally define the grief of each component, and a mechanism for its minimization.
    We then describe our method for joint training of individual rankers that takes into account the Good Grief decoding procedure.
    In an m-aspect ranking problem, we are given a training sequence of instance-label pairs (x1, y1), ..., (xt, yt), .... Each instance xt is a feature vector in
