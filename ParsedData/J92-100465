lly acquiring a word-pair grammar for a recognizer and producing sentences to test the back-end capability.
    We discussed a number of different application domains, and gave some performance statistics in terms of perplexity / coverage / overgeneralization within some of these domains.
    The most interesting result was obtained within the VOYAGER domain (see Sections 3.3 and 3.4).
    The perplexity (average number of words that can follow a given word) decreased from 70 to 28 to 8 when the grammar changed from wordpair (derived from the same grammar) to parser without probabilities to parser with probabilities.
    We currently have two application domains that can carry on a spoken dialog with a user.
    One, the VOYAGER domain (Zue et al. 1990), answers questions about places of interest in an urban area, in our case, the vicinity of MIT and Harvard University.
    The second one, ATIS (Seneff et al. 1991), is a system for accessing data in the Official Airline Guide and booking flights.
