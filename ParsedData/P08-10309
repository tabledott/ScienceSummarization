221; for a &#8220;Life_Die&#8221; event mention.
    But the same annotation for this mention doesn&#8217;t appear again in the related documents, so we can determine it&#8217;s a spurious argument.
  
  
    Based on the above motivations we propose to incorporate global evidence from a cluster of related documents to refine local decisions.
    This section gives more details about the baseline withinsentence event tagger, and the information retrieval system we use to obtain related documents.
    In the next section we shall focus on describing the inference procedure.
    Figure 1 depicts the general procedure of our approach.
    EMSet represents a set of event mentions which is gradually updated.
    We apply within-sentence event extraction to get an initial set of event mentions EMSett , and conduct cross-sentence inference (details will be presented in section 5) to get an updated set of event mentions EMSett .
  
  
    We then use the INDRI retrieval system (Strohman et al., 2005) to obtain the to
