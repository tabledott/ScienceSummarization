etaining the better candidate.
    However, due to the lack of strong assumption of transitivity, the selection procedure is in fact a greedy search.
    By contrast, our approach evaluates a candidate according to the times it wins over the other competitors.
    Comparatively this algorithm could lead to a better solution.
    (3) Our approach makes use of more indicative features, such as Appositive, Name Alias, String-matching, etc.
    These features are effective especially for non-pronoun resolution.
  
  
    In this paper we have proposed a competition learning approach to coreference resolution.
    We started with the introduction of the singlecandidate model adopted by most supervised machine learning approaches.
    We argued that the confidence values returned by the single-candidate classifier are not reliable to be used as ranking criterion for antecedent candidates.
    Alternatively, we presented a twin-candidate model that learns the competition criterion for antecedent candidates directly.
