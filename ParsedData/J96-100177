ly 45 megabytes and 8.5 million words).
    For the first corpus (DB1), we ran XTRACT and obtained a set of approximately 3,000 collocations from which we randomly selected a subset of 300 for manual evaluation purposes.
    The 300 collocations were selected from among the collocations of mid-range frequency&#8212;collocations appearing more than 10 times in the corpus.
    We call this first set of source collocations Cl.
    The second set (C2) is a set of 300 collocations similarly selected from the set of approximately 5,000 collocations identified by XTRACT on all data from 1987.
    The third set of collocations (C3) consists of 300 collocations selected from the set of approximately 5,000 collocations identified by XTRACT on all data from 1988.
    We used DB1 with both Cl (experiment 1) and C2 (experiment 2) and we used DB2 with C3 (experiment 3).
    We asked three fluent bilingual speakers to evaluate the results for the different experiments.
    The evaluators first examined the source collocatio
