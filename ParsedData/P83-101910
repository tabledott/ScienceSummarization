e preponderance of cases, an apparent ungrammaticality can be resolved by simple editing rules.
    In order to make sense of non-fluent speech, it is essential that the various types of grammatical deviation be distinguished.
    This point has sometimes been missed, and fundamentally different kinds of deviation from standard grammaticality have been treated together because they all present the same sort of problem for a natural language understanding system.
    For example, Hayes and Mouradian (1981) mix together speaker-initiated self-corrections with fragmentary sentences of all sorts: people often leave out or repeat words or phrases, break off what they are saying and rephrase or replace it, speak in fragments, or otherwise use incorrect grammar (1981:231).
    Ultimately, it will be essential to distinguish between nonfluent productions on the one hand, and constructions that are fully grammatical though not yet understood, on the other.
