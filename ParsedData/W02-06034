a flat concatenation of stems and suffices.
    Many existing morphology discovery algorithms concentrate on identifying prefixes, suffixes and stems, i.e., assume a rather simple inflectional morphology.
    D&#180;ejean (1998) concentrates on the problem of finding the list of frequent affixes for a language rather than attempting to produce a morphological analysis of each word.
    Following the work of Zellig Harris he identifies possible morpheme boundaries by looking at the number of possible letters following a given sequence of letters, and then utilizes frequency limits for accepting morphemes.
    Goldsmith (2000) concentrates on stem+suffixlanguages, in particular Indo-European languages, and tries to produce output that would match as closely as possible with the analysis given by a human morphologist.
    He further assumes that stems form groups that he calls signatures, and each signature shares a set of possible affixes.
    He applies an MDL criterion for model optimization.
