non-convergence is the oscillation of the estimated O.
    That is, O traverses two or more local maxima.
    Therefore, we examined its convergence property experimentally.
    The right graph in Figure 2 shows a typical convergence property.
    Fortunately, in all our experiments, JESS-CM converged in a small number of iterations.
    No oscillation is observed here.
  
  
    Table 4 shows the performance of JESS-CM using 1G-words of unlabeled data and the performance gain compared with supervised CRF, which is trained under the same conditions as JESS-CM except that joint PMs are not incorporated.
    We emphasize that our model achieved these large improvements solely using unlabeled data as additional resources, without introducing a sophisticated model, deep feature engineering, handling external handcrafted resources, or task dependent human knowledge (except for the feature design).
    Our method can greatly reduce the human effort needed to obtain a high performance tagger or chunker.
