ract more functional information.
    Xtract now works in three stages.
    The three-stage analysis is described in Sections 6, 7, and 8.
    In the first stage, described in Section 6, Xtract uses straight statistical measures to retrieve from a corpus pairwise lexical relations whose common appearance within a single sentence are correlated.
    A pair (or bigram) is retrieved if its frequency of occurrence is above a certain threshold and if the words are used in relatively rigid ways.
    The output of stage one is then passed to both the second and third stage in parallel.
    In the second stage, described in Section 7, Xtract uses the output bigrams to produce collocations involving more than two words (or n-grams).
    It analyzes all sentences containing the bigram and the distribution of words and parts of speech for each position around the pair.
    It retains words (or parts of speech) occupying a position with probability greater than a given threshold.
    For example, the bigram &amp;quot;ave
