ing necessitates that only one canonical derivation (say leftmost or rightmost) need to be com- puted; all other derivations yield the same object.
			Stan- dard parsing algorithms for both TAGs and CFGs rely on this optimization.
			If incrementality requires that we generate xplicit representations of all possible interpre- tations (i.e., target derivations) of the string seen so far, then this optimization cannot be used, and parsing will be highly inefficient.
			If the representation can be left im- plicit, the optimization can be maintained, but retrieval of explicit representations will be combinatorially more complex.
