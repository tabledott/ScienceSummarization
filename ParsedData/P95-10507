malization was conducted in such a way that the sum of all matrix entries adds up to the number of fields in the matrix. of the English and the German matrix and the number of non-corresponding word positions c for 3 formulas.
    The dotted lines are the minimum and maximum values of each sample of 1000 for formula 1.
  
  
    It could be shown that even for unrelated English and German texts the patterns of word cooccurrences strongly correlate.
    The monotonically increasing character of the curves in figure 1 indicates that in principle it should be possible to find word correspondences in two matrices of different languages by randomly permuting one of the matrices until the similarity function s reaches a minimum and thus indicates maximum similarity.
    However, the minimum-curve in figure 1 suggests that there are some deep minima of the similarity function even in cases when many word correspondences are incorrect.
    An algorithm currently under construction therefore searches for many local mi
