ions.
    Their further classification must reflect different kinds of linguistic information: morphology (e.g., case, inflection), category, dependency type (complementation vs. modification), thematic role, etc.'
    However, there is a trade-off between the granularity of information encoded in the labels and the speed and accuracy of annotation.
    In order to avoid inconsistencies, the corpus is annotated in two stages: basic annotation and nfirtellte714.
    While in the first phase each annotator has to annotate structures as well as categories and functions, the refinement call be done separately for each representation level.
    During the first phase, the focus is on annotating correct structures and a coarse-grained classification of grammatical functions, which represent the following areas of information: Dependency type: complements are further classified according to features such as category and case: clausal complements (OC), accusative objects (OA), datives (DA), etc.
    Modifiers are ass
