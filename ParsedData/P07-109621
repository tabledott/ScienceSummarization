 the development data set in 4-8 iterations over the training data.
    Table 2 shows the error rate on the development set with different features.
    We first use the same feature set used in (Ratnaparkhi, 1996), which includes a set of prefix, suffix and lexical features, as well as some bi-gram and tri-gram context features.
    Following (Collins, 2002), we do not distinguish rare words.
    On set A, Ratnaparkhi&#8217;s feature set, our system reports an error rate of 3.05% on the development data set.
    With set B, we include a few feature templates which are symmetric to those in Ratnaparkhi&#8217;s set, but are only available with bidirectional search.
    With set C, we add more bi-gram and tri-gram features.
    With set D, we include bi-lexical features.
    With set E, we use prefixes and suffixes of length up to 9, as in (Toutanova et al., 2003; Tsuruoka and Tsujii, 2005).
    We obtain 2.72% of error rate.
    We will use this feature set on our final experiments on the test data.
