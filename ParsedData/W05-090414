resentative MT systems in the ACL05 MT workshop data set, which have relatively high human scores and low human scores respectively.
    The results are shown in Table 1 and Table 2, with every metric indexed by the maximum n-gram length or subtree depth.
    The last row of the each table shows the treekernel-based measures, which have no depth parameter to adjust, but implicitly consider all depths.
    The results show that in both systems our syntactic metrics all achieve a better performance in the correlation with human judgments of fluency.
    We also notice that with the increasing of the maximum length of n-grams, the correlation of BLEU with human judgments does not necessarily increase, but decreases in most cases.
    This is contrary to the argument in BLEU which says that longer n-grams better represent the sentences&#8217; fluency than the shorter ones.
    The problem can be explained by the limitation of the reference translations.
    In our experiments, every hypothesis is evaluated by ref
