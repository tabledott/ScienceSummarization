    Observe that for more than 50% of the terms, all five annotators agree with each other, and for more than 80% of the terms, at least four annotators agree.
  
  
    We showed how Mechanical Turk can be used to create a high-quality, moderate-sized, emotion lexicon for a very small cost (less than US$500).
    Notably, we used automatically generated word choice questions to detect and reject erroneous annotations and to reject all annotations by unqualified Turkers and those who indulge in malicious data entry.
    We compared a subset of our lexicon with existing gold standard data to show that the annotations obtained are indeed of high quality.
    A detailed analysis of the (evaluative and non-evaluative): Percent of 2081 terms for which the majority class size was 3, 4, and 5. lexicon revealed insights into how prevalent emotion bearing terms are among common unigrams and bigrams.
    We also identified which emotions tend to be evoked simultaneously by the same term.
    The lexicon is available fo
