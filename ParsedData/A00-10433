ces in the test corpus.
    When the corpus probability is absent for a case, the system makes decisions based on the other two sources of knowledge.
    Some of the errors made by the system result from the errors by the syntactic parser.
    We randomly checked 50 sentences, and found that 8% of the errors made by the system are due to parsing errors.
    There are two main reasons responsible for this relative low percentage of errors resulted from mistakes in parsing.
    One reason is that we have taken some special measures to avoid errors introduced by mistakes in parsing.
    For example, PP attachment is a difficult problem in parsing and it is not rare that a PP is wrongly attached.
    Therefore, we take this into account when marking the obligatory components using subcategorization knowledge from the lexicon (step 2) &#8212; we not only look at the PPs that are attached to a verb phrase, but also PPs that are next to the verb phrase but not attached, in case it is part of the verb phrase.
