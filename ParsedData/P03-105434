ally, we gave the percent sign (%) its own tag, in line with the dollar sign ($) already having its own.
    Together these three annotations brought the F1 to 81.81%.
  
  
    Around this point, we must address exactly what we mean by an unlexicalized PCFG.
    To the extent that we go about subcategorizing POS categories, many of them might come to represent a single word.
    One might thus feel that the approach of this paper is to walk down a slippery slope, and that we are merely arguing degrees.
    However, we believe that there is a fundamental qualitative distinction, grounded in linguistic practice, between what we see as permitted in an unlexicalized PCFG as against what one finds and hopes to exploit in lexicalized PCFGs.
    The division rests on the traditional distinction between function words (or closed-class words) and content words (or open class or lexical words).
    It is standard practice in linguistics, dating back decades, to annotate phrasal nodes with important functionword distin
