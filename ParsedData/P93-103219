bcategorizations for less common verbs never appeared in the modest-sized learning corpus, so the model had no chance to master them.'
    Further, the learned corpus may reflect language use more accurately than the dictionary.
    The OALD lists retire to NP and retire from NP as subcategorized PP complements, but not retire in NP.
    However, in the training corpus, the collocation retire in is much more frequent than retire to (or retire from).
    In the absence of differential error bounds, the program is always going to take such more frequent collocations as subcategorized.
    Actually, in this case, this seems to be the right result.
    While in can also be used to introduce a locative or temporal adjunct: it seems that in should be regarded as a subcategorized complement of retire (and so the dictionary is incomplete).
    As a final example of the results, let us discuss verbs that subcategorize for from (cf. fn.
    1 and Church and Hanks 1989).
