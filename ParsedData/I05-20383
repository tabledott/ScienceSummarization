g techniques, annotated corpora from which system can acquire rules (including grammar rules, lexicon, etc.) are indispensable 220 resources for customizing general-purpose NLP tools.
			In bio-textmining, for example, training on part-of-speech (POS)-annotated GENIA cor pus was reported to improve the accuracy of JunK tagger (English POS tagger) (Kazama et al., 2001) from 83.5% to 98.1% on MEDLINE abstracts (Tateisi and Tsujii, 2004), and the FraMed corpus (Wermter and Hahn, 2004) was used to train TnT tagger on German (Brants, 2000) to improve its accuracy from 95.7% to 98% on clinical reports and other biomedical texts.
			Corpus annotated for syntactic structures is expected to play a similar role in tuning parsers to biomedical domain, i.e., similar improve ment on the performance of parsers is expected by using domain-specific treebank as a resource for learning.
			For this purpose, we construct GENA Treebank (GTB), a treebank on research abstracts in biomedical domain.
