 which has come to be regarded, as I said at the outset &amp;quot;classical&amp;quot;.
    FUG traffics in descriptions and there is essentially only one kind of description, whether for lexical items, phrases, sentences, or entire languages.
    Descriptions do not distinguish among levels in the linguistic hierarchy.
    This is not to say that the distinctions among the levels are unreal or that a linguist working with the formalism whould not respect them.
    It means only that the notation and its interpretation are always uniform.
    Either a pair of descriptions is incompatible or they are combinable into a single description.
    Within FUG, every object has infinitely many descriptions, though a given grammar partitions the descriptions of the words and phrases in its language into a finite number of equivalence classes, one for each interpretation that the grammar assigns to it.
