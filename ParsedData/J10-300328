empting variants where they extract the n-grams only from sentences that include specific additional information to be added to the anchor.
    For example, in one variant, they only use sentences where the candidate phrase is surrounded by named entities Algorithm 1 (Pa&#184;sca and Dienes 2005).
    Induce a set of phrasal paraphrase pairs H with associated counts from a corpus of pre-processed Web documents.
    Summary.
    Extract all n-grams from the corpus longer than a pre-stipulated length.
    Compute a lexical anchor for each extracted n-gram.
    Pairs of n-grams that share lexical anchors are then construed to be paraphrases. on both sides and they attach the nearest pair of entities to the anchor.
    As expected, the paraphrases do improve in quality as the anchors become more specific.
    However, they also report that as anchors are made more specific by attaching additional information, the likelihood of finding a candidate pair with the same anchor is reduced.
