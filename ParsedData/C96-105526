class it appeared in.
  Therefore, the syntactic signature was coml)osed from all of the example sentences fiom every (:lass the verb appeared in.
  In some cases, the verbs were seanan- tically unrelated and consequently the mat)ping from syntax to semantics was muddied.
  [he second exper- iment attelnpted to determine a relationship between a semantic lass and the syntactic information associ- ated with each class.
  Not surprisingly, but not insignif- icantly, this relationship was very clear, since this ex- periment avoided the problem of word sense ambiguity.
  These experiments served to validate Levins claim that verb semantics and syntactic behavior are predictably related and also demonstrated that a significant con&gt; ponent of any lexical acquisition program is the ability to perform word-sense disambiguation.
  We have used the results of our first two experiments to help in constructing and augmenting online dictio- naries for novel verb senses.
  We have used the same syntactic signatures to c
