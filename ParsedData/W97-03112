    NCCs are usually not translated literally to other languages.
    Therefore, one way to discover NCCs is to induce and analyze a translation model between two languages.
    This paper is about an informationtheoretic approach to this kind of ontological discovery.
    The method is based on the insight that treatment of NCCs as multiple words reduces the predictive power of translation models.
    Whether a given sequence of words is an NCC can be determined by comparing the predictive power of two translation models that differ on whether they treat the word sequence as an NCC.
    Searching a space of data models in this manner has been proposed before, e.g.
    by Brown et al. (1992) and Wang et al.
    (1996), but their particular methods have been limited by the computational expense of inducing data models and the typically vast number of potential NCCs that need to be tested.
    The method presented here overcomes this limitation by making independence assumptions that allow hundreds
