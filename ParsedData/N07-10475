odels can be trained from the training examples.
    In Section 3, we present a letter chunk prediction method that automatically discovers double letters in grapheme sequences.
    It incorporates our manyto-many alignments with prediction models.
    In Section 4, we present our application of an HMM method to the local prediction results.
    The results of experiments on several language data sets are discussed in Section 5.
    We conclude and propose future work in Section 6.
  
  
    There are two main problems with one-to-one alignments: First, consider the double letter problem.
    In most cases when the grapheme sequence is longer than the phoneme sequence, it is because some letters are silent.
    For example, in the word abode, pronounced [ a b o d ], the letter a produces a null phoneme (E).
    This is well captured by one-to-one aligners.
    However, the longer grapheme sequence can also be generated by double letters; for example, in the word king, pronounced [ k i ], the letters ng togeth
