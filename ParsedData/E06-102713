eutral (n = 14, 328).
			Overall, the system?s 66.5% accuracy on thecollapsed runs is comparable to the accuracy re ported in the literature for other systems run onlarge corpora (Turney and Littman, 2002; Hatzi vassiloglou and McKeown, 1997).
			In order to make a meaningful comparison with the results reported in (Turney and Littman, 2002), we also did an evaluation of STEP results on positives andnegatives only (i.e., the neutral adjectives from GI H4 list were excluded) and compared our labels tothe remaining 1266 GI-H4 adjectives.
			The accuracy on this subset was 73.4%, which is compara ble to the numbers reported by Turney and Littman(2002) for experimental runs on 3, 596 sentiment marked GI words from different parts of speechusing a 2x109 corpus to compute point-wise mu tual information between the GI words and 14 manually selected positive and negative paradigm words (76.06%).
