e centroids, picking the nearest one.
    For example, the Cause&#8211;Effect relation has positive training examples such as cycling&#8211;happiness and massage&#8211;relief and negative examples such as customer&#8211;satisfaction and exposure&#8211;protection.
    We create a positive centroid by summing the W1W2&#215;L vectors of the first set of pairs, and a negative centroid by summing the latter.
    We then measure the cosine of a test item such as smile&#8211;wrinkle with the centroids, and decide if it instantiates the Cause&#8211;Effect relation based on whether it is closer to the positive or negative centroid.
    For the other tasks (as well as the transitive alternation task of Section 6.3), we do not have negative examples, but positive examples for different classes.
    We create a centroid for each class, and classify test items based on the centroid they are nearest to.
    Our first test pertains to the seven relations between nominals in Task 4 of SEMEVAL 2007 (Girju et al. 2007): Cause&
