    The language model, phrase dictionary, and other decoder tuning parameters remain the same in all experiments reported in this table.
    Table 5 clearly shows that as we open the search and consider wider range of word reorderings, the BLEU score decreases in the absence of our distortion model when we rely solely on the language model.
    Wrong reorderings look attractive to the decoder via the language model which suggests that we need a richer model with more parameter.
    In the absence of richer models such as the proposed distortion model, our results suggest that it is best to decode monotonically and only allow local reorderings that are captured in our phrase dictionary.
    However, when the distortion model is used, we see statistically significant increases in the BLEU score as we consider more word reorderings.
    The best BLEU score achieved when using the distortion model is 0.4792 , compared to a best BLEU score of 0.4468 when the distortion model is not used.
