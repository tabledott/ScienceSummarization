 finding the best alignment of two graphs is NP-complete, so exact computation is intractable.
    Authors have proposed a variety of approximate search techniques.
    Haghighi et al. (2005) divide the search into two steps: in the first step they consider node scores only, which relaxes the problem to a weighted bipartite graph matching that can be solved in polynomial time, and in the second step they add the edges scores and hillclimb the alignment via an approximate local search.
    A third approach, exemplified by Moldovan et al. (2003) and Raina et al.
    (2005), is to translate dependency parses into neo-Davidsonian-style quasilogical forms, and to perform weighted abductive theorem proving in the tradition of (Hobbs et al., 1988).
    Unless supplemented with a knowledge base, this approach is actually isomorphic to the graph matching approach.
    For example, the graph in figure 1 might generate the quasi-LF rose(e1), nsubj(e1, x1), sales(x1), nn(x1, x2), Mitsubishi(x2), dobj(e1, x3), percent(x3)
