network classifiers.
  For the sense resolution problem, each sense is repre- sented by a single vector constructed from the training contexts for that sense.
  A vector in the space defined by the training contexts is also constructed for each test context.
  To select a sense for a test context, the inner product between its vector and each of the sense vectors is computed, and the sense whose inner product is the largest is chosen.
  The components of the vectors are weighted to reflect the relative importance of the concepts in the text.
  The weighting method was designed to favor concepts that occur frequently in exactly one sense.
  The weight of a concept c is computed as follows: Let n, : number of times c occurs in sense s p = n , /  ~senses  n, d : difference between the two largest n, (if difference is 0, d is set to 1) thenw,  = p*min(n , ,d ) For example, if a concept occurs 6 times in the training contexts of sense 1, and zero times in the other five sets of contexts, then its weights in the si
