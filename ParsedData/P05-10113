    Such constraints are known to introduce inconsistencies in probabilistic models estimated using simple relative frequency (Abney, 1997).
    Log-linear models are required for credible probabilistic models and are also beneficial for incorporating various overlapping features.
    This study follows previous studies on the probabilistic models for HPSG.
    The probability, p(tIs), of producing the parse result t from a given sentence s is defined as where po(tIs) is a reference distribution (usually assumed to be a uniform distribution), and T(s) is a set of parse candidates assigned to s. The feature function fi(t, s) represents the characteristics of t and s, while the corresponding model parameter Ai(t, s) is its weight.
    Model parameters that maximize the loglikelihood of the training data are computed using a numerical optimization method (Malouf, 2002).
    Estimation of the above model requires a set of pairs (ts, T (s)), where ts is the correct parse for sentence s. While ts is provided by
