  Generalized Probabilistic LR Parsing Of Natural Language (Corpora) With Unification-Based Grammars
  
    The first issue to consider is what the analysis will be used for and what constraints this places on its form.
    The corpus analysis literature contains a variety of proposals, ranging from part-of-speech tagging to assignment of a unique, sophisticated syntactic analysis.
    Our eventual goal is to recover a semantically and pragmatically appropriate syntactic analysis capable of supporting semantic interpretation.
    Two stringent requirements follow immediately: firstly, the analyses assigned must determinately represent the syntactic relations that hold between all constituents in the input; secondly, they be drawn from an priori well-formed set of possible syntactic analyses (such as the set defined by a generative grammar).
    Otherwise, semantic interpretation of the resultant analyses cannot be guaranteed to be (structurally) unambiguous, and the semantic operations defined (over syntacti
