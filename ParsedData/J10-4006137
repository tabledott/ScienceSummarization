different semantic spaces and losing sight of the fact that such spaces share the same kind of distributional information.
    The third-order tensor formalization of distributional data allows DM to fully exploit the potential of corpus-derived tuples.
    The four semantic spaces we analyzed and tested in Section 6 are generated from the same underlying third-order tensor, by the standard operation of tensor matricization.
    This way, we derive a set of semantic spaces that can be used for measuring attributional similarity (finding synonyms, categorizing concepts into superordinates, etc.) and relational similarity (finding analogies, grouping concept pairs into relation classes, etc.).
    Moreover, the distributional information encoded in the tensor and unfolded via matricization leads to further arrangements of the data useful in addressing semantic problems that do not fall straightforwardly into the attributional or the relational paradigm (grouping verbs by alternations, harvesting patterns that r
