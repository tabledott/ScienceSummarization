hat is passed on to the phrase-based system will be solvable using a completely monotonic translation, without any skips, and without requiring extremely long phrases to be translated (for example a phrasal translation corresponding to Ihnen die entsprechenden Anmerkungen aushaendigen).
    Note than an additional benefit of the reordering phase is that it may bring together groups of words in German which have a natural correspondance to phrases in English, but were unseen or rare in the original German text.
    For example, in the previous example, we might derive a correspondance between werde aushaendigen and will pass on that was not possible before reordering.
    Another example concerns verb-particle constructions, for example in Wir machen die Tuer auf machen and auf form a verb-particle construction.
    The reordering stage moves auf to precede machen, allowing a phrasal entry that &#8220;auf machen&#8221; is translated to to open in English.
    Without the reordering, the particle can be arbitra
