  Use Of Deep Linguistic Features For The Recognition And Labeling Of Semantic Arguments
  
    We use deep linguistic features to predict semantic roles on syntactic arguments, and show that these perform considerably better than surface-oriented features.
    We also show that predicting labels from a &#8220;lightweight&#8221; parser that generates deep syntactic features performs comparably to using a full parser that generates only surface syntactic features.
  
  
    Syntax mediates between surface word order and meaning.
    The goal of parsing (syntactic analysis) is ultimately to provide the first step towards giving a semantic interpretation of a string of words.
    So far, attention has focused on parsing, because the semantically annotated corpora required for learning semantic interpretation have not been available.
    The completion of the first phase of the PropBank (Kingsbury et al., 2002) represents an important step.
    The PropBank superimposes an annotation of semantic predicate-argume
