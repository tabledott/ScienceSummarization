ither weighted finite-state transducers (FSTs) or weighted synchronous context-free grammars (SCFGs) (Lopez, 2008).
    Phrase-based models (Koehn et al., 2003), lexical translation models (Brown et al., 1993), and finite-state conditional random fields (Sha and Pereira, 2003) exemplify the former, and hierarchical phrase-based models the latter (Chiang, 2007).
    We introduce a software package called cdec that manipulates both classes in a unified way.1 Although open source decoders for both phrasebased and hierarchical translation models have been available for several years (Koehn et al., 2007; Li et al., 2009), their extensibility to new models and algorithms is limited by two significant design flaws that we have avoided with cdec.
    First, their implementations tightly couple the translation, language model integration (which we call rescoring), and pruning algorithms.
    This makes it difficult to explore alternative translation models without also re-implementing rescoring and pruning logic.
