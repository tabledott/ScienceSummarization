 a mapping between extracted and annotated CEs.
    We will use the term twin(ce) to refer to the unique annotated/extracted CE to which the extracted/annotated CE is matched.
    We say that a CE is twinless (has no twin) if no corresponding CE is identified.
    A twinless extracted CE signals that the resolver extracted a spurious CE, while an annotated CE is twinless when the resolver fails to extract it.
    Unfortunately, it is unclear how the B3 score should be computed for twinless CEs.
    Bengtson and Roth (2008) simply discard twinless CEs, but this solution is likely too lenient &#8212; it doles no punishment for mistakes on twinless annotated or extracted CEs and it would be tricked, for example, by a system that extracts only the CEs about which it is most confident.
    We propose two different ways to deal with twinless CEs for B3.
    One option, B3all, retains all twinless extracted CEs.
    It computes the preci4We also experimented with the CEAF score (Luo, 2005), but excluded it due to di
