ng this parsing system for two reasons.
    First, the parser is near state-of-the-art on English parsing benchmarks and second, and more importantly, the parser is extremely fast to train and run, making it easy to run a large number of experiments.
    Preliminary experiments using a different dependency parser &#8211; MSTParser (McDonald et al., 2005) &#8211; resulted in similar empirical observations.
    All systems are evaluated using unlabeled attachment score (UAS), which is the percentage of words (ignoring punctuation tokens) in a corpus that modify the correct head (Buchholz and Marsi, 2006).
    Furthermore, we evaluate with both gold-standard part-of-speech tags, as well as predicted part-ofspeech tags from the projected part-of-speech tagger of Das and Petrov (2011).2 This tagger relies only on labeled training data for English, and achieves accuracies around 85% on the languages that we consider.
    We evaluate in the former setting to compare to previous studies that make this assumption.
