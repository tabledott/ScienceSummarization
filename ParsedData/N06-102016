is statement.)
    While we did not predict this effect, in retrospect it seems reasonable.
    The parser was already doing very well on short sentences.
    The very long ones are hopeless, and the middle ones are just right.
    We call this the Goldilocks effect.
    As for the other three of these graphs, their stories are by no means clear.
    Figure 3 seems to indicate that the number of unknown words in the sentence does not predict that the reranker will help.
    Figure 4 might indicate that the self-training parser improves prepositional-phrase attachment, but the graph looks suspiciously like that for sentence length, so the improvements might just be due to the Goldilocks effect.
    Finally, the improvement in Figure 5 is hard to judge.
    To get a better handle on these effects we did a factor analysis.
    The factors we consider are number of CCs, INs, and unknowns, plus sentence length.
    As Figure 2 makes clear, the relative performance of the self-trained and baseline parsers does not
