ts offer a priori.
    The Viterbi alignments that we have computed with Model 5 give us a frame of reference from which to expand our horizons to multi-word cepts.
    By inspecting them, we can find translations for a given multi-word sequence.
    We need only promote a multi-word sequence to cepthood when these translations differ substantially from what we might expect on the basis of the individual words that it contains.
    In English, either a boat or a person can be left high and dry, but in French, un bateau is not left haut et sec, nor une personne haute et seche.
    Rather, a boat is left echoue and a person en plan.
    High and dry, therefore, is a promising three-word cept because its translation is not compositional.
    We treat each distinct sequence of letters as a distinct word.
    In English, for example, we recognize no kinship among the several forms of the verb to eat (eat, ate, eaten, eats, and eating).
    In French, irregular verbs have many forms.
