is required to explore just how much this model of vocabulary usage can be generalized to other languages.
    Our results with French suggest that once we have normalized incoming types to accommodate the morphology of a language, the same core classifier approach may still be applicable, at least for some family of languages.
  
  
    We have shown that reading difficulty can be estimated with a simple language modeling approach using a modified na&#239;ve Bayes classifier.
    The classifier's effectiveness is improved by explicitly modeling class relationships and smoothing frequency data across classes as well as within each class.
    Our evaluation suggests that reasonably effective models can be trained with small amounts of easilyacquired data.
    While this data is less-rigorously graded, such material also greatly reduces the cost of creating a readability measure, making it easy to modify for specific tasks or populations.
    As an example of retraining, we showed that the classifier obtained g
