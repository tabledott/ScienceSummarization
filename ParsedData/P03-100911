 p(K(V )|V ) &gt; 90% which makes the output clustering approximately hard.
    For this reason, we decided to use only K(V ) as output and defer a further exploration of the soft output to future work.
  
  
    The input data to clustering was obtained from the automatically acquired SCF lexicon for our 110 test verbs (section 2).
    The counts were extracted from unfiltered (noisy) SCF distributions in this lexicon.8 The NN algorithm produced 24 clusters on this input.
    From the IB algorithm, we requested K = 2 to 60 clusters.
    The upper limit was chosen so as to slightly exceed the case when the average cluster size 110/K = 2.
    We chose for evaluation the IB results for K = 25, 35 and 42.
    For these values, the SCF relevance satisfies our criterion for a notable improvement in cluster quality (section 4).
    The value K =35 is very close to the actual number (34) of predominant senses in the gold standard.
    In this way, the IB yields structural information beyond clustering.
