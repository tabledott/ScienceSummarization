  The aim of the present article is to generalize Grefenstette&#8217;s (1998) and Zhu and Rosenfeld&#8217;s (2001) findings by testing the hypothesis that the Web can be employed to obtain frequencies for bigrams that are unseen in a given corpus.
    Instead of having a particular task in mind (which would introduce a sampling bias), we rely on sets of bigrams that are randomly selected from a corpus.
    We use a Web-based approach for bigrams that encode meaningful syntactic relations and obtain Web frequencies not only for noun-noun bigrams, but also for adjective-noun and verb-object bigrams.
    We thus explore whether this approach generalizes to different predicateargument combinations.
    We evaluate our Web counts in four ways: (a) comparison with actual corpus frequencies from two different corpora, (b) comparison with human plausibility judgments, (c) comparison with frequencies re-created using class-based smoothing, and (d) performance in a pseudodisambiguation task on data sets from the litera
