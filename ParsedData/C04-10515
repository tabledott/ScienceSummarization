			Figure 1 shows the flow of our data collection process.
			We begin with sets of pre-clustered URLs which point to news articles on the Web, representing thousands of different news sources.
			The clustering algorithm takes into account the full text of each news article, in addition to temporal cues, to produce a set of topically and temporally related articles.
			Our method is believed to be independent of the specific clustering technology used.
			The story text is isolated from a sea of advertisements and other miscellaneous text through use of a supervised HMM.

			The clusters are generally coherent in topic and focus.
			Discrete events like disasters, business announcements, and deaths tend to yield tightly focused clusters, while ongoing stories like the SARS crisis tend to produce less focused clusters.
