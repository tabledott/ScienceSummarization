ren: (g, h, m) is scored only when m is the outermost modifier of h in some direction.
    Note that Models 1 and 2 have the same complexity as Carreras (2007), but strictly greater expressiveness: for each sibling or grandchild part used in the Carreras (2007) factorization, Model 1 defines an enclosing grand-sibling, while Model 2 defines an enclosing tri-sibling or grand-sibling.
    The factored parsing approach we focus on is sometimes referred to as &#8220;graph-based&#8221; parsing; a popular alternative is &#8220;transition-based&#8221; parsing, in which trees are constructed by making a series of incremental decisions (Yamada and Matsumoto, 2003; Attardi, 2006; Nivre et al., 2006; McDonald and Nivre, 2007).
    Transition-based parsers do not impose factorizations, so they can define arbitrary features on the tree as it is being built.
    As a result, however, they rely on greedy or approximate search algorithms to solve Eq.
