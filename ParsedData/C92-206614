 in (1-8) the inside probability, F (pos , 71, i, j , k,l), is defined for all nodes 7/ contained in an elementary tree and for pos E {t,b}, and for all indices 0 &lt; i &lt; j &lt; k &lt; I &lt; N as follows: (i) If the node 7/does not subsume the foot node of (~ (if there is one), then j and k are un- bound and: l~ (pos, ~, i , - , - , I) d~=l P(pos\[$@~ w~) (it) If the node y/subsumes the foot node 7/!
