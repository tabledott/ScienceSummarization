n MR structure is considered correct if and only if it retrieves identical results as the reference MR structure when both are issued as queries to the underlying Prolog database.
    For the ROBOCUP corpus, an MR structure is considered correct if and only if it has the same string representation as the reference MR structure, up to reordering of children of MR productions whose function symbols are commutative, such as and, or, etc.
    We evaluated the three models, with and without reranking.
    The results are presented in Table 3.
    Comparing Model I and Model II, we noticed that for both corpora, Model I in general achieves better recall while Model II achieves better precision.
    This observation conforms to our earlier expectations.
    Model III, as an interpolation of the above two models, achieves a much better F-measure on GEOQUERY corpus.
    However, it is shown to be less effective on ROBOCUP corpus.
    We noticed that compared to the GEOQUERY corpus, ROBOCUP corpus contains longer sente
