nd OTHER are merged) using hand-labeled data of a single meeting as a test set and the remaining data as training material; for this experiment, we used the same training set as (Hillard et al., 2003).
    Performance is reported in Table 6.
    In the second set of experiments, we aimed at reducing the expected variance of our experimental results and performed N-fold cross-validation in a four-way classification task, at each step retaining the hand-labeled data of a meeting for testing and the rest of the data for training.
    Table 7 summarizes the performance of our classifier with the different feature sets in this classification task, distinguishing the case where the four label-dependency pragmatic features are available during decoding from the case where they are not.
    First, the analysis of our results shows that with our three local feature sets only, we obtain substantially better results than (Hillard et al., 2003).
    This might be due to some additional features the latter work didn&#8217
