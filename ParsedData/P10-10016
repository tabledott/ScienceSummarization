the constituent can be extended by adding more modifiers to m. Each type of span is created by recursively combining two smaller, adjacent spans; the constructions are specified graphically in Figure 2.
    An incomplete span is constructed from a pair of complete spans, indicating the division of the range [h, m] into constituents headed by h and m. A complete span is created by &#8220;completing&#8221; an incomplete span with the other half of m&#8217;s constituent.
    The point of concatenation in each construction&#8212;m in Figure 2(a) or r in Figure 2(b)&#8212;is the split point, a free index that must be enumerated to find the optimal construction.
    In order to parse a sentence x, it suffices to find optimal constructions for all complete and incomplete spans defined on x.
    This can be accomplished by adapting standard chart-parsing techniques (Cocke and Schwartz, 1970; Younger, 1967; Kasami, 1965) to the recursive derivations defined in Figure 2.
    Since each derivation is defined by two fixe
