s corresponding to the entire projection, including the kitchen-specific features &#8220;poorly designed&#8221; and &#8220;awkward to&#8221;.
    While some rows of the projection matrix 0 are useful for classification, SCL can also misalign features.
    This causes problems when a projection is discriminative in the source domain but not in the target.
    This is the case for adapting from kitchen appliances to books.
    Since the book domain is quite broad, many projections in books model topic distinctions such as between religious and political books.
    These projections, which are uninformative as to the target label, are put into correspondence with the fewer discriminating projections in the much narrower kitchen domain.
    When we adapt from kitchen to books, we assign weight to these uninformative projections, degrading target classification accuracy.
  
  
    We now show how to use a small amount of target domain labeled data to learn to ignore misaligned projections from SCL-MI.
