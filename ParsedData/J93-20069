umber of probabilities to be estimated.
    Rather than assuming w, depends on all previous words and all previous tags, one assumes w, depends only on t,.
    This independence assumption, of course, is not correct.
    Yet, it so reduces the number of probabilities that must be estimated and therefore so reduces the amount of data needed to estimate probabilities, that it is a worthwhile simplifying assumption.
    It is an empirical issue whether alternative assumptions would yield significantly better performance.
    Second, rather than assuming the tag t, depends on the full sequence of previous tags, we can assume that local context is sufficient.
    Typically, individuals have assumed tag t, depends only on t,_i and t1_2 (a tri-tag model) or only on tz_i (a bi-tag model).
    This assumed locality is termed a Markov independence assumption.
    Using a tri-tag model, we then have the following: If we have sufficient training data, we can estimate the tag n-gram sequence of probabilities and the proba
