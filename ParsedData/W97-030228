at is, we actually run the algorithm multiple times to termination, first changing thresholds by a factor of 16.
    After a loop is reached at this factor, we lower the factor to 4, then 2. then 1.414, then 1.15.
    Note that this algorithm is fairly domain independent.
    It can be used for almost any statistical parsing formalism that uses thresholds, or even for speech recognition.
  
  
    Beam thresholding is a common approach.
    While we don't know of other systems that have used exactly our techniques, our techniques are certainly similar to those of others.
    For instance, Collins (1996) uses a form of beam thresholding that differs from ours only in that it doesn't use the prior probability of nonterminals as a factor, and Caraballo and Charniak (1996) use a version with the prior, but with other factors as well.
    Much of the previous related work on thresholding is in the similar area of priority functions for agenda-based parsers.
    These parsers try to do &amp;quot;best first&amp;quot
