stituent structure by first handling the dependencies on each side separately and then combining the left and right sides.
    First, it is straightforward to build the constituent structure resulting from multiple adjunctions on the same side of a spine.
    As one example, the structure in figure 2(a) is formed by first s-adjoining the spine with anchor cake into the VP node of the spine for ate, then r-adjoining spines anchored by today and quickly into the same node, where all three modifier words are to the right of the head word.
    Notice that each r-adjunction operation creates a new VP level in the tree, whereas s-adjunctions do not create a new level.
    Now consider a tree formed by first r-adjoining a spine for luckily into the VP node for ate, followed by sadjoining the spine for John into the S node, in both cases where the modifiers are to the left of the head.
    In this case the structure that would be formed is shown in figure 2(b).
    Next, consider combining the left and right structur
