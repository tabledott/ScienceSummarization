		Lower-frequency changes that fell outside of the above categories were not tallied: for example, the presence or absence of a definite article (had authority / had the authority) in Figure 2 was ignored.
			After summing all alternations in each sentence pair, we calculated the average number of occurrences of each paraphrase type in each data set.
			The results are shown in Table 2.
			Several major differences stand out between the two data sets.
			First, the F2 data is less parallel, as evidenced by the higher percentage of Elaborations found in those sentence pairs.
			Loss of parallelism, however, is offset by greater diversity of paraphrase types encountered in the F2 data.
			Phrasal alternations are more than 4x more common, and Reorderings occur over 20x more frequently.
			Thus while string difference methods may produce relatively clean training data, this is achieved at the cost of filtering out common (and interesting) paraphrase relationships.
