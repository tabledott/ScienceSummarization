  Dependency Tree Kernels For Relation Extraction
  
    We extend previous work on tree kernels to estimate the similarity between the dependency trees of sentences.
    Using this kernel within a Support Vector Machine, we detect and classify relations between entities in the Automatic Content Extraction (ACE) corpus of news articles.
    We examine the utility of different features such as Wordnet hypernyms, parts of speech, and entity types, and find that the dependency tree kernel achieves a 20% F1 improvement over a &#8220;bag-of-words&#8221; kernel.
  
  
    The ability to detect complex patterns in data is limited by the complexity of the data&#8217;s representation.
    In the case of text, a more structured data source (e.g. a relational database) allows richer queries than does an unstructured data source (e.g. a collection of news articles).
    For example, current web search engines would not perform well on the query, &#8220;list all California-based CEOs who have social ties with a United St
