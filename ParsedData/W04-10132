roduce a package, ROUGE, for automatic evaluation of summaries and its evaluations.
    ROUGE stands for Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation.
    It includes several automatic evaluation methods that measure the similarity between summaries.
    We describe ROUGE-N in Section 2, ROUGE-L in Section 3, ROUGE-W in Section 4, and ROUGE-S in Section 5.
    Section 6 shows how these measures correlate with human judgments using DUC 2001, 2002, and 2003 data.
    Section 7 concludes this paper and discusses future directions.
  
  
    Formally, ROUGE-N is an n-gram recall between a candidate summary and a set of reference summaries.
    ROUGE-N is computed as follows: Where n stands for the length of the n-gram, gramn, and Countmatch(gramn) is the maximum number of n-grams co-occurring in a candidate summary and a set of reference summaries.
    It is clear that ROUGE-N is a recall-related measure because the denominator of the equation is the total sum of the number of n-grams occurring at the refere
