rd and FBIS corpora.
    For the former, we present results for the three alignments: S alignments, P alignments, and the alignments computed by GIZA++.
    Each plotted value represents a percentage of parse trees in a corpus that can be transformed into a target sentence using transformation rules.
    The x-axis represents different restrictions on the size of these rules: if we use a model that restrict rules to a single expansion of a non-terminal into a sequence of symbols, we are in the scope of the child-reordering model of (Yamada and Knight, 2001; Fox, 2002).
    We see that its explanatory power is quite poor, with only 19.4%, 14.3%, 16.5%, and 12.1% (for the respective corpora).
    Allowing more expansions logically expands the coverage of the model, until the point where it is total: transformation rules no larger than 17, 18, 23, and 43 (in number of rule expansions) respectively provide enough coverage to explain the data at 100% for each of the four cases.
    It appears from the plot that th
