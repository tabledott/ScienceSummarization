			In this paper we focus on the last stage: question and answer sentences are normalized to aFrameNet-style representation and answers are re trieved by selecting the candidate whose semantic structure is most similar to the question.The architecture of our answer extraction mod ule is shown in Figure 1.
			Semantic structures for questions and sentences are automatically derived using the model described in Section 4 (Model I).
			Asemantic structure SemStruc = ?p,Set(SRA)?
			consists of a predicate p and a set of semantic role assignments Set(SRA).
			p is a word or phrase evoking a frame F of FrameNet.
			A semantic role assignment SRA is a ternary structure ?w,SR,s?, consist ing of frame element w, its semantic role SR, and score s indicating to what degree SR qualifies as a label for w.For a question q, we generate a semantic struc ture SemStrucq.
			Question words, such as what, who, when, etc., are considered expected answer phrases (EAPs).
			We require that EAPs are frame elementsof SemStrucq.
