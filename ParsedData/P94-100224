 term repetition alone, without use of thesaural relations, knowledge bases, or inference mechanisms, works well for many of the experimental texts.
    The structure it obtains is coarse-grained but generally reflects human judgment data.
    Earlier work (Hearst 1993) incorporated thesaural information into the algorithms; surprisingly the latest experiments find that this information degrades the performance.
    This could very well be due to problems with the algorithm used.
    A simple algorithm that just posits relations among terms that are a small distance apart according to WordNet (Miller et a/.
    1990) or Roget's 1911 thesaurus (from Project Gutenberg), modeled after Morris and Hirst's heuristics, might work better.
    Therefore I do not feel the issue is closed, and instead consider successful grouping of related words as future work.
    As another possible alternative Kozima (1993) has suggested using a (computationally expensive) semantic similarity metric to find similarity among terms wi
