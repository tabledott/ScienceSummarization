tion syntactic and semantic roles of words, better answer ranking, answer justification, and others.
    The recent TREC results (Voorhees 2002) have demonstrated that many performing systems reached a plateau; the systems ranked from 4th to 14th answered correctly between 38.4% to 24.8% of the total number of questions.
    It is clear that new ideas based on a deeper language understanding are necessary to push further the QA technology.
    In this paper we introduce one such novel idea, the use of automated reasoning in QA, and show that it is feasible, effective, and scalable.
    We have implemented a Logic Prover, called COGEX (from the permutation of the first two syllables of the verb excogitate) which uniformly codifies the question and answer text, as well as world knowledge resources, in order to use its inference engine to verify and extract any lexical relationships between the question and its candidate answers.
    COGEX captures the syntax-based relationships such as the syntactic objects, sy
