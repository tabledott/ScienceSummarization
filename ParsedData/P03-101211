t.
    We refer to these as adjacency features.
    The second feature type ftd uses the English parse tree to capture regularities among grammatical relations between languages.
    For example, when dealing with French and English, the location of the determiner with respect to its governor4 is never swapped during translation, while the location of adjectives is swapped frequently.
    For any word pair (ei, fj), let ei, be the governor of ei, and let rel be the relationship between them.
    If a link l(ei,, fj,) exists, then we say that the feature ftd(j &#8722;j', rel) is active for this context.
    We refer to these as dependency features.
    Take for example Figure 3 which shows a partial alignment with all links completed except for those involving &#8216;the&#8217;.
    Given this sentence pair and English parse tree, we can extract features of both types to assist in the alignment of thea.
    The word pair (thea, l') will have an active adjacency feature fta(+1, +1, host) as well as a dependency
