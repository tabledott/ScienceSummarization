			If x = x1x2...xm and y = y1y2...yn are two relation examples, where xi denotes the set ofword classes corresponding to position i (as in Fig ure 3), then the number of common features between x and y is computed as in Equation 1.
			K(x, y) = { 0, m 6= n ?n i=1 c(xi, yi), m = n (1) where c(xi, yi) = |xi?yi| is the number of common word classes between xi and yi.
			This is a simple kernel, whose computation takes O(n) time.
			If the two paths have different lengths,they correspond to different ways of expressing a re lationship ? for instance, they may pass through a different number of predicate argument structures.
			Consequently, the kernel is defined to be 0 in this case.
			Otherwise, it is the product of the number of common word classes at each position in the two paths.
			As an example, let us consider two instances of the LOCATED relationship: 1.
			?his actions in Brcko?, and 2.
			?his arrival in Beijing?.
			Their corresponding dependency paths are: 1.
			?his ? actions ? in ? Brcko?, and
