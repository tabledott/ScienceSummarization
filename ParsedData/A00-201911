reduce false positives, ALEK requires that effect sizes be at least in the moderate-to-small range (Cohen and Cohen, 1983).
    Direct evidence from the word specific corpus can also be used to control the overgeneration of errors.
    For each candidate error, ALEK compares the larger context in which the bigram appears to the contexts that have been analyzed in the word-specific corpus.
    From the wordspecific corpus, ALEK forms templates, sequences of words and tags that represent the local context of the target.
    If a test sentence contains a low probability bigram (as measured by the x2 test), the local context of the target is compared to all the templates of which it is a part.
    Exceptions to the error, that is longer grammatical sequences that contain rare subsequences, are found by examining conditional probabilities.
    To illustrate this, consider the example of a knowledge and a knowledge of The conditional probability of of given a knowledge is high, as it accounts for almost all of the
