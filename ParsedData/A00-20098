sense given the particular context represented by that classifier; the ensemble disambiguates by assigning the sense that receives a majority of the votes.
  
  
    The line data was created by (Leacock et al., 1993) by tagging every occurrence of line in the ACL/DCI Wall Street Journal corpus and the American Printing House for the Blind corpus with one of six possible WordNet senses.
    These senses and their frequency distribution are shown in Table 1.
    This data has since been used in studies by (Mooney, 1996), (Towell and Voorhees, 1998), and (Leacock et al., 1998).
    In that work, as well as in this paper, a subset of the corpus is utilized such that each sense is uniformly distributed; this reduces the accuracy of the majority classifier to 17%.
    The uniform distribution is created by randomly sampling 349 sense-tagged examples from each sense, resulting in a training corpus of 2094 sense-tagged sentences.
    The interest data was created by (Bruce and Wiebe, 1994) by tagging all occurrences
