onstituents (such as source) to a base input specification without taking into account all possible syntactic interactions between the new constituent and existing ones; 2.
    SURGE relies on semantic information to make decisions and verify that these decisions are compatible with the rest of the sentence structure.
    When the semantic information is not available, it is more difficult to predict that the decisions are compatible with the input provided in syntactic form.
    We modified the input specification language for FUF/SURGE to account for these problems.
    We added features that indicate the ordering of circumstantials in the output.
    Ordering of circumstantials can easily be derived from their ordering in the input.
    Thus, we label circumstantials with the features front-i (i-th circumstantial at the front of the sentence) and end-i (i-th circumstantial at the end), where i indicates the relative ordering of the circumstantial within the clause.
