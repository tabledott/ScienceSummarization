r shares some support vectors with other classifiers.
    By storing the bodies of all support vectors together and letting each classifier have only the weights, we can greatly reduce the size of the classifier.
    The sharing of support vectors also can be exploited to accelerate the classification by caching the value of the kernel function between a support vector and a classifiee sample.
  
  
    To conduct experiments, we divided 670 abstracts of the GENIA corpus (Ver.
    1.1) into the training part (590 abstracts; 4,487 sentences; 133,915 words) and the test part (80 abstracts; 622 sentences; 18,211 words).6 Texts are tokenized by using Penn Treebank&#8217;s tokenizer.
    An HMM for the HMM state features was trained with raw abstracts of the GENIA corpus (39,116 sentences).7 The number of states is 160.
    The vocabulary for the word feature is constructed by taking the most frequent 10,000 words from the above raw abstracts, the prefix/suffix/prefix list by taking the most frequent 10,000 prefix
