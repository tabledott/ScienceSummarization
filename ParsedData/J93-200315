an English passage is a web of concepts woven together according to the rules of English grammar.
    When we look at a passage, we cannot see the concepts directly but only the words that they leave behind.
    To show that these words are related to a concept but are not quite the whole story, we say that they form a cept.
    Some of the words in a passage may participate in more than one cept, while others may participate in none, serving only as a sort of syntactic glue to bind the whole together.
    When a passage is translated into French, each of its cepts contributes some French words to the translation.
    We formalize this use of the term cept and relate it to the idea of an alignment as follows.
    We call the set of English words connected to a French word in a particular alignment the cept that generates the French word.
    Thus, an alignment resolves an English string into a set of possibly overlapping cepts that we call the ceptual scheme of the English string with respect to the alignment
