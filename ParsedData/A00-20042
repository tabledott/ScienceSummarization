odel (Beeferman et al., 1997a) and word frequency model (Reynar, 1999) to detect cohesion.
    Methods for finding the topic boundaries include sliding window (Hearst, 1994), lexical chains (Morris, 1988; Kan et al., 1998), dynamic programming (Ponte and Croft, 1997; Heinonen, 1998), agglomerative clustering (Yaari, 1997) and divisive clustering (Reynar, 1994).
    Lexical cohesion methods are typically used for segmenting written text in a collection to improve information retrieval (Hearst, 1994; Reynar, 1998).
    Multi-source methods combine lexical cohesion with other indicators of topic shift such as cue phrases, prosodic features, reference, syntax and lexical attraction (Beeferman et al., 1997a) using decision trees (Miike et al., 1994; Kurohashi and Nagao, 1994; Litman and Passonneau, 1995) and probabilistic models (Beeferman et al., 1997b; Hajime et al., 1998; Reynar, 1998).
    Work in this area is largely motivated by the topic detection and tracking (TDT) initiative (Allan et al., 1998).
