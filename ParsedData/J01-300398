perimenting with the combination of several sources of information: the classification of each instance will be a function of a bias for the verb type (using the cross-corpus statistics we collect), but also of features of the usage of the instance being classified (cf., Lapata and Brew [1999]; Siegel [1998]).
    Finally, corpus-based learning techniques collect statistical information related to language use, and are a good starting point for studying human linguistic performance.
    This opens the way to investigating the relation of linguistic data in text to people's linguistic behaviour and use.
    For example, Merlo and Stevenson (1998) show that, contrary to the naive assumption, speakers' preferences in syntactic disambiguation are not simply directly related to frequency (i.e., a speaker's preference for one construction over another is not simply modelled by the frequency of the construction, or of the words in the construction).
    Thus, the kind of corpus investigation we are advocating&#8212;
