ess meanings syntactically.
    For example, current theories claim that languages employ stable headcomplement orders across construction types.
    In English, the head of a phrase is uniformly to the left of modifying prepositional phrases, sentential complements, etc.
    In Chinese, verbal and prepositional phrases respect the English ordering but heads in the nominal system uniformly appear to the right.
    Systematic application of this sort of linguistic knowledge turns out to be the key in getting beyond the DCA's limitations.
  
  
    Thus far, we have argued that the DCA is a useful and widely assumed principle; at the same time we have illustrated that it is incapable of accounting for some well known and fundamental linguistic facts.
    Yet this is not art unfamiliar situation.
    For years, stochastic modeling of language has depended on the linguistically implausible assumptions underlying'n-gram models, hidden Markov models, context-free grammars, and the like, with remarkable success.
