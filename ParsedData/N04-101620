eting of the word sequence (see (3) for an example).
    Previous approaches typically compare different bracketings and choose the most likely one.
    The adjacency model compares [n1 n2] against [n2 n3] and adopts a right branching analysis if [n2 n3] is more likely than [n1 n2].
    The dependency model compares [n1 n2] against [n1 n3] and adopts a right branching analysis if [n1 n3] is more likely than [n1 n2].
    The simplest model of compound noun disambiguation compares the frequencies of the two competing analyses and opts for the most frequent one (Pustejovsky et al., 1993).
    Lauer (1995) proposes an unsupervised method for estimating the frequencies of the competing bracketings based on a taxonomy or a thesaurus.
    He uses a probability ratio to compare the probability of the leftbranching analysis to that of the right-branching (see (4) for the dependency model and (5) for the adjacency model).
    Here t1, t2 and t3 are conceptual categories in the taxonomy or thesaurus, and the nouns w1...
