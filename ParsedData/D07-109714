			The final Blended parser was constructed by reusingthe tuned Single Malt parser for each language (arcstandard left-to-right for Chinese, arc-eager left-to right for the remaining languages) and training five additional parsers with the same parameter settings except for the following mechanical adjustments: 1.
			Pseudo-projective parsing was not used for the.
