of approaches for building statistical models of parse se- lection are possible.
  At the simplest end, we might look only at the lexical type sequence assigned to the words by each parse and rank the parse based on the likelihood of that sequence.
  These lexical types ?
  the preterminals in the derivation ?
  are essentially part-of-speech tags, but encode considerably finer-grained information about the words.
  Well-understood statistical part-of-speech tag- ging technology is sufficient for this approach.
  In order to use more information about the parse, we might examine the entire derivation of the string.
  Most probabilistic parsing research ?
  including, for ex- ample, work by by Collins (1997), and Charniak (1997) ?
  is based on branching process models (Harris, 1963).
  The HPSG derivations that the treebank makes available can be viewed as just such a branching process, and a stochastic model of the trees can be built as a prob- abilistic context-free grammar (PCFG) model.
