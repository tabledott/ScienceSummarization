 version of the WordNet inventory, we aim at defining an automatic mapping between WordNet and ODE, i.e. a function &#181; : SensesWN &#8594; SensesODE U {E}, where SensesD is the set of senses in the dictionary D and E is a special element assigned when no plausible option is available for mapping (e.g. when the ODE encodes no entry corresponding to a WordNet sense).
    Given a WordNet sense S E SensesWN(w) we define &#710;m(S), the best matching sense in the ODE, as: where &#181;&#8722;1(S') is the group of WordNet senses mapped to the same sense S' of the ODE, while the second set includes singletons of WordNet 107 where B is a threshold below which a matching between sense descriptions is considered unreliable.
    Finally, we define the clusteri In Sections 2.3.1 and 2.3.2 we describe two different choices for the match function, respectively based on the use of lexical and seman where match : SensesWNxSensesODE &#8594; [0, 1] is a function that measures the degree of matching between the sense descript
