 score a point.
    For the unlabeled scores, only the two dependent words are considered.
    The F-score is the balanced harmonic mean of precision (P) and recall (R): 2PR/(P + R).
    The scores are given only for those sentences which were parsed successfully.
    We also give coverage values showing the percentage of sentences which were parsed successfully.
    Using the CCGbank dependencies for evaluation is a departure from our earlier work, in which we generated our own gold standard by running the parser over the derivations in CCGbank and outputting the dependencies.
    In this article we wanted to use a gold standard which is easily accessible to other researchers.
    However, there are some differences between the dependency scheme used by our parser and CCGbank.
    For example, our parser outputs some coordination dependencies which are not in CCGbank; also, because the parser currently encodes every argument slot in each lexical category as a dependency relation, there are some relations, su
