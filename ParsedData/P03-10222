resolve also pronouns with non-NP-antecedents.
    Because of the difficulties a pronoun resolution algorithm encounters in spoken dialogue, previous approaches were applied only to tiny domains, they needed deep semantic analysis and discourse processing and relied on hand-crafted knowledge bases.
    In contrast, we build on our existing anaphora resolution system and incrementally add new features specifically devised for spoken dialogue.
    That way we are able to determine relatively powerful yet computationally cheap features.
    To our knowledge the work presented here describes the first implemented system for corpus-based anaphora resolution dealing also with non-NP-antecedents.
  
  
    Spoken dialogue contains more pronouns with nonNP-antecedents than written text does.
    However, pronouns with NP-antecedents (like 3rd pers. masculine/feminine pronouns, cf. he in the example below) still constitute the largest fraction of all coreferential pronouns in the Switchboard corpus.
