    With it, the combined model has substantially lower error than the heuristic model without re-estimation; without it, for any number of EM iterations, the combined model has higher error than the heuristic model.
    A similar analysis shows that add-n smoothing is much less important in the combined model than 3Modificiations are &#8220;omitted&#8221; by setting the corresponding parameter to a value that is equivalent to removing the modification from the model. the smoothed model.
    The probable explanation for this is that add-n smoothing is designed to address over-fitting from many iterations of EM.
    While the smoothed model does require many EM iterations to reach its minimum AER, the combined model, with or without add-n smoothing, is at its minimum AER with only one EM iteration.
    Finally, we note that, while the initial null-word weight is crucial to the heuristic model without reestimation, the combined model actually performs better without it.
    Presumably, the re-estimation nul
