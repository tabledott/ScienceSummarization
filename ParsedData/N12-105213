ransfer methods and unsupervised methods have recently been shown to hold promise as a way to at least partially sidestep the demand for labeled data.
    Unsupervised methods attempt to infer linguistic structure without using any annotated data (Klein and Manning, 2004) or possibly by using a set of linguistically motivated rules (Naseem et al., 2010) or a linguistically informed model structure (Berg-Kirkpatrick and Klein, 2010).
    The aim of transfer methods is instead to use knowledge induced from labeled resources in one or more source languages to construct systems for target languages in which no or few such resources are available (Hwa et al., 2005).
    Currently, the performance of even the most simple direct transfer systems far exceeds that of unsupervised systems (Cohen et al., 2011; McDonald et al., 2011; S&#248;gaard, 2011).
    Our starting point is the delexicalized direct transfer method proposed by McDonald et al. (2011) based on work by Zeman and Resnik (2008).
