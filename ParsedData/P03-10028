 PREDICATE WORD &#8722; In our implementation this feature consists of two components: (1) VERB: the word itself with the case and morphological information preserved; and (2) LEMMA which represents the verb normalized to lower case and infinitive form.
    Statistical methods in general are hindered by the data sparsity problem.
    To achieve high accuracy and resolve the data sparsity problem the method reported in (Gildea and Palmer, 2002; Gildea and Jurafsky, 2002) employed a backoff solution based on a lattice that combines the model features.
    For practical reasons, this solution restricts the size of the feature sets.
    For example, the backoff lattice in (Gildea and Palmer, 2002) consists of eight connected nodes for a five-feature set.
    A larger set of features will determine a very complex backoff lattice.
    Consequently, no new intuitions may be tested as no new features can be easily added to the model.
    In our studies we found that inductive learning through decision trees enabled u
