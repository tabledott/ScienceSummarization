tions could have arisen by chance.
    We then analyze the distributions in more detail to determine what aspects of the distribution are significant, and thereby to abstract significant data for use in defining segmentations for each narrative.
    The results indicate that the observed distributions are highly significant, i.e., unlikely to have arisen by chance.
    In Section 3.2.2, we briefly review Cochran's Q (1950), the statistic that we use, and the test of the null hypothesis.
    We then partition Cochran's Q to determine the lowest value on the x-axis in Figure 3 at which agreements on boundaries become statistically significant.
    The results indicate significance arises when at least three subjects agree on a boundary.
    Reliability metrics (Krippendorff 1980; Carletta 1996) are designed to give a robust measure of how well distinct sets of data agree with, or replicate, one another.
    They are sensitive to the relative proportion of the different data types (e.g., boundaries versus nonbou
