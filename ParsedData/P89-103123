ed piece that is the smallest and insert it into the hole in the side of the large plastic tube.
    IT goes in the hole nearest the end with the engravings on IT.
    The Hobbs algorithm will correctly choose the end as the antecedent for the second it.
    The BFP algorithm on the other hand will get two interpretations, one in which the second it co-specifies the red piece and one in which it co-specifies the end.
    They are both CONTINUING interpretations since the first it co-specifies the CB, but the constraints don't make a choice.
    All of the examples on which BFP succeed and Hobbs fails have to do with extended discussion of one discourse entity.
    For instance: Expi: Now take the blue cap with the two prongs sticking out (Cu = blue cap) Exp2: and fit the little piece of pink plastic on IT.
    Ok?
    (Cs= blue cap) Clii: ok. Exp3: Insert the rubber ring into that blue cap.
    (Ca= blue cap) Exp4: Now screw IT onto the cylinder.
    On this example, Hobbs fails by choosing the cospecifier of
