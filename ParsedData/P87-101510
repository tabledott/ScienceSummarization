operation to compose two arbitrarily large categories.
    This allows an unbounded amount of information about two separate paths (e.g. an encoding of their length) to be combined and used to influence the later derivation.
    A consequence of the ability to generate tree sets with this property is that CC's under this definition can generate the following language which can not be generated by either TAG's or HG's.
    0n0'i'i0'2&amp;quot;bin242bn I n = 711 + n2 } On the other hand, no linguistic use is made of this general form of composition and Steedman (personal communication) and Steedman (1986) argues that a more limited definition of composition is more natural.
    With this restriction the resulting tree sets will have independent paths.
    The equivalence of CC's with this restriction to TAG's and HG's is, however, still an open problem.
    An extension of the TAG system was introduced by Joshi et al. (1975) and later redefined by Joshi (1987) in which the adjunction operation is defined on set
