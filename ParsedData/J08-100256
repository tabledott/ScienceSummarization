ast row denotes the accuracy attained by the unigram model (i.e., the reference distribution).
    The numbers in bold type represent a significant difference from the final model according to stratified shuffling tests with the Bonferroni correction (Cohen 1995) with p-value &lt; .05 for 32 pairwise comparisons.
    The results indicate that DIST, COMMA, SPAN, WORD, and Filtering threshold vs. estimation cost. n, c Estimation time (sec.)

    In contrast, RULE, SYM, and LE features did not affect accuracy.
    However, when each was removed together with another feature, the accuracy decreased drasticall
