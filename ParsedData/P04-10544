er dependency trees and incorporate this kernel within an SVM to extract relations from newswire documents.
    The tree kernel approach consistently outperforms the bag-ofwords kernel, suggesting that this highly-structured representation of sentences is more informative for detecting and distinguishing relations.
  
  
    Kernel methods (Vapnik, 1998; Cristianini and Shawe-Taylor, 2000) have become increasingly popular because of their ability to map arbitrary objects to a Euclidian feature space.
    Haussler (1999) describes a framework for calculating kernels over discrete structures such as strings and trees.
    String kernels for text classification are explored in Lodhi et al. (2000), and tree kernel variants are described in (Zelenko et al., 2003; Collins and Duffy, 2002; Cumby and Roth, 2003).
    Our algorithm is similar to that described by Zelenko et al. (2003).
    Our contributions are a richer sentence representation, a more general framework to allow feature weighting, as well as the use of
