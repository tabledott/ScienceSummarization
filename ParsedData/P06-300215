e averaged over all corpora.
    To put our results in perspective, we computed the following baselines on random samples of the same 1000 randomly chosen sentences that we used for evaluation: Table 2 summarizes the baselines.
    We give PP figures as well as tag-conditional cluster perplexity PPG (uncertainty to predict the clustering from the gold standard tags, inverse direction of PP): We measured the quality of the resulting taggers for combinations of several substeps: Figure 2 illustrates the influence of the similarity threshold s for O, OM and OMA for German &#8211; the other languages showed similar results.
    Varying s influences coverage on the 10,000 target words.
    When clustering very few words, tagging performance on these words reaches a PP as low as 1.25 but the high OOV rate impairs the total performance.
    Clustering too many words results in deterioration of results most words end up in one big partition.
    In the medium ranges, higher coverage and lower known PP compensate each
