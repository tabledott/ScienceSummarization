aluation of the participating system translations is detailed in the figures at the end of this paper.
    The scores and confidence intervals are detailed first in the Figures 7&#8211;10 in table form (including ranks), and then in graphical form in Figures 11&#8211;16.
    In the graphs, system scores are indicated by a point, the confidence intervals by shaded areas around the point.
    In all figures, we present the per-sentence normalized judgements.
    The normalization on a per-judge basis gave very similar ranking, only slightly less consistent with the ranking from the pairwise comparisons.
    The confidence intervals are computed by bootstrap resampling for BLEU, and by standard significance testing for the manual scores, as described earlier in the paper.
    Pairwise comparison is done using the sign test.
    Often, two systems can not be distinguished with a confidence of over 95%, so there are ranked the same.
    This actually happens quite frequently (more below), so that the rankings are
