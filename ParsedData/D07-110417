ry set Q. Double binary search takes this idea a step further.It performs a binary search in D for the median ele ment of Q. Whether or not the element is found, the 5These can be identified using a single traversal over alongest common prefix (LCP) array, an auxiliary data struc ture of the suffix array, described by Manber and Myers (1993).
			Since we don?t need the LCP array at runtime, we chose to do this computation once offline.
			6Minor modifications are required since we are computing collocation rather than intersection.
			Due to space constraints, details and proof of correctness are available in Lopez (2007a).
			search divides both sets into two pairs of smaller sets that can be processed recursively.
			Detailed analysis and empirical results on an information retrieval task are reported in Baeza-Yates (2004) and Baeza-Yates and Salinger (2005).
			If |Q| log |D| &lt; |D| then theperformance is guaranteed to be sublinear.
			In practice it is often sublinear even if |Q| log |D| is somewhat lar
