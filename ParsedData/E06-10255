on 4 describes in detail three different variants of it we propose for determining, at the same time, subjectivity and orientation, and describes the general setup of our experiments.
    In Section 5 we discuss the results we have obtained.
    Section 6 concludes.
  
  
    Most previous works dealing with the properties of terms within an opinion mining perspective have focused on determining term orientation.
    Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown (1997) attempt to predict the orientation of subjective adjectives by analysing pairs of adjectives (conjoined by and, or, but, either-or, or neither-nor) extracted from a large unlabelled document set.
    The underlying intuition is that the act of conjoining adjectives is subject to linguistic constraints on the orientation of the adjectives involved; e.g. and usually conjoins adjectives of equal orientation, while but conjoins adjectives of opposite orientation.
    The authors generate a graph where terms are nodes connected by &#8220;equal-orientation&#8221; or
