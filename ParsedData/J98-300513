ple, extracted sentences may accidentally include pronouns that have no previous reference in the extracted text or, in the case of extracting several sentences, may result in incoherent text when the extracted sentences are not consecutive in the original text and do not naturally follow one another.
    Paice describes techniques for modifying the extracted text to replace unresolved references.
    Summaries that consist of sentences plucked from texts have been shown to be useful indicators of content, but they are often judged to be highly unreadable (Brandow, Mitze, and Rau 1990).
    A more recent approach (Kupiec, Pedersen, and Chen 1995) uses a corpus of articles with summaries to train a statistical summarization system.
    During training, the system uses abstracts of existing articles to identify the features of sentences that are typically included in abstracts.
    In order to avoid problems noted by Paice, the system produces an itemized list of sentences from the article thus eliminating the
