cision and recall of the algorithm on a larger set of unknown words.
  
  
    We have devised an algorithm using context seed word TF/IDF for extracting bilingual lexicon from nonparallel, comparable corpus in English-Chinese.
    This algorithm takes into account the reliability of bilingual seed words and is language independent.
    This algorithm can be applied to other language pairs such as English-French or English-German.
    In these cases, since the languages are more similar linguistically and the seed word lexicon is more reliable, the algorithm should yield better results.
    This algorithm can also be applied in an iterative fashion where high-ranking bilingual word pairs can be added to the seed word list, which in turn can yield more new bilingual word pairs.
