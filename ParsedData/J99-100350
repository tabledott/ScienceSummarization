GSA also considers the confidence level with which the length-based alignment algorithm reports its realignment.
    If this confidence level is sufficiently high, GSA accepts the lengthbased realignment; otherwise, the alignment indicated by SIMR's points of correspondence is retained.
    The minimum confidence at which GSA trusts the length-based realignment is a GSA parameter, which has been optimized on a separate development bitext.

    Evaluation of GSA GSA processed two bitext maps produced by SIMR using two different matching predicates.
    The first matching predicate relied only on cognates that pass a certain LCSR threshold, as described in Section 4.2.
    The second matching predicate was like the first, except that it also generated a point of correspondence whenever the input token pair appeared as an entry in a translation lexicon.
    The translation lexicon was automatically extracted from an MRBD (Cousin et al. 1991).
    Bitexts involving millions of segments are becoming more and
