e, words that tend to act as modifers (e.g., adjectives) would have a different distribution than verbs or nouns.
    Our model&#8217;s parameters are directly estimated from word alignments as we will further explain in Section 4.
    We will also show how to generalize this word distortion model to a phrase-based model.
    (Och et al., 2004; Tillman, 2004) propose orientation-based distortion models lexicalized on the phrase level.
    There are two important distinctions between their models and ours.
    First, they lexicalize their model on the phrases, which have many more parameters and hence would require much more data to estimate reliably.
    Second, their models consider only the direction (i.e., orientation) and not the relative jump.
    We are not aware of any work on measuring word order differences between a given language pair in the context of statistical machine translation.
  
  
    In this section, we propose a simple, novel method for measuring word order similarity (or differences) b
