    We also tried marking nodes which dominated prepositions and/or conjunctions, but these features did not help the cumulative hill-climb.
    The final distance/depth feature we used was an explicit attempt to model depth, rather than use distance and linear intervention as a proxy.
    With we marked all which contained their right periphery (i.e., as a rightmost descendant).
    This captured some further attachment trends, and brought us to a final develop- 87.04%.
