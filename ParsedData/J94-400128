   In this example only a pair of yl and y3, (6, 7), gives a correct relation so that the scope of the CS is determined uniquely without the dynamic programming method.
    If there exist two or more CS pairs in a sentence that all have incorrect relations, the redetection is done on the pair whose difference of scores is the greatest.
    Whenever the redetection is done on one pair of CSs, the relations of all pairs of CSs in a sentence are checked and contradictory relations are corrected by the previously described process.
    This continues till no pair of CSs with an incorrect relation exists in the sentence.
    An example of a reduced sentence.
    As for the sentence in Figure 8, the following CSs are detected: Because CSI and CS2 are found to be in a brother relation by checking their overlap relation, they are merged into one CS (CSI-2: [HYOUDAI(a tit/e),HCHOSHA(an author),]- [SHUDAI-NADO-NO(such as a theme)]).
    Then, because CS3 is found to be a parent CS of CS2, that is, a parent CS of CS1-2,
