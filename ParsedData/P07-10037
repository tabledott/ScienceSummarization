ese fragments: the alignment error causes all non-terminal nodes in the parse tree to be interior nodes, excluding preterminals and the root.
    Figure 1B exposes the consequences: a wide array of desired rules are lost during extraction.
    The degree to which a word alignment respects the constituent structure of a parse tree can be quantified by the frequency of interior nodes, which indicate alignment patterns that cross constituent boundaries.
    To achieve maximum coverage of the translation model, we hope to infer tree-violating alignments only when syntactic structures truly diverge. an alignment error that violates the constituent structure of the English sentence.
    The resulting frontier nodes are printed in bold; all nodes would be frontier nodes under a correct alignment.
    (B) shows a small sample of the rules extracted under the proposed alignment, (ii), and the correct alignment, (i) and (ii).
    The single alignment error prevents the extraction of all rules in (i) and many more.
