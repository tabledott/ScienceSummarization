hat we have described to second-order parsing models.
    In practice, however, a bottleneck for the method would be the estimation of the generative models on unlabeled data.
    This step requires calculation of marginals on unlabeled data.
    Second-order parsing models generally require more costly inference methods for the calculation of marginals, and this increased cost may be prohibitive when large quantities of unlabeled data are employed.
    We instead make use of a simple &#8216;two-stage&#8217; approach for extending the SS-SCM approach to the second-order parsing model of (Carreras, 2007).
    In the first stage, we use a first-order parsing model to estimate generative models q1 ... qk from unlabeled data.
    In the second stage, we incorporate these generative models as features within a second-order parsing model.
    More precisely, in our approach, we first train a first-order parsing model by Step 1 and 2, exactly as described in Section 2.4, to estimate w0, v0 and q1.
    Then, we subst
