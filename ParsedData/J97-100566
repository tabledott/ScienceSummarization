P performs best.
    Our results thus suggest that accurately predicting discourse segmentation involves far more than directly using known linguistic differences between discourse boundaries and nonboundaries.'
    Here we analyze some of the likely reasons for our 15 Whittaker and Stenton (1988) also show that cue phrases are not reliable for predicting segment boundaries, and similarly argue for the use of multiple linguistic devices.
    In addition, our training data results, to motivate the methodologies for algorithm improvement presented in the next section.
    First, we must take into account the dimensions along which the three algorithms differ, apart from the different types of linguistic information used.
    As shown in Figures 9, 11, and 12, NP uses more knowledge than PAUSE and CUE.
    PAUSE and CUE each depend on only a single feature, while NP relies on three features.
    Unsurprisingly, NP performs most like humans.
    For both PAUSE and CUE, the recall is relatively high, but the preci
