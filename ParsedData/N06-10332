he importance and difficulty of binarization for efficient synchronous parsing.
    One way around this difficulty is to stipulate that all rules must be binary from the outset, as in inversion-transduction grammar (ITG) (Wu, 1997) and the binary synchronous context-free grammar (SCFG) employed by the Hiero system (Chiang, 2005) to model the hierarchical phrases.
    In contrast, the rule extraction method of Galley et al. (2004) aims to incorporate more syntactic information by providing parse trees for the target language and extracting tree transducer rules that apply to the parses.
    This approach results in rules with many nonterminals, making good binarization techniques critical.
    Suppose we have the following SCFG, where superscripts indicate reorderings (formal definitions of SCFGs can be found in Section 2): VP held a meeting, juxing le huitan PP with Sharon, yu Shalong Decoding can be cast as a (monolingual) parsing problem since we only need to parse the sourcelanguage side of the SCFG, as if
