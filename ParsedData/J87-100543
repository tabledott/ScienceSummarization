 Also by the induction hypothesis, p(f11) &lt; p(a,).
    Thus, we see that in either case, p(A) &lt; p(a,).
    So Condition 2: We must show that for all terms t in a, apply(t,a) terminates with result p such that p(I3) &lt; p(a).
    Suppose t=&lt;qvr&gt;.
    Then = aPP1.YRq v r&gt;, a) = q(v, y, 8) where y = pull(r, false) and 8 = subst(v, &lt;q v r&gt;, a).
    Now, let p(r) = m. By Lemma 2, m &lt;n.
    So by the induction hypothesis, the computation of y terminates and p(y) &lt; m. Also, the computation of 8 is assumed to terminate (as mentioned above) with 8 missing the complex term t that occurs in a (and possibly other complex terms embedded within 1).
    So Finally, by definition of p we have p(fl) &lt; 1 + p(y) + p(8)&lt;1+m+n&#8212; 2 &#8212;m=n-1&lt;n.
    We will use the two conditions just proved in the proofs of the final four conditions.
    Condition 3: We must show that apply-terms(a,true) terminates with result /3 such that p(13) = 0.
    By Lemma 1, we know that complex terms exist in a
