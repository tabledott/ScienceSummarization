orrect relative order between the alternatives.
    To carry out the evaluation, we implemented a variant of the disambiguation method of (Dagan et al., 1991), for sense disambiguation in machine translation.
    We term this method as TWS, for Target Word Selection.
    Consider for example the Hebrew phrase `laxtorn xoze shalom', which translates as 'to sign a peace treaty'.
    The word cla.xtom', however, is ambiguous, and can be translated to either 'sign' or 'seal'.
    To resolve the ambiguity, the TWS method first generates the alternative lexical cooccurrence patterns in the target language, that correspond to alternative selections of target words.
    Then, it prefers those target words that generate more frequent patterns.
    In our example, the word 'sign' is preferred upon the word 'seal', since the pattern 'to sign a treaty' is much more frequent than the pattern 'to seal a treaty'.
    Similarly, the word `xoze' is translated to 'treaty' rather than 'contract', due to the high frequency of th
