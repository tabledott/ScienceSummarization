 We evaluate in the latter setting to measure performance in a more realistic scenario &#8211; when no target language resources are available.
  
  
    To simplify discussion, we first focus on the most common instantiation of parser transfer in the literature: transferring from English to other languages.
    In the next section we expand our system to allow for the inclusion of multiple source languages.
    We start with the observation that discriminatively trained dependency parsers rely heavily on part-ofspeech tagging features.
    For example, when training and testing a parser on our English data, a parser with all features obtains an UAS of 89.3%3 whereas a delexicalized parser &#8211; a parser that only has nonlexical features &#8211; obtains an UAS of 82.5%.
    The key observation is that part-of-speech tags contain a significant amount of information for unlabeled dependency parsing.
    This observation combined with our universal part-of-speech tagset, leads to the idea of direct transfer, i
