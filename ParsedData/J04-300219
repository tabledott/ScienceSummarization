s (Litman and Passonneau 1995; Marcu, Romera, and Amorortu 1999), but our focus in this article is on words.
    Thus, our analyses are at the word level: Each word is classified as either appearing in a subjective element or not.
    Punctuation and numbers are excluded from the analyses.
    The kappa value for word agreement in this study is 0.42.
    Another two-level annotation project was performed in Wiebe et al. (2001), this time involving document-level and expression-level annotations of newsgroup data (NG-FE in Table 1).
    In that project, we were interested in annotating flames, inflammatory messages in newsgroups or listservs.
    Note that inflammatory language is a kind of subjective language.
    The annotators were instructed to mark a message as a flame if the main intention of the message is a personal attack and the message contains insulting or abusive language.
    After multiple rounds of training, three annotators independently annotated a fresh test set of 88 messages from NG-FE.
