description, where the semantic load is spread more evenly throughout the lexicon.
    I argue that lexical decomposition is possible if it is performed generatively.
    Rather than assuming a fixed set of primitives, I will assume a fixed number of generative devices that can be seen as constructing semantic expressions.
    I develop a theory of Qualia Structure, a representation language for lexical items, which renders much lexical ambiguity in the lexicon unnecessary, while still explaining the systematic polysemy that words carry.
    Finally, I discuss how individual lexical structures can be integrated into the larger lexical knowledge base through a theory of lexical inheritance.
    This provides us with the necessary principles of global organization for the lexicon, enabling us to fully integrate our natural language lexicon into a conceptual whole.
  
  
    I believe we have reached an interesting turning point in research, where linguistic studies can be informed by computational tools for lex
