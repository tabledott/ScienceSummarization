available per word is shown as &amp;quot;total count&amp;quot; in Figure 3.
    We have reduced the sense inventory of these words so that only the two or three most frequent senses are included in the text being disambiguated.
    For several of the words, there are minority senses that form a very small percentage (i.e., &lt; 5%) of the total sample.
    Such minority classes are not yet well handled by unsupervised techniques; therefore we do not consider them in this study.
  
  
    We define three different feature sets for use in these experiments.
    Our objective is to evaluate the effect that different types of features have on the accuracy of unsupervised learning algorithms such as those discussed here.
    We are particularly interested in the impact of the overall dimensionality of the feature space, and in determining how indicative different feature types are of word senses.
    Our feature sets are composed of various combinations of the following five types of features.
