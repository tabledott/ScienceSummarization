isius et al., 2006).
    In a stepwise approach, not all pairs are considered.
    Instead, the dependency tree is built stepwise and the decision about what step to take next (e.g.
    which dependency to insert) can be based on information about, in theory all, previous steps and their results (in the context of generative probabilistic parsing, Black et al. (1993) call this the history).
    Stepwise approaches can use an explicit probability model over next steps, e.g. a generative one (Eisner, 1996; Dreyer et al., 2006), or train a machine learner to predict those.
    The approach can be deterministic (at each point, one step is chosen) or employ various types of search.
    In addition, parsing can be done in a bottom-up-constituent or a bottom-up-spans fashion (or in another way, although this was not done in this shared task).
    Finally, parsing can start at the first or the last token of a sentence.
    When talking about languages that are written from left to right, this distinction is normally
