    Of these, As a practical matter, it is extremely difficult to 223 names (comprising 180 countries) are characmeasure precision and recall for relations that have ter strings with no white space.
    Since we consider not been pre-determined in any way.
    For each gen- only single word names, these 223 are the names we 236 hope to capture in this stage.
    Using the seed words France and Angola, we obtained 202 country names (comprising 167 distinct countries) as well as 32 other names (consisting mostly of names of other geopolitical entities).
    Using the list of 223 single word countries as our gold standard, this gives precision of 0.90 and recall of 0.86.
    (Ten other seed pairs gave results ranging in precision: 0.86-0.93 and recall: 0.79-0.90.)
    The second part of the algorithm generated a set of 31 binary relations.
    Of these, 25 were clearly identifiable relations many of which are shown in Table 1.
    Note that for three of these there are standard exhaustive lists against which we
