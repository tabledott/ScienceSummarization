    We will refer to this figure of merit as straight 0.
    One side effect of omitting the a and p(to,n) terms in the straight j3 figure above is that inside probability alone tends to prefer shorter constituents to longer ones, as the inside probability of a longer constituent involves the product of more probabilities.
    This can result in a &amp;quot;thrashing&amp;quot; effect as noted in Chitrao and Grishman (1990), where the system parses short constituents, even very low-probability ones, while avoiding combining them into longer constituents.
    To avoid thrashing, some technique is used to normalize the inside probability for use as a figure of merit.
    One approach is to take the geometric mean of the inside probability, to obtain a per-word inside probability.
    (In the &amp;quot;ideal&amp;quot; model, the p(to,n) term acts as a normalizing factor.)
    The per-word inside probability of the constituent Nip( is calculated as: k-0(N.11,k).
    We will refer to this figure as normalized 13
