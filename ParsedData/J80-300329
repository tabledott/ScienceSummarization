e the rating of a partial plan in which the effects of a pending act already obtain or are not wanted by the planner.4 Other heuristics depending on how well the utterance fits with the expectations are not immediately relevant to understanding indirect speech acts and will not be discussed here.
    One further heuristic is added in section 4.3.
    In general several rating heuristics are applicable to an partial plan.
    Their effects on the rating of the partial plan are cumulative.
    A hearer S identifies the illocutionary force of an utterance by recognizing that the speaker A has certain intentions, namely that S should recognize some intention P of A's.
    This can be represented by a formula of the form BsWA(BsWA(P)).
    To do the recognition, the simple plan construction and inference rules of sections 3.3 and 3.4 must be extended so that they can operate on these nested formulas.
    This can be done by assuming that every agent is aware that other agents construct and infer plans in the same
