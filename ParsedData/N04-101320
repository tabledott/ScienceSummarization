ple, the dependency list in Fig.
    3 is the Reduced set corresponding to the following sentence: He reiterated his opposition to such funding, but expressed hope of a compromise.
    An additional feature of the DEPBANK that is relevant to our comparisons is that dependency heads are represented by their standard citation forms (e.g. the verb swam in a sentence appears as swim in its dependencies).
    We believe that most applications will require a conversion to canonical citation forms so that semantic relations can be mapped into application-specific databases or ontologies.
    The predicates of LFG f-structures are already represented as citation forms; for a fair comparison we ran the leaves of the Collins tree through the same stemmer modules as part of the tree-to-dependency translation.
    We also note that proper names appear in the DEPBANK as single multi-word expressions without any internal structure.
    That is, there are no dependencies holding among the parts of people names (A. Boyd Simp
