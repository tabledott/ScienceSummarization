anguage, because the score it assigns to a rule does not take its span into account.
  
  
    The most similar related work is (Johnson, 2001), which did discriminative training of a generative PCFG.
    The model was quite similar to ours, except that it did not incorporate any features and it required the parameters (which were just scores for rules) to be locally normalized, as with a generatively trained model.
    Due to training time, they used the ATIS treebank corpus , which is much smaller than even WSJ15, with only 1,088 training sentences, 294 testing sentences, and an average sentence length of around 11.
    They found no significant difference in performance between their generatively and discriminatively trained parsers.
    There are two probable reasons for this result.
    The training set is very small, and it is a known fact that generative models tend to work better for small datasets and discriminative models tend to work better for larger datasets (Ng and Jordan, 2002).
