ds, but the degree of sensitivity is unknown.
    For the five categories reported in this paper, we arbitrarily chose a few words that were central members of the category.
    Our initial seed words worked well enough that we did not experiment with them very much.
    But we did perform a few experiments varying the number of seed words.
    In general, we found that additional seed words tend to improve performance, but the results were not substantially different using five seed words or using ten.
    Of course, there is also a law of diminishing returns: using a seed word list containing 60 category words is almost like creating a semantic lexicon for the category by hand!
  
  
    Building semantic lexicons will always be a subjective process, and the quality of a semantic lexicon is highly dependent on the task for which it will be used.
    But there is no question that semantic knowledge is essential for many problems in natural language processing.
    Most of the time semantic knowledge is defin
