 can hope to find practical solutions that will serve particular needs; this is considered more fully in the next section.
    3.3.2 Evaluation In Vivo.
    Another approach to evaluation is to consider results insofar as they contribute to the overall performance in a particular application, such as machine translation, information retrieval, or speech recognition.
    This approach (also called adequacy evaluation: Hirschman and Thompson [1996]; or operational evaluation: Arnold, Sadler, and Humphreys [1993]), although it does not assure the general applicability of a method nor contribute to a detailed understanding of problems, does not demand agreement on sense distinctions or the establishment of a pretagged corpus.
    Only the final result is taken into consideration, subjected to evaluation appropriate to the task at hand.
    Methods for WSD have evolved largely independently of particular applications, especially in the recent past.
    It is interesting to note that few, if any, systems for machin
