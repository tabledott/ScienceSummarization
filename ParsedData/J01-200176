    The first category of analyses, labeled Good, is self-explanatory in the case of most words (e.g., proceed, proceeded, proceeding, proceeds), and many of the errors are equally easy to identify by eye (abide with no analysis, next to abid-e and abid-ing, or Abn-er).
    Quite honestly, I was surprised how many words there were in which it was difficult to say what the correct analysis was.
    For example, consider the pair aboli-tion and abolish.
    The words are clearly related, and abolition clearly has a suffix; but does it have the suffix -ion, -tion, or -ition, and does abolish have the suffix -ish, or -sh?

    The first is that analyses are better insofar as they explicitly relate words that are appropriately parallel in semantics, as in the abolish/abolition cas
