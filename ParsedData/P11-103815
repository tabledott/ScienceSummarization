sed on our evaluation dataset (see Section 5.1).
    The recall for lexical edit distance with T, &lt; 2 is moderately high, but it is unable to detect the correct candidate for about one quarter of words.
    The combination of the lexical and phonemic strategies with T, &lt; 2 V Tp &lt; 2 is more impressive, but the number of candidates has also soared.
    Note that increasing the edit distance further in both cases leads to an explosion in the average number of candidates, with serious computational implications for downstream processing.
    Thankfully, T, &lt; 2 V Tp &lt; 1 leads to an extra increment in recall to 88.8%, with only a slight increase in the average number of candidates.
    Based on these results, we use T, &lt; 2VTp &lt; 1 as the basis for confusion set generation.
    Examples of ill-formed words where we are unable to generate the standard lexical form are clippings such as fav &#8220;favourite&#8221; and convo &#8220;conversation&#8221;.
    In addition to generating the confusion set
