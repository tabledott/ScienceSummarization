 one found in both Hatori et al. (2011) and our own work, although Titov and Henderson (2007) used it to define a generative model by parameterizing the SHIFT transition by an input word.
    Zhang and Clark (2008) was the first to combine beam search with a globally normalized discriminative model, using structured perceptron learning and the early update strategy of Collins and Roark (2004), and also explored the addition of graphbased features to a transition-based parser.
    This approach was further pursued in Zhang and Clark (2011) and was used by Zhang and Nivre (2011) to achieve state-of-the-art results in dependency parsing for both Chinese and English through the addition of rich non-local features.
    Huang and Sagae (2010) combined structured perceptron learning and beam search with the use of a graph-structured stack to allow ambiguity packing in the beam, a technique that was reused by Hatori et al. (2011).
    Finally, as noted in the introduction, although joint tagging and parsing is rare i
