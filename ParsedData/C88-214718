lar to the projection principle in Chomskys ~ransformation theory.
  !It is appealing to state that the adjunetion .operation does not alter the .grarmnatical relations defined by the intermediate ree structures.
  For ~example, consider the following derivation of the ~ntence Ma~y thought John saw Bil l  hit Jill.
  If the derivation results in the intermediate ree corresponding to Mary thought Bil l  hit Jill, then we wofild expect o obtain the relation of Mary thinking that "Bill hit Jill".
  This relation is altered by the adjunction at the node corresponding to the foot node of theauxiliary tree correspond- ing to Mary thought S. ff we wish to implement this stipulatio a, one solution is to insist that only one F-V statement is made with the foot node, i.e, the tloo~ and bloot are combined.
  The definition of adjunction can be suitably altered.
  The second stipulation i volves the complexity of the feature structure associated with the nodes.
  So far, we have not placed any restrictions on the growth
