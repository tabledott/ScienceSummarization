) is asserted to bear a partial resemblance (the ground of the comparison) to something else (the vehicle), the resemblance being insufficient to sustain a literal comparison.
    As with any comparison, there is always some residual dissimilarity (the tension) between the terms involved in the comparison, but comparison theorists tend not to emphasize this dissimilarity (Tourangeau and Sternberg 1982, p. 205, their italics).
    What is crucial in the comparison approach, then, is finding the correct ground in a metaphor.

    Tourangeau and Sternberg reduce these principles to two basic ones: finding a category to which the tenor and vehicle belong and constructing an analogy involving them.
    Gentner's (1983) Structure-Mapping Theory, which has been implemented in the Structure-Mapping Engine (Falkenhainer, Forbus and Gentner 1989), closely resemb
