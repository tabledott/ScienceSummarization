dedly better than that of mult is remarkable, since earlier studies found that 1The semantic space in which we rank the observed ANs with respect to their predicted counterparts also contain the observed vectors of nouns and ANs that were used to train alm.
    We do not see how this should affect performance, but we nevertheless repeated the evaluation leaving out, for each AN, the observed items used in training, and we obtained the same results reported in the main text (same ordering of method performance, and very significant difference between alm and add). multiplicative models are, in general, better than additive ones in compositionality tasks (see Section 2 above).
    This might depend on the nature of AN composition, but there are also more technical issues at hand: (i) we are not sure that previous studies normalized before summing like we did, and (ii) the multiplicative model, as discussed in Section 4, does not benefit from SVD reduction.
