side of all corpora are segmented into words by our implementation of (Gao et al., 2003).
    As mentioned in section 3, the preprocessing module for reordering needs a parser of the SL, a word alignment tool, and a Maximum Entropy training tool.
    We use the Stanford parser (Klein and Manning, 2003) with its default Chinese grammar, the GIZA++ (Och and Ney, 2000) alignment package with its default settings, and the ME tool developed by (Zhang, 2004).
    Section 5 mentions that our reordering model can apply to nodes of any branching factor.
    It is interesting to know how many branching factors should be included.
    The distribution of parse tree nodes as shown in table 1 is based on the result of parsing the Chinese side of NIST MT-2002 test set by the Stanford parser.
    It is easily seen that the majority of parse tree nodes are binary ones.
    Nodes with more than 3 children seem to be negligible.
    The 3ary nodes occupy a certain proportion of the distribution, and their impact on translation
