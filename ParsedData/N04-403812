mproved with larger dictionaries, however, the largest dictionary will still have coverage problems, therefore, there is a role for a data-driven approach such as SVM-TOK.
    An analysis of the confusion matrix for SVM-TOK shows that the most confusion occurs with the PREF2 class.
    This is hardly surprising since PREF2 is an infix category, and thus has two ambiguous boundaries.
    Results: Table 3 shows the results obtained with the SVM based POS tagger, SVM-POS, and the results obtained with a simple baseline, BASELINE, where the most frequent POS tag associated with a token from the training set is assigned to it in the test set.
    If the token does not occur in the training data, the token is assigned the NN tag as a default tag.
    Discussion: The performance of SVM-POS is better than the baseline BASELINE.
    50% of the errors encountered result from confusing nouns, NN, with adjectives, JJ, or vice versa.
    This is to be expected since these two categories are confusable in Arabic leading to
