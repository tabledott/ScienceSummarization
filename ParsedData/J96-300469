    In the case of adverbial reduplication illustrated in (3b) an adjective of the form AB is reduplicated as AABB.
    The only way to handle such phenomena within the framework described here is simply to expand out the reduplicated forms beforehand, and incorporate the expanded forms into the lexical transducer.
  
  
    Despite these limitations, a purely finite-state approach to Chinese word segmentation enjoys a number of strong advantages.
    The model we use provides a simple framework in which to incorporate a wide variety of lexical information in a uniform way The use of weighted transducers in particular has the attractive property that the model, as it stands, can be straightforwardly interfaced to other modules of a larger speech or natural language system: presumably one does not want to segment Chinese text for i
