			There are two research avenues that loom beyondthe current TempEval: (1) definition of other subtasks with the ultimate goal of establishing a hierar chy of subtasks ranked on performance of automatictaggers, and (2) an approach to evaluate entire time lines.
			Some other temporal linking tasks that can be considered are ordering of consecutive events in a sentence, ordering of events that occur in syntacticsubordination relations, ordering events in coordi nations, and temporal linking of reporting events to the document creation time.
			Once enough temporallinks from all these subtasks are added to the entire temporal graph, it becomes possible to let confidence scores from the separate subtasks drive a con straint propagation algorithm as proposed in (Allen, 1983), in effect using high-precision relations to constrain lower-precision relations elsewhere in the graph.
			With this more complete temporal annotation it is no longer possible to simply evaluate the entire graph by scoring pairwise compa
