 category is set apart, while an ordering over the other four categories is defined.
    The some category also includes definite and indefinite determiners and small cardinal numbers.
    A crude attempt is made to handle negation by interchanging no and all in the presence of negation.
    Features are generated given the categories of both hypothesis and text.
    Number, date, and time features.
    These are designed to recognize (mis-)matches between numbers, dates, and times, as in IDs 1806 and 231.
    We do some normalization (e.g. of date representations) and have a limited ability to do fuzzy matching.
    In ID 1806, the mismatched years are correctly identified.
    Unfortunately, in ID 231 the significance of over is not grasped and a mismatch is reported.
    Alignment features.
    Our feature representation includes three real-valued features intended to represent the quality of the alignment: score is the raw score returned from the alignment phase, while goodscore and badscore try to captur
