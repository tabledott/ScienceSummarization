(lm+map TM), the results are much better than a log-linear combination for the EMEA setting, and on a par for NIST.
    This is consistent with the nature of these two settings: log-linear combination, which effectively takes the intersection of IN and OUT, does relatively better on NIST, where the domains are broader and closer together.
    Somewhat surprisingly, there do not appear to be large systematic differences between linear and MAP combinations.
    The 4th block contains instance-weighting models trained on all features, used within a MAP TM combination, and with a linear LM mixture.
    The iw all map variant uses a non-0 y weight on a uniform prior in p,,(s t), and outperforms a version with y = 0 (iw all) and the &#8220;flattened&#8221; variant described in section 3.2.
    Clearly, retaining the original frequencies is important for good performance, and globally smoothing the final weighted frequencies is crucial.
    This best instance-weighting model beats the equivalant model without instan
