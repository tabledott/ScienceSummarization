ased approaches is to recast coreference resolution as a binary classification task.
    Specifically, a classifier is first trained to determine whether two NPs in a document are co-referring or not.
    A separate clustering mechanism then coordinates the possibly contradictory pairwise coreference classification decisions and constructs a partition on the given set of NPs, with one cluster for each set of coreferent NPs.
    Though reasonably successful, this &#8220;standard&#8221; approach is not as robust as one may think.
    First, design decisions such as the choice of the learning algorithm and the clustering procedure are apparently critical to system performance, but are often made in an ad-hoc and unprincipled manner that may be suboptimal from an empirical point of view.
    Second, this approach makes no attempt to search through the space of possible partitions when given a set of NPs to be clustered, employing instead a greedy clustering procedure to construct a partition that may be far from
