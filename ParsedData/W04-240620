 show the number of training (TRN) and test instances (TST) that remain after filtering, and the number of senses found in the test data (S).
    We also show the percentage of the majority sense in the test data (MAJ).
    This is particularly useful, since this is the accuracy that would be attained by a baseline clustering algorithm that puts all test instances into a single cluster.
  
  
    When we cluster test instances, we specify an upper limit on the number of clusters that can be discovered.
    In these experiments that value is 7.
    This reflects the fact that we do not know a&#8211;priori the number of possible senses a word will have.
    This also allows us to verify the hypothesis that a good clustering approach will automatically discover approximately same number of clusters as senses for that word, and the extra clusters (7&#8211;#actual senses) will contain very few instances.
    As can be seen from column S in Table 1, most of the words have 2 to 4 senses on an average.
