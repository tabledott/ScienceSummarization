left: books, DVDs, electronics, and kitchen.
    For each set of bars, the first letter is the source domain and the second letter is the target domain.
    The thick horizontal bars are the accuracies of the in-domain classifiers for these domains.
    Thus the first set of bars shows that the baseline achieves 72.8% accuracy adapting from DVDs to books.
    SCL-MI achieves 79.7% and the in-domain gold standard is 80.4%.
    We say that the adaptation loss for the baseline model is 7.6% and the adaptation loss for the SCL-MI model is 0.7%.
    The relative reduction in error due to adaptation of SCL-MI for this test is 90.8%.
    We can observe from these results that there is a rough grouping of our domains.
    Books and DVDs are similar, as are kitchen appliances and electronics, but the two groups are different from one another.
    Adapting classifiers from books to DVDs, for instance, is easier than adapting them from books to kitchen appliances.
    We note that when transferring from kitchen to elect
