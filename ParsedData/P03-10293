icipating entities can appear not only as an argument of the predicate that describes the event type, but also in other places within the sentence or in the prior text.
    In the MUC-3 terrorism scenario, WEAPON entities occur in many different relations to event predicates in the documents.
    Even if WEAPON entities appear in the same sentence with the event predicate, they rarely serve as a direct argument of such predicates.
    (e.g., &#8220;One person was killed as the result of a bomb explosion.&#8221;) Predicate-Argument model The PredicateArgument model is based on a direct syntactic relation between a predicate and its arguments1 (Yangarber et al., 2000).
    In general, a predicate provides a strong context for its arguments, which leads to good accuracy.
    However, this model has two major limitations in terms of its coverage, clausal boundaries and embedded entities inside a predicate&#8217;s arguments.
