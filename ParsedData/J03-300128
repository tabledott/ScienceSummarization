 Web, the use of the Web forces the issue.
    Where researchers use established corpora, such as Brown, the BNC, or the Penn Treebank, researchers and readers are willing to accept the corpus name as a label for the type of text occurring in it without asking critical questions.
    Once we move to the Web as a source of data, and our corpora have names like &#8220;April03-sample77,&#8221; the issue of how the text type(s) can be characterized demands attention.
  
  
    One use of a corpus is to extract a language model: a list of weighted words, or combinations of words, that describe (1) how words are related, (2) how they are used with each other, and (3) how common they are in a given domain.
    Language models are used in speech processing to predict which word combinations are likely interpretations of a sound stream, in information retrieval to decide which words are useful indicators of a topic, and in machine translation to identify good translation candidates.
