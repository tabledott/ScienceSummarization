mentations that are not empirically justified, or present only qualitative analyses of the correlation with linguistic devices.
    After identifying segments, and core and contributor relations within segments, Moser and Moore (1995) investigate whether cue words occur, where they occur, and what word occurs.
    In their talk, they presented results showing that the occurrence and placement of a discourse usage of a cue word correlates with relative order of core versus contributor utterances.
    For example, a discourse cue is more likely to occur when the contributor precedes the core utterance (p &lt; .001).
    Finally, Whittaker and Stenton (1988) examined a wide variety of means for signaling discourse structure.
    Prompts, repetitions, and summaries rather than cue words more often signaled control-based discourse segment boundaries.
    No statistical analysis of the significance of the differences was presented, however.
