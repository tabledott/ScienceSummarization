on has been shown to improve classification performance in various tasks.
    There are several approaches for combining classifiers.
    In ensemble learning, a collection of simple classifiers is used to yield better performance than any single classifier; for example boosting (Schapire, 1990).
    Another approach is to combine outputs from a few highly specialized classifiers.
    The classifiers may be based on the same basic modeling techniques but differ by, for example, alternative feature representations.
    Combination of speech recognition outputs is an example of this approach (Fiscus, 1997).
    In speech recognition, confusion network decoding (Mangu et al., 2000) has become widely used in system combination.
    Unlike speech recognition, current statistical machine translation (MT) systems are based on various different paradigms; for example phrasal, hierarchical and syntax-based systems.
    The idea of combining outputs from different MT systems to produce consensus translations in the hop
