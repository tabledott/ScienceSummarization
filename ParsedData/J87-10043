has been implemented in Common Lisp, and running on Symbolics and HP Al workstations.
    The parser is used in the multi-lingual machine translation project at CMU.
    Also, a commercial on-line parser for Japanese language is being built by Intelligent Technology Incorporation, based on the technique developed at CMU.
  
  
    Parsing efficiency is crucial when building practical natural language systems on smaller computers such as personal workstations.
    This is especially the case for interactive systems such as natural language database access, interfaces to expert systems, and interactive machine translation.
    This paper introduces an efficient on-line parsing algorithm, and focuses on its practical application to natural language interfaces.
    The algorithm can be viewed as a generalized LR parsing algorithm that can handle arbitrary context-free grammars, including ambiguous grammars.
    Section 2 describes the algorithm by extending the standard LR parsing algorithm with the idea of a &am
