 similarity between every pair of nouns according to each distributional similarity mea sure.
			We then generated ranked sets of nearest neighbours (of size k = 200 and where a word is excluded from being a neighbour of itself) for each word and each measure.For a given word, we compute the overlap between neighbour sets using a comparison tech nique adapted from Lin (1998).
			Given a word w, each word w?
			in WScomp is assigned a rankscore of k ? rank if it is one of the k near est neighbours of w using measure m and zero otherwise.
			If NS(w,m) is the vector of such scores for word w and measure m, then theoverlap, C(NS(w,m1),NS(w,m2)), of two neigh bour sets is the cosine between the two vectors: C(NS(w,m1),NS(w,m2)) = ? w? rm1(w ?, w)?
			rm2(w ?, w) ?k i=1 i2 The overlap score indicates the extent to which sets share members and the extent to whichthey are in the same order.
			To achieve an over lap score of 1, the sets must contain exactly the same items in exactly the same order.
