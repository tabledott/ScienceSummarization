 in I(H1il), we may efficiently check whether, for each sense s E senses(w), for all words where we have some evidence ERiw, whether s participates in some relation with i in the set of implied relations I(H1il).7 If there is more than one sense s E senses(w), we add to I(H1il) the single relationship Ris that maximizes the taxonomy likelihood, i.e. arg maxsEsenses(w) AT(Ris).
    A major strength of our model is its ability to correctly choose the sense of a hypernym to which to add a novel hyponym, despite collecting evidence over untagged word pairs.
    In our algorithm word sense disambiguation is an implicit side-effect of our algorithm; since our algorithm chooses to add the single link which, with its implied links, yields the most likely taxonomy, and since each distinct synset in WordNet has a different immediate neighborhood of relations, our algorithm simply disambiguates each node based on its surrounding structural information.
    As an example of sense disambiguation in practice, consider our
