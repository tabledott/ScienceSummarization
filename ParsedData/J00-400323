 introduced in sentence 2.
    Automatically recognizing the hierarchical structure of texts is an unresolved problem, as it involves reasoning about intentions;14 better results have been achieved on the simpler task of &amp;quot;chunking&amp;quot; the text into sequences of segments, generally by means of lexical density measures (Hearst 1997; Richmond, Smith, and Amitay 1997).
    The methods for limiting the life span of discourse entities that we considered for our system are even simpler.
    One type of heuristic we looked at are windowbased techniques, i.e., considering only the antecedents within fixed-size windows of previous sentences, although we allow some discourse entities to have a longer life span: we call this method loose segmentation.
    More specifically, a discourse entity is considered a potential antecedent for a definite description when the antecedent's head is identical to the description's head, and We also considered an even simpler recency heuristic: this involves keeping a tabl
