and Moens (1997) showed that in our corpus only 45% of the abstract sentences appear elsewhere in the body of the document (either as a close variant or in identical form), whereas Kupiec, Pedersen, and Chen report a figure of 79%.
    We believe that the reason for the difference is that in our case the abstracts were produced by the document authors and by professional abstractors in Kupiec, Pedersen, and Chen&#8217;s case.
    Author summaries tend to be less systematic (Rowley 1982) and more &#8220;deep generated,&#8221; whereas summaries by professional abstractors follow an internalized building plan (Liddy 1991) and are often created through sentence extraction (Lancaster 1998).
    Second, and more importantly, the abstracts and improved citation indexes we intend to generate are not modeled on traditional summaries, which do not provide the type of information needed for the applications we have in mind.
    Information about related work plays an important role in our strategy for summarization and
