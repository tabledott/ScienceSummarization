rison, with the same-tune-eval procedure, the accuracy improved by approximately 9% over P(Neutral) and by 8% over content BOW.
			In the second experiment, the emotion category was split into two classes: emotions with positiveversus negative valence.
			The results in terms of precision, recall, and F-score are included in table 7, us ing all features and the sep-tune-eval condition.
			Thedecrease in performance for the emotion classes mir rors the smaller amounts of data available for each class.
			As noted in section 4.3, only 9.87% of the sentences were annotated with a positive emotion,and the results for this class are worse.
			Thus, perfor mance seems likely to improve as more annotated story data becomes available; at this point, we are experimenting with merely around 12% of the total texts targeted by the data annotation project.
			5.2 Feature experiments.
			Emotions are poorly understood, and it is espe cially unclear which features may be important for their recognition from text.
			Thus, w
