is paper has also proposed a neural network training method which optimizes a discriminative criteria even when the parameters being estimated are those of a generative probability model.
    This training method successfully satisfies the conflicting constraints that it be computationally tractable and that it be a good approximation to the theoretically optimal method.
    This approach contrasts with previous approaches to scaling up discriminative methods to broad coverage natural language parsing, which have parameterizations which depart substantially from the successful previous generative models of parsing.
