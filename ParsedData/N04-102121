 is computationally expensive, we sorted the n-best list by the sentence length, and processed them from the shorter ones to the longer ones.
    We used 10 CPUs for about five days, and 273/997 development sentences and 237/878 test sentences were processed.
    The average %BLEU score (average of the best four among different 20 search initial points) was 31.7 for both hTreeToStringSum and hTreeToStringViterbi.
    Among the processed development sentences, the model preferred the oracle sentences over the produced sentence in 61% of the cases.
    The biggest problem of this model is that it is computationally very expensive.
    It processed less than 30% of the n-best lists in long CPU hours.
    In addition, we processed short sentences only.
    For long sentences, it is not practical to use this model as it is.
    A tree-to-tree translation model makes use of syntactic tree for both the source and target language.
    As in the tree-to-string model, a set of operations apply, each with some probabili
