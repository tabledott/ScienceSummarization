eliability of the correlation; for example, the standard threshold of p &lt; .05 indicates 95% confidence that the correlation was not obtained by chance.
    In our original work, we used fixed thresholds, determined manually by inspection of development (nontest) data for English-Spanish, to decide whether a candidate pair should be kept or filtered out.
    Thresholds of dp &lt; 20% and p &lt; 0.05 were used.
    As with most search tasks, performance at finding parallel Web pages can be evaluated using standard measures of precision and recall and by combining those figures using the F-measure.
    It is not possible for us to measure recall relative to the entire set of document pairs that should have been found; this would require exhaustive evaluation using the entire Web, or pooling results from a large number of different systems, as is done in the TREC information retrieval evaluations.
    Therefore, recall in this setting is measured relative to the set of candidate pairs that was generated.
