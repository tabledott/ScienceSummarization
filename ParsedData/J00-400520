cerning Criterion 1, finally, it has been observed that the figures for recall in the MUC information extraction algorithm are rather discouraging (Appelt 1998).
    The material in Section 2 suggests that this relative lack of success is no accident and that unclarities in the TD are to blame.
    Repairs are not always easy to find.
    Given this situation, we suggest that a rethinking of the coreference task is required.
    Firstly, one needs a consistent story of what reference and coreference are taken to be.
    Theoretical work on reference does not show a consensus on some crucial questions in this area (Bach 1987; Kronfeld and Roberts 1998).
    Different answers have been suggested, each with its own advantages and disadvantages.
    For example, one might identify the notion of a referring NP with that of a semantically definite NP in the sense of Barwise and Cooper (1981).3 This would include proper names, extensional definite descriptions, universally quantified NPs, and specifically used indef
