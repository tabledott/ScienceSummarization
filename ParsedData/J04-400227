    This model distinguishes the positions within a phrasal translation.
    The number of parameters of p(e  |f,i,j) is significantly higher than that of p(e  |f) alone.
    Hence, there is a data estimation problem especially for words that rarely occur.
    Therefore, we linearly interpolate the models p(e  |f) and p(e  |f, i, j). very often a monotone alignment is a correct alignment.
    Hence, the feature function hAL measures the &#8220;amount of nonmonotonicity&#8221; by summing over the distance (in the source language) of alignment templates that are consecutive in the target language: Here, j&#960;0 is defined to equal 0 and j&#960;K+1&#8722;1 is defined to equal J.
    The above-stated sum includes k = K + 1 to include the distance from the end position of the last phrase to the end of sentence.
    The sequence of K = 6 alignment templates in Figure 5 corresponds to the following sum of seven jump distances: 0 + 0 + 1 + 3 + 2 + 0 + 0 = 6.
