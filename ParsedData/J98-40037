to build five probability distributions: Given a katakana string o observed by OCR, we want to find the English word sequence w that maximizes the sum, over all e, j, and k, of of the models in turn.
    The result is a large WFSA containing all possible English translations.
    We have implemented two algorithms for extracting the best translations.
    The first is Dijkstra's shortest-path graph algorithm (Dijkstra 1959).
    The second is a recently discovered k-shortest-paths algorithm (Eppstein 1994) that makes it possible for us to identify the top k translations in efficient 0(m + n log n + kn) time, where the WFSA contains n states and m arcs.
    The approach is modular.
    We can test each engine independently and be confident that their results are combined correctly.
    We do no pruning, so the final WFSA contains every solution, however unlikely.
    The only approximation is the Viterbi one, which searches for the best path through a WFSA instead of the best sequence (i.e., the same sequence
