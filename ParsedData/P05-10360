  Supervised And Unsupervised Learning For Sentence Compression
  
    Summarization - Step Sentence Knight and Marcu (Knight and Marcu, 2000) (K&amp;M) present a noisy-channel model for sentence compression.
    The main difficulty in using this method is the lack of data; Knight and Marcu use a corpus of 1035 training sentences.
    More data is not easily available, so in addition to improving the original K&amp;M noisy-channel model, we create unsupervised and semi-supervised models of the task.
    Finally, we point out problems with modeling the task in this way.
    They suggest areas for future research.
  
  
    Summarization in general, and sentence compression in particular, are popular topics.
    Knight and Marcu (henceforth K&amp;M) introduce the task of statistical sentence compression in Statistics-Based Summarization - Step One: Sentence Compression (Knight and Marcu, 2000).
    The appeal of this problem is that it produces summarizations on a small scale.
    It simplifies general compres
