e Switchboard data is much easier given the correct positions of the EDITED nodes than without this information.
    The difference between the Gold-tags and the Machine-tags parses is small, as would be expected from the relatively small difference in the performance of the edit detector reported in Section 2.
    This suggests that putting significant effort into a tagger for use by the edit detector is unlikely to produce much improvement.
    Also, as one might expect, parsing conversational speech is harder than Wall Street Journal text, even given the gold-standard EDITED nodes.
    Probably the only aspect of the above numbers likely to raise any comment in the parsing community is the degree to which precision numbers are lower than recall.
    With the exception of the single pair reported in [3] and repeated above, no precision values in the recent statistical-parsing literature [2,3,4,5,14] have ever been lower than recall values.
    Even this one exception is by only 0.1% and not statistically si
