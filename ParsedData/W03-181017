rs, not including the simplex verb itself.
    We tried this for sures which use the automatic thesaurus we indicate whether the measure relies only on the phrasal neighbours (PN), or the simplex neighbours (SN) or some combination of both (PN SN).
    In this first column, we also indicate how many of the top ranked neighbours were used.
    Where we are evaluating scores on a numerical scale, such as the size of the overlap, we use the ranks of the numerical values and compare these to the average ranks of our gold-standard using the Spearman Rank-Order Correlation Coefficient (r8).
    Since we have a large enough sample, these can be used to obtain a normally distributed Z score and we can thus obtain the probability of obtaining a score such as this by chance under the null hypothesis (that there is no relationship).
    For the scores which involve a binary decision, such as whether a score is in WordNet or not, we use the Mann Whitney U test, which compares the gold-standard ranks for the partitioned s
