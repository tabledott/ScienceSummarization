he set of argument values of two lattices, we simply count their word overlap, giving double weight to proper names and numbers and discarding auxiliaries (we purposely ignore order because paraphrases can consist of word re-orderings).
    Given a sentence to paraphrase, we first need to identify which, if any, of our previously-computed sentence clusters the new sentence belongs most strongly to.
    We do this by finding the best alignment of the sentence to the existing lattices.4 If a matching lattice is found, we choose one of its comparable-corpus paraphrase lattices to rewrite the sentence, substituting in the argument values of the original sentence.
    This yields as many paraphrases as there are lattice paths.
  
  
    All evaluations involved judgments by native speakers of English who were not familiar with the paraphrasing systems under consideration.
    We implemented our system on a pair of comparable corpora consisting of articles produced between September 2000 and August 2002 by the Agen
