hese distinctions.
    We identify the property that precisely distinguishes among these three classes as that of argument structure&#8212; i.e., the thematic roles assigned by the verbs.
    The thematic roles for each class, and their mapping to subject and object positions, are summarized in Table 2.
    Note that verbs across these three classes allow the same subcategorization frames (taking an NP object or occurring intransitively); thus, classification based on subcategorization alone would not distinguish them.
    On the other hand, each of the three classes is comprised of multiple Levin classes, because the latter reflect more detailed semantic distinctions among the verbs (Levin 1993); thus, classification based on Levin's labeling would miss generalizations across the three broader classes.
    By contrast, as shown in Table 2, each class has a unique pattern of thematic assignments, which categorize the verbs precisely into the three classes of interest.
    Although the granularity of our class
