mbiguation, as demonstrated in the first evaluation.
    Ideally, this evaluation should be carried out using a large set of held out data, which would provide good estimates for the true probabilities of the pairs in the test sets.
    The estimation method should then use a much smaller training corpus, in which none of the example pairs occur, and then should try to recover the probabilities that are known to us from the held out data.
    However, such a setting requires that the held out corpus would be several times larger than the training corpus, while the latter should be large enough for robust application of the estimation method.
    This was not feasible with the size of our corpus, and the rather noisy data we had.
    To avoid this problem, we obtained the set of pairs with high probability from the training corpus, selecting pairs that occur at least 5 times.
    We then deleted these pairs from the data base that is used by the estimation method, forcing the method to recover their probabilit
