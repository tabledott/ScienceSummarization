    Their system makes some generalisations across pattern elements by grouping certain elements together.
    However, there is no difference between the expressiveness of the patterns learned by either approach and we do not believe this difference has any effect on the results of our experiments.
  
  
    Various approaches have been suggested for the evaluation of automatic IE pattern acquisition.
    Riloff (1996) judged the precision of patterns learned by reviewing them manually.
