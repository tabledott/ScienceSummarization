    Difference in sentence structure is one of the main sources of errors in machine translation.
    It is thus promising to &#8220;harmonize&#8221; the word order in corresponding sentences.
    The presentation in this section focuses on the following aspects: question inversion and separated verb prefixes.
    For a more detailed discussion of restructuring for statistical machine translation the reader is referred to NieBen and Ney (2000, 2001).
    In many languages, the sentence structure of questions differs from the structure in declarative sentences in that the order of the subject and the corresponding finite verb is inverted.
    From the perspective of statistical translation, this behavior has some disadvantages: The algorithm for training the parameters of the target language model Pr(eI1), which is typically a standard n-gram model, cannot deduce the probability of a word sequence in an interrogative sentence from the corresponding declarative form.
