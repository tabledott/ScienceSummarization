d in multiple classes.
  The second experiment, which we label Class-Based, implicitly takes word-sense distinc- tions into account by considering each occurrence of a verb individually and assigning it a single syntactic sig- nature according to class membership.
  The remainder of this section describes the assign- rnent of signatures to semantic busses and the two ex- periments for determining the relation of syntactic in- formation to semantic btsses.
  We will see that our clas- sitication technique shows a 15-fold improvement in the experiment where we implicitly account for word-sense distinctions.
  1Both the database and the parser are encoded in Quin- tus Prolog.
  2The design of this experiment is inspired by the work of (Dubois and Saint-Dizier, 1995).
  In particular, we depart from the alternation-based data in (Levin, 1993), which is primarily binary in that sentences are presented in pairs which constitute an alternation.
  Following Saint-Diziers work, we construct N-ary syntactic haracteriza
