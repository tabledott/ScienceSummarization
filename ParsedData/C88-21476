n or is more gen- eral).
  Unification of two feat,re structures (if it is defined) corresponds to the feature ~;tructure that has all the information contained in the original two feal;nre structures and nothing more.
  We will not describe feature structur,~s any fnrther (see [Shieber 1985a] for more details on fea- turc structures and an introduction to the unification based approach to grammars).
  2 Featme Structure Based Tree Adjoining Grammars  (FTAG) The linguistic theory underlying TAGs is centered around the factor- ization of reeursion and localization of dependencies into the elementary trees.
  The "dependent" items usually belong to the same elementary tree 2.
  Thus, for example, the predicate and its arguments will be in the same tree, as will the filler and the gap.
  Our main goal in embedding TAGs in an unificational framework is to capture this localization of de- pendencies.
  Therefore, we would like to associate f ature structures with the elementary trees (rather than break these trees
