		This formulation also dispels the notion that non-projective parsing is?harder?
			than projective parsing.
			In fact, it is easier since non-projective parsing does not need to en force the non-crossing constraint of projective trees.
			As a result, non-projective parsing complexity is justO(n2), against the O(n3) complexity of the Eisner dynamic programming algorithm, which by con struction enforces the non-crossing constraint.
	
	
			In this section, we review the work of McDonald etal.
			(2005) for online large-margin dependency pars ing.
			As usual for supervised learning, we assume a training set T = {(xt,yt)}Tt=1, consisting of pairs of a sentence xt and its correct dependency tree yt.
			In what follows, dt(x) denotes the set of possible dependency trees for sentence x. The basic idea is to extend the Margin Infused Relaxed Algorithm (MIRA) (Crammer and Singer,2003; Crammer et al, 2003) to learning with struc tured outputs, in the present case dependency trees.
