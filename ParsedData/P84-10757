    Formal definition of these and other technical notions can be found in Appendix A of Shieber et at.

    Note that some implementations have been extended to handle cyclic graph structures as well as graph structures with disjunction and negation 1Karttunen, 841.
    4In our implementation, this association is not directly encoded&#8212;since this would yield a grossly inefficient characterization of the lexicon&#8212; but is mediated by a morphological analyzer.
