anslation: The equation denotes the search for the optimal paraphrase Ep for a given sentence E. We may use Bayes&#8217; Theorem to rewrite this as: where P(Ep) is an n-gram language model providing a probabilistic estimate of the fluency of a hypothesis Ep and P(E|Ep) is the translation model, or more appropriately for paraphrasing, the replacement model, providing a probabilistic estimate of what is essentially the semantic adequacy of the hypothesis paraphrase.
    Therefore, the optimal sentential paraphrase may loosely be described as one that fluently captures most, if not all, of the meaning contained in the input sentence.
    It is important to provide a brief description of the parallel corpus used here because unsupervised induction of word alignments typically requires a relatively large number of parallel sentence pairs.
    The monolingual parallel corpus (or more accurately, quasiparallel, since not all sentence pairs are fully semantically equivalent) is constructed by scraping on-line news si
