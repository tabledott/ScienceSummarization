ation marks exhibit absorption properties.
    Sites which logically should be marked with multiple punctuation marks will often only have one ((Nunberg, 1990) as summarized in (White, 1995)).
    For example, a sentence-ending abbreviation will most likely not be followed by an additional period if the abbreviation already contains one (e.g. note that D.0 is followed by only a single . in The president lives in Washington, D.C.).
    As a result, we believe that manually writing rules is not a good approach.
    Instead, we present a solution based on a maximum entropy model which requires a few hints about what. information to use and a corpus annotated with sentence boundaries.
    The model trains easily and performs comparably to systems that require vastly more information.
    Training on 39441 sentences takes 18 minutes on a Sun Ultra Sparc and disambiguating the boundaries in a single Wall Street Journal article requires only 1.4 seconds.
