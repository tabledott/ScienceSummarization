n accuracy when the starting point was derived from a significant amount of hand-tagged text.
    In addition, although Merialdo does not highlight the point, BW re-estimation starting from less than 5000 words of hand-tagged text shows early maximum behaviour.
    Merialdo's conclusion is that taggers should be trained using as much hand-tagged text as possible to begin with, and only then applying BW re-estimation with untagged text.
    The step forward taken in the work here is to show that there are three patterns of reestimation behaviour, with differing guidelines for how to use BW effectively, and that to obtain a good starting point when a hand-tagged corpus is not available or is too small, either the lexicon or the transitions must be biased.
    While these may be useful heuristics from a practical point of view, the next step forward is to look for an automatic way of predicting the accuracy of the tagging process given a corpus and a model.
