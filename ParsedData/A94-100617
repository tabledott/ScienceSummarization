    Termight collects the candidate translations from all occurrences of a source term and sorts them in decreasing frequency order.
    The sorted list is presented to the user, followed by bilingual concordances for all occurrences of each candidate translation (see Figure 3).

    The latter task becomes especially easy when a candidate overlaps with the correct translation, directing the attention of the user to the concordance lines of this particular candidate, which are likely to be aligned correctly.
