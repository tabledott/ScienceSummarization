er of this section we will define a data structure for disjunctive descriptions, using DG structures as a basic component.
    In the following exposition, we will carefully observe the distinction between feature structures and their descriptions, as explained in [4].
    Feature structures will be represented by DGs, and descriptions of feature structures will be represented by logical formulas of the type described in [4].
    The NIL denoting no information; TOP denoting inconsistent information; a where a E A, to describe atomic values; I : where I E L and E FDL, to describe structures in which the feature labeled by I has a value described by 0; [&lt; pi &gt;,&#8226;&#8226;&#8226;,&lt; pes &gt;I where each pi E L* , to describe an equivalence class of paths sharing a common value in a feature structure; where 0, E FDL; syntax for formulas of this feature description logic (hereafter called FDL) is given in Figure 1.1 Note, in particular, that disjunction is used in descriptions of feature structures, bu
