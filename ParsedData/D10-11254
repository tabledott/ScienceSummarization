al-purpose LP or ILP solvers, instead using an MST solver in combination with dynamic programming; thus we leverage the underlying structure of the problem, thereby deriving more efficient decoding algorithms.
    Both dual decomposition and Lagrangian relaxation have a long history in combinatorial optimization.
    Our work was originally inspired by recent work on dual decomposition for inference in graphical models (Wainwright et al., 2005; Komodakis et al., 2007).
    However, the non-projective parsing problem has a very different structure from these models, and the decomposition we use is very different in nature from those used in graphical models.
    Other work has made extensive use of decomposition approaches for efficiently solving LP relaxations for graphical models (e.g., Sontag et al. (2008)).
    Methods that incorporate combinatorial solvers within loopy belief propagation (LBP) (Duchi et al., 2007; Smith and Eisner, 2008) are also closely related to our approach.
    Unlike LBP, our method
