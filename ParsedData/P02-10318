ent arguments are given separate rolesets.
    However, the preliminary version of the data used in the experiments below are not tagged for word sense, or for the roleset used.
    Sense tagging is planned for a second pass through the data.
    In many cases the roleset can be determined from the argument annotations themselves.
    However, we did not make any attempt to distinguish sense in our experiments, and simply attempted to predict argument labels based on the identity of the lexical predicate.
  
  
    In previous work using the FrameNet corpus, Gildea and Jurafsky (2002) developed a system to predict semantic roles from sentences and their parse trees as determined by the statistical parser of Collins (1997).
    We will briefly review their probability model before adapting the system to handle unparsed data.
    Probabilities of a parse constituent belonging to a given semantic role were calculated from the following features: Phrase Type: This feature indicates the syntactic type of the phras
