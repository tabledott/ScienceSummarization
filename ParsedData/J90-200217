ge model.
    Thus, we have one parameter for every pair of words in the source language.
    We estimate these parameters from the counts of word pairs in a large sample of text from the English part of our Hansard data using a method described by Jelinek and Mercer (1980).
    In Section 3 we discussed alignments of sentence pairs.
    If we had a collection of aligned pairs of sentences, then we could estimate the parameters of the translation model by counting, just as we do for the language model.
    However, we do not have alignments but only the unaligned pairs of sentences.
    This is exactly analogous to the situation in speech recognition where one has the script of a sentence and the time waveform corresponding to an utterance of it, but no indication of just what in the time waveform corresponds to what in the script.
    In speech recognition, this problem is attacked with the EM algorithm (Baum 1972; Dempster et al. 1977).
    We have adapted this algorithm to our problem in translation.
