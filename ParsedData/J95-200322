at. purposes, we will use the following schematic to refer to the centers of utterances in a sequence: For Ur,: COO = a, Cf(Un) = (ei, ez, &#8226; &#8226; &#8226; ep), a = ek, for some k. For Und_i: Cb(Un+i) realizes em and, for all j, j &lt; m, ei is not realized in U0+1; i.e., em is realized in Un+1, and no higher ranked ej is realized in Finally, we also define three types of transition relations across pairs of utterances.
    The coherence of a segment is affected by the kinds of centering transitions engendered by a speaker's choices of linguistic realizations in the utterances constituting the segment.
    Of particular concern are choices among (1) CONTINUATION of the center from one utterance not only to the next, but also to subsequent utterances; (2) RETENTION of the center from one utterance to the next; (3) SHIFTING the center, if it is neither retained nor continued.'
  
  
    The centering framework described above provides the basis for stating a number of specific claims about the relationsh
