s noted earlier, this representation subsumes the first-order representation of McDonald et al. (2005b), so we can incorporate all of their features as well as the new second-order features we now describe.
    The old first-order features are built from the parent and child words, their POS tags, and the POS tags of surrounding words and those of words between the child and the parent, as well as the direction and distance from the parent to the child.
    The second-order features are built from the following conjunctions of word and POS identity predicates xi-pos, xk-pos, xj-pos xk-pos, xj-pos xk-word, xj-word xk-word, xj-pos xk-pos, xj-word where xi-pos is the part-of-speech of the ith word in the sentence.
    We also include conjunctions between these features and the direction and distance from sibling j to sibling k. We determined the usefulness of these features on the development set, which also helped us find out that features such as the POS tags of words between the two siblings would not improve
