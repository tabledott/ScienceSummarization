tely obvious how to use the ITS algorithm to equip attribute-value grammars with probabilities.
    In brief, the difficulty is that the ITS algorithm requires the computation of the expectations, under random fields, of certain functions; in general, computing these expectations involves summing over all configurations (all possible character sequences, in the orthography application), which is not possible when the configuration space is large.
    Instead, DD&amp;L use Gibbs sampling to estimate the needed expectations.
    Gibbs sampling is possible for the application that DD&amp;L consider.
    A prerequisite for Gibbs sampling is that the configuration space be closed under relabeling of graph nodes.
    In the orthography application, the configuration space is the set of possible English words, represented as finite linear graphs labeled with ASCII characters.
    Every way of changing a label, that is, every substitution of one ASCII character for a different one, yields a possible English word.
