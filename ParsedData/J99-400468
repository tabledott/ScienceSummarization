 if the sentence can be generated by the grammar, FALSE otherwise) is the same as its value under a transformed grammar.
    Therefore, we say that this grammar transformation is value preserving under the Boolean semiring.
    We can generalize this concept of value preserving to other semirings.
    Elsewhere (Goodman 1998), we show that using essentially the same item-based descriptions we have used for parsing, we can specify grammar transformations.
    The concept of value preserving grammar transformation is already known in the intersection of formal language theory and algebra (Kuich 1997; Kuich and Salomaa 1986; Teitelbaum 1973).
    Our contribution is to show that these value preserving transformations can be written as simple item-based descriptions, allowing the same computational machinery to be used for grammar transformations as is used for parsing, and to some extent showing the relationship between certain grammar transformations and certain parsers, such as that of Graham, Harrison, and Ru
