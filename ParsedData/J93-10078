    In this section, we present four properties of collocations that we have identified and discuss their relevance to computational linguistics.
    Collocations are difficult to produce for second language learners (Nakhimovsky and Leed 1979).
    In most cases, the learner cannot simply translate word-for-word what s/he would say in her/his native language.
    As we can see in Table 1, the word-forword translation of &amp;quot;to open the door&amp;quot; works well in both directions in all five languages.
    In contrast, translating word-for-word the expression: &amp;quot;to break down/force the door&amp;quot; is a poor strategy in both directions in all five languages.
    The co-occurrence of &amp;quot;door&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;open&amp;quot; is an open or free combination, whereas the combination &amp;quot;door&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;break down&amp;quot; is a collocation.
    Learners of English would not produce &amp;quot;to break down a door&amp;quot; whether their first language is French, G
