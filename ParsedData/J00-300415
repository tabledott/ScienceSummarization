ximum context length and maintains statistics for this and all shorter contexts.
    The maximum is five in most of the experiments below, and statistics are maintained for models of order 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, and 0.
    These are not stored separately; they are all kept in a single trie structure.
    PPM incorporates a simple and highly effective method to combine the predictions of the models of different order&#8212;often called the problem of &amp;quot;backoff.&amp;quot; To encode the next symbol, it starts with the maximum-order model (order 5).
    If that model contains a prediction for the upcoming character, the character is transmitted according to the order 5 distribution.
    Otherwise, both encoder and decoder escape down to order 4.
    There are two possible situations.
    If the order 5 context&#8212;that is, the preceding five-character sequence&#8212;has not been encountered before, then escape to order 4 is inevitable, and both encoder and decoder can deduce that fact without requiring any comm
