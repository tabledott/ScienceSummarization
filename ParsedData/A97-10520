    of the system that are new: the extractor, classifier and evaluator.
    The grammar consists of 455 phrase structure rule schemata in the format accepted by the parser (a syntactic variant of a Definite Clause Grammar with iterative (Kleene) operators).
    It is 'shallow' in that no atof which thetempt is made to fully analyse unbounded dependencies.
    However, the distinction between arguments and adjuncts is expressed, following X-bar theory (e.g.
    Jackendoff, 1977), by Chomsky-adjunction to maximal projections of adjuncts (XP XP Adjunct) as opposed to 'government' of arguments (i.e. arguments are sisters within projections; X1 XO Argl... ArgN). more, all analyses are rooted (in S) so the grammar assigns global, shallow and often 'spurious' analyses to many sentences.
    There are 29 distinct values for VSUBCAT and 10 for PSUBCAT; these are analysed in patterns along with specific closed-class lemmas of arguments, such as suband so for
