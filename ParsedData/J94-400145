rom right to left for each bunsetsu in the sentence with this simple rule for CSs, heuristic rules for head-dependent relations (described in Section 5.1), and the no-cross condition.
    The result of this method (the lower part of Table 5) clearly shows the superiority of our method over the conventional method.
    Third, we report the results of the redetection of CSs and the recovery of omitted components.
    &#8226; The redetection of CSs was activated only for incorrect CSs, so we can conclude that the conditions for performing redetection are reasonable.
    Out of 215 CSs, 180 were obtained correctly by the first CS detection (the success ratio is 84%).
    Five CSs were redetected because of incorrect relation to other CSs, and all of them were analyzed correctly.
    Eight CSs were redetected because of the failure in obtaining a dependency structure, and five out of them were recognized correctly.
    Finally, 190 CSs out of 215 were obtained correctly (the success ratio is 88%).
