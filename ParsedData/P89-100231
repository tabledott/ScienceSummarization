t available only after the subject has been generated.
    This nondeterminism can be eliminated by deferring lexical choice to a postprocess.
    The generator will yield a list of lexical items instead of a list of words.
    To this list a small phonological front end is applied.
    BUG uses such a mechanism to eliminate much of the uninteresting nondeterminism in choice of word forms.
    Of course, the same mechanism could be added to any of the other generation techniques discussed to in this paper.
  
  
    Further enhancements to the algorithm are envisioned.
    First, any system making use of a tabular link predicate over complex nonterminals (like the chained_nodes predicate used by the generation algorithm and including the link predicate used in the BUP parser (Matsumoto et al., 1983)) is subject to a problem of spurious redundancy in processing if the elements in the link table are not mutually exclusive.
    For instance, a single chain rule might be considered to be applicable twice because
