t propositions that hold between scientific concepts within biomedical texts (Swanson and Smalheiser, 1994).
    One of the important challenges of biomedical text, along with most other technical text, is the proliferation of noun compounds.
    A typical article title is shown below; it consists a cascade of four noun phrases linked by prepositions: Open-labeled long-term study of the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of subcutaneous sumatriptan in acute migraine treatment.
    The real concern in analyzing such a title is in determining the relationships that hold between different concepts, rather than on finding the appropriate attachments (which is especially difficult given the lack of a verb).
    And before we tackle the prepositional phrase attachment problem, we must find a way to analyze the meanings of the noun compounds.
    Our goal is to extract propositional information from text, and as a step towards this goal, we classify constituents according to which semantic relationships hold between
