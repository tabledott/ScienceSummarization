re retrieved; more flexible collocations such as &amp;quot;make-decision,&amp;quot; in which the two words can be separated by an arbitrary number of words, are not dealt with.
    Second, these techniques simply analyze the collocations according to their observed frequency in the corpus; this makes the results too dependent on the size of the corpus.
    Finally, at a more general level, although disambiguation was originally considered as a performance task, the collocations retrieved have not been used for any specific computational task.
    Church and Hanks (1989) describe a different set of techniques to retrieve collocations.
    A collocation as defined in their work is a pair of correlated words.
    That is, a collocation is a pair of words that appear together more often than expected.
    Church et al. (1991) improve over Choueka's work as they retrieve interrupted as well as uninterrupted sequences of words.
    Also, these collocations have been used by an automatic parser in order to resolve a
