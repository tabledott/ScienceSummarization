  IDAS uses a KL-ONE type knowledge repr~entation system, with roles corresponding to attributes and lillem to values.
  The type attribute is implicit in the position of an object in the taxonomy, and is not explicitly represented.
  The value and taxonomy- children functions are defined in terms of standard knowledge-base access functions.
  A knowledg~base author can specify explicit basic- level attr ibute values in IDAS user models, but IDAS is also capable of using heuristics to guess which value is basic-level.
  The heuristics are fairly simple (e.g., "nse the most general value that is not in the upper- model [BKMW90] and has a one-word realization"), but they seem (so far) to be at least somewhat effec- tive.
  A *preferred-attributes* li t has been crcated for IOASs domain (complex electronic machinery) by visual inspection of the equipment being docu- mented; its first membe
