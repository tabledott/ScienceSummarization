			As regards optimization, we may note that although there is a significant improvement for both models, the magnitude of the difference is relatively small.
			Table 4 shows the parsing accuracy obtained with theoptimized versions of the MBL models (lexical and nonlexical), compared to the MCLE model described in sec tion 3.
			We see that MBL outperforms the MCLE model even when limited to the same features (all differences again being significant at the .0001 level according to a paired t-test).
			This can probably be explained by the fact that the similarity-based smoothing built into the memory-based approach gives a better extrapolation than the fixed back-off sequence in the MCLE model.
			We also see that the lexical MBL model outperforms both the other m
