because they were modified by particular syntactic constructions, but because they were part of the reader's general world knowledge.
    Definite noun phrases that do not need to be resolved because they are understood through world knowledge can represent a significant portion of the existential noun phrases in a text.
    In our research, we found that existential NPs account for 63% of all definite NPs, and 24% of them could not be identified by syntactic or lexical means.
    This paper details our method for identifying existential NPs that are understood through general world knowledge.
    Our system requires no hand coded information and can recognize a larger portion of existential NPs than Vieira and Poesio's system.
  
  
    To better understand what makes an NP anaphoric or non-anaphoric, we found it useful to classify definite NPs into a taxonomy.
    We first classified definite NPs into two broad categories, referential NPs, which have prior referents in the texts, and existential NPs, which
