    We assume a morphological component such as GERTWOL (1996) to apply before the compositional process starts.
    Composition itself is implemented as follows, relying on a separate lexicon for particles.
    The particle lexicon is hierarchically structured and lists selectional restrictions with respect to the base verb selected.
    An example for the hierarchical structure is given in figure 7 (without selectional restrictions for matters of simplicity), where heraus- is a hyponym of her- and am-.
    SAdjectives pertaining to a noun from which they derive their meaning (financial, finances).
    Selectional restrictions for particles include Aktionsart, a particular semantic verb field, deictic orientation and directional orientation of the base verb.
    The evaluation of a particle verb takes the following steps.
    First, GermaNet is searched for an explicit entry of the particle verb, If no such entry exists the verb is morphologically analyzed and its semantics is compositionally determi
