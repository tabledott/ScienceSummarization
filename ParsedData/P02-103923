Section 5 use syntactic statistics from the training corpus.
    Therefore, we are now investigating more sophisticated LMs such as (Charniak, 2001) which incorporate syntactic features and lexical information.
  
  
    We have presented a decoding algorithm for a syntax-based statistical machine translation.
    The translation model was extended to incorporate phrasal translations.
    Because the input of the channel model is an English parse tree, the decoding algorithm is based on conventional syntactic parsing, and the grammar is expanded by the channel operations of the TM.
    As the model size becomes huge in a practical setting, and the decoder considers multiple syntactic structures for a word alignment, efficient pruning is necessary.
    We applied several pruning techniques and obtained good decoding quality and coverage.
    The choice of the LM is an important issue in implementing a decoder for the syntaxbased TM.
    At present, the best result is obtained by using trigrams, but a more soph
