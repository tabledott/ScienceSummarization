mpaigns on bio-entity recognition, such as BioCreAtIvE and JNLPBA 2004 shared task, have shown that several systems are able to achieve good performance (even if it is a bit worse than that reported on news articles).
    However, relation identification is more useful from an applicative perspective but it is still a considerable challenge for automatic tools.
    In this work, we propose a supervised machine learning approach to relation extraction which is applicable even when (deep) linguistic processing is not available or reliable.
    In particular, we explore a kernel-based approach based solely on shallow linguistic processing, such as tokenization, sentence splitting, Part-of-Speech (PoS) tagging and lemmatization.
    Kernel methods (Shawe-Taylor and Cristianini, 2004) show their full potential when an explicit computation of the feature map becomes computationally infeasible, due to the high or even infinite dimension of the feature space.
    For this reason, kernels have been recently used to de
