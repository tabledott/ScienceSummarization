 be processed sooner than they would be in that monotonic traversal.
    Each source position then generates a certain number of target words.
    The restrictions are fully formalized in Section 3.5.
    A typical situation is shown in Figure 5.
    When translating the sentence monotonically from left to right, the translation of the German finite verb kann, which is the left verbal brace in this case, is skipped until the German noun phrase mein Kollege, which is the subject of the sentence, is translated.
    Then, the right verbal brace is translated: Word reordering for the translation direction German to English: The reordering is restricted to the German verb group.
    The infinitive besuchen and the negation particle nicht.
    The following restrictions are used: One position in the source sentence may be skipped for a distance of up to L = 4 source positions, and up to two source positions may be moved for a distance of at most R = 10 source positions (the notation L and R shows the relation to th
