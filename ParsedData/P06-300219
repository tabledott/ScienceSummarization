ted the claim of language-independence by validating the output of our system against supervised systems in three languages.
    The system is not very sensitive to parameter changes: the number of feature words, the frequency cutoffs, the log-likelihood threshold and all other parameters did not change overall performance considerably when altered in reasonable limits.
    In this way it was possbile to arrive at a one-size-fits-all configuration that allows the parameter-free unsupervised tagging of large corpora.
    To really judge the benefit of an unsupervised tagging system, it should be evaluated in an application-based way.
    Ideally, the application should tell us the granularity of our tagger: e.g. semantic class learners could greatly benefit from the high-granular word sets arising in both of our partitionings, which we endeavoured to lump into a coarser tagset here.
