re, the Jaccard measure (standard and binary), the Euclidean distance, and the scalar product, and found that the city-block metric yielded the best results.
    This may seem surprising, since the formula is very simple and the computational effort smaller than with the other measures.
    It must be noted, however, that the other authors applied their similarity measures directly to the (log of the) co-occurrence vectors, whereas we applied the measures to the association vectors based on the log-likelihood ratio.
    According to our observations, estimates based on the log-likelihood ratio are generally more reliable across different corpora and languages.
    The results reported in the next section were obtained using the following procedure: 1.
    Based on the word co-occurrences in the German corpus, for each of the 100 German test words its association vector was computed.
    In these vectors, all entries belonging to words not found in the English part of the base lexicon were deleted.
