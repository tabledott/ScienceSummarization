  943 the pattern base: information about the event type (predicate) associated with the pattern, and the mapping from pattern elements to pred- icate arguments.
  We have evaluated ExDIsco by manually incorporating the discovered pat- terns into the Proteus knowledge bases and run- ning a full MUC-style evaluation.
  We started with our extraction system, Pro- tens, which was used in MUC-6 in 1995, and has undergone continual improvements since the MUC evaluation.
  We removed all the scenario-specific clause and nominalization pat- terns.
  4 We then reviewed all the patterns which were generated by the ExDIsco,  deleting those which were not relewmt to the task, or which did not correspond irectly to a predicate al- ready implemented tbr this task)  The remain- ing pat;terns were augmented with intbnnation about the corresponding predicate, and the re- lation between the pattern and the pre
