&#8212;proportional to the number of words replaced by MSA in the same sentence&#8212;and replacing each with an arbitrary word from its most frequent WordNet synset.
    Since our SMT approach depends quite heavily on a target language model, we presented an alternate WordNet baseline using a target language model.8 In combination with the language model described in section 3.4, we used a very simple replacement model: each appropriately inflected member of the most frequent synset was proposed as a possible replacement with uniform probability.
    This was intended to isolate the contribution of the language model from the replacement model.
    Given that our alignments, while aggregated into phrases, are fundamentally word-aligned, one question that arises is whether the information we learn is different in character than that learned from much simpler techniques.
    To explore this hypothesis, we introduced an additional baseline that used statistical clustering to produce an automated, unsupervised s
