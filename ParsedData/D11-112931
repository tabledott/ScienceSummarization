e then show how to apply verbs to their subject/object, in order to compute the meaning of intransitive and transitive sentences.
    (2008) with full confidence.
    Other work uses matrices to model meaning (Baroni and Zamparelli, 2010; Guevara, 2010), but only for adjective-noun phrases.
    Our approach easily applies to such compositions, as well as to sentences containing combinations of adjectives, nouns, verbs, and adverbs.
    The other key difference is that they learn their matrices in a top-down fashion, i.e. by regression from the composite adjective-noun context vectors, whereas our model is bottom-up: it learns sentence/phrase meaning compositionally from the vectors of the compartments of the composites.
    Finally, very similar functions, for example a verb with argument alternations such as &#8216;break&#8217; in &#8216;Y breaks&#8217; and &#8216;X breaks Y&#8217;, are not treated as unrelated.
    The matrix of the intransitive &#8216;break&#8217; uses the corpusobserved information about
