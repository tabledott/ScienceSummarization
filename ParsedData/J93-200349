e assume that We require that 'irk'', be greater than r[]k_i.
    Some English words tend to produce a series of French words that belong together, while others tend to produce a series of words that should be separate.
    For example, implemented can produce mis en application, which usually occurs as a unit, but not can produce ne pas, which often occurs with an intervening verb.
    We expect d&gt;1(2IB(pas)) to be relatively large compared with d&gt;i (218( en)).
    After training, we find that d&gt;i(2I13(pas)) is 0.6847 and d&gt;1(215( en)) is 0.1533.
    Whereas we assume that 7-Ni can be placed either before or after any previously positioned words, we require subsequent words from TN to be placed in order.
    This does not mean that they must occupy consecutive positions but only that the second word from TN must lie to the right of the first, the third to the right of the second, and so on.
    Because of this, only one of the Om! arrangements of r[t] is possible.
    We leave the routine details
