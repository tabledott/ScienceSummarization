    Agents play fixed roles in the argumentation, and there are so Statements expressing research continuation, with source article number.

    Note the similarity of agent roles to the three kinds of intellectual attribution mentioned above.
    We also propose prototypical actions frequently occurring in scientific discourse: the f
