    We propose to measure the quality of an alignment model by comparing the quality of the most probable alignment, the Viterbi alignment, with a manually produced reference alignment.
    This has the advantage of enabling an automatic evaluation to be performed.
    In addition, we shall show that this quality measure is a precise and reliable evaluation criterion that is well suited to guide designing and training statistical alignment models.
    The software used to train the statistical alignment models described in this article is publicly available (Och 2000).
    We follow Brown, Della Pietra, Della Pietra, and Mercer (1993) to define alignment as an object for indicating the corresponding words in a parallel text.
    Figure 1 shows an example.
    Very often, it is difficult for a human to judge which words in a given target string correspond to which words in its source string.
    Especially problematic is the alignment of words within idiomatic expressions, free translations, and missing fu
