core stability.
    Here we first compare pyramid scores of the original summaries with DUC scores.
    Then we present results demonstrating the need for at least five summaries per pyramid, given this corpus of 100-word summaries.
    Table 2 compares DUC and pyramid scores for all three sets.
    The first two rows of pyramid scores are for a pyramid of order 3 using a single pyramid with the remaining three original DUC summaries (n=3) versus an where j = max( i average over all order-3 pyramids (Avg. n=3); the third row of pyramid scores are for the single pyramid of order 9 (n=9; note that the 10th summary is the one being scored).
    Compared to the DUC scores, pyramid scores show all humans performing reasonably well.
    While the Lockerbie set summaries are better overall, the difference with the PAL and China sets scores is less great than with the DUC method, which accords with our impressions about the relative quality of the summaries.
    Note that pyramid scores are higher for larger pyramid
