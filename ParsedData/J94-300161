 x 0 replacement: This relation includes strings where the 0 x 0 replacement occurs only when immediately preceded and followed by identical substrings satisfying A and p, respectively.
    But this formulation does not allow for the fact, noted above, that the context strings of one application may overlap either the contexts or the center strings of another.
    For example, consider the following optional rule, which allows an abstract B to be rewritten as b intervocalically: With the definition of Replace just given, the string pair on the left below would be accepted but the pair on the right would not: But the second pair also represents a valid application of the rule, one in which the center vowel is serving as the right context of one application and the left context of the other.
    The problem is that a given string symbol can simultaneously serve several different roles in the application of a rule, and all possible interactions must be accounted for.
    As a next approximation, we avoid this co
