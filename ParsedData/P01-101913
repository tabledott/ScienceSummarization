dles denote these via g) and a wellfounded partial order G on L (this helps interpret the hcons; cf.
    Fernando (1997)).
    A SEMENT then denotes an element of H x ...H x P(G), where the Hs (= L x I) are the new hook and holes.
    Note that the language E is first order, and we do not use A-abstraction over higher order elements.6 For example, in the standard Montagovian view, a quantifier such as every is represented by the higher-order expression APAQbx(P(x), Q(x)).
    In our framework, however, every is the following (using qeq conditions, as in the LinGO ERG): A slight complication is that the determiner is also syntactically selected by the N' via the SPR slot (following Pollard and Sag (1994)).
    However, from the standpoint of the compositional semantics, the determiner is the semantic head, and it is only its SPEC hole which is involved: the N' must be treated as having an empty SPR hole.
    In the ERG, the distinction between intersective and scopal modification arises because of distinctions
