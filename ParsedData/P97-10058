&amp;quot; Factors are not used for genre classification (the values of a text on the various dimensions are often not informative with respect to genre).
    Rather, factors are used to validate hypotheses about the functions of various linguistic features.
    An important and more relevant set of experiments, which deserves careful attention, is presented in Karlgren and Cutting (1994).
    They too begin with a corpus of hand-classified texts, the Brown corpus.
    One difficulty here. however, is that it is not clear to what extent the Brown corpus classification used in this work is relevant for practical or theoretical purposes.

    We will replace these cues wit
