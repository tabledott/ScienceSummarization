Examples like this, and his inability to rigorously distinguish performative sentences from those which purportedly have truth value (which he called constatives) led Austin to the view that all utterances could be described as actions, or speech acts.
    He classified speech acts into three classes, the locutionary, illocutionary, and perlocutionary acts.
    A locutionary act is an act of saying something: it is the act of uttering sequences of words drawn from the vocabulary of a given language and conforming to its grammar.
    An illocutionary act is one performed in making an utterance; &amp;quot;promise&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;warn&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;inform&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;request&amp;quot; are names of illocutionary acts.
    In general, any verb that can complete the sentence &amp;quot;I hereby &lt;verb&gt; you {that I to] ...&amp;quot; names an illocutionary act.
    An utterance has illocutionary force F if the speaker intends to perform the illocutionary act F by making that utterance.
