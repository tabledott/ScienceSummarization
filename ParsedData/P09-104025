ike the standard system for the subset of projective trees.
    As a result, the time complexity of deterministic parsing is O(n2) in the worst case, which is rare, but O(n) in the best case, which is common, and experimental results on data from five languages support the conclusion that expected running time is linear in the length of the sentence.
    Experimental results also show that parsing accuracy is competitive, especially for languages like Czech and Slovene where nonprojective dependency structures are common, and especially with respect to the exact match score, where it has the best reported results for four out of five languages.
    Finally, the simplicity of the system makes it very easy to implement.
    Future research will include an in-depth error analysis to find out why the system works better for some languages than others and why the exact match score improves even when the attachment score goes down.
    In addition, we want to explore alternative oracle functions, which try to minim
