s. or at least implicit in, the sounding.
    Hence, in addition to trying to derive expressions such as (3) for nominal reference, for possible non-nominal reference we try to prove similar expressions.
    (3 ... e, a,...)... A activate'(e, a) A ...3 That is, we wish to derive the existence, from background knowledge or the previous text, of some known or implied activation.
    Most, but certainly not all, information conveyed non-nominally is new, and hence will be assumed.
    Compound Nominals: To resolve the reference of the noun phrase &amp;quot;lube-oil alarm&amp;quot;, we need to find two entities o and a with the appropriate properties.
    The entity o must be lube oil, a must be an alarm, and there must be some implicit relation between them.
    Let us call that implicit relation nn.
    Then the expression that must be proved is In the proof, instantiating nn amounts to interpreting the implicit relation between the two nouns in the compound nominal.
    Compound nominal interpretation is thus
