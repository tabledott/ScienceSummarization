nguage have been widely adopted over the last few years.
    The simplest of these (Chiang, 2005) make no use of information from syntactic theories or syntactic annotations, whereas others have successfully incorporated syntactic information on the target side (Galley et al., 2004; Galley et al., 2006) or the source side (Liu et al., 2006; Huang et al., 2006).
    The next obvious step is toward models that make full use of syntactic information on both sides.
    But the natural generalization to this setting has been found to underperform phrasebased models (Liu et al., 2009; Ambati and Lavie, 2008), and researchers have begun to explore solutions (Zhang et al., 2008; Liu et al., 2009).
    In this paper, we explore the reasons why treeto-tree translation has been challenging, and how source syntax and target syntax might be used together.
    Drawing on previous successful attempts to relax syntactic constraints during grammar extraction in various ways (Zhang et al., 2008; Liu et al., 2009; Zollmann and
