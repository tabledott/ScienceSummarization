    The L-BFGS algorithm requires the following values at each iteration: the expected value, and the empirical expected value, of each feature (to calculate the gradient); and the value of the likelihood function.
    For the normal-form model, the empirical expected values and the likelihood can easily be obtained, since these only involve the single goldstandard derivation for each sentence.
    The expected values can be calculated using the method in Clark and Curran (2003).
    For the dependency model, the computations of the empirical expected values (5) and the likelihood function (4) are more complex, since these require sums over just those derivations leading to the gold s
