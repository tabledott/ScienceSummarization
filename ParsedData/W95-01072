), but also for prepositional phrase attachment disambiguation (Brill and Resnik, 1994), and assigning unlabeled binary-branching tree structure to sentences (Brill, 1993a).
    Because transformation-based learning uses patternaction rules based on selected features of the local context, it is helpful for the values being predicted to also be encoded locally.
    In the text-chunking application, encoding the predicted chunk structure in tags attached to the words, rather than as brackets between words, avoids many of the difficulties with unbalanced bracketings that would result if such local rules were allowed to insert or alter inter-word brackets directly.
    In this study, training and test sets marked with two different types of chunk structure were derived algorithmically from the parsed data in the Penn Treebank corpus of Wall Street Journal text (Marcus et al., 1994).
    The source texts were then run through Brill's part-of-speech tagger (Brill, 1993c), and, as a baseline heuristic, chunk structu
