ed using very simple statisti- cal models.
  The performance of the perfect tagger shows that, informally speaking, roughly half of the information necessary to disambiguate parses is available in the lexi- cal types alone.
  About half of the remaining information is recovered by our best method, Combined.
  An alternative (more primitive) task is the tagging task itself.
  It is interesting to know how much the tagging task can be improved by perfecting parse disambigua- tion.
  With the availability of a parser, we can examine the accuracy of the tag sequence of the highest scoring parse, rather than trying to tag the word sequence directly.
  We refer to this problem as the tag selection problem, by analogy with the relation between the parsing problem and the parse selection problem.
  The first column of Ta- ble 2 presents the performance of the models on the tag selection problem.
  The results are averaged accuracies over 10 cross-validation splits of the same corpus as the previous experiment, and sh
