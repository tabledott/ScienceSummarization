sment of the quality of tagging seems possible, and, based on the experience of prior volunteer contribution projects (Singh, 2002), the rate of maliciously misleading or incorrect contributions is surprisingly low.
    Additionally, the tagging quality will be estimated by comparing the agreement level among Web contributors with the agreement level that was already measured in previous sense tagging projects.
    An analysis of the semantic annotation task performed by novice taggers as part of the SemCor project (Fellbaum et al., 1997) revealed an agreement of about 82.5% among novice taggers, and 75.2% among novice taggers and lexicographers.
    Moreover, since we plan to use paid, trained taggers to create a separate test corpus for each of the words tagged with Open Mind Word Expert, these same paid taggers could also validate a small percentage of the training data for which no gold standard exists.
