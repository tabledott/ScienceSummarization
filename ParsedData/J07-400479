shown in Table 3.
    There are also the three distance measures which encode the distance between the two head words of the combining categories, as for the dependency model.
    Here the distance feature encodes the combining categories, the result category, the head of the result category (either as a word or POS tag), and the distance between the two head words.
    For the features in the normal-form model, a frequency cutoff of two was applied; that is, a feature had to occur at least twice in the gold-standard normal-form derivations to be included in the model.
    The same cutoff was applied to the features in the dependency model, except for the rule instantiation feature types.
    For these features the counting was done across all derivations licensed by the gold-standard lexical category sequences and a frequency cutoff of 10 was applied.
    The larger cutoff was used because the productivity of the grammar can lead to very large numbers of these features.
    We also only included those featur
