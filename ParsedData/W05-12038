 total number of documents in the corpus, divided by the total number of documents that include that word.
    In the experiments reported in this paper, we use the British National Corpus to derive the document frequency counts, but other corpora could be used to the same effect.
    Provided a measure of semantic similarity between words, and an indication of the word specificity, we combine them into a measure of text semantic similarity, by pairing up those words that are found to be most similar to each other, and weighting their similarity with the corresponding specificity score.
    We define a directional measure of similarity, which indicates the semantic similarity of a text segment Ti with respect to a text segment Tj.
    This definition provides us with the flexibility we need to handle applications where the directional knowledge is useful (e.g. entailment), and at the same time it gives us the means to handle bidirectional similarity through a simple combination of two unidirectional metrics.
