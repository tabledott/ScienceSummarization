    In terms of world knowledge, the simplest and most relevant resource for this task is a database of known names.
    For each entity class to be recognized and tagged, it is assumed that the user can provide a short list (order of one hundred) of unambiguous examples (seeds).
    Of course the more examples provided, the better the results, but what we try to prove is that even with minimal knowledge good results can be achieved.
