ionary, each with a count of one.
    We took the enhanced dictionary with counts to define a Dirichlet prior, which is the conjugate prior to a multinomial distribution over discrete events (like the distribution p over link types we seek to estimate) (MacKay and Peto 1995).
    Such a prior is characterized by counts of all such events; when it is used in an EM procedure, these prior counts are added to those produced by the E step on every iteration.
    Intuitively, if a word pair (x, y) is expected to be a likely lexical word pair in the dictionary and cognate set, then models that make (x, y) probable are more likely (according to the prior).
    Therefore the expected count of (x, y) is increased at each iteration of training to the extent that the prior favors it.
    Using the enhanced, weighted lexicon as a Dirichlet prior (containing 77,699 entries and a total count of 85,332), a word-to-word translation model (Melamed 2000) was trained on a verse-aligned Bible (15,548 verses, averaging 25.5 Englis
