number of open questions.
    The first is whether there exists a better string transformation algorithm to use in the induction step.
    One possible area of investigation is to use larger dictionaries and assess how much better stochastic transducers, and distance metrics derived from them, perform with more training data.
    Another option is to investigate the use of multi-vowel or multi-consonant compounds which better reflect the underlying phonetic units, using an more sophisticated edit distance measure.
    In this paper, we explore ways of using cognate pairs to create translation lexicons.
    It is an interesting research question as to whether we can augment these methods with translation probabilities estimated from statistical frequency information gleaned from loosely aligned or unaligned bilingual corpora for non-cognate pairs.
    Various machine learning techniques, including co-training and mutual bootstrapping, could employ these additional measures in creating better estimates.
