ty than before.
    This is mainly because the rigid tree-building constraints prevent really bad trees being built and so the worst results are less bad.
    The results are also significantly better than for subtree swapping, with the edge-sensitive representation clearly winning.
  
  
    It is necessary to be careful in evaluating these results, which are only as good as the evaluation function.
    This is certainly flawed in major ways.
    The texts are of a specific type, there are only three of them and we have not used all rhetorical relations.
    Some independent evaluation by human readers is imperative at this point.
    The texts are especially limited by the fact that there is no account taken of the possibilities for aggregation, embedding etc. in the trees that are produced.
    Nevertheless the approach looks promising enough that it is a real candidate to be used with the &#8226; ILEX system.
    Future work needs to look at improving the characterisation of good trees and if possible int
