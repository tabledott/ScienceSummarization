ences in the other language.
    Let d be the distance function described in the previous section, and let D(i, j) be the minimum distance between sentences s1, &#8226; &#8226; &#8226; si and their translations , &#8226; &#8226; &#8226; ti, under the maximum likelihood alignment.
    D(i,j) is computed by minimizing over six cases (substitution, deletion, insertion, contraction, expansion, and merger) which, in effect, impose a set of slope constraints.
    That is, D(i,j) is defined by the following recurrence with the initial condition D(i, j) = 0.
  
  
    To evaluate align, its results were compared with a human alignment.
    All of the UBS sentences were aligned by a primary judge, a native speaker of English with a reading knowledge of French and German.
    Two additional judges, a native speaker of French and a native speaker of German, respectively, were used to check the primary judge on 43 of the more difficult paragraphs having 230 sentences (out of 118 total paragraphs with 725 sentences).
