			More concretely, in the FrameNet paradigm, themeaning of predicates (usually verbs, nouns, or adjectives) is conveyed by frames, schematic repre sentations of situations.
			Semantic roles (or frame1The approaches are too numerous to list; we refer the inter ested reader to Carreras and Ma`rquez (2005) for an overview.elements) are defined for each frame and correspond to salient entities present in the evoked situ ation.
			Predicates with similar semantics instantiate the same frame and are attested with the same roles.
			The FrameNet database lists the surface syntacticrealizations of semantic roles, and provides anno tated example sentences from the British National Corpus.
			For example, the frame Commerce Sell has three core semantic roles, namely Buyer, Goods, andSeller ? each expressed by an indirect object, a di rect object, and a subject (see sentences (1a)?(1c)).
