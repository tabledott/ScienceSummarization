l as generic software toolkits.
    Moreover, a surprising variety of problems are attackable with FSTs, from partof-speech tagging to letter-to-sound conversion to name transliteration.
    However, language problems like machine translation break this mold, because they involve massive reordering of symbols, and because the transformation processes seem sensitive to hierarchical tree structure.
    Recently, specific probabilistic tree-based models have been proposed not only for machine translation (Wu, 1997; Alshawi, Bangalore, and Douglas, 2000; Yamada and Knight, 2001; Gildea, 2003; Eisner, 2003), but also for This work was supported by DARPA contract F49620-001-0337 and ARDA contract MDA904-02-C-0450. summarization (Knight and Marcu, 2002), paraphrasing (Pang, Knight, and Marcu, 2003), natural language generation (Langkilde and Knight, 1998; Bangalore and Rambow, 2000; Corston-Oliver et al., 2002), and language modeling (Baker, 1979; Lari and Young, 1990; Collins, 1997; Chelba and Jelinek, 2000; Charni
