an entity tracking part, for a which a novel modeling approach is proposed.
    This statistical framework is general and can incorporate heterogeneous feature types &#8212; the models were built using a wide array of lexical, syntactic and semantic features extracted from texts, and further enhanced by adding the output of pre-existing semantic classifiers as feature streams; additional feature types help improve the performance significantly, especially in terms of ACE value.
    The experimental results show that the systems perform remarkably well, for both well investigated languages, such as English, and for the relatively new additions Arabic and Chinese.
