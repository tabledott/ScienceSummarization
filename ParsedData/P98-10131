    The Berkeley FrameNet project' is producing frame-semantic descriptions of several thousand English lexical items and backing up these descriptions with semantically annotated attestations from contemporary English corpora2.
    These descriptions are based on hand-tagged semantic annotations of example sentences extracted from large text corpora and systematic analysis of the semantic patterns they exemplify by lexicographers and linguists.
    The primary emphasis of the project therefore is the encoding, by humans, of semantic knowledge in machine-readable form.
    The intuition of the lexicographers is guided by and constrained by the results of corpus-based research using highperformance software tools.
    The semantic domains to be covered are: HEALTH CARE, CHANCE, PERCEPTION, COMMUNICATION, TRANSACTION, TIME, SPACE, BODY (parts and functions of the body), MOTION, LIFE
