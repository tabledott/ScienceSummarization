 al. (2003) performed a similar chi-squared analysis, but used the true segment boundaries in the labeled data; this can be thought of as a sort of ground truth.
    Four of the ten cue phrases identified by our system overlap with their analysis; these are indicated with asterisks.
    In contrast to our model&#8217;s success at extracting cue phrases from the meeting dataset, only very common words are selected for the textbook dataset.
    This may help to explain why cue phrases improve performance for meeting transcripts, but not for the textbook.
  
  
    This paper presents a novel Bayesian approach to unsupervised topic segmentation.
    Our algorithm is capable of incorporating both lexical cohesion and cue phrase features in a principled manner, and outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on text and transcribed speech corpora.
    We have developed exact and sampling-based inference techniques, both of which search only over the space of segmentations and marginalize out the associated language mod
