set they comprise violates Naive Bayes&#8217; conditional-independence assumptions; on the other hand, recall that this does not imply that Naive Bayes will necessarily do poorly (Domingos and Pazzani, 1997).
    Line (3) of the results table shows that bigram information does not improve performance beyond that of unigram presence, although adding in the bigrams does not seriously impact the results, even for Naive Bayes.
    This would not rule out the possibility that bigram presence is as equally useful a feature as unigram presence; in fact, Pedersen (2001) found that bigrams alone can be effective features for word sense disambiguation.
    However, comparing line (4) to line (2) shows that relying just on bigrams causes accuracy to decline by as much as 5.8 percentage points.
    Hence, if context is in fact important, as our intuitions suggest, bigrams are not effective at capturing it in our setting.
    11Alternatively, we could have tried integrating frequency information into MaxEnt.
    However,
