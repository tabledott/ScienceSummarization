    Cer et al. (2008) Results are reported using BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002), METEOR5 (Banerjee and Lavie, 2005; Denkowski and Lavie, 2010), and TER (Snover et al., 2006).
    In this section, we describe and measure (on the example systems just described) three extraneous variables that should be considered when evaluating a translation system.
    We quantify these variables in terms of standard deviation s, since it is expressed in the same units as the original metric.
    Refer to Table 1 for the statistics.
