h, m, cmi) ? wlmi + ?2(x, h, m, cmo) ? wlmoNote that the model uses a common feature func tion for second-order relations, but features could be defined specifically for each type of relation.
			Note also that while the higher-order factors includefour dependencies, our modelling choice only ex ploits relations between the main dependency andsecondary dependencies.
			Considering relations between secondary dependencies would greatly in crease the cost of the associated algorithms.
			2.1 Parsing Algorithm.
			In this section we sketch an extension of the projective dynamic programming algorithm of Eisner (1996; 2000) for the higher-order model defined above.
			The time complexity of the algo rithm is O(n4L), and the memory requirements areO(n2L + n3).
			As in the Eisner approach, our algo rithm visits sentence spans in a bottom up fashion, and constructs a chart with two types of dynamic programming structures, namely open and closedstructures?see Figure 2 for a diagram.
