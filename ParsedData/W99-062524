  Primitive features are named acto the type of the feature (e.g., the feature that counts the number of matching verbs according to exact matches).
    Composite feature names indicate the restrictions applied to primitives.
    For example, the composite fea- &lt; a pair of matching primitives to occur within a relative distance of four words.
    If the composite feature also restricts the types of the primitives in the pair, the name of the restricting primitive feature is added to the composite feature name.
    For exthe feature named Distance &lt; 5 requires one member of the pair to be a verb and the relative distance between the primitives to be at most five.
