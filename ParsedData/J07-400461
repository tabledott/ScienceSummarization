    The features used in the parsing model determine the definition of the equivalence relation used for grouping individual entries.
    In our models, features are defined in terms of individual dependencies and local rule instantiations, where a rule instantiation is the local tree arising from the application of a rule in the grammar.
    Note that features can be defined in terms of long-range dependencies, even though such dependencies may involve words which are a long way apart in the sentence.
    Our earlier definition of equivalence is consistent with these feature types.
    As an example, consider the following composition of will with buy using the forward composition rule: The equivalence class of the resulting individual entry is determined by the CCG category plus heads, in this case (S[dcl]will\NP)/NP, plus the dependencies yet to be filled.
    The dependencies are not shown, but there are two subject dependencies on the first NP, one encoding the subject of will and one encoding the su
