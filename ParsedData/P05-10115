art for parsing &#8220;he saw a girl with a telescope&#8221;, where the modifiee (&#8220;saw&#8221; or &#8220;girl&#8221;) of &#8220;with&#8221; is ambiguous.
    Each feature structure expresses an equivalence class, and the arrows represent immediate-dominance relations.
    The phrase, &#8220;saw a girl with a telescope&#8221;, has two trees (A in the figure).
    Since the signs of the top-most nodes are equivalent, they are packed into an equivalence class.
    The ambiguity is represented as two pairs of arrows that come out of the node.
    Formally, a set of HPSG parse trees is represented in a chart as a tuple (E, Er, a), where E is a set of equivalence classes, Er C E is a set of root nodes, and a : E &#8212;&#65533; 2ExE is a function to represent immediate-dominance relations.
    Our representation of the chart can be interpreted as an instance of a feature forest (Miyao and Tsujii, 2002; Geman and Johnson, 2002).
    A feature forest is an &#8220;and/or&#8221; graph to represent exponentiallyman
