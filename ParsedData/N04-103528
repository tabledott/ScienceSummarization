heless be systematically used to produce correct translations.
    In this paper, we focused on providing a well-founded mathematical theory and efficient, linear algorithms for learning syntactically motivated transformation rules from parallel corpora.
    One can easily imagine a range of techniques for defining probability distributions over the rules that we learn.
    We suspect that such probabilistic rules could be also used in conjunction with statistical decoders, to increase the accuracy of statistical machine translation systems.
