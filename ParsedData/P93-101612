    This treatment of movement requires that the parent node of a initial trace be able to determine the type of movement.
    When a movement is generated, the type of the movement depends on the ca (case assigner) attribute of the item: ca movement examples + wh active V, P, finite IP - np A, passive V, non-finite IP For example, when IP node receives an item from Ibar, IP attempts to combine it with another item from subject NP.
    If the subject is not found, then the IF node generates a movement.
    If the item represent a finite clause, then it has attributes +ca (cform fin) and the movement is of type wh.
    Otherwise, the movement is of type np.
  
  
    We now describe how the principles of GB theory are implemented.
    The first condition requires that every non-lexical category have a head.
    This is guaranteed by a constraint in item combination: one of the sources of the two items being combined must be from the head daughter.
    The second condition is implemented
