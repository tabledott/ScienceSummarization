al translation to syntactic constituents yields poor translation performance &#8211; the ability to translate nonconstituent phrases (such as &#8220;there are&#8221;, &#8220;note that&#8221;, and &#8220;according to&#8221;) turns out to be critical and pervasive.
    Another direction is to abandon conventional English syntax and move to more robust grammars that adapt to the parallel training corpus.
    One approach here is that of Wu (1997), in which word-movement is modeled by rotations at unlabeled, binary-branching nodes.
    At each sentence pair, the parse adapts to explain the translation pattern.
    If the same unambiguous English sentence were to appear twice in the corpus, with different Chinese translations, then it could have different learned parses.
    A third direction is to maintain English syntax and investigate alternate transformation models.
    After all, many conventional translation systems are indeed based on syntactic transformations far more expressive than what has been proposed
