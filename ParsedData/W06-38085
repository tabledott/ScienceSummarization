lkopf, 2004) used by (Pang and Lee, 2005).
    This acts as an extra knowledge source for our semisupervised learning framework to improve upon.
    We note our framework is general and works without the separate learner, too.
    (For this to work in practice, a reliable similarity measure is required.)
    We now describe our graph for the semisupervised rating-inference problem.
    We do this piece by piece with reference to Figure 1.
    Our undirected graph G = (V, E) has 2n nodes V , and weighted edges E among some of the nodes.
    Summing over all edges in the graph, we obtain the (un)smoothness L(f) over the whole graph.
    We call L(f) the energy or loss, which should be minimized.
    Let L = 1... l and U = l + 1... n be labeled and unlabeled review indices, respectively.
    With the graph in Figure 1, the loss L(f) can be written as are set by cross validation in experiments.
    The last two kinds of edges are the key to semisupervised learning: They connect unobserved nodes and force ratings
