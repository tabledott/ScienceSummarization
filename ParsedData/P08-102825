 all the individual participants&#8217; similarity judgments with those of the models.6 We used Spearman&#8217;s p for our correlation analyses.
    Again, better models should correlate better with the experimental data.
    We assume that the inter-subject agreement can serve as an upper bound for comparing the fit of our models against the human judgments.
  
  
    Our experiments assessed the performance of seven composition models.
    These included three additive models, i.e., simple addition (equation (5), Add), weighted addition (equation (7), WeightAdd), and Kintsch&#8217;s (2001) model (equation (10), Kintsch), a multiplicative model (equation (6), Multiply), and also a model which combines multiplication with addition (equation (11), Combined).
    As a baseline we simply estimated the similarity between the reference verb and its landmarks without taking the subject noun into account (equation (8), NonComp).
    Table 2 shows the average model ratings for High and Low similarity items.
