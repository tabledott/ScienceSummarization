They can be further divided into two categories of relationship: systematic semantic, and nonsystematic semantic.
    Systematic semantic relationships can be classified in a fairly straightforward way.
    This type of relation includes antonyms, members of an ordered set such as {one, two, three}, members of an unordered set such as {white, black, red}, and part-to-whole relationships like {eyes, mouth, face}.
    Example 5 is an illustration of collocation where the word relationship, {garden, digging}, is nonsystematic.
    This type of relationship is the most problematic, especially from a knowledge representation point of view.
    Such collocation relationships exist between words that tend to occur in similar lexical environments.
    Words tend to occur in similar lexical environments because they describe things that tend to occur in similar situations or contexts in the world.
    Hence, context-specific examples such as {post office, service, stamps, pay, leave} are included in the class.
