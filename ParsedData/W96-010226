ng syntactic and semantic information about a five-word window centered on the word to be tagged, including the words themselves, and 11 global context features providing information about the major constituents parsed already), and with a tag set of 18 tags (7 open-class, 11 closed class), she reports a 95% tagging accuracy.
    A decision-tree learning approach to feature selection is used in this experiment (Cardie, 1993b, 1994) to discard irrelevant features.
    Results are based on experiments with 120 randomly chosen sentences from the TIPSTER JV corpus (representing 2056 cases).
    Cardie (p.c.) reports 89.1% correct tagging for unknown words.
    Percentage unknown words was 20.6% of the test words, and overall tagging accuracy (known and unknown) 95%.
    Notice that her algorithm gives no initial preference to training cases that match the test word during its initial case retrieval.
    On the other hand, after retrieving the top k cases, the algorithm does prefer those cases that match the test
