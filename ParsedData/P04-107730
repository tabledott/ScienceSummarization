Stem set in adequacy and Case set in fluency.
    The Pearson's p correlation values in the Stem set of the Adequacy Table, indicates that ROUGEL and ROUGE-S with a skip distance longer than 0 correlate highly and linearly with adequacy and outperform BLEU and NIST.
    ROUGE-S* achieves that best correlation with a Pearson&#8217;s p of 0.95.
    Measures favoring consecutive matches, i.e.
    BLEU4 and 12, ROUGE-W, GTM20 and 30, ROUGE-S0 (bigram), and WER have lower Pearson&#8217;s p. Among them WER (0.48) that tends to penalize small word movement is the worst performer.
    One interesting observation is that longer BLEU has lower correlation with adequacy.
    Spearman&#8217;s p values generally agree with Pearson's p but have more equivalents.
    The Pearson's p correlation values in the Stem set of the Fluency Table, indicates that BLEU12 has the highest correlation (0.93) with fluency.
    However, it is statistically indistinguishable with 95% confidence from all other metrics shown in the Case set o
