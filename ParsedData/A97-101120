    In this paper, we have presented some main features of our new framework for dependency syntax.
    The most important result is that the new framework allows us to describe non-projective dependency grammars and apply them efficiently.
    This is a property that will be crucial when we will apply this framework to a language having free word-order.
    Basically, the parsing framework combines the Constraint Grammar framework (removing ambiguous readings) with a mechanism that adds dependencies between readings or tags.
    This means that while the parser disambiguates it also builds up a dependency forest that, in turn, is reduced by other disambiguation rules and a global pruning mechanism.
    This setup makes it possible to operate on several layers of information, and use and combine structural information more efficiently than in the original Constraint Grammar framework, without any further disadvantage in dealing with ambiguity.
    First preliminary evaluations are presented.
