 We presented a comprehensive set of experiments for both these tasks on manually annotated data that is a random sample of stream of tweets.
    We investigated two kinds of models: tree kernel and feature based models and demonstrate that both these models outperform the unigram baseline.
    For our feature-based approach, we do feature analysis which reveals that the most important features are those that combine the prior polarity of words and their parts-of-speech tags.
    We tentatively conclude that sentiment analysis for Twitter data is not that different from sentiment analysis for other genres.
    In future work, we will explore even richer linguistic analysis, for example, parsing, semantic analysis and topic modeling.
