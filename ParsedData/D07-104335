ot require its user to map each cluster to a class.Therefore, it only evaluates the quality of the clustering, not a post-hoc class-cluster mapping.
			3) It eval uates the clustering of every data point, avoiding the ?problem of matching?.
			4) By evaluating the criteria of both homogeneity and completeness, V-measure is more comprehensive than those that evaluate onlyone.
			5) Moreover, by evaluating these criteria separately and explicitly, V-measure can serve as an el egant diagnositic tool providing greater insight into clustering behavior.
