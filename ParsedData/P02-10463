ing a high-precision classifier.
  
  
    A bootstrapping problem consists of a space of instances X, a set of labels L, a function Y : X -+ G assigning labels to instances, and a space of rules mapping instances to labels.
    Rules may be partial functions; we write F(x) = + if F abstains (that is, makes no prediction) on input x.
    &#8220;Classifier&#8221; is synonymous with &#8220;rule&#8221;.
    It is often useful to think of rules and labels as sets of instances.
    A binary rule F can be thought of as the characteristic function of the set of instances {x : F(x) = +}.
    Multi-class rules also define useful sets when a particular target class t is understood.
    For any rule F, we write F` for the set of instances {x : F(x) = &#65533;}, or (ambiguously) for that set&#8217;s characteristic function.
    We write F` for the complement of F`, either as a set or characteristic function.
    Note that &#175;F` contains instances on which F abstains.
    We write F&#175;` for {x : F(x) =&#65533; t n F
