			The Chen and Rambow (C&amp;R) System Chen and Rambow report on two different systems,also using a decision tree classifier.
			The first ?C&amp;R Sys tem I?
			uses surface syntactic features much like the G&amp;P system.
			The second ?C&amp;R System II?
			uses additional syntactic and semantic representations that are extractedfrom a Tree Adjoining Grammar (TAG) ? another grammar formalism that better captures the syntactic proper ties of natural languages.
