    Our work builds on Choueka's, and has been developed contemporarily to Church's.
    Choueka, Klein, and Neuwitz (1983) proposed algorithms to automatically retrieve idiomatic and collocational expressions.
    A collocation, as defined by Choueka, is a sequence of adjacent words that frequently appear together.
    In theory the sequences can be of any length, but in actuality, they contain two to six words.
    In Choueka (1988), experiments performed on an 11 million&#8212;word corpus taken from the New York Times archives are reported.
    Thousands of commonly used expressions such as &amp;quot;fried chicken,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;casual sex,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;chop suey,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;home run,&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Magic Johnson&amp;quot; were retrieved.
    Choueka's methodology for handling large corpora can be considered as a first step toward computer-aided lexicography.
    The work, however, has some limitations.
    First, by definition, only uninterrupted sequences of words a
