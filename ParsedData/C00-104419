the model that uses all three predictors (in that case, we obtained an average precision of 93.86%, average recall ol 81.70%, and average over- all accuracy o1 87.70%).
  Figure I lists the gradability labels that were automatically assigned to one of the 100 random test sets ttsing the moditied prediction algorithm.
  We also assigned automatically labels to the entire set of 453 adjectives, using 4-fold cross-validation (repeatedly training on three-fourths of tim 453 adjectives and test- ing on the rest).
  This resulted in precision of 94.15%, recall of 82.13%, and accuracy of 88.08% for the entire adjective set.
  4 Subjectivity The main motivation for the present paper is to examine the effect that information about an adjectives semantic orientation and gradability has on its probability of oc- curring in a subjective sentence (and hence on its quality as a subjectivity predictor).
  We tirst review related work on subjectivity recognition and then present our results.
