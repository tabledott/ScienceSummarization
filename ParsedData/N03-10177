    During translation, future costs for uncovered foreign words can be quickly computed by consulting this table.
    If a hypothesis has broken sequences of untranslated foreign words, we look up the cost for each sequence and take the product of their costs.
    The beam size, e.g. the maximum number of hypotheses in each stack, is fixed to a certain number.
    The number of translation options is linear with the sentence length.
    Hence, the time complexity of the beam search is quadratic with sentence length, and linear with the beam size.
    Since the beam size limits the search space and therefore search quality, we have to find the proper trade-off between speed (low beam size) and performance (high beam size).
    For our experiments, a beam size of only 100 proved to be sufficient.
    With larger beams sizes, only few sentences are translated differently.
    With our decoder, translating 1755 sentence of length 5-15 words takes about 10 minutes on a 2 GHz Linux system.
    In other words, we a
