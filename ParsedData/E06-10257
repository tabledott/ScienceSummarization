 negative terms.
    For computing PMI, term frequencies and co-occurrence frequencies are measured by querying a document set by means of the AltaVista search engine1 with a &#8220;t&#8221; query, a &#8220;ti&#8221; query, and a &#8220;t NEAR ti&#8221; query, and using the number of matching documents returned by the search engine as estimates of the probabilities needed for the computation of PMI.
    Kamps et al. (2004) consider instead the graph defined on adjectives by the WordNet2 synonymy relation, and determine the orientation of a target adjective t contained in the graph by comparing the lengths of (i) the shortest path between t and the seed term good, and (ii) the shortest path between t and the seed term bad: if the former is shorter than the latter, than t is deemed to be Positive, otherwise it is deemed to be Negative.
    Takamura et al. (2005) determine term orientation (for Japanese) according to a &#8220;spin model&#8221;, i.e. a physical model of a set of electrons each endowed with one be
