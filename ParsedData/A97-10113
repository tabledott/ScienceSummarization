 and &amp;quot;stop words&amp;quot;) or to a constituent (by using &amp;quot;stop categories&amp;quot;) instead of the whole sentence.
    In addition, another test may be added relative to the unrestricted context position using keyword LINK.
    For example, the following rule discards the syntactic function' CI-OBJ (indirect object): The rule holds if the closest finite verb to the left is unambiguously (C) a finite verb (VFIN), and there is no ditransitive verb or participle (subcategorisation SV00) between the verb and the indirect object.
    If, in addition, the verb does not take indirect objects, i.e. there is no SVO0 in the same verb (LINK NOT 0 SV00), the CI-OBJ reading will be discarded.
    In essence, the same formalism is used in the syntactic analysis in Jarvinen (1994) and Anttila (1995).
    After the morphological disambiguation, all legitimate surface-syntactic labels are added to the set of morphological readings.
    Then, the syntactic rules discard contextually illegitimate alternative
