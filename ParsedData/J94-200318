Cb and Cf, the theory of centering specifies a set of rules and constraints.
  Constraints are meant o hold strictly whereas rules may sometimes be violated.
  CONSTRAINTS For each utterance Ui in a discourse segment UI~.. .
  There is precisely one backward-looking center Cb.
  Every element of the forward centers list, Cf(Ui), must be realized in Ui.
  The center, Cb(Ui), is the highest-ranked element of Cf(Ui-D that is realized in Ui.
  5 Constraint (1) says that there is one central discourse ntity that the utterance is about, and that is the Cb.
  The second constraint depends on the definition of realizes.
  An utterance U realizes a center c if c is an element of the situation described by U, or c is the semantic interpretation of some subpart of U (Grosz, Joshi, and Weinstein unpublished).
  Thus the relation REALIZE describes zeros, explicitly realized discourse entities, and those implicitly realized centers that are entities inferable from the dis- course situation (Prince 1978a, 1981b).
