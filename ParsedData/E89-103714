ngement sketched below, we introduce the v correspondence to map between the f-structure units of the source language and the f-structure units of the target language.
    The a correspondence maps from the f-structure of each language to its own corresponding semantic structure, and a second transfer correspondence 1' relates those structures.
    This arrangement allows us to describe the target f-structure by composing 4:( and t to form expressions such as t(4:af* ComP)= (-4&#8226;M* XcomP) or simply t( t COMP) == (i t XC OMP)) This maps a COMP in the source f-structure into an XCOMP in the target f-structure.
    The relations asserted by this equation are depicted in the following source-target diagram: As another example, the equation &amp;quot;e(c) t ARGO = (au t ARM) identifies the first arguments in the source and target semantic structures.
    The equation t'a( t RoBJ)= 43(E t TOPIC) imposes the constraint that the semantics of the source SUBJ will translate via t' into the semantics of the target
