r value decomposition (SVD) to the whole matrix, and so on.
    Under the assumption that W1 = W2 and the inverse link constraint (see Section 3.1), it follows that for each column of the matrix resulting from mode-1 matricization and labeled by (l, w2), there will be a column in the matrix resulting from mode-3 matricization that is labeled by (w1, k) (with k being the inverse link of l and w1 = w2) and that is identical to the former, except possibly for the order of the dimensions (which is irrelevant to all operations we perform on matrices and vectors, however).
    Similarly, for any row w2 in the matrix resulting from mode-3 matricization, there will be an identical row w1 in the mode-1 matricization.
    Therefore, given a weighted tuple structure TW extracted from a corpus and subject to the constraints we just mentioned, by matricizing the corresponding labeled third-order tensor X&#955; we obtain the following four distinct semantic vector spaces: word by link&#8211;word (W1xLW2): vectors are label
