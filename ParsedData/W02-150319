arallelism.
    The most obvious use of this is to ensure that the grammars encode the same features in the same way.
    For example, at a basic level, one feature declaration might have specified GEN for gender while the others had chosen the name GEND; this divergence in naming is regularized.
    More interesting cases arise when one language uses a feature and another does not for analyzing the same phenomena.
    When this is noticed via the feature-table comparison, it is determined why one grammar needs the feature and the other does not, and thus it may be possible to eliminate the feature in one grammar or to add it to another.
    On a deeper level, the feature comparison is useful for conducting a survey of what constructions each grammar has and how they are implemented.
    For example, if a language does not have an ADEGREE (adjective degree) feature, the question will arise as to whether the grammar analyzes comparative and superlative adjectives.
    If they do not, then they should be added
