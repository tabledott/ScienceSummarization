ge of these models is that they negate the need for the development of grammars when adapting the model to new languages.
    One interesting class of data-driven models are those that assume each dependency decision is independent modulo the global structural constraint that dependency graphs must be trees.
    Such models are commonly referred to as edge-factored since their parameters factor relative to individual edges of the graph (Paskin, 2001; McDonald et al., 2005a).
    Edge-factored models have many computational benefits, most notably that inference for nonprojective dependency graphs can be achieved in polynomial time (McDonald et al., 2005b).
    The primary problem in treating each dependency as independent is that it is not a realistic assumption.
    Non-local information, such as arity (or valency) and neighbouring dependencies, can be crucial to obtaining high parsing accuracies (Klein and Manning, 2002; McDonald and Pereira, 2006).
    However, in the data-driven parsing setting this can be
