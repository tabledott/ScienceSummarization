ovements by automatically generating conjunctive features.
			The final system, which com bines the basic features, the IE pattern features, and feature induction achieves an F-measure of 69.4(recall=60.6%, precision=81.2%) for the OL measure, an F-measure of 68.0 (recall=59.5%, preci sion=79.3%) for the HM measure, and an F-measure of 62.0 (recall=54.1%, precision=72.7%) for the EM measure.
			6.4 Error Analysis.
			An analysis of the errors indicated some common mistakes: ? Some errors resulted from error propagation in 360our subsystems.
			Errors from the sentence bound ary detector in GATE (Cunningham et al, 2002) were especially problematic because they causedthe Collins parser to fail, resulting in no depen dency tree information.
			Some errors were due to complex and unusualsentence structure, which our rather simple fea ture encoding for CRF could not capture well.
			Some errors were due to the limited coverage of the opinion lexicon.
			We failed to recognize some cases when idiomatic or vague exp
