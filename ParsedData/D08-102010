If there is a relation between the sentences but adding a connective would be inappropriate, it is marked AltLex.
    If the consecutive sentences are only related by entity-based coherence (Knott et al., 2001) they are annotated with EntRel.
    Otherwise, they are annotated with NoRel.
    Besides labeling the connective, the PDTB also annotates the sense of each relation.
    The relations are organized into a hierarchy.
    The top level relations are Expansion, Comparison, Contingency, and Temporal.
    Briefly, an expansion relation means that the second clause continues the theme of the first clause, a comparison relation indicates that something in the two clauses is being compared, contingency means that there is a causal relation between the clauses, and temporal means they occur either at the same time or sequentially.
