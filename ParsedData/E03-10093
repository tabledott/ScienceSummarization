 (Mikheev, 1997).
    Our approach will be to incorporate morphological information of a restricted form into a distributional clustering algorithm.
    In addition we will use a very limited sort of frequency information, since rare words tend to belong to open class categories.
    The input to the algorithm is a sequence of tokens, each of which is considered as a sequence of characters in a standard encoding.
    The rest of this paper is structured as follows: we will first discuss the evaluation of the models in some detail and present some simple experiments we have performed here (Section 2).
    We will then discuss the basic algorithm that is the starting point for our research in Section 3.
    Then we show how we can incorporate a limited form of morphological information into this algorithm in Section 4.
    Section 5 presents the results of our evaluations on a number of data sets drawn from typologically distinct languages.
    We then briefly discuss the use of ambiguous models or soft cluster
