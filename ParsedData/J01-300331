do not distinguish verb senses.
    In these counts, we did not distinguish a core sense of the verb from an extended use of the verb.
    So, for instance, the sentence Consumer spending jumped 1.7% in February after a sharp drop the month before (WSJ 1987) is counted as an occurrence of the manner-of-motion verb jump in its intransitive form.
    This particular sense extension has a transitive alternant, but not a causative transitive (i.e., Consumer spending jumped the barrier.
    .
    .
    , but not Low taxes jumped consumer spending.
    .
    .).
    Thus, while the possible subcategorizations remain the same, rates of transitivity and causativity may be different than for the literal mannerof-motion sense.
    This is an unavoidable result of using simple, automatic extraction methods given the current state of annotation of corpora.
    For each occurrence of each verb, we counted whether it was in a transitive or intransitive use (TRANS), in a passive or active use (PAss), in a past participle or
