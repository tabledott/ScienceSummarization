o types of information represent a common trade-off in statistical language processing: the first type is related to a limited amount of deeper, and more precise linguistic information, whereas the second type provides a large amount of shallow information, which can be applied in a more robust manner.
    The two sources of information seem to complement each other and may both be combined in future disambiguation methods.'
