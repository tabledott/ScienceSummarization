in the alignment and lexicon probability counts, we introduce the following auxiliary quantities that use the move and swap matrices that are available after performing the hill climbing described above: For the alignment counts c(j  |i; e, f) and the lexicon counts c(f  |e; e, f), we have To obtain the fertility probability counts and the count for p1 efficiently, we introduce the following auxiliary quantities: These quantities do not depend on swaps, since a swap does not change the fertilities of an alignment.
    For the fertility counts, we have: Using the auxiliary quantities, a count collection algorithm can be formulated that requires about O(max(I, J)2) operations.
    This is one order of magnitude faster than the straightforward algorithm described above.
    In practice, we observe that the resulting training is 10&#8211;20 times faster.
