    While in the typical generation scenario above, the generator can make choices based on semantic information, in our situation, the generator has only a low-level syntactic structure, represented as a DSYNT.
    It would seem at first glance that realizing such an input should be easier for the syntactic realization component.
    The generator in that case is left with little less to do than just linearizing the input specification.
    The task we had to solve, however, is more difficult for two reasons: 1.
    The input specification we define must allow the sentence planner to perform revisions; that is, to attach new c
