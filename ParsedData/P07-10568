he rest discarded because their polarity was ambiguous.
    After this conversion, we had 1000 positive and 1000 negative examples for each domain, the same balanced composition as the polarity dataset (Pang et al., 2002).
    In addition to the labeled data, we included between 3685 (DVDs) and 5945 (kitchen) instances of unlabeled data.
    The size of the unlabeled data was limited primarily by the number of reviews we could crawl and download from the Amazon website.
    Since we were able to obtain labels for all of the reviews, we also ensured that they were balanced between positive and negative examples, as well.
    While the polarity dataset is a popular choice in the literature, we were unable to use it for our task.
    Our method requires many unlabeled reviews and despite a large number of IMDB reviews available online, the extensive curation requirements made preparing a large amount of data difficult 3.
    For classification, we use linear predictors on unigram and bigram features, trained to
