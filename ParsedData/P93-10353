tion, since some tokens in a sentence are not even considered in parsing, the method could prove to be considerably more robust than a CFG-based approach when faced with noise or unfamiliar input.
    After describing the algorithm, we present results and compare these results to other recent results in automatic phrase structure induction.
    TRANSFORMATION-BASED
  
  
    The phrase structure learning algorithm is a transformation-based error-driven learner.
    This learning paradigm, illustrated in figure 1, has proven to be successful in a number of different natural language applications, including part of speech tagging (Bri92, BM92b), prepositional
  
  
    The phrase structure learning algorithm is trained on a small corpus of partially bracketed text which is also annotated with part of speech information.
    All of the experiments presented below were done using the Penn Treebank annotated corpus(MSM93).
    The learner begins in a naive initial state, knowing very little about the phrase struct
