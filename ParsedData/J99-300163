E over SMOOTH-SHIFT.
    In (10d'), she is resolved to DRIVER because SMOOTH-SHIFT is preferred over ROUGH-SHIFT (see Table 24).
    10c'.
    A professional driver races her on weekends.
    Within the functional approach, the evoked phrase her in (10c') is ranked higher than the brand-new phrase a professional driver.
    Therefore, the preference changes between example (10c) and (10c').
    In (10d) and (10d') the pronoun she is resolved to BRENNAN, the discourse entity denoted by her (see Table 25).
    We find the analyses of functional centering to match our intuitions about the underlying referential relations more closely than those that are computed by grammatically based centering approaches.
    Hence, in the light of this still preliminary evidence, we answer the question we posed at the beginning of this subsection in the affirmative&#8212;functional centering indeed explains the data in a more satisfying manner than other well-known centering principles.
    To summarize the results of our empi
