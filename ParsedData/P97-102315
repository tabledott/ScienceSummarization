ch possible partition P of the adjectives into two subgroups Ci and C2 as where ICI stands for the cardinality of cluster i, and d(x, y) is the dissimilarity between adjectives x and y.
    We want to select the partition Pmin that minimizes (I), subject to the additional constraint that for each adjective x in a cluster C, where C is the complement of cluster C, i.e., the other member of the partition.
    This constraint, based on Rousseeuw's (1987) silhouettes, helps correct wrong cluster assignments.
    To find Pi we first construct a random partition of the adjectives, then locate the adjective that will most reduce the objective function if it is moved from its current cluster.
    We move this adjective and proceed with the next iteration until no movements can improve the objective function.
    At the final iteration, the cluster assignment of any adjective that violates constraint (1) is changed.
    This is a steepestdescent hill-climbing method, and thus is guaranteed to converge.
    However, it
