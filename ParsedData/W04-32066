lates are then exploited to get new anchor sets, which are subsequently processed as the initial {Mozart, 1756}.
    Eventually, the overall procedure results in an iterative process able to induce templates from anchor sets and vice versa.
    The limitation of this approach is the requirement for one input anchor set per target meaning.
    Preparing such input for all possible meanings in broad domains would be a huge task.
    As will be explained below, our method avoids this limitation by finding all anchor sets automatically in an unsupervised manner.
    Finally, (Lin and Pantel, 2001) present a notably different approach that relies on matching separately single anchors.
    They limit the allowed structure of templates only to paths in dependency parses connecting two anchors.
    The algorithm constructs for each possible template two feature vectors, representing its co-occurrence statistics with the two anchors.
    Two templates with similar vectors are suggested as paraphrases (termed inference
