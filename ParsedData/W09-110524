proach has been motivated by the significantly higher results that the metalearner produces compared to the results of the first three classifiers.
    The results of each of the classifiers independently are presented in Table 8.
    PCS results show that the metalearner system performs significantly better than the three classifiers for the abstracts and papers subcorpora, but not for the clinical subcorpus, in which case TiMBL and SVM produce higher scores, although only the SVM results are significantly better with a difference of 11.7 PCS.
    An analysis in detail of the SVM scores per negation signal shows that the main difference between the scores of the metalearner and SVM is that the SVM is good at predicting the scopes of the negation signal no when it occurs as the first token in the sentence, like in (4) above.
    When no occurs in other positions, SVM scores 1.17 PCS better.
    We plan to perform experiments with the three classifiers using the features of the metalearner that are not related
