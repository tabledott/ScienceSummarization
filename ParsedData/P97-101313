 considered to have a discourse usage is sometimes based on the context in which that phrase occurs, i.e., it depends on the occurrence of other cue phrases.
    For example, an &amp;quot;and&amp;quot; will not be assigned a discourse usage in most of the cases; however, when it occurs in conjunction with &amp;quot;although&amp;quot;, i.e., &amp;quot;and although&amp;quot;, it will be assigned such a role.
    The most important criterion for using a cue phrase in the marker identification procedure is that the cue phrase (together with its orthographic neighborhood) is used as a discourse marker in at least 90% of the examples that were extracted from the corpus.
    The enforcement of this criterion reduces on one hand the recall of the discourse markers that can be detected, but on the other hand, increases significantly the precision.
    We chose this deliberately because, during the corpus analysis, we noticed that most of the markers that connect large textual units can be identified by a shallow analy
