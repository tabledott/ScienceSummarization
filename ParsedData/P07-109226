    Furthermore, when combined with a standard phrase-table, our models also yield performance improvements on larger datasets.
    Our experiments revealed that triangulation benefits from a large set of intermediate languages and that performance is increased when languages of the same family to the source or target are used as intermediates.
    We have just scratched the surface of the possibilities for the framework discussed here.
    Important future directions lie in combining triangulation with richer means of conventional smoothing and using triangulation to translate between low-density language pairs.
