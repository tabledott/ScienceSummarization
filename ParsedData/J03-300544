te-argument bigrams.
    AltaVista counts for seen bigrams are a better predictor of human judgments than BNC and NANTC counts.
    These results show that our heuristic method yields valid frequencies; the simplifications we made in obtaining the Web counts (see Section 2.3), as well as the fact that Web data are noisy (see Section 2.4), seem to be outweighed by the fact that the Web is up to a thousand times larger than the BNC.
    The evaluation in the last two sections established that Web counts are useful for approximating corpus counts and for predicting plausibility judgments.
    As a further step in our evaluation, we correlated Web counts with counts re-created by applying a class-based smoothing method to the BNC.
    We re-created co-occurrence frequencies for predicate-argument bigrams using a simplified version of Resnik&#8217;s (1993) selectional association measure proposed by Lapata, Keller, and McDonald (2001).
    In a nutshell, this measure replaces Resnik&#8217;s (1993) information-theo
