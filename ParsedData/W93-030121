    English word'.
    A similar dynamic programming approach was used by Gale and Church for word alignment (Gale and Church, 1991a), to handle dependency between connections.
  
  
    Word_olign was first evaluated on a representative sample of Canadian Hansards (160,000 words in English and French).
    The sample was kindly provided by Simard et al., along with alignments of sentence boundaries as determined by their panel of 8 judges (Simard et al., 1992).
    Ten iterations of the EM algorithm were computed to estimate the parameters of the model.
    The window size was set to 20 words in each direction, and the minimal threshold for t(fle) was set to 0.005.
    We considered connections whose source and target words had frequencies between 3 and 1700 (1700 is the highest frequency of a content word in the corpus.
    We thus excluded as many 'As mentioned earlier, we do not estimate directly transla
