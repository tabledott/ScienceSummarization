;exp;H#?L;RP Table 1: The unlexicalized models The models described here are all extensions of a very simple model which models derivations by a top-down tree-generating process.
			This model was originally described in Hockenmaier (2001), where it was applied to a preliminary version of CCGbank, and its definition is repeated here in the top row of Table 1.
			Given a (parent) node with category P, choose the expansion exp of P, where exp can beleaf (for lexical categories), unary (for unary ex pansions such as type-raising), left (for binary trees where the head daughter is left) or right (binary trees, head right).
			If P is a leaf node, generate its head word w. Otherwise, generate the category ofits head daughter H . If P is binary branching, gen erate the category of its non-head daughter S (a complement or modifier of H).The model itself includes no prior knowledge spe cific to CCG other than that it only allows unary andbinary branching trees, and that the sets of nontermi nals and terminals are not
