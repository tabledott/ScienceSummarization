(Press et al., 1992).
  
  
    A series of experiments were conducted to establish the relationship between linguistic processes and segmentation accuracy.
    C99 (Choi, 2000a) was used as the test bench.
    In the first set of experiments, its stemming algorithm, ranking procedure and automatic termination method were systematically disabled to determine the contribution of each process to overall performance.
    We discovered that, first, stemming generally improves accuracy unless the topic segments are short (3 to 5 sentences).
    Second, ranking plays a vital role in C99.
    It reduces error rate by half (22% to 10%).
    Finally, the termination procedure in C99 is effective (0.6% difference).
    The method works particularly well on long topic segments (&gt; 6 sentences).
    The second set of experiments focused on LSA as a similarity metric.
    The cosine metric in C99 was replaced by LSA.
    Ten different LSA spaces were examined.
    We discovered that LSA is twice as accurate as the cosin
