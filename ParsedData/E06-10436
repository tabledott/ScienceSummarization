lated to idiomaticity.
    For example, the meaning of shoot the breeze, a highly idiomatic expression, has nothing to do with either shoot or breeze.
    In contrast, a less idiomatic expression, such as spill the beans, can be analyzed as spill corresponding to &#8220;reveal&#8221; and beans referring to &#8220;secret(s)&#8221;.
    Generally, the constituents of a semantically analyzable idiom can be mapped onto their corresponding referents in the idiomatic interpretation.
    Hence analyzable (less idiomatic) expressions are often more open to lexical substitution and syntactic variation.
    We use the observed connection between idiomaticity and (in)flexibility to devise statistical measures for automatically distinguishing idiomatic from literal verb+noun combinations.
    While VNICs vary in their degree of flexibility (cf.
    1 and 2 above; see also Moon 1998), on the whole they contrast with compositional phrases, which are more lexically productive and appear in a wider range of syntactic forms.
