 labeled.
    A passive edge with label N links node r to node .9 if the string between r and s has been analyzed as a phrase of type N. Initially, the only edges are passive edges that link consecutive nodes and are labeled with I he words of the input string (see Figure 1).
    Active edges represent partially applied grammar rules.
    In the simplest. case, active edges are labeled by dotted rules.
    A dotted rule is a grammar rule with a dot inserted somewhere on its right-hand side (4) An edge with this label links node r to node s if the sentential form a/ ... is an analysis of the input string between r and s. An active edge that links a node to itself is called empty and acts like a top-down prediction.
    Chart-parsing procedures start with a chart containing the passive edges for the input string.
    New edges are added in two distinct ways.
    First, an active edge from r to .9 labeled with a dotted rule (41) combines with a passive edge from s to t with label cgi to produce a new edge from r
