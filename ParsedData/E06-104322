t determine their canonical form(s)&#8212;Cforms henceforth.
    For example, the lexical representation of shoot, breeze should include shoot the breeze as a Cform.
    Since VNICs are syntactically fixed, they are mostly expected to have a single Cform.
    Nonetheless, there are idioms with two or more acceptable forms.
    For example, hold fire and hold one&#8217;s fire are both listed in CCID as variations of the same idiom.
    Our approach should thus be capable of predicting all allowable forms for a given idiomatic verb&#8211;noun pair.
    We expect a VNIC to occur in its Cform(s) more frequently than it occurs in any other syntactic patterns.
    To discover the Cform(s) for a given idiomatic verb&#8211;noun pair, we thus examine its frequency of occurrence in each syntactic pattern in .
    Since it is possible for an idiom to have more than one Cform, we cannot simply take the most dominant pattern as the canonical one.
    Instead, we calculate a -score for the target pair and each pattern : in
