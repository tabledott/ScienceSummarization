xts without much helpful context.
    However, our experiments only show the usefulness of gazetteers on a particular type of text, viz. journalistic English with mixed case.
    The rules as well as the maximum entropy models make use of internal and external evidence in that type of text when trying to identify named entities, and it is obvious that this system cannot be applied without modification to a different type of text, e.g. scientific articles.
    Without further formal evaluations with externally supplied evaluation corpora it is difficult to judge how general this text type is.
    It is encouraging to note that Krupka and Hausman (1998) point out that the muc-7 articles which we used in our experiments have less external evidence than do Wall Street Journal articles, which suggests that on Wall Street Journal articles our system might perform even better than on muc-7 articles.
