    To do this we need to try to assign each preposition that occurs either to the noun or to the verb that it occurs with.
    In some cases it is fairly certain that the preposition attaches to the noun or the verb; in other cases, it is far less certain.
    Our approach is to assign the clear cases first, then to use these to decide the unclear cases that can be decided, and finally to arbitrarily assign the remaining cases.
    The procedure for assigning prepositions in our sample to noun or verb is as follows: This procedure gives us a table of bigrams representing our guess about what prepositions associate with what nouns or verbs, made on the basis of the distribution of verbs nouns and prepositions in our corpus.
    The procedure for guessing attachment Given the table of bigrams, derived as described above, we can define a simple procedure for determining the attachment for an instan
