  (s (NP-SBJ-I The ball) (VP was (VP thrown (NP *-i) (PP by (NP-LGS Chris))))) Predicate Argument Structure: throw(Chris, ball) The interpretation rules for passives and WH-phrases inter- act correctly to yield the predicate argument structures for complex nestings of WH-questions and passives.

  Predicate Argument Structure: believe (*someone*, shoot (*someone*, Who)) A null element is also used to indicate which lexical NP  is to be interpreted as the null null subject of an infinitive comple- ment clause; it is co-indexed with the controlling NP, based upon the lexical properties of the verb.
