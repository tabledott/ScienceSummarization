Wang et.al., 2007; Habash, 2007), or to provide multiple orderings as weighted options (Zhang et.al., 2007; Li et.al., 2007; Elming, 2008).
    In these approaches, input source sentences are reordered based on syntactic analysis and some reordering rules at preprocessing step.
    The reordering rules can be either manually written or automatically extracted from data.
    Deterministic reordering based on syntactic analysis for the input sentences provides a good way of resolving long distance reordering, without introducing complexity to the decoding process.
    Therefore, it can be efficiently incorporated into phrase-based systems.
    Furthermore, when the same preprocessing reordering is performed for the training data, we can still apply other reordering approaches, such as distance based reordering and hierarchical phrase reordering, to capture additional local reordering phenomena that are not captured by the preprocessing reordering.
    The work presented in this paper is largely motivated by the
