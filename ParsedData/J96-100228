    We therefore introduce a modification to the algorithm, making it greedy but much more feasible.
    We replace the computation of the gain AL(S,f ) of a feature f with an approximation, which we will denote by -,AL(S,f).
    Recall that a model ps has a set of parameters A, one for each feature in S. The model p contains this set of parameters, plus a single new parameter a, , corresponding to I-.4 Given this structure, we might hope that the optimal values for A do not change as the feature f is adjoined to S. Were this the case, imposing an additional constraint would require only optimizing the single parameter a to maximize the likelihood.
    Unfortunately, when a new constraint is imposed, the optimal values of all parameters change.
    However, to make the feature-ranking computation tractable, we make the approximation that the addition of a feature f affects only a, leaving the A-values associated with other features unchanged.
    That is, when determining the gain off over the model Ps' we p
