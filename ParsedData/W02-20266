non-string-based similarity measure in isolation.
    This behavior (shown quantatively in Figure 8) illustrates the contribution of consensus modeling over this set of diverse similarity measures.

    Multipath translation induction via bridge languages.
    In
  
  
    process of intra-family translation was handled by weighted string distance models of cognate similarity with a probabilistic representation of common intrafamily orthographic transformations.
    These models were iteratively reestimated using an ExpectationMaximization algorithm (Ristad and Yanilos 1997).
    When intra-family orthographic shifts are clear and systematic, such models can be quite effective on their own.
    In practice, the technique described suffers from the problem of faux amis &#8212; false cognates.
    For example, Serbian-Czech faux amis such as prazan-prizen and prazan-pazen can outrank the correct but orthographically less similar prazanprazdny, causing the English bridge pathwa
