  Chart Generation
  
    Charts constitute a natural uniform architecture for parsing and generation provided string position is replaced by a notion more appropriate to logical forms and that measures are taken to curtail generation paths containing semantically incomplete phrases.
    1 Charts Shieber (1988) showed that parsing charts can be also used in generation and raised the question, which we take up again here, of whether they constitute a natural uniform architecture for parsing and generation.
    In particular, we will be interested in the extent to which they bring to the generation process advantages comparable to those that make them attractive in parsing.
    Chart parsing is not a well defined notion.
    The usual conception of it involves at least four related ideas: edges. context-free grammar, all phrases of a given category that cover a given part of the string are equivalent for the purposes of constructing larger phrases.
    Efficiency comes from collecting equivalent of phrases int
