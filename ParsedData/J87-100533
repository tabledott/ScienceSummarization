), we take a donkey to be generic, take it to refer to the unique generic donkey that m owns, and assume that to beat a generic donkey is to beat all its instances.
    In any case, modifications to the algorithm would be needed to handle such anaphora phenomena in all their complexity.
  
  
    We have presented an algorithm for generating exactly those quantifier scopings that are consistent with the logical structure of English.
    While this algorithm can sometimes result in a significant savings over the naive approach, it by no means solves the entire quantifier scoping problem, as we have already pointed out.
    There has already been much research on the problem of choosing the preferred reading among these allowable ones, but the methods that have been suggested need to be specified in an implementation-free fashion more precisely than they have been previously, and they need to be evaluated rigorously on large bodies of naturalistic data.
    More important, methods need to be developed for using
