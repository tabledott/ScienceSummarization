			Sentiment analysis tasks typically combine twodifferent tasks: (1) Identifying sentiment expres sions, and (2) determining the polarity (sometimes called valence) of the expressed sentiment.
			These tasks are closely related as the purpose of most works is to determine whether a sentence bears a positive or a negative (implicit or explicit) opinion about the target of the sentiment.
