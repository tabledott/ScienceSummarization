			The accuracy of a baseline tagger which chooses the most probable tag 9ignoring the context is 67.3% without and 69.4% with the supple mentary lexicon.
			The TnT tagger achieves 86.3% accuracy on the default tagset.
			A tag is considered correct if allattributes are correct.
			The tagset refinement increases the accuracy by about 0.6%, and the ex ternal lexicon by another 3.5%.
			The SVMTool is slightly better than the TnTtagger on the default tagset, but shows little im provement from the tagset refinement.
			Apparently, the lexical features used by the SVMTool encode most of the information of the tagset refinement.With a context of two preceding POS tags (similar to the trigram tagger TnT), our tagger outper forms TnT by 0.7% on the default tagset, by 1% on the refined tagset, and by 1.1% on the refined tagset plus the additional lexicon.
			A larger context of up to 10 preceding POS tags further increased the accuracy by 0.6, 0.6, and 0.7%, respectively.
