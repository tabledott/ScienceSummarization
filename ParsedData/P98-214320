ion heading (37.8%), immediate reference (31.1%) and collocation (11.1%).
    As expected, the most frequent indicators were not the most discriminative ones.
    We felt appropriate to extend the evaluation of our approach by comparing it to Breck Baldwin's CogMAC (Baldwin 1997) approach which features &amp;quot;high precision coreference with limited knowledge and linguistics resources&amp;quot;.
    The reason is that both our approach and Breck Baldwin's approach share common principles (both are knowledge-poor and use a POS tagger to provide the input) and therefore a comparison would be appropriate.
    Given that our approach is robust and returns antecedent for each pronoun, in order to make the comparison as fair as possible, we used CogNIAC's &amp;quot;resolve all&amp;quot; version by simulating it manually on the same training data used in evaluation B above.
    CogNIAC successfully resolved the pronouns in 75% of the cases.
    This result is comparable with the results described in (Baldwin 1997
