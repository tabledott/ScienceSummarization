    Longest common subsequence takes into account sentence level structure similarity naturally and identifies longest co-occurring in-sequence ngrams automatically while this is a free parameter in BLEU.
    To give proper credit to shorter common sequences that are ignored by LCS but still retain the flexibility of non-consecutive matches, we proposed counting skip bigram co-occurrence.
    The skip-bigram-based ROUGE-S* (without skip distance restriction) had the best Pearson's p correlation of 0.95 in adequacy when all words were lower case and stemmed.
    ROUGE-L, ROUGE-W, ROUGE-S*, ROUGE-S4, and ROUGE-S9 were equal performers to BLEU in measuring fluency.
    However, they have the advantage that we can apply them on sentence level while longer BLEU such as BLEU12 would not differentiate any sentences with length shorter than 12 words (i.e. no 12-gram matches).
    We plan to explore their correlation with human judgments on sentence-level in the future.
