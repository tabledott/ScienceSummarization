minal also included.
    An adj flag is also included, which is one if the modifier is adjacent to the head, zero otherwise.
    As an example, say the nonterminal dominating the example rule is S. The example rule would contribute (Left, S, VP, VBD, PP, adj = 1), (Right, S, VP, VBD, NP, adj = 1), (Right, S, VP, VBD, NP, adj = 0), and (Right, S, VP, VBD, SBAR, adj = 0).
    PPs.
    Lexical trigrams involving the heads of arguments of prepositional phrases.
    The example shown at right would contribute the trigram (NP, NP, PP, NP, president, of, U.S.), in addition to the relation (NP, NP, PP, NP, of, U.S.), which ignores the headword of the constituent being modified by the PP.
    The three nonterminals (for example, NP, NP, PP) identify the parent of the entire phrase, the nonterminal of the head of the phrase, and the nonterminal label for the PP.
    Distance head modifiers.
    Features involving the distance between headwords.
    For example, assume dist is the number of words between the headwords o
