that in each dialogue, the client initiates all the topics before the central shift, whereas the expert initiates the later ones.
    We also discovered a close relationship between topic initiation and topic dominance.
    In 19 of the 21 topics, the person who initiated the topic also had control of more turns.
    As we might expect, the point at which the expert begins to have control over more turns per topic is also the point at which the expert begins to initiate new topics.
  
  
    The main result of this exploratory study is the finding that control is a useful parameter for identifying discourse structure.
    Using this parameter we identified three levels of structure in the dialogues: (a) control phases; (b) topic; and (c) global organisation.
    For the control phases, we found that three types of utterances (prompts, repetitions and summaries) were consistently used to signal control shifts.
    For the low level structures we identified, (i.e. control phases), cue words and phrases were not
