 marginal counts by dots.
    For example, cu&#183;k is the number of xul&#8217;s assigned the value of yuk, cuw&#183; is the number of xul&#8217;s with value w, and tu&#183;&#183; is the current number of draws yuk from G&#960;(u).
    Notice that we have the following relationships among the cuw&#183;&#8217;s and tuw&#183;: Pseudo-code for drawing words using the hierarchical Chinese restaurant process is given as a recursive function DrawWord(u), while pseudocode for computing the probability that the next word drawn from Gu will be w is given in WordProb(u,w).
    The counts are initialized at all cuwk = tuwk = 0.
  
  
    Returns a new word drawn from Gu.
    If u = 0, return w E W with probability G0(w).
    Else with probabilities proportional to: Notice the self-reinforcing property of the hierarchical Pitman-Yor language model: the more a word w has been drawn in context u, the more likely will we draw w again in context u.
    In fact word w will be reinforced for other contexts that share a common
