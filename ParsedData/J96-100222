egativity, that the feature functions satisfy Ei f,(x, y) = 1 for all x, y.
    Input: Feature functions fi,f2, ...fn; empirical distribution 19(x, y) Output: Optimal parameter values A*,; optimal model N. where The key step in the algorithm is step (2a), the computation of the increments A A, that solve (16).
    If f# (x, y) is constant (f* (x, y) = M for all x, y, say) then AA, is given explicitly as If f# (x, y) is not constant, then AA, must be computed numerically.
    A simple and effective way of doing this is by Newton's method.
    This method computes the solution a* of an equation g(a*) = 0 iteratively by the recurrence with an appropriate choice for ao and suitable attention paid to the domain of g.
  
  
    Earlier we divided the statistical modeling problem into two steps: finding appropriate facts about the data, and incorporating these facts into the model.
    Up to this point we have proceeded by assuming that the first task was somehow performed for us.
    Even in the simple example of S
