ht suspect that most could suffice for finding MWU dictionary headwords.
    To verify this, we evaluate nine existing collocation-finders to see which best identifies valid headwords.
    We evaluate using two completely separate gold standards: (1) WordNet and (2) a compendium of Internet dictionaries.
    Although web-based resources are dynamic and have better coverage than WordNet (especially for acronyms and names), we show that WordNet-based scores are comparable to those using Internet MRDs.
    Yet the evaluations indicate that significant improvement is still needed in MWU-induction.
    As an attempt to improve MWU headword induction, we introduce several algorithms using Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA).
    LSA is a technique which automatically induces semantic relationships between words.
    We use LSA to try to eliminate proposed MWUs which are semantically compositional.
    Unfortunately, this does not help.
    Yet when we use LSA to identify substitutable delimiters.
    This suggests that
