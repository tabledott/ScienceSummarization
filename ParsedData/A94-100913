esults are summarised in table 1, for various corpora, where F denotes the &amp;quot;most frequent tag&amp;quot; test.
    As an example of how these figures relate to overall accuracies, LOB-B contains 32.35% ambiguous tokens with respect to the lexicon from LOB-B-J, and the overall accuracy in the DO+TO case is hence 98.69%.
    The general pattern of the results is similar across the three test corpora, with the only difference of interest being that case D3+TO does better for LOB-L than for the other two cases, and in particular does better than cases DO+T1 and Dl+Tl.
    A possible explanation is that in this case the test data does not overlap with the training data, and hence the good quality lexicons (DO and D1) have less of an influence.
    It is also interesting that D3+T1 does better than D2-FT1.
    The reasons for this are unclear, and the results are not always the same with other corpora, which suggests that they are not statistically significant.
    Several follow-up experiments were used to
