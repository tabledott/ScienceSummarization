ds for closed formulas in traditional predicate logic (i.e. if the interpretation of the constant symbols in the language is fixed).
    Unresolved QLFs behave more like open formulas, and there is an analogy between assignments to unbound variables in predicate logic and possible resolutions of meta-variables admitted by the salience relation S. S(C,H) should be thought of as providing QLF expressions whose denotations are possible referents for unresolved expressions with category C. (It would have been possible to define S as a direct relation between categories and referents, but this complicates the statement of its role in resolution and in the semantic definitions.)
    We used S above in the definition of QLF semantics, but it is also central to NL processing: being able to compute S can clearly play an important role in the process of reference resolution during NL interpretation and in the process of building descriptions during NL synthesis.
    (The computational analogue of S was implemented as a
