median on our data.
    By applying in to our data, we observe a small but visible improvement of 1.3% absolute to .282 (see Fig.
    1).
    It is also possible that other improvements could be gained using other combining strategies.
  
  
    This paper identifies several new results in the area of MWU-finding.
    We saw that MWU headword evaluations using WordNet provide similar results to those obtained from far more extensive webbased resources.
    Thus, one could safely use WordNet as a gold standard for future evaluations.
    We also noted that information-like algorithms, particularly Z-scores, SCP, and x2, seem to perform best at finding MRD headwords regardless of filtering mechanism, but that improvements are still needed.
    We proposed two new LSA-based approaches which attempted to address issues of non-compositionality and non-substitutivity.
    Apparently, either current algorithms already capture much non-compositionality or LSA-based models of non-compositionality are of little help.
