and 4400 rela tion instances.
			That is, all the reported performances in this paper on the ACE RDC 2004 corpus are evalu ated using 5-fold cross validation on the entire corpus . Both corpora are parsed using Charniak?s parser (Charniak, 2001) with the boundaries of all the entity mentions kept 4 . We iterate over all pairs of entity mentions occurring in the same sentence to generate potential relation instances5.
			In our experimentation, SVM (SVMLight, Joachims(1998)) is selected as our classifier.
			For efficiency, we apply the one vs. others strategy, which builds K classifiers so as to separate one class from all others.
			The training parameters are chosen using cross-validation on the ACE RDC 2003 training data.
			In particular, l in our tree kernel is fine-tuned to 0.5.
			This suggests that about 50% dis count is done as our tree kernel moves down one level in computing ])2[],1[( 11 ii nnD . 4.2 Experimental Results.
