udy, we build a semantic role labeling system as an intermediate step to label opinion holders and topics by training it on opinion-bearing frames and their frame elements in FrameNet.
    For the goal of this study, extracting opinions from news media texts with their holders and topics, we utilize FrameNet data.
    The basic idea of our approach is to explore how an opinion holder and a topic are semantically related to an opinion bearing word in a sentence.
    Given a sentence and an opinion bearing word, our method identifies frame elements in the sentence and searches which frame element corresponds to the opinion holder and which to the topic.
    The example in Figure 1 shows the intuition of our algorithm.
    We decompose our task in 3 subtasks: (1) collect opinion words and opinion-related frames, We describe the subtask of collecting opinion words and related frames in 3 phases.
    In this study, we consider an opinion-bearing (positive/negative) word is a key indicator of an opinion.
