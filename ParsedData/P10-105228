oves of almost a half point as compared to the best Nettalk system.
    For the POS tagging task, BCD appears to be unpractically slower to train than the others approaches (SGD takes about 40min to train, OWLQN about 1 hour) due the simultaneous increase in the sequence length and in the number of observations.
    As a result, one iteration of BCD typically requires to repeatedly process over and over the same sequences: on average, each sequence is visited 380 times when we use the baseline feature set.
    This technique should reserved for tasks where the number of blocks is small, or, as below, when memory usage is an issue.
    In many tasks, the ambiguity of tokens can be reduced by looking up increasingly large windows of local context.
    This strategy however quickly runs into a combinatorial increase of the number of features.
    A side note of the Nettalk experiments is that when using embedded features, the active feature set tends to reflect this hierarchical organization.
    This means that
