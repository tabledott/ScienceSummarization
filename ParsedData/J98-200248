DL has a wider coverage than SA for the same degree of accuracy.
    One may be concerned that MDL is &amp;quot;overgeneralizing&amp;quot; here,14 but as shown in Figure 10, its disambiguation accuracy does not seem to be degraded.
    Another problem that must be dealt with concerning SA is how to remove noise (resulting, for example, from erroneous extraction) from the generalization results.
    Since SA estimates the ratio between two probability values, namely P(pcA'r), the generalization result may be lead astray if one of the estimates of P(C I v, r) and P(C) is unreliable.
    For instance, a high estimated value for (drop, bead, pearl) at protect against shown in Table 14 is rather odd, and is because the estimate of P(C) is unreliable (too small).
    This problem apparently costs SA a nonnegligible drop in disambiguation accuracy.
    In contrast, MDL does not suffer from this problem since a high estimated probability value is only possible with high frequency, which cannot result just from extrac
