ibed by Moldovan et al. (2002); and our exploitation of the glosses in the noisy-channel framework amounts to a simplified, statistical version of the semantic proofs implemented by LCC.
    Table 3 shows the impact of WordNet synonyms (WNsyn) and WordNet glosses (WNgloss) on our system.
    Adding WordNet synonyms and glosses improved slightly the performance on the KM questions.
    On the other hand, it is surprising to see that the performance has dropped when testing on TREC 2002 questions.
    Hermjakob et al. (2002) showed that reformulations (syntactic and semantic) improve the answer pinpointing process in a QA system.
    To make use of this technique, we extend our training data set by expanding every questionanswer pair Q-SA to a list (Qr-SA), Qr &#8834; &#920; where &#920; is the set of question reformulations.2 We also expand in a similar way the answer candidates in the test corpus.
    Using reformulations improved the performance of our system on the TREC 2002 test set while it was not benefi
