aged perceptron algorithm of Collins (2002).
			In that algorithm, the single highest scoring tree (or structure) is used toupdate the weight vector.
			However, MIRA aggres sively updates w to maximize the margin between 527 the correct tree and the highest scoring tree, which has been shown to lead to increased accuracy.
			3.2 Factored MIRA.
			It is also possible to exploit the structure of the output space and factor the exponential number of mar gin constraints into a polynomial number of local constraints (Taskar et al, 2003; Taskar et al, 2004).
			For the directed maximum spanning tree problem,we can factor the output by edges to obtain the fol lowing constraints: min ? ?w(i+1) ? w(i) ? ?
			s.t. s(l, j) ? s(k, j) ? 1 ?(l, j) ? yt, (k, j) /?
			yt This states that the weight of the correct incomingedge to the word xj and the weight of all other in coming edges must be separated by a margin of 1.
			It is easy to show that when all these constraintsare satisfied, the correct spanning tree and all inco
