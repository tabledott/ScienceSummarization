  A Machine Learning Approach To Pronoun Resolution In Spoken Dialogue
  
    We apply a decision tree based approach to pronoun resolution in spoken dialogue.
    Our system deals with pronouns with NPand non-NP-antecedents.
    We present a set of features designed for pronoun resolution in spoken dialogue and determine the most promising features.
    We evaluate the system on twenty Switchboard dialogues and show that it compares well to Byron&#8217;s (2002) manually tuned system.
  
  
    Corpus-based methods and machine learning techniques have been applied to anaphora resolution in written text with considerable success (Soon et al., 2001; Ng &amp; Cardie, 2002, among others).
    It has been demonstrated that systems based on these approaches achieve a performance that is comparable to hand-crafted systems.
    Since they can easily be applied to new domains it seems also feasible to port a given corpus-based anaphora resolution system from written text to spoken dialogue.
