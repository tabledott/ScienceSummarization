uent templates.
			All learning methods suffer from these issues.
			As wasshown by our results, BInc provides a first step to wards reducing these problems.
			Yet, these issues require further research.
			Apart from incorrectly learned rules, incorrect template matching (e.g. due to parse errors) and context mismatch contribute together 46% of theerrors.
			Context mismatches occur when the entail ing template is matched in inappropriate contexts.
			For example, ?slam X ? attack X?
			should not be applied when X is a ball, only when it is a person.
			The rule-set net effect on system precision is better estimated by removing these errors and fixing the annotation errors, which yields 72% precision.
