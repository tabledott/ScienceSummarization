 conditional exponential models of the form: where X(y) is the set of parses for sentence y, Z&#955;(y) = PxEX(y) e&#955;'f(x) is a normalizing constant, &#955; = (&#955;1, ... , &#955;n) E IRn is a vector of log-parameters, f = (f1, ... , fn) is a vector of property-functions fi : X IR for i = 1, ... , n on the set of parses X, and &#955; f(x) is the vector dot product Pni=1 &#955;ifi(x).
    In our experiments, we used around 1000 complex property-functions comprising information about c-structure, f-structure, and lexical elements in parses, similar to the properties used in Johnson et al. (1999).
    For example, there are property functions for c-structure nodes and c-structure subtrees, indicating attachment preferences.
    High versus low attachment is indicated by property functions counting the number of recursively embedded phrases.
    Other property functions are designed to refer to f-structure attributes, which correspond to grammatical functions in LFG, or to atomic attributevalue pairs in f-s
