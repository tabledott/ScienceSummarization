    6.2.3 Qualia Extraction.
    A popular alternative to the supervised approach to relation extraction is to pick a set of lexico-syntactic patterns that should capture the relation of interest and to harvest pairs they connect in text, as famously illustrated by Hearst (1992) for the hyponymy relation.
    In the DM approach, instead of going back to the corpus to harvest the patterns, we exploit the information already available in the W1W2&#215;L space.
    We select promising links as our equivalent of patterns and we measure the length of word pair vectors in the W1W2&#215;L subspace defined by these links.
    We illustrate this with the data set of Cimiano and Wenderoth (2007), which contains qualia structures (Pustejovsky 1995) for 30 nominal concepts, both concrete (door) and abstract (imagination).
    Cimiano and Wenderoth asked 30 subjects to produce qualia for these words (each word was rated by at least three subjects), obtai
