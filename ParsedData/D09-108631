cantly better than hard projection.
    Unlike EM on the target language alone, the QG&#8217;s performance does not depend on a clever initializer for initial model weights&#8212;all parameters of the generative model except for the QG configuration features were initialized to zero.
    Setting the prior to prefer direct correspondence provides the necessary bias to initialize learning.
    Error analysis showed that certain types of dependencies eluded the QG&#8217;s ability to learn from bitext.
    The Spanish treebank treats some verbal complements as the heads of main verbs and auxiliary verbs as the children of participles; the QG, following the English, learned the opposite dependency direction.
    Spanish treebank conventions for punctuation were also a common source of errors.
    In both German and Spanish, coordinations (a common bugbear for dependency grammars) were often mishandled: both treebanks attach the later coordinands and any conjunctions to the first coordinand; the reverse is true in
