pendency structure.
    Another aspect of EDL is that the arguments of the anchor can be filled in any order.
    This is possible because the elementary structures allocate a slot for each argument of the anchor in each syntactic environment that the anchor appears in.
    There can be many ways of constructing the elementary structures of a grammar so as to possess the EDL property.
    However, by requiring that the constructed elementary structures be &amp;quot;minimal,&amp;quot; the third property of LTAGs namely, factoring of recursion from the domain of dependencies, follows as a corollary of EDL.
  
  
    Factoring of recursion from the domain of dependencies (FRD): Recursion is factored away from the domain for the statement of dependencies.
    In LTAGs, recursive constructs are represented as auxiliary trees.
    They combine with elementary trees by the operation of adjunction.
    Elementary trees define the domain for stating dependencies such as agreement, subcategorization, and filler-gap dep
