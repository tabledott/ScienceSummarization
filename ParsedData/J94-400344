tuples.
    Only the extracted sentences were parsed, and their counts were recorded in our database.
    Even though this database is much smaller than the full database, for the ambiguous words of the test sentences, both databases provide the same information.
    Thus, the success rate for the test sentences is the same for both methods, while requiring a considerably smaller amount of resources at the research phase.
    The problem with this method is that for every set of sample sentences the entire corpus has to be scanned.
    Thus, a practical system would have to preprocess the corpus to construct a database of the entire corpus.
    Then, to resolve ambiguities, only this database need be consulted.
    After acquiring all the relevant data, the algorithm of Section 3.3 was executed for each of the test sentences.
  
  
    Two measurements, applicability and precision, are used to evaluate the performance of the algorithm.
    The applicability (coverage) denotes the proportion of cases for which
