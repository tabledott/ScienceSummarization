eparate homographs, which we call polyhomographic.
    As can be seen from the example entry, each LDOCE homograph includes information about the part of speech with which the homograph is marked and that applies to each of the senses within that homograph.
    The vast majority of homographs in LDOCE are marked with a single part of speech; however, about 2% of word types in the dictionary contain a homograph that is marked with more than one part of speech (e.g., noun or verb), meaning that either part of speech may apply.
    Although the granularity of the distinction between homographs in LDOCE is rather coarse-grained, they are, as we noted at the beginning of this paper, an appropriate level for many practical computational linguistic applications.

    This level of semantic disambiguation is frequently suffi
