utational complexity of the inferences required to process a discourse and the coherence of that discourse as assessed by measures that invoke centering phenomena.
    However, their basic definitions conflate the centers of an utterance with the linguistic expressions that realize those centers.
    In some of their examples it is unclear whether the shift in center or the particular expression used to realize the center is responsible for differences in coherence and inference load.
    Our present work has clarified these differences while maintaining Joshi and Weinstein's basic focus on the interaction between inference load and center management.
    Since Grosz, Joshi, and Weinstein (1986) was first circulated a number of researchers have tested and developed aspects of the theory presented here.'
    This follow-on research can be roughly grouped in a few main areas:
