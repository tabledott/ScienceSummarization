ing problematic cases for our projection framework, we are exploring ways to automatically create large quantities of syntactically annotated data.
    This will break the bottleneck in developing appropriately annotated training corpora.
    Currently, we are following two research directions.
    Our first goal is to minimize the degree of degradation in the quality of the projected trees when the input analyses and word alignments are automatically generated by a statistical parser and word alignment model.
    To improve the quality of the input analyses, we are adapting active learning and co-training techniques (Hwa, 2000; Sarkar, 2001) to exploit the most reliable data.
    We are also actively developing art alternative alignment model that makes more use of the syntactic structure (Lopez et al., 2002).
    Our second goal is to detect and reduce the noise in the projected trees so that they might replace the expensive human-annotated corpora as training examples for statistical parsers.
