 methods can be devised for the unsupervised discovery of morphemes, they could aid the formulation of a linguistic theory of morphology for a new language.
    It seems that even approximative automated morphological analysis would be beneficial for many natural language applications dealing with large vocabularies.
    For example, in text retrieval it is customary to preprocess texts by returning words to their base forms, especially for morphologically rich languages.
    Moreover, in large vocabulary speech recognition, predictive models of language are typically used for selecting the most plausible words suggested by an acoustic speech recognizer (see, e.g., Bellegarda, 2000).
    Consider, for example the estimation of the standard n-gram model, which entails the estimation of the probabilities of all sequences of n words.
    When the vocabulary is very large, say 100 000 words, the basic problems in the estimation of the language model are: (1) If words are used as basic representational units in th
