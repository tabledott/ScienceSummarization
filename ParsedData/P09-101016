put instructions.
    For example, one lexical feature measures the similarity of a word in the sentence to the UI labels of objects in the environment.
    Environment-specific features, such as whether an object is currently in focus, are useful when selecting the object to manipulate.
    In total, there are 4,438 features.
    Reward Function Environment feedback can be used as a reward function in this domain.
    An obvious reward would be task completion (e.g., whether the stated computer problem was fixed).
    Unfortunately, verifying task completion is a challenging system issue in its own right.
    Instead, we rely on a noisy method of checking whether execution can proceed from one sentence to the next: at least one word in each sentence has to correspond to an object in the environment.6 For instance, in the sentence from Figure 2 the word &#8220;Run&#8221; matches the Run... menu item.
    If no words in a sentence match a current environment object, then one of the previous sentences was analy
