  6As with all clause-level patterns in Proteus, these patterns m-e automatically generalized tohandle syntac- tic wniants uch as passive, relative clause, etc.

  The tables show the recall and precision mea- sures for the patterns, with F-measure being the harmonic mean of the two.
  The Seed pat- tern base consists of just the initial pattern set, given in the table on the previous page.
  ~ib this we added the patterns which the system discov- ered automatically after about 100 iterations, producing the pattern set called ExDIsco.
  For comparison, M anual-MUC is the pattern base lnanually develot)ed on the MUC-6 training corpus-1)repared over the course of 1 month of full-time work by at least one computational linguist (during which the 100-document train- ing corpus was studied in detail).
