;quot; has a large kurtosis.'
    Among the eliminated collocates were &amp;quot;dormant, dilute, ex., defunct,&amp;quot; which obviously are not typical of a takeover.
    Although these rejected collocations might be useful for applications such as speech recognition, for example, we do not consider them any further here.
    We are looking for recurrent combinations and not casual ones.
    Condition (C2) requires that the histogram of the 10 relative frequencies of appearance of w, within five words of w (or pis) have at least one spike.
    If the histogram is flat, it will be rejected by this condition.
    For example, in Figure 5, the histogram associated with w2 would be rejected, whereas the one associated with wl or w, would be accepted.
    In Table 2, the histogram for &amp;quot;takeover-possible&amp;quot; is clearly accepted (there is a spike for 19_0, whereas the one for &amp;quot;takeover-federal&amp;quot; is rejected.
    The assumption here is that, if the two words are repeatedly used toget
