ith the minimum cost as in (Tillmann and Ney, 2003) and (Koehn, 2004) .
    The distortion cost is added to the log-linear mixture of the hypothesis extension in a fashion similar to the language model cost.
    A hypothesis covers a subset of the source words.
    The final translation is a hypothesis that covers all source words and has the minimum cost among all possible 9 hypotheses that cover all source words.
    A hypothesis h is extended by matching the phrase dictionary against source word sequences in the input sentence that are not covered in h. The cost of the new hypothesis C(hn w) = C(h) + C(e), where C(e) is the cost of this extension.
    The main components of the cost of extension e can be defined by the following equation: where CLM(e) is the language model cost, CTM (e) is the translation model cost, and CD(e) is the distortion cost.
    The extension cost depends on the hypothesis being extended, the phrase being used in the extension, and the source word positions being covered.
