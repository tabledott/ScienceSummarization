red by the algorithm.
    Figure 3 shows the proportion of correctly discovered NE transliteration equivalence classes throughout the run of the algorithm.
    The figure also shows the accuracy if transliterations are selected according to the current transliteration model (top scoring candidate) and sequence matching alone.
    The transliteration model alone achieves an accuracy of about 47%, while the time sequence alone gets about 41%.
    The combined algorithm achieves about 66%, giving a significant improvement.
    In order to understand what happens to the transliteration model as the algorithm proceeds, let us consider the following example.
    Figure 4 shows parts of transliteration lists for NE forsyth for two iterations of the algorithm.
    The weak transliteration model selects the correct transliteration (italicized) as the 24th best transliteration in the first iteration.
    Time sequence scoring function chooses it to be one of the training examples for the next round of training of the m
