    Distributional triples are also used in computational lexicography to identify the grammatical and collocational behavior of a word and to define its semantic similarity spaces.
    For instance, the Sketch Engine1 builds &#8220;word sketches&#8221; consisting of triples extracted from parsed corpora and formed by two words linked by a grammatical relation (Kilgarriff et al. 2004).
    The number of shared triples is then used to measure the attributional similarity between word pairs.
    Structured models take into account the crucial role played by syntactic structures in shaping the distributional properties of words.
    To qualify as context of a target item, a word must be linked to it by some (interesting) lexico-syntactic relation, which is also typically used to distinguish the type of this co-occurrence.
    Given the sentence The teacher eats a red apple, structured DSMs would not consider eat as a legitimat
