			used cores.
			The parsing time is 1.9 times fasteron two cores and 3.4 times faster on 4 cores.
			Hy per threading can improve the parsing times again and we get with hyper threading 4.6 faster parsingtimes.
			Hyper threading possibly reduces the over head of threads, which contains already our single core version.
