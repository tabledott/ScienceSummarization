d the complete sequence of tokens that constitute the scope.
    We apply the following postprocessing: - If one token has been predicted as FIRST and none has been predicted as LAST, the sequence is formed by the token predicted as FIRST.
    - If one token has been predicted as LAST and none as FIRST, the sequence will start at the negation signal and it will finish at the token predicted as LAST.
    - If one token has been predicted as FIRST and more than one as LAST, the sequence will end with the first token predicted as LAST after the token predicted as FIRST, if there is one.
    - If one token has been predicted as LAST and more than one as FIRST, the sequence will start at the negation signal.
    - If no token has been predicted as FIRST and more than one as LAST, the sequence will start at the negation signal and will end at the first token predicted as LAST after the negation signal.
