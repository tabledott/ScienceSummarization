 into two with different nature: one is that the annota tion policy is still not well-established for the coordination involving ellipsis, and the other is an ambiguity when the coordinated phrase has modifiers.
			Syntax annotation of coordination with ellipsis is difficult in general but the more so in an notation of abstracts than in the case of general texts, because in abstracts authors tend to pack information in limited number of words.
			The PTB guideline dedicates a long section for this phenomena and allows alternatives in annotation, but there are still cases which are not well covered by the scheme.
			For example, in addition to the disagreement, the phrase illustrated in Figure 2a and Figure 2b shows another problem of the annotation scheme.
			Both annotators fail to indicate that it is ?mediated?
			that was to be after ?IL-1?
			because there is no mechanism of coindexing a null element with a part of a token.
			This problem of ellipsis can frequently occur in research abstracts, and it can
