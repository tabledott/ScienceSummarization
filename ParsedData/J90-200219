of this experiment, we replaced all other words with either the unknown English word or the unknown French word, as appropriate.
    We applied the iterative algorithm discussed above in order to estimate some 81 million parameters from 40,000 pairs of sentences comprising a total of about 800,000 words in each language.
    The algorithm requires an initial guess of the parameters.
    We assumed that each of the 9,000 French words was equally probable as a translation of any of the 9,000 English words; we assumed that each of the fertilities from 0 to 25 was equally probable for each of the 9,000 English words; and finally, we assumed that each target position was equally probable given each source position and target length.
    Thus, our initial choices contained very little information about either French or English.
    Figure 4 shows the translation and fertility probabilities we estimated for the English word the.
    We see that, according to the model, the translates most frequently into the French
