 textbook would be intermediate between the more typical English of a news article and the specialized English native to the domain.
    To test this we created a corpus of seven texts (`BioBooks&amp;quot;) on various areas of biology that were available on the web.
    We observe in Figure 2 that for all quantities of self-training data one does better with Medline than BioBooks.
    For example, at 37,000 sentences the BioBook corpus is only able to achieve and an f-measure of 82.8% while the Medline corpus is at 83.4%.
    Furthermore, BioBooks levels off in performance while Medline has significant improvement left in it.
    Thus, while the hypothesis seems reasonable, we were unable to make it work.
  
  
    We self-trained the standard C/J parser on 270,000 sentences of Medline abstracts.
    By doing so we achieved a 20% error reduction over the best previous result for biomedical parsing.
    In terms of the gap between the supervised data and the self-trained data, this is the largest that has been
