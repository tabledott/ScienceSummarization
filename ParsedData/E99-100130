oved performance of the Named Entity recognition system.
    Figure 4 summarises the Precision and Recall results for each of these modes and confirms the hypotheses.
  
  
    The hypotheses were correct: without gazetteers the system still scores in the high eighties for names of organisations and people.
    Locations come out badly.
    But even with a very small number of country names performance for those named entities also goes up into the mideighties.
    And simple techniques for extending the gazetteers on the basis of a sample of just 30 articles already makes the system competitive again.
    These experiments suggest that the collection of gazetteers need not be a bottleneck: through a judicious use of internal and external evidence relatively small gazetteers are sufficient to give good Precision and Recall.
    In addition, when collecting these gazetteers one can concentrate on the obvious examples of locations and organisations, since these are exactly the ones that will be introduced in te
