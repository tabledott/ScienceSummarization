the more general sense inventory is considered.
    We substituted the corresponding supersense to each noun and verb synset in all three data-sets: SEM, SEMv and SE3.
    All other tokens were labeled &#8220;0&#8221;.
    The supersense label &#8220;noun.Tops&#8221; refers to 45 synsets which lie at the very top of the Wordnet noun hierarchy.
    Some of these synsets are expressed by very general nouns such as &#8220;biont&#8221;, &#8220;benthos&#8221;, &#8220;whole&#8221;, and &#8220;nothing&#8221;.
    However, others undoubtedly refer to other supersenses, for which they provide the label, such as &#8220;food&#8221;, &#8220;person&#8221;, &#8220;plant&#8221; or &#8220;animal&#8221;.
    Since these nouns tend to be fairly frequent, it is confusing and inconsistent to label them &#8220;noun.Tops&#8221;; e.g., nouns such as &#8220;chowder&#8221; and &#8220;Swedish meatball&#8221; would be tagged as &#8220;noun.food&#8221;, but the noun &#8220;food&#8221; would be tagged as &#8220;noun.Tops&#8221;.
