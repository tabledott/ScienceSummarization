ecause another translation, Steuernienu, was uniquely used, violating the consistency requirement.
    Termight, or a similar tool, can thus be helpful in identifying inconsistent translations.
  
  
    We have shown that terminology research provides a good application for robust natural language technology, in particular for part-of-speech tagging and word-alignment algorithms.
    Although the output of these algorithms is far from perfect, it is possible to extract from it useful information that is later corrected and augmented by a user.
    Our extraction algorithms emphasize completeness, and identify also infrequent candidates that may not meet some of the statistical significance criteria proposed in the literature.
    To make the entire process efficient, however, it is necessary to analyze the user's work process and provide interfaces that support it.
    In many cases, improving the way information is presented to the user may have a larger effect on productivity than improvements in the under
