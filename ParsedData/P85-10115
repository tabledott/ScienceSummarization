uppemr in the frontier of the trees in TIG).
  This set will be called the string language (~r langtiage) of G. If L is the string language of s TAG G then we say that L is a Tree-Adjoinin~ I.angllage (TAL).
  The relationship between TAGs , context-free grammmm, and the corresponding string languages can be summarised as follows ([Joehi, Levy, and Takahashi, 1975], [Joshi, 19831).
  Theorem 2.1: For every context-free grammar, G, there is so equivalent TAG, G, both weakly and strongly.
  Theorem 2.2: For every TAG, G, we have the following sitoatious: a.
  LeG) is context-free 3nd there is a context-free grammar G that is strongly (cud therefore weakly) equivalent o G. b. C. L(G) is context-free and there is 4o coutext~free gramma~ G that is equivalent o G. Of course, there must be n context-free grmmmar that is weakly equivalent to G. L(G) is strictly context-sensitive.
  Obviously in this cue, there is no context-freo grammar that is weakly equivalent to G. Part8 Ca) ~d (e) of Theorem 2.2 appear in ([Jushi
