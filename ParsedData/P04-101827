    The Bell tree representation proposed in this paper, however, provides us with a naturally incremental framework for coreference resolution.
    Maximum entropy method has been used in coreference resolution before.
    For example, Kehler (1997) uses a mention-pair maximum entropy model, and two methods are proposed to compute entity scores based on the mention-pair model: 1) a distribution over entity space is deduced; 2) the most recent mention of an entity, together with the candidate mention, is used to compute the entity-mention score.
    In contrast, in our mention pair model, an entity-mention pair is scored by taking the maximum score among possible mention pairs.
    Our entity-mention model eliminates the need to synthesize an entity-mention score from mention-pair scores.
    Morton (2000) also uses a maximum entropy mention-pair model, and a special &#8220;dummy&#8221; mention is used to model the event of starting a new entity.
