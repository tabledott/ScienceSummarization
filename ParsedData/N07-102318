duces good alignments.
    A sample alignment is provided in Figure 2.
    Once a constituent alignment is available, it is then trivial to extract all deletion SCFG rules available in a tree pair, e.g., NP &#8212;* (DT JJ NN, DT JJ NN) in the figure.
    We also exploited more general tree productions known as synchronous tree substitution grammar (STSG) rules, in an approach quite similar to (Turner and Charniak, 2005).
    For instance, the STSG rule rooted at S can be decomposed into two SCFG productions if we allow unary rules such as VP &#8212;* VP to be freely added to the compressed tree.
    More specifically, we decompose any STSG rule that has in its target (compressed) RHS a single context free production, and that contains in its source (full) RHS a single context free production adjoined with any number of tree adjoining grammar (TAG) auxiliary trees (Joshi et al., 1975).
    In the figure, the initial tree is S &#8212;* NP VP, and the adjoined (auxiliary) tree is VP &#8212;* VP CC VP.6 We found
