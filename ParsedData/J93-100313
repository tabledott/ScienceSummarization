significance of the occurrences of both rare and common phenomenon.
    Likelihood ratio tests are based on the idea that statistical hypotheses can be said to specify subspaces of the space described by the unknown parameters of the statistical model being used.
    These tests assume that the model is known, but that the parameters of the model are unknown.
    Such a test is called parametric.
    Other tests are available that make no assumptions about the underlying model at all; they are called distribution-free.
    Only one particular parametric test is described here.
    More information on parametric and distribution-free tests is available in Bradley (1968) and Mood, Graybill, and Boes (1974).
    The probability that a given experimental outcome described by k1,...,kn will be observed for a given model described by a number of parameters p1,132,... is called the likelihood function for the model and is written as where all arguments of H left of the semicolon are model parameters, and all argumen
