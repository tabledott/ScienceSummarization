ation is equivalent to the parse trees of the simple grammar in (Wu, 1997).
    We observe that a given permutation may be constructed in several ways by the above method.
    For instance, let us consider the identity permutation of 1, 2,..., n. Any binary tree with n nodes and all inner nodes colored white (monotone order) is a possible representation of this permutation.
    To obtain a unique representation, we pose an additional constraint on the binary trees: if the right son of a node is an inner node, it has to be colored with the opposite color.
    With this constraint, each of these binary trees is unique and equivalent to a parse tree of the &#8217;canonical-form&#8217; grammar in (Wu, 1997).
    In (Shapiro and Stephens, 1991), it is shown that the number of such binary trees with n nodes is the (n &#8722; 1)th large Schr&#168;oder number Sn&#8722;1.
    The (small) Schr&#168;oder numbers have been first described in (Schr&#168;oder, 1870) as the number of bracketings of a given sequence (Schr&#1
