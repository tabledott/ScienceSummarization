e approaches adopt a single-candidate model in which the classifier judges whether an antecedent candidate is coreferential to an anaphor with a confidence value.
    The confidence values are generally used as the competition criterion for the antecedent candidates.
    For example, the &#8220;Best-First&#8221; selection algorithms (Aone and Bennett, 1995; Ng and Cardie, 2002a) link the anaphor to the candidate with the maximal confidence value (above 0.5).
    One problem of the single-candidate model, however, is that it only takes into account the relationships between an anaphor and one individual candidate at a time, and overlooks the preference relationship between candidates.
    Consequently, the confidence values cannot accurately represent the true competition criterion for the candidates.
    In this paper, we present a competition learning approach to coreference resolution.
    Motivated by the research work by Connolly et al. (1997), our approach adopts a twin-candidate model to directly learn
