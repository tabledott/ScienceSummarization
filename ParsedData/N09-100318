ataset, where 9 pairs contain words which are unknown to WordNet.
    In order to overcome this shortcoming, we could use similar words instead, as provided by the distributional thesaurus.
    We used the distributional thesaurus defined in Section 3, using context windows of width 4, to provide three similar words for each of the unknown words in WordNet.
    Results improve for both WN30 and WN30g, as shown in Table 4, attaining our best results for WordSim353.
    We mentioned above that the annotation guidelines of WordSim353 did not distinguish between similar and related pairs.
    As the results in Section 4 show, different techniques are more appropriate to calculate either similarity or relatedness.
    In order to study this effect, ideally, we would have two versions of the dataset, where annotators were given precise instructions to distinguish similarity in one case, and relatedness in the other.
    Given the lack of such datasets, we devised a simpler approach in order to reuse the existing hu
