rtest possible description, if one exists.
    Suppose the full brevity algorithm is used to generate a description for d1 in Figure 1.
    There is no single property that distinguishes the target object d1 from the distractors {d2, d3, d4}.
    But when considering all pairs of properties the algorithm will find that one such pair rules out all distractors, namely, small and dog; &#8220;the small dog&#8221; is a successful and minimal distinguishing description for d1.
    Dale and Reiter point out that the full brevity algorithm is both computationally infeasible (NP hard) and psychologically unrealistic.
    They offer the incremental algorithm as an alternative.
    The incremental algorithm considers properties for selection in a predetermined order, based on the idea that human speakers and listeners prefer certain kinds of properties (or attributes) when describing objects from a given domain.
    For instance, when discussing domestic animals, it seems likely that a human speaker would first describe
