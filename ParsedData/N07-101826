ay be a useful estimator.
			However, in our experiments with theSesotho data above we found that for the small val ues of ? necessary to obtain a sparse solution,the expected rule count E[fr] for many rules r was lessthan 1??.
			Thus on the next iteration ?r = 0, result ing in there being no parse whatsoever for many of the strings in the training data.
			Variational Bayesian techniques offer a systematic way of dealing with these problems, but we leave this for further work.
	
	
			This paper has described basic algorithms for performing Bayesian inference over PCFGs given ter minal strings.
			We presented two Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms (a Gibbs and a Hastings sampling algorithm) for sampling from the posterior distribution over parse trees given a corpus of theiryields and a Dirichlet product prior over the production probabilities.
			As a component of these algorithms we described an efficient dynamic program ming algorithm for sampling trees from a PCFG which is useful in its own right.
