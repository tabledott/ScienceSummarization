 definite description.
    A classification scheme based on this distinction (such as Fraurud's) that just asked subjects to indicate an antecedent for subsequent-mention definite descriptions may have a chance of resulting in a standardized annotation.
    Even in this case, however, the agreement we observed was not very high, but better results may be obtained with more training.
    The possibility we are exploring is that these results might get better if annotators are given computer support in the form of a semiautomatic classifier&#8212;i.e., a system capable of suggesting to annotators a classification for definite descriptions, including possibly an indication of how reliable the classification might be.
    We briefly discuss below our progress in this direction so far.
    5.1.2 Consequences for Linguistic Theory.
    Our study confirms the findings of previous work (e.g., Fraurud [1990]) that a great number of definite descriptions in texts are discourse-new: in our second experiment we found an
