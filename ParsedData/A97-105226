em consists of the following six components which are applied in sequence to sentences containing a specific predicate in order to retrieve a set of subcategorization classes for that predicate: For example, building entries for attribute, and given that one of the sentences in our data was (la), the tagger and lemmatizer return (lb).
    (lb) is parsed successfully by the probabilistic LR parser, and the ranked analyses are returned.
    Then the patternset extractor locates the subanalyses containing attribute and constructs a patternset.
    The highest ranked analysis and pattern for this example are shown in Figure 12.
    Patterns encode the value of the VSUBCAT feature from the VP rule and the head lemma(s) of each argument.
    In the case of PP (P2) arguments, the pattern also encodes the value of PSUBCAT from the PP rule and the head lemma(s) of its complement(s).
    In the next stage of processing, patterns are classified, in this case giving the subcategorization class corresponding to transitive
