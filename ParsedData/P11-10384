ological and phonetic variation.
    Then, all candidates are ranked according to a list of features generated from noisy context and similarity between ill-formed words and candidates.
    Our proposed cascaded method is shown to achieve state-of-the-art results on both SMS and Twitter data.
    Our contributions in this paper are as follows: (1) we conduct a pilot study on the OOV word distribution of Twitter and other text genres, and analyse different sources of non-standard orthography in Twitter; (2) we generate a text normalisation dataset based on Twitter data; (3) we propose a novel normalisation approach that exploits dictionary lookup, word similarity and word context, without requiring annotated data; and (4) we demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art accuracy over both SMS and Twitter data.
  
  
    The noisy channel model (Shannon, 1948) has traditionally been the primary approach to tackling text normalisation.
    Suppose the ill-formed text is T and its corresponding standard f
