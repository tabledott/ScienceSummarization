T" in position 1, with "N" in position 2, and with one of the VFIN readings in position 3.
  Here are two more context-dependent disambiguation constraints for English: (@w =0 VFIN (-1 TO)) ("that" =!
  "&lt;Rel&gt;" (-1 NOMHEAD) (1 VFIN)) stating that if a word (@w) has a reading with the feature "PREP", this very reading is discarded (=0) iff the preceding word (i.e.
  the word in position -1) has a reading with the feature "DET".
  The domain points out some element o be disam- biguated, e.g.
  (the readings of) a particular word- form.
  The designated domain @w is a variable over any word-form, used when the target reading is picked by feature(s) only.
  The target defines which reading the constraint is about.
  The target may refer to one particular eading, such as "V PRES -SG3", or to all members of a declared set, such as VFIN.
  The operator defines which operation to perform on the reading(s).
  There are three disambiguation operators, here treated in order of decreasing strength.
  The operator =
