ical significance of difference in the means of two classes of phrases.
    Results reported are significant at the .005 level or better, except where '*' indicates significance at the .03 level or better.
    Results were calculated using one-tailed t-tests, except where 'f' indicates a two-tailed test. ing methods, namely lower f0 maximum and average, lower rms maximum and average, faster speaking rate, shorter preceding pauses, and longer subsequent pauses.
    While it may appear somewhat surprising that results for both labeling methods match so closely, in fact, correlations for text-and-speech labels presented in Table 5 were almost invariably statistically stronger than those for text-alone labels presented in Table 4.
    These more robust results for text-andspeech labelings occur even though the data set of consensus labels is considerably larger than the data set of consensus text-alone labelings.
    With a view toward automatically segmenting a spoken discourse, we would like to directly classif
