ed (e.g. by clustering, or by manual effort) to be related, as opposed to groupings of nouns that happen to appear near each other in running text (which may or may not reflect relatedness based on meaning).
    This provides some justification for restricting attention to similarity (reflected by the scaffolding of IS-A links in the taxonomy), as opposed to the more general notion of association.
    Second, this difference is reflected algorithmically by the fact that Sussna uses not only IS-A links but also other WordNet links such as PART-OF.
    Third, unlike Sussna's algorithm, the semantic similarity/distance computation here is not based on path length, but on information content, a choice that I have argued for elsewhere (Resnik, 1993; Resnik, 1995).
    Fourth, the combinatorics are handled differently: Sussna explores analyzing all sense combinations (and living with the exponential complexity), as well as the alternative of sequentially &amp;quot;freezing&amp;quot; a single sense for each of wi ,
