    translational equivalence between their components.
    Every link generated by a D-MTG has D components.
    Some (but not all) components of a link may be empty.
    An empty component indicates that an expression vanishes in translation.
    To express empty components, we add a special terminal E to T and a special nonterminal E to N. In MTG applications, the different components of a link will typically come from largely disjoint subsets of T or N, representing vocabularies or sets of grammatical categories from different languages.
    Each MTG also has a set of production rules (or just &amp;quot;productions&amp;quot; for short), which fall into one of two categories.'
    YIELD productions have the form where M is a non-empty vector of nonterminal links, P is a non-empty vector of D permutations, and N (&amp;quot;join&amp;quot;) is a rendering function, explained below.2 The rank of an MTG production is the number of nonterminal links on its RHS.
    The rank of an MTG is the maxim
