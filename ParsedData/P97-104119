    The following shows an example of an English sentence and its de-segmented version: About 20,000 years ago the last ice age ended.

    In addition, we are also able to provide a more detailed error analysis of the English segmentation (since the author can read English but not Thai).
    Our English experiments were performed using a corpus of texts from the Wall Street Journal (WSJ).
    The training set consisted of 2675 sentences (64632 words) in which all the spaces had been removed; the test set was a separate set of 700 sentences (16318 words) from the same corpus (also with all spaces removed).
    For an initial experiment, segmentation was performed using the maximum matching algorithm, with a large lexicon of 34272 English words compiled from the WSJ.&amp;q
