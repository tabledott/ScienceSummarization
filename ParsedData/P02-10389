ion needed in Eq.
    8 requires a sum over a large number of possible sentences, for which we do not know an efficient algorithm.
    Hence, we approximate this sum by sampling the space of all possible sentences by a large set of highly probable sentences.
    The set of considered sentences is computed by an appropriately extended version of the used search algorithm (Och et al., 1999) computing an approximate n-best list of translations.
    Unlike automatic speech recognition, we do not have one reference sentence, but there exists a number of reference sentences.
    Yet, the criterion as it is described in Eq.
    11 allows for only one reference translation.
    Hence, we change the criterion to allow Rs reference translations es,1, ... , es,Rs for the sentence es: We use this optimization criterion instead of the optimization criterion shown in Eq.
    11.
    In addition, we might have the problem that no single of the reference translations is part of the nbest list because the search algorithm per
