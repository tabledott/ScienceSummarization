l-Onaizan et al., 1999), a publicly available SMT package that implements the IBM models (Brown et al., 1993), to train a QA noisy-channel model that maps flattened answer parse trees, obtained using the &#8220;cut&#8221; procedure described in Section 3.1, into questions.
    We used two different data sets for the purpose of testing.
    The first set consists of the 500 questions used at TREC 2002; the second set consists of 500 questions that were randomly selected from the Knowledge Master (KM) repository (http://www.greatauk.com).
    The KM questions tend to be longer and quite different in style compared to the TREC questions.
    Our QA system is straightforward.
    It has only two modules: an IR module, and an answeridentifier/ranker module.
    The IR module is the same we used in previous participations at TREC.
    As the learner, the answer-identifier/ranker module is also publicly available &#8211; the GIZA package can be configured to automatically compute the probability of the Viterbi align
