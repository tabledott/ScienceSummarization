p)/n) where n is the number of words.
			This value appears in subsequent tables under the column cr.
			We also calculate the confidence that the a character string segmented as a word is actually a word by treating p as the precision rates of each system.
			This is referred to as cp inthe result tables.
			Two systems are then considered to be statistically different (at a 95% confi dence level) if one of their cr or cp are different.
			Tables 5?12 contain the results for each corpus and track (groups are referenced by their ID as found in Table!2) ordered by F score.
