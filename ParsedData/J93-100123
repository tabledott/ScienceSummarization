    For information on contacting these organizations, see footnote 1.

    Imagine that a sequence of parts of speech, P. is presented at the input to the channel and for some crazy reason, it appears at the output of the channel in a corrupted form as a sequence of words, W. Our job is to determine P given W. By analogy with the noisy channel f
