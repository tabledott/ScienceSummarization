rsers but also for integrated systems such as information extraction using deep linguistic analysis.
			Similar attempt of con structing integrated corpora is being done in University of Pennsylvania, where a corpus of MEDLINE abstracts in CYP450 and oncology domains where annotated for named entities, POS, and tree structure of sentences (Kulick et al, 2004).
			2.1 Annotation Scheme.
			The annotation scheme basically follows the Penn Treebank II (PTB) scheme (Beis et al 1995), encoded in XML.
			A non-null constituent is marked as an element, with its syntactic cate gory (which may be combined with its function tags indicating grammatical roles such as -SBJ, -PRD, and -ADV) used as tags.
			A null constitu ent is marked as a childless element whose tag corresponds to its categories.
			Other function tags are encoded as attributes.
			Figure 1 shows an ex ample of annotated sentence in XML, and the corresponding PTB notation.
			The label ?S? means ?sentence?, ?NP?
			noun phrase, ?PP?
