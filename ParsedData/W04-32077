most of this small corpus, we performed all our evaluations using five-fold cross-validation.
    Due to the computational expense of bilingual parsing, we produced a sub-corpus of the KTB limiting English sentence length to 10 words, or 27% of the full data.
    We then randomized the order of sentences and divided the data into five equal test sets of 280 sentences each (&#8776;1,700 Korean words, &#8776;2,100 English words).
    Complementing each test set, the remaining data were used for training sets of increasing size to simulate various levels of data scarcity.
  
  
    We now describe parameter estimation for the four component models that combine to make our full system (Table 1).
    Our English syntax model is based on weighted bilexical dependencies.
    The model predicts the generation of a child (POS tag, word) pair, dependent upon its parent (tag, word) and the tag of the parent&#8217;s most recent child on the same side (left or right).
    These events correspond quite closely to the parse
