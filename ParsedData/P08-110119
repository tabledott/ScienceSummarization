 calculated by the percentage of correct tags on each character.
    The learning curves of the baseline and joint models are shown in Figure 3, Figure 4 and Figure 5, respectively.
    These curves are used to show the convergence of perceptron and decide the number of training iterations for the test.
    It should be noticed that the accuracies from Figure 4 and Figure 5 are not comparable because gold-standard segmentation is used as the input for the baseline tagger.
    According to the figures, the number of training iterations for the baseline segmentor, POS tagger, and the joint system are set to 8, 6, and 7, respectively for the remaining experiments.
    There are many factors which can influence the accuracy of the joint model.
    Here we consider the special character category features and the effect of the tag dictionary.
    The character category features (templates 15 and 16 in Table 2) represent a Chinese character by all the tags associated with the character in the training data.
    They
