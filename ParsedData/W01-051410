equency of term j in s,.
    Given Ak, the &amp;quot;meaning&amp;quot; of s, is computed by eq.
    3.
    Informally, s, is represented by the sum of the LSA feature vectors.
    Inter-sentence similarity is estimated by the cosine of the corresponding X (eq.
    4, Azk is the k&#8212;th element in Ai).
    Since Ak is derived from the co-occurrence matrix A, the size of each training text Si E A is crucial to its performance.
    Work in information retrieval uses Sz = document since the aim is to distinguish entire texts.
    Sz = paragraph is popular in psychology experiments.
    However, we suspect the segmentation task may benefit from Sz = sentence.
    Thus, two training corpora were derived from the Brown Corpus (Marcus et al., 1993).
    Annotations were first removed to leave a set of tokenised raw text (1.2 million tokens).
    This was partitioned into 35,000 paragraphs or 104,000 sentences, as two training corpora.
    The parameter k adjusts the accuracy of Ak.
    A large k implies minor diff
