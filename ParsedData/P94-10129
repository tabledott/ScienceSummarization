glish-Chinese encoding system known as Big 5.
    Gale &amp; Church's (1991) length-based alignment method is based on the model that each English character in L1 is responsible for generating some number of characters in L2.
    This model leads to a further approximation which encapsulates the dependence to a single parameter .6 that is a function of /1 and /2: Pr(Li L2IL1, L2)',&#9632;+' Pr(Li L2 I6(11, 12)) However, it is much easier to estimate the distributions for the inverted form obtained by applying Bayes' Rule: where Pr(6) is a normalizing constant that can be ignored during minimization.
    The other two distributions are estimated as follows.
    First we choose a function for 6(4,12).
    To do this we look at the relation between /1 and 12 under the generative model.
    Figure 1 shows a plot of English versus Chinese sentence lengths for a hand-aligned sample of 142 sentences.
    If the sentence lengths were perfectly correlated, the points would lie on a diagonal through the origin.
