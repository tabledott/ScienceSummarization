    In general, coreference errors in state-of-theart systems are frequently due to poor models of semantic compatibility (Haghighi and Klein, 2009).
    In this work, we take a primarily unsupervised approach to coreference resolution, broadly similar to Haghighi and Klein (2007), which addresses this issue.
    Our generative model exploits a large inventory of distributional entity types, including standard NER types like PERSON and ORG, as well as more refined types like WEAPON and VEHICLE.
    For each type, distributions over typical heads, modifiers, and governors are learned from large amounts of unlabeled data, capturing type-level semantic information (e.g.
    &#8220;spokesman&#8221; is a likely head for a PERSON).
    Each entity inherits from a type but captures entity-level semantic information (e.g.
    &#8220;giant&#8221; may be a likely head for the Microsoft entity but not all ORGs).
    Separately from the type-entity semantic module, a log-linear discourse model ca
