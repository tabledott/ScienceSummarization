anywhere from 6 to 10 hours each to complete their part.
    In the second experiment, we asked users to indicate all cases when within a cluster, a sentence is subsumed by another.
    The judges' data on the first seven sentences of cluster A are shown in Table 8.
    The &amp;quot;-F score&amp;quot; indicates the number of judges who agree on the most frequent subsumption.
    The t score&amp;quot; indicates that the consensus was no subsumption.
    We found relatively low interjudge agreement on the cases in which at least one judge indicated evidence of subsumption.
    Overall, out of 558 sentences, there was full agreement (5 judges) on 292 sentences (Table 9).
    Unfortunately, h 291 of these 292 sentences the agreement was that there is no subsumption.
    When the bar of agreement was lowered to four judges, 23 out of 406 agreements are on sentences with subsumption.
    Overall, out of 80 In conclusion, we found very high interjudge agreement in the first experiment and moderately low agreement i
