cting discourse relationships from a fixed set of alternative rhetorical patterns (e.g., Hobbs 1979, Mann and Thompson 1983, Reichman 1981) are unlikely to suffice.
    The intentional structure introduced in this paper depends instead on a small number of structural relations that can hold between intentions.
    This study also reveals several problems that must be confronted in expanding speech-act-related theories (e.g., Allen and Perrault 1980, Cohen and Levesque 1980, Allen 1983) from coverage of individual utterances to coverage of extended sequences of utterances in discourse.

    In particular, we take a discourse to be a piece of language behavior that typically involves multiple utterances and multiple participants.
    A discourse may be produced by one or more of these participants as speakers or writers; the audien
