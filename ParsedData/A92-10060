  Applied Text Generation
  
  
    This paper presents the Joyce system as an example of a fully-implemented, application-oriented text generation system.
    Joyce covers the whole range of tasks associated with text generation, from content selection to morphological processing.
    It was developped as part of the interface of the software design environment Ulysses.
    The following design goals were set for it: While we were able to exploit existing research for many of the design issues, it turned out that we needed to develop our own approach to text planning (Ra.mbow 1990).
    This paper will present the system and attempt to show how these design objectives led to particular design decisions.
    The structure of the paper is as follows.
    In Section 2, we will present the underlying application and give examples of the output of the System.
    In Section 3, we will discuss the overall structure of Joyce.
    We then discuss the three main components in turn: the text planner in Section 4, the
