peech recognition systems use a rescoring method (Figure 21).
    This consists of first using a simple acoustic and grammar model to produce a word lattice, and then to reevaluate this word lattice with a more sophisticated model.
    The size of the word lattice is then a critical parameter in the time and space efficiency of the system.
    The determinization and minimization algorithms we presented allow the size of such word lattices to be considerably reduced, as seen in the examples.
    We experimented with both determinization and minimization algorithms in the ATIS task.
    Table 1 illustrates these results.
    It shows these algorithms to be very effective in reducing the redundancy of speech networks in this task.
    The reduction is also illustrated by an example in the ATIS task.
    The number of paths of the word lattice before determinization was larger than that of the largest integer representable with 32 bit machines.
    We also experimented with the minimization algorithm by applying
