	Chinese Segmentation And New Word Detection Using Conditional Random Fields
		Chinese word segmentation is a difficult, im portant and widely-studied sequence modelingproblem.
		This paper demonstrates the abil ity of linear-chain conditional random fields(CRFs) to perform robust and accurate Chinese word segmentation by providing a principled framework that easily supports the in tegration of domain knowledge in the form of multiple lexicons of characters and words.
		We also present a probabilistic new word detection method, which further improves performance.
		Our system is evaluated on four datasets usedin a recent comprehensive Chinese word segmentation competition.
		State-of-the-art perfor mance is obtained.
	
	
			Unlike English and other western languages, many Asian languages such as Chinese, Japanese, and Thai, do not delimit words by white-space.
			Wordsegmentation is therefore a key precursor for language processing tasks in these languages.
			For Chinese, there has been significant research
