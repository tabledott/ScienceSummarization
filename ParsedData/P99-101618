tiple clusters.
    Their clustering is based on verb-object relations rather than on the noun-noun relations that we use.
    Future work on our project will include an attempt to incorporate verb-object data as well in the clustering process.
    The tree they construct is also binary with some internal nodes which seem to be &amp;quot;artificial&amp;quot;, but for evaluation purposes they disregard the tree structure and consider only the leaf nodes.
    Unfortunately it is difficult to compare their results to ours since their evaluation is based on the verb-object relations.
    Riloff and Shepherd (1997) suggested using conjunction and appositive data to cluster nouns; however, they approximated this data by just looking at the nearest NP on each side of a particular NP.
    Roark and Charniak (1998) built on that work by actually using conjunction and appositive data for noun clustering, as we do here.
    (They also use noun compound data, but in a separate stage of processing.)
    Both of these proj
