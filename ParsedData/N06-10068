locality.
    Locality is needed to allow practical search, but many entailment decisions rely on global features of the alignment, and thus do not naturally factor by nodes and edges.
    To take just one example, dropping a restrictive modifier preserves entailment in a positive context, but not in a negative one.
    For example, Dogs barked loudly entails Dogs barked, but No dogs barked loudly does not entail No dogs barked.
    These more global phenomena cannot be modeled with a factored alignment score.
    The last issue arising in the graph matching approaches is the inherent confounding of alignment and entailment determination.
    The way to show that one graph element does not follow from another is to make the cost of aligning them high.
    However, since we are embedded in a search for the lowest cost alignment, this will just cause the system to choose an alternate alignment rather than recognizing a non-entailment.
    In ID 152, we would like the hypothesis to align with the first part of t
