 Products of the above ratios/deltas and classifier choice/presence probabilities Type of operation: deletion, insertion, substitution (3 features) For each preposition/article choice: P(choice): 13 features for prepositions (12 prepositions and other for a preposition not in that set), 2 for articles Original token: none (for insertion) or the original preposition/article (13 features for prepositions, 2 for articles) Suggested token: none (for deletion) or the suggested preposition/article (13 features for prepositions, 2 for articles) The total number of features is 63 for prepositions and 36 for articles.

    To give an example, the top th
