th of the sentence fragments that are separated by punctuation marks is rather small: 4.5 words per fragment.
    A coverage pruning threshold of tc = 5.0 and an observation pruning of no = 50 are applied during the experiments.4 No other type of pruning is used.5 The MON constraint performs worst in terms of both mWER and SSER.
    The computing time is small, since no reordering is carried out.
    Constraints GE and S3 perform nearly identically in terms of both mWER and SSER.
    The GE constraint, however, works about three times as fast as the S3 constraint.
    Table 7 shows example translations obtained under the three different reordering constraints.
    Again, the MON reordering constraint performs worst.
    In the second and third translation examples, the S3 word reordering constraint performs worse than the GE reordering constraint, since it cannot take the word reordering due to the German verb group properly into account.
    The German finite verbs bin (second example) and k&#168;onnten (thi
