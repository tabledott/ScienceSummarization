    A symbol can also be written in braces, in which case the corresponding tape will move if the symbol under the read-write head is the last one on the tape.
    This is intended to capture the notion of spreading, from autosegmental morphology, that is, the principal according to which the last item in a string may be reused when required to fill several positions.
