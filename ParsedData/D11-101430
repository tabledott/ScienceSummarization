 for sentiment analysis include (Maas et al., 2011).
    Pang et al. (2002) were one of the first to experiment with sentiment classification.

    Even adding specific negation words, bigrams or part-of-speech information to these models did not add significant improvements.
    Other document-level sentiment work includes (Turney, 2002; Dave et al., 2003; Beineke et al., 2004; Pang and Lee, 2004).
    For further references, see (Pang and Lee, 2008).
    Instead of document level sentiment classification, (Wilson et al., 2005) analyze the contextual polarity of phrases and incorporate many well designed features including dependency trees.
    They also show improvements by first distinguishing between neutral and polar sentences.
    Our model naturally incorporates the recursive
