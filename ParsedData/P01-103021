To put it another way, every hotel must have an equal number of tour segments going in and out: Third, it is necessary to prevent multiple independent sub-tours.
    To do this, we require that every proper subset of cities have at least one tour segment leaving it: There are an exponential number of constraints in this third class.
    Finally, we invoke our IP solver.
    If we assign mnemonic names to the variables, we can easily extracte,afrom the list of variables and their binary values.
    The shortest tour for the graph in Figure 3 corresponds to this optimal decoding: it is not clear .
    We can obtain the second-best decoding by adding a new constraint to the IP to stop it from choosing the same solution again.4
  
  
    In our experiments we used a test collection of 505 sentences, uniformly distributed across the lengths 6, 8, 10, 15, and 20.
    We evaluated all decoders with respect to (1) speed, (2) search optimality, and (3) translation accuracy.
    The last two factors may not always coin
