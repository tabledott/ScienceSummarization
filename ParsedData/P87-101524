 is linear and nonerasing, a bounded sequences of substrings associated with the resulting structure is obtained by combining the substrings in each of its arguments using only the concatenation operation, including each substring exactly once.
    CFG's, TAG's, MCTAG's and HG's are all members of this class since they satisfy these restrictions.
    Giving a recognition algorithm for LCFRL's involves describing the substrings of the input that are spanned by the structures derived by the LCFRS's and how the composition operation combines these substrings.
    For example, in TAG's a derived auxiliary tree spans two substrings (to the left and right of the foot node), and the adjunction operation inserts another substring (spanned by the subtree under the node where adjunction takes place) between them (see Figure 3).
    We can represent any derived tree of a TAG by the two substrings that appear in its frontier, and then define how the adjunction operation concatenates the substrings.
    Similarly, for all
