pass the threshold but AB should, for different values of the threshold parameter (solid line in Figure 3).
    We observed that for low values of the threshold, less than 1% of the valid translations are missed; for example, for the threshold value of 0.10 we currently use, the error rate is 0.74%.
    However, as the threshold increases, the rate of failure can become unacceptable.
    A higher value for the threshold has two advantages: First, it offers higher selectivity, allowing fewer false positives (proposed translations that are not considered 13 Note that the number of sentences that do not contain any of X, A, or B does not enter any of the Dice coefficients computed by Champollion and consequently does not affect the algorithm's decisions.
    As discussed in Section 4, this gives a definite advantage to the Dice method over other measures of similarity.
    Failure rate of the translation algorithm with constant and increasing thresholds.
    The case a = 1 (solid line) represents the basic algor
