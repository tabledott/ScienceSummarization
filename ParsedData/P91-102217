We repeated this process many thousands of times and found that we could expect an error rate of about 0.9% given the frequency of anchor points from the first two Passes.
    By varying the parameters of the hidden Markov model, we explored the effect of anchor points and paragraph markers on the accuracy of alignment.
    We found that with paragraph markers but no anchor points, we could expect an error rate of 2.0%, with anchor points but no paragraph markers, we could expect an error rate of 2.3%, and with neither anchor points nor paragraph markers, we could expect an error rate of 3.2%.
    Thus, while anchor points and paragraph markers are important, alignment is still feasible without them.
    This is promising since it suggests that one may be able to apply the same technique to data where frequent anchor points are not available.
  
  
    We applied the alignment algorithm of Sections 3 and 4 to the Canadian Hansard data described in Section 2.
