  Labeled Pseudo-Projective Dependency Parsing With Support Vector Machines
  
    We use SVM classifiers to predict the next action of a deterministic parser that builds labeled projective dependency graphs in an incremental fashion.
    Non-projective dependencies are captured indirectly by projectivizing the training data for the classifiers and applying an inverse transformation to the output of the parser.
    We present evaluation results and an error analysis focusing on Swedish and Turkish.
  
  
    The CoNLL-X shared task consists in parsing texts in multiple languages using a single dependency parser that has the capacity to learn from treebank data.
    Our methodology for performing this task is based on four essential components: All experiments have been performed using MaltParser (Nivre et al., 2006), version 0.4, which is made available together with the suite of programs used for pre- and post-processing.1
  
  
    The parsing algorithm used for all languages is the deterministic algorithm
