anguage with fewer inflections when compared to Romanian, which accommodates for gender and case as a suffix to the base form of a word, the automatic translation into English is closer to a human translation (experiment three).
    Therefore labeling this data using the OpinionFinder tool and projecting the labels onto a fully inflected humangenerated Romanian text provides more accurate classification results, as compared to a setup where the training is carried out on machine-translated Romanian text (experiment two).
    We also wanted to explore the impact that the corpus size may have on the accuracy of the classifiers.
    We re-ran experiments two and three with 20% corpus size increments at a time (Figures 5 and 6).
    It is interesting to note that a corpus of approximately 6000 sentences is able to achieve a high enough Fmeasure (around 66% for both experiments) to be considered viable for training a subjectivity classifier.
    Also, at a corpus size over 10,000 sentences, the Naive Bayes classif
