 hierarchy.
    However, it is not clear what the desired level of sense distinction should be for WSD (or if it is the same for all word categories, all applications, etc.
    ), or if this level is even captured in WordNet's hierarchy.
    Discussion within the language-processing community is beginning to address these issues, including the most difficult one of defining what we mean by &amp;quot;sense&amp;quot; (see Section 3.2).
    As outlined in Buitelaar (1997), sense disambiguation in the generative context starts with a semantic tagging that points to a complex knowledge representation reflecting all of a word's systematically related senses, after which semantic processing may derive a discourse-dependent interpretation containing more precise sense information about the occurrence.
    Buitelaar (1997) describes the use of CORELEX for underspecified semantic tagging (see also Pustejovsky, Boguraev, and Johnston [19951).
    Viegas, Mahesh, and Nirenburg (forthcoming) describe a similar approach to
