ttom section displays the chart; the middle section displays the sentence; and the top section displays the partial syntax tree corresponding to the selected edge.
    Buttons along the bottom of the window are used to control the execution of the algorithm.
    The main display window for the chart parsing tool is shown in Figure 1.
    This tool can be used to explain several different aspects of chart parsing.
    First, it can be used to explain the basic chart data structure, and to show how edges can represent hypotheses about syntactic constituents.
    It can then be used to demonstrate and explain the individual rules that the chart parser uses to create new edges.
    Finally, it can be used to show how these individual rules combine to find a complete parse for a given sentence.
    To reduce the overhead of setting up demonstrations during lecture, the user can define a list of preset charts.
    The tool can then be reset to any one of these charts at any time.
    The chart parsing tool allows f
