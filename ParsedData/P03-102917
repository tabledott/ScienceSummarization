n this scenario is the smaller number of contributing patterns compared to the Succession scenario.
  
  
    One of the advantages of the proposed model is the ability to capture more varied context.
    The Predicate-Argument model relies for its context on the predicate and its direct arguments.
    However, some Predicate-Argument patterns may be too general, so that they could be applied to texts about a different scenario and mistakenly detect entities from them.
    For example, (( C-ORG -SBJ) happyo-suru), &#8220; C-ORG reports&#8221; may be the pattern used to extract an Organization in the Succession scenario but it is too general &#8212; it could match irrelevant sentences by mistake.
    The proposed Subtree Model can acquire a more scenario-specific pattern (( C-ORG SBJ)((shunin-suru-REL) jinji-OBJ) happyo-suru) &#8220; C-ORG reports a personnel affair to appoint&#8221;.
    Any scoring function that penalizes the generality of a pattern match, such as inverse document frequency, can successfully
