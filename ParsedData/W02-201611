ectors appear as their dot products.
    By simply substituting every dot product of xi and xj in dual form with a Kernel function K(xi, xj), SVMs can handle non-linear hypotheses.
    Among many kinds of Kernel functions available, we will focus on the dth polynomial kernel: K(xi, xj) = (xi &#8226; xj + 1)d. Use of d-th polynomial kernel functions allows us to build an optimal separating hyperplane which takes into account all combinations of features up to d.
  
  
    We used the following two annotated corpora for our experiments.
    This data set consists of the Kyoto University text corpus Version 2.0 (Kurohashi and Nagao, 1997).
    We used 7,958 sentences from the articles on January 1st to January 7th as training examples, and 1,246 sentences from the articles on January 9th as the test data.
    This data set was used in (Uchimoto et al., 1999; Uchimoto et al., 2000) and (Kudo and Matsumoto, 2000).
    In order to investigate the scalability of the cascaded chunking model, we prepared larger data s
