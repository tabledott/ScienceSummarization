acy using a particular set of knowledge sources and some particular learning algorithm, without investigating the effect of varying knowledge sources and learning algorithms.
    In SENSEVAL-2, the various Duluth systems (Pedersen, 2001b) attempted to investigate whether features or learning algorithms are more important.
    However, relative contribution of knowledge sources was not reported and only two main types of algorithms (Naive Bayes and decision tree) were tested.
    In contrast, in this paper, we systematically vary both knowledge sources and learning algorithms, and investigate the interaction between them.
    We also base our evaluation on both SENSEVAL-2 and SENSEVAL-1 official test data sets, and compare with the official scores of participating systems.
  
  
    To disambiguate a word occurrence , we consider four knowledge sources listed below.
    Each training (or test) context of generates one training (or test) feature vector.
    We use 7 features to encode this knowledge source: , w
