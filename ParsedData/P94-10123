    As a step toward remedying this, we are in the process of constructing a suitable English-Chinese corpus.
    To be included, materials must contain primarily tight, literal sentence translations.
    This rules out most fiction and literary material.
    We have been concentrating on the Hong Kong Hansard, which are the parliamentary proceedings of the Legislative Council (LegCo).
    Analogously to the bilingual texts of the Canadian Hansard (Gale 8.6 Church 1991), LegCo transcripts are kept in full translation in both English and Cantonese.2 However, unlike the Canadian Hansard, the Hong Kong Hansard has not previously been available in machine-readable form.
