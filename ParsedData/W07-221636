es many advantages.
    As mentioned above, it permits simple augmentation techniques to incorporate non-local information such as arity constraints and Markovization.
    It also ensures the compatibility of projective parsing algorithms with many important natural language processing methods that work within a bottom-up chart parsing framework, including information extraction (Miller et al., 2000) and syntax-based machine translation (Wu, 1996).
    The complexity results given here suggest that polynomial chart-parsing algorithms do not exist for the non-projective case.
    Otherwise we should be able to augment them and move beyond edgefactored models without encountering intractability &#8211; just like the projective case.
    An interesting line of research is to investigate classes of non-projective structures that can be parsed with chart-parsing algorithms and how these classes relate to the languages parsable by other syntactic formalisms.
