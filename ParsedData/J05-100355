f features were included in the model.
    We will use the rule VP &#8212;&gt; PP VBD NP NP SBAR with head VBD as an example.
    Note that the output of our baseline parser produces syntactic trees with headword annotations (see Collins [1999]) for a description of the rules used to find headwords).
    Two-level rules.
    Same as Rules, but also including the entire rule above the rule.
    Two-level bigrams.
    Same as Bigrams, but also including the entire rule above the rule.
    Trigrams.
    All trigrams within the rule.
    The example rule would contribute the trigrams (VP, STOP, PP, VBD!
    ), (VP, PP, VBD!, NP), (VP, VBD!, NP, NP), (VP, NP, NP, SBAR), and (VP,NP, SBAR, STOP) (! is used to mark the head of the rule).
    Grandparent bigrams.
    Same as Bigrams, but also including the nonterminal above the bigrams.
    Lexical bigrams.
    Same as Bigrams, but with the lexical heads of the two nonterminals also included.
    Head Modifiers.
    All head-modifier pairs, with the grandparent nonter
