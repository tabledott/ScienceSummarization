esentative collection of sentences containing these words.
    This selection of examples is achieved through a hybrid process partially controlled by the preliminary lexical description of each lemma.
    Sentences containing the lemma are extracted from from a corpus and classified into subcorpora by syntactic pattern (2.2.1) using a CASCADE FILTER (2.2.2, 2.2.5, 2.2.6) representing a partial regular-expression grammar of English over part-of-speech tags (cf.
    Gahl (forthcoming)), formatted for annotation (2.2.4) , and automatically sampled (2.2.3) down to an appropriate number.
    (If these heuristics fail to find appropriate examples by means of syntactic patterns, sentences are selected using INTERACTIVE SELECreviews the skeletal lexical record created by the Vanguard, the annotated example sentences (5.3), and the FEGs extracted from them, and builds both the entries for the lemmas in the Lexical Database (5.2) and the frame descriptions in the Frame Database (5.1), using the Entry Writing Tools (4.
