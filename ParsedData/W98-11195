 clearcut.
    Nevertheless it can still give us guidance on which candidates are more probable than others.
    The last factor we consider is referents' mention count.
    Noun phrases that are _mentioned repeatedly are preferred.
    The training corpus is marked with the number of times a referent has been mentioned up to that point in the story.
    Here we are concerned with the probability that a proposed antecedent is correct given that it has been repeated a certain number of times.
    In effect, we use this probability information to identify the topic of the segment with the belief that the topic is more likely to be referred to by a pronoun.
    The idea is similar to that used in the centering approach (Brennan et al., 1987) where a continued topic is the highest-ranked candidate for pronominalization.
    Given the above possible sources of information, we arrive at the following equation. where F(p) denotes a function from pronouns to their antecedents: where A(p) is a random variable denoting
