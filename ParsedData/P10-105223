   For this task, the number of labels is smaller (|Y  |= 45) than for Nettalk, and the set of observations is much larger (IXI = 43207).
    This benchmark, which has been used in many studies, allows for direct comparisons with other published work.
    We thus use a standard experimental set-up, where sections 0-18 of the Wall Street Journal are used for training, sections 19-21 for development, and sections 22-24 for testing.
    Features are also standard and follow the design of (Suzuki and Isozaki, 2008) and test the current words (as written and lowercased), prefixes and suffixes up to length 4, and typographical characteristics (case, etc.) of the words.
    Our baseline feature set also contains tests on individual and pairs of words in a window of 5 words.
    The first important issue is to assess the benefits of using large feature sets, notably including features testing both a bigram of labels and an observation.
    Table 1 compares the results obtained with and without these features for vari
