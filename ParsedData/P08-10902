uctured sequences of participants and events that have been called scripts (Schank and Abelson, 1977) or Fillmorean frames.
    These participants and events can be filled in and instantiated in a particular text situation to draw inferences.
    Chains focus on a single actor to faciliIt would be useful for question answering or textual entailment to know that &#8216;X denied &#8217; is also a likely event in the left chain, while &#8216; replaces W&#8217; temporally follows the right.
    Narrative chains (such as Firing of Employee or Executive Resigns) offer the structure and power to directly infer these new subevents by providing critical background knowledge.
    In part due to its complexity, automatic induction has not been addressed since the early nonstatistical work of Mooney and DeJong (1985).
    The first step to narrative induction uses an entitybased model for learning narrative relations by following a protagonist.
    As a narrative progresses through a series of events, each event is chara
