ce final precision and recall numbers for the entire output.
    For an entity, i, we define the precision and recall with respect to that entity in Figure 10.
    The final precision and recall numbers are computed by the following two formulae: Final Precision = E wi Precisioni Final Recall = E wi * Recalls where N is the number of entities in the document, and wi is the weight assigned to entity i in the document.
    For all the examples and the experiments in this paper we assign equal weights to each entity i.e. wi = 1/N.
    We have also looked at the possibilities of using other weighting schemes.
    Further details about the B-CUBED algorithm including a model theoretic version of the algorithm can be found in (Bagga 98a).
    Consider the response shown in Figure 7.
    Using the B-CUBED algorithm, the precision for entity-6 in the document equals 2/7 because the chain output for the entity contains 7 elements, 2 of which are correct, namely {6,7}.
    The recall for entity-6, however, is 2/2 becau
