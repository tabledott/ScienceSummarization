otation in preparation for a new task.
    Improving portability - being able to adapt to a new topic with minimal effort &#8211; is necessary to make Information Extraction technology useful for real users and, we believe, lead to a breakthrough for the application of the technology.
    We propose &#8216;On-demand information extraction (ODIE)&#8217;: a system which automatically identifies the most salient structures and extracts the information on the topic the user demands.
    This new IE paradigm becomes feasible due to recent developments in machine learning for NLP, in particular unsupervised learning methods, and it is created on top of a range of basic language analysis tools, including POS taggers, dependency analyzers, and extended Named Entity taggers.
  
  
    The basic functionality of the system is the following.
    The user types a query / topic description in keywords (for example, &#8220;merge&#8221; or &#8220;merger&#8221;).
    Then tables will be created automatically in several minut
