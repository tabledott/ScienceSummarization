VCA, a subset of less ambiguous verbs were manually selected.
    As reported above, we covered 56% of the verbs by token.
    Indeed, when we attempted to add more verbs to EVCA categories, at the 59% mark we reached a point of difficulty in adding new verbs due to ambiguity, e.g. verbs such as get.
    Thus, although our results using EVCA are revealing in important ways, it must be emphasized that the comparison has some imbalance which puts WordNet in an unnaturally negative light.
    In order to accurately compare the two approaches, we would need to process either the same less ambiguous verb subset with WordNet, or the full set of all verbs in all senses with EVCA.
    Although the results reported in this paper permitted the validation of our hypothesis, unless a fair comparison between resources is performed, conclusions about WordNet as a resource versus EVCA class distinctions should not be inferred.

    In addition to considering verb type frequencies in texts, we have observed
