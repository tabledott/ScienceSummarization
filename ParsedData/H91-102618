  A remarkably simple heuristic seemed to work fairly well to incorporate this observation.
  That is, assume that two pairs are morphologically related if both words start with the same first 5 characters.
  Then, select a pair if it is morphologically related to a pair that is already selected and it appears "significantly often" (in many more sentences than you would expect by chance) on any iteration.
  This very simple heuristic more than doubled the number of pairs that had been selected on the first four iterations, from 6419 to 13,466.
  As we will see in the next section, these 13 thousand pairs cover more than half of the words
