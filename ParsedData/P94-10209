 G2 statistic gives preference to models with the fewest number of interdependencies, thereby assuring the selection of a model specifying only the most systematic variable interactions.
    Within the framework described above, the process of model selection becomes one of hypothesis testing, where each pattern of dependencies among variables expressible in terms of a decomposable model is postulated as a hypothetical model and its fit to the data is evaluated.
    The &amp;quot;best fitting&amp;quot; models are identified, in the sense that the significance of their reference x2 values are large, and, from among this set, a conceptually appealing model is chosen.
    The exhaustive search of decomposable models can be conducted as described in [12].
    What we have just described is a method for approximating the joint distribution of all variables with a model containing only the most important systematic interactions among variables.
    This approach to model formulation limits the number of parameters
