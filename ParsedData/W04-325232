xtRank for a given application are the ones most recommended by related text units in the text, with preference given to the recommendations made by most influential ones, i.e. the ones that are in turn highly recommended by other related units.
    The underlying hypothesis is that in a cohesive text fragment, related text units tend to form a &#8220;Web&#8221; of connections that approximates the model humans build about a given context in the process of discourse understanding.
  
  
    In this paper, we introduced TextRank &#8211; a graphbased ranking model for text processing, and show how it can be successfully used for natural language applications.
    In particular, we proposed and evaluated two innovative unsupervised approaches for keyword and sentence extraction, and showed that the accuracy achieved by TextRank in these applications is competitive with that of previously proposed state-of-the-art algorithms.
    An important aspect of TextRank is that it does not require deep linguistic knowledg
