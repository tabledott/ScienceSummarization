, but there is no real contest between these approaches, because we can simply add LRA to the combination, as a fourteenth module.
    Since the VSM module had the best performance of the 13 modules (Turney et al. 2003), the following experiments focus on comparing VSM and LRA.
  
  
    LRA takes as input a set of word pairs and produces as output a measure of the relational similarity between any two of the input pairs.
    LRA relies on three resources, a search engine with a very large corpus of text, a broad-coverage thesaurus of synonyms, and an efficient implementation of SVD.
    We first present a short description of the core algorithm.
    Later, in the following subsections, we will give a detailed description of the algorithm, as it is applied in the experiments in Sections 6 and 7. intended to form near analogies with the corresponding original pairs (see Section 2.3).
    The motivation for the alternate pairs is to handle cases where the original pairs cooccur rarely in the corpus.
