 three relationships hold between the different DSPs:14
  
  
    This kind of interruption is distinct from a true interruption because there is a connection, although indirect, between the DSPs for the two segments.
    Furthermore, the linguistic features of the start of the interruption signify that there is a precedence relation between these DSPs (and hence that the correction is necessary).
    Flashbacks are also distinct from normally embedded discourses because of the precedence relationship between the DSPs for the two segments and the order in which the segments occur.
    The available linguistic data permit three possible attentional states as appropriate models for flashbacktype interruptions: one is identical to the state that would ensue if the flashback segment were a normally embedded segment, the second resembles the model of a true interruption, and the third differs from the others by requiring an auxiliary stack.
    An example of the stack for a normally embedded sequence is given in S
