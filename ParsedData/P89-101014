an 0, we need to say that P(x,y) is much less than 10-1&#176;, a statement that is hard to make with much confidence given the size of presently available corpora.
    In fact, we cannot (easily) observe a probability less than 1/N 10-7, and therefore, it is hard to know if I(x,y) is much less than chance or not, unless chance is very large.
    (In fact, the pair (a, doctors) above, appears significantly less often than chance.
    But to justify this statement, we need to compensate for the window size (which shifts the score downward by 2.0, e.g. from 0.96 down to &#8212; 1.04) and we need to estimate the standard deviation, using a method such as [Good (1953)].)
    Although the psycholinguistic literature documents the significance of noun/noun word associations such as doctor/nurse in considerable detail, relatively little is said about associations among verbs, function words, adjectives, and other non-nouns.
    In addition to identifying semantic relations of the doctor/nurse variety, we believe the
