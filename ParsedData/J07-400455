ulting model will typically assign low probabilities to non-normal-form derivations.
    The empirical value in Equation (19) is simply a count of the number of times the feature appears in the gold-standard normal-form derivations.
    The second term in Equation (19) is an expectation over all derivations for each sentence.
    The limited memory BFGS (L-BFGS) algorithm is a general purpose numerical optimization algorithm (Nocedal and Wright 1999).
    In contrast to iterative scaling algorithms such as GIS, which update the parameters one at a time on each iteration, L-BFGS updates the parameters all at once on each iteration.
    It does this by considering the topology of the feature space and moving in a direction which is guaranteed to increase the value of the objective function.
    The simplest way in which to consider the shape of the feature space is to move in the direction in which the value of the objective function increases most rapidly; this leads to the method of steepest-ascent.
    Hence
