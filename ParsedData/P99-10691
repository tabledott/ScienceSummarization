 be hoped.
    The simple &amp;quot;relative frequency&amp;quot; estimator for PCFGs yields the maximum likelihood parameter estimate, which is to say that it minimizes the Kulback-Liebler divergence between the training and estimated distributions.
    On the other hand, as Abney (1997) points out, the context-sensitive dependencies that &amp;quot;unification-based&amp;quot; constraints introduce render the relative frequency estimator suboptimal: in general it does not maximize the likelihood and it is inconsistent.
    Abney (1997) proposes a Markov Random Field or log linear model for SUBGs, and the models described here are instances of Abney's general framework.
    However, the Monte-Carlo parameter estimation procedure that Abney proposes seems to be computationally impractical for reasonable-sized grammars.
    Sections 3 and 4 describe two new estimation procedures which are computationally tractable.
    Section 5 describes an experiment with a small LFG corpus provided to us by Xerox PARC.
