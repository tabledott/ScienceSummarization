 density of the domain d with the lexicon L defined as: This indicates the ratio of polar clauses that appear in the coherent context, among all of the polar clauses detected by the system.
    The right column of Table 5 shows the coherent density in each domain.
    The movie domain has notably higher coherent density than the others.
    This indicates the sentiment expressions are more frequently used in the movie domain.
    The next section describes the method of our unsupervised learning using this imperfect context coherency.
  
  
    Figure 3 shows the flow of our unsupervised learning method.
    First, the runtime SA system identifies the polar clauses, and the candidate polar atoms are collected.
    Then, each candidate atom is validated using the two metrics in the previous section, cp and cd, which are calculated from all of the polar clauses found in the domain corpus.
    Table 6: Examples of candidate polar atoms and their frequencies.
    `*' denotes that it should not be added to the lex
