    The average precision over all these runs is 0.803 and the average recall is 0.757.
    The overlap in each run is almost identical to the precision, and differs slightly because there may have been some slight positional errors in either the FrameNet data or the sentence string provided in the test data.
    The results for the restricted case are shown in Table 2.
    The average precision over all these runs is 0.595 and the average recall is 0.481.
    The average overlap is noticeably lower than the precision, indicating the additional difficulty for these runs of identifying the frame element boundaries.
    In both cases, the percent attempted is quite high, except for one system in the restricted runs.
    This indicates that systems were able to identify potential frame elements in quite a large percentage of the cases.
    Systems were allowed to return any number of frame elements for a sentence and it is possible for a system to identify more frame elements than were identified by the F
