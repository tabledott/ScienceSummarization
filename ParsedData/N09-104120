 did fewer.
    A total of 69 preferences were solicited.
    Document collections presented to users were randomly selected from those evaluated fewest.
    As seen in table 5.2, HIERSUM outperforms PYTHY under all questions.
    All results are statistically significant as judged by a simple pairwise t-test with 95% confidence.
    It is safe to conclude that users in this study strongly preferred the HIERSUM summaries over the PYTHY summaries.
  
  
    While it is difficult to qualitatively compare one summarization system over another, we can broadly characterize HIERSUM summaries compared to some of the other systems discussed.
    For example output from HIERSUM and PYTHY see table 2.
    On the whole, HIERSUM summaries appear to be significantly less redundant than PYTHY and moderately less redundant than SUMBASIC.
    The reason for this might be that PYTHY is discriminatively trained to maximize ROUGE which does not directly penalize redundancy.
    Another tendency is for HIERSUM to select longer s
