 be interpreted to cospecify the discourse ntity realized by Cp(Ui-1) in one step (Constraint 3).
  The ordering of the Cf is the main determinant of which transition state holds between adjacent utterances.
  This means that the predictions of the theory are largely determined by the ranking of the items on the Cf.
  But there are many factors that can contribute to the salience of a discourse entity; among them are factors that we will not examine here such as lexical semantics, intonation, word-order, and tense.
  In this 9 A prediction made by the preference for CONTINUE is that intersentential antecedents for pronouns will be preferred over intrasentential c ndidates.
  This preference is one that distinguishes Centering for pronoun interpretation from the proposal made by Hobbs (1976a, 1976b).
  However, this preference needs to be constrained further by the fact that sortal filters may rule out the Cp of the previous utterance as the current Cb.
  In this case the data suggest that perhaps intrasentent
