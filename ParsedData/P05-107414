t probability by Equation 2, which chooses a single best paraphrase without regard for context.
    The 289 sentences created by substituting the italicized paraphrases in for the original phrase were judged to be correct an average of 74.9% of the time.
    Ignoring the constraint that the new sentences remain grammatically correct, these paraphrases were judged to have the correct meaning 84.7% of the time.
    This suggests that the context plays a more important role with respect to the grammaticality of substituted paraphrases than with respect to their meaning.
    In order to allow the surrounding words in the sentence to have an influence on which paraphrase was selected, we re-ranked the paraphrase probabilities based on a trigram language model trained on the entire English portion of the Europarl corpus.
    Paraphrases were selected from among all those in Table 2, and not constrained to the italicized phrases.
    In the case of the paraphrases extracted from the manual word alignments, the langu
