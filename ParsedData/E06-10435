rom Cowie et al. 1983).
    However, most are lexically fixed (nonproductive) to a large extent.
    Neither shoot the wind nor fling the breeze are typically recognized as variations of the idiom shoot the breeze.
    Similarly, spill the beans has an idiomatic meaning (&#8220;to reveal a secret&#8221;), while spill the peas and spread the beans have only literal interpretations.
    Idiomatic combinations are also syntactically peculiar: most VNICs cannot undergo syntactic variations and at the same time retain their idiomatic interpretations.
    It is important, however, to note that VNICs differ with respect to the degree of syntactic flexibility they exhibit.
    Some are syntactically inflexible for the most part, while others are more versatile; as illustrated in 1 and 2: Linguists have explained the lexical and syntactic flexibility of idiomatic combinations in terms of their semantic analyzability (e.g., Glucksberg 1993; Fellbaum 1993; Nunberg et al. 1994).
    Semantic analyzability is inversely re
