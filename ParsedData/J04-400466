or recovering latent information in treebanks.
    The second half of that paper focused on a use of the Inside&#8211;Outside algorithm to reestimate the parameters of a model defined over an augmented tree space, where the observed data were considered to be the gold-standard labeled bracketings found in the treebank, and the hidden data were considered to be the headlexicalizations, one of the most notable tree augmentations performed by modern statistical parsers.
    These expectation maximization (EM) experiments were motivated by the desire to overcome the limitations imposed by the heuristics that have been heretofore used to perform head-lexicalization in treebanks.
    In particular, it appeared that the head rules used in Collins&#8217; parser had been tweaked specifically for the English Penn Treebank.
    Using EM would mean that very little effort would need to be spent on developing head rules, since EM could take an initial model that used simple heuristics and optimize it appropriately to maxi
