 of near analogies, in which case they can be solved using attributional similarity measures.
    We could score each candidate analogy by the average of the attributional similarity, sima, between A and C and between B and D: This kind of approach was used in two of the thirteen modules in Turney et al. (2003) (see Section 3.1).
    An example of a typical TOEFL question, from the collection of 80 questions.
    Stem: Levied To evaluate this approach, we applied several measures of attributional similarity to our collection of 374 SAT questions.
    The performance of the algorithms was measured by precision, recall, and F, defined as follows: Note that recall is the same as percent correct (for multiple-choice questions, with only zero or one guesses allowed per question, but not in general).
    Table 4 shows the experimental results for our set of 374 analogy questions.
    For example, using the algorithm of Hirst and St-Onge (1998), 120 questions were answered correctly, 224 incorrectly, and 30 question
