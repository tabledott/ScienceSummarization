alyses descriptions, and not merely directed acyclic graphs.
    The power of naming can be demonstrated most clearly by investigating some implications of the use of names i.e.
    (11.1) They sell ripe apples, pears, and cherries from local orchards.

    (11.2) They sell ripe cheese, bread, and cider from local orchards. for the representation of coordinate constructions, conjunction phenomena and the like.
    Coordinate constructions are infamous for being highly ambiguous given only syntactic constraints; standard techniques for parsing coordinate structures, e.g.
    [Woods 731, are highly combinatoric, and it would seem inherent in the phenomenon that tree-building parsers must do extensive search to build all syntactically possible analyses.
    (See, e.g. the analysis of (Church &amp; Patil 19821.)
    One widely-used approach which eliminates much of this seemingly inherent search is to use extensive semanti
