 nonce that the trees that are built by the program do not have the same granularity as the trees constructed by the analysts For example, the program treats units 13,14, and 15 as one elementary unit However, as we argue in (Marcie, 1997b), the corpus analysis on which our parser is built supports the observation that, in most cases, the global structure of the RS-tree is not affected by the inability of the rhetorical parser to uncover all clauses in a text &#8212; most of the clauses that are not uncovered are nuclei of Mir relations The summarization program takes the RS-tree produced by the rhetorical parser and selects the textual units that are most salient in that text If the aim of the program is to produce just a very short summary, only the salient units associated with the internal nodes found closer to the root are selected The longer the summary one wants to generate, the farther the selected salient units will be from the root In fact, one can see that the RS-trees built by the rhetoncal parser
