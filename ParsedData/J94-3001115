 surrounded by c:d and e:f. The second belongs because it contains an instance of a: g instead of a:b and thus imposes no requirements on the surrounding context.
    The string pair (cae, cbe) is not included, however, because a:b appears in a context not sanctioned by the rule.
    For strings to satisfy a constraint of this form, they must meet a more complicated set of conditions.
    Suppose that a corresponding substring belonging to A comes before a corresponding substring belonging to p, and that the lexical side of the paired substring that comes between them belongs to the domain of T. Then that intervening paired substring must itself belong to T. To illustrate, consider the surface coercion version of the context restriction example above: The string pair (cae,dbf) satisfies this constraint because a:b comes between the context substrings c:d and e:f. The pair (cbe,dbf) is also acceptable, because the string intervening between c:d and e:f does not have a on its lexical side.
    However, the pair
