reement score into accord with the agreement relation between the individual ranks r[1], ... , r[m]: Ranking models Pseudo-code for Good Grief training is shown in Figure 1.
    This training algorithm is based on PRanking (Crammer and Singer, 2001), an online perceptron algorithm.
    The training is performed by iteratively ranking each training input x and updating the model.
    If the predicted rank y&#65533; is equal to the true rank y, the weight and boundaries vectors remain unchanged.
    On the other hand, if y&#65533; =&#65533; y, then the weights and boundaries are updated to improve the prediction for x (step 4.c in Figure 1).
    See (Crammer and Singer, 2001) for explanation and analysis of this update rule.
    Our algorithm departs from PRanking by conjoining the updates for the m ranking models.
    We achieve this by using Good Grief decoding at each step throughout training.
    Our decoder H(x) (from equation 2) uses all the aspect component models ponent models are comparable.
