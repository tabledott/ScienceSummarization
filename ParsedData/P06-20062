istical parser as one which utilizes probabilistic parameters concerning lexical subcategorization and/or bilexical relations over tree configurations.
    Current lexicalized statistical parsers developed, trained and tested on PTB achieve a labelled Fl-score &#8211; the harmonic mean of labelled precision and recall &#8211; of around 90%.
    Klein and Manning (2003) argue that such results represent about 4% absolute improvement over a carefully constructed unlexicalized PCFGlike model trained and tested in the same manner.1 Gildea (2001) shows that WSJ-derived bilexical parameters in Collins&#8217; (1999) Model 1 parser contribute less than 1% to parse selection accuracy when test data is in the same domain, and yield no improvement for test data selected from the Brown Corpus.
    Bikel (2004) shows that, in Collins&#8217; (1999) Model 2, bilexical parameters contribute less than 0.5% to accuracy on in-domain data while lexical subcategorization-like parameters contribute just over 1%.
