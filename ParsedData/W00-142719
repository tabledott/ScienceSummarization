g, obtaining King's Arms.
    But, following the newspaper style guide, if the preceding word ends in s or z we have to 'reduce' the marker as in, for example, Stacey Edwards' skilful fingers.
    The generation of contractions presents more of a problem.
    For example, changing he will to he'll would make (4) more idiomatic.
    But there are cases where this type of contraction is not permissible.
    Since these cases seem to be dependent on syntactic context (see Section 4 below), and we have syntactic structure from the analysis phase, we are in a good position to make the correct choice.
    However, we have not yet tackled this issue and currently take the conservative approach of not contracting in any circumstances.
  
  
    We are following a well-established line of research into the use of finite-state techniques for lexical and shallow syntactic NLP tasks (e.g.
    Karttunen et al. (1996)).
    Lexical transducers have been used extensively for morphological analysis, and in theory a finite-st
