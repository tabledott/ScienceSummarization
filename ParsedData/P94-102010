to be estimated, supports computational efficiency, and provides an understanding of the data.
    The single biggest limitation remaining in this day of large memory, high speed computers results from reliance on asymptotic theory to describe the distribution of the maximum likelihood estimates and the likelihood ratio statistic.
    The effect of this reliance is felt most acutely when working with large sparse multinomials, which is exactly when this approach to model construction is most needed.
    When the data is sparse, the usual asymptotic properties of the distribution of the likelihood ratio statistic and the maximum likelihood estimates may not hold.
    In such cases, the fit of the model will appear to be too good, indicating that the model is in fact over constrained for the data available.
    In this work, we have limited ourselves to considering only those models with sufficient statistics that are not sparse, where the significance of the reference x2 is not unreasonable; most such models h
