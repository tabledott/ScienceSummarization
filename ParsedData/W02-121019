lative clause.
    We picked the topic relation for this purpose (following Kuno 1973).
    The topic relation is introduced into the semantics by the relative clause rule.
    As with main clause topics (which we also give a non-extraction analysis), we rely on downstream anaphora resolution to refine the relationship.
    For the most part, semantic representations and the syntax-semantic interface already worked out in the ERG were directly applicable to the Japanese grammar.
    In those cases where Japanese presented problems not yet encountered (or at least not yet tackled) in English, it was fairly straightforward to work out suitable MRS representations and means of building them up.
    Both of these points illustrate the cross-linguistic validity and practical utility of MRS representations.
  
  
    As Japanese written text does not have word segmentation, a preprocessing system is required.
    We integrated ChaSen (Asahara &amp; Matsumoto 2000), a tool that provides word segmentation as well as
