ues of than for higher values of )3. ing the a-skew divergence measure and those found using the MI-Based model.
    Optimal similarity (0.760 and 0.725 respectively) was found at -y = 0.0 and ,i3 = 0.0 for high frequency nouns and at -y = 0.25 and )3 = 0.0 for low frequency nouns.
    Further, similarity between the measures drops rapidly once ,i3 rises above 0.3.
  
  
    Using the MI-based model for precision and recall and with a parameter setting of -y = 1.0, the general framework for distributional similarity proposed herein closely approximates Lin's (1998) Measure.
    However, we have shown that using a much lower value of -y so that the combination of precision and recall is closer to a weighted arithmetic mean than a harmonic mean yields better results in the two application tasks considered here.
    This is because the relative importance of precision and recall can be tuned to the task at hand.
    Further, we have shown that pseudodisambiguation is a task which requires high precision neighbou
