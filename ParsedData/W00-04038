es above a predefined threshold in the documents that constitute the cluster.
    CIDR computes Count*IDF in an iterative fashion, updating its values as more articles are inserted in a given cluster.
    We hypothesize that sentences that contain the words from the centroid are more indicative of the topic of the cluster.
    2 The selection of Cluster E is due to an idea by the participants in the Novelty Detection Workshop, led by James Allan.
    MEAD decides which sentences to include in the extract by ranking them according to a set of parameters.
    The input to MEAD is a cluster of articles (e.g., extracted by CIDR) and a value for the compression rate r. For example, if the cluster contains a total of 50 sentences (n = 50) and the value of r is 20%, the output of MEAD will contain 10 sentences.
    Sentences are laid in the same order as they appear in the original documents with documents ordered chronologically.
    We benefit here from the time stamps associated with each document. where i (/ n)
