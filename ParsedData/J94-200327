at the centering rules and constraints and the notion of centering transition states have some cognitive reality (Brennan submitted; Hudson-DZmura 1988; Gor- don, Grosz, and Gilliom 1993; Hudson-DZmura and Tanenhaus, 1995).
  However, we make no claims about he cognitive reality of the centering algorithm that we discuss in Section 2.4.
  2.2 The Distinction between Continue and Retain This theory predicts preferences in the interpretation of utterances whose meaning depends on parameters from the discourse context.
  Thus if there are still multiple possibilities for interpretation after the application of all constraints and rules, the ordering on transitions applies, and CONTINUE interpretations are preferred (Rule 2).
  Indeed, many cases of the preference for one interpretation ver another follow directly from the distinction between the transition states of CONTINUE and RETAIN.
  Let us look at a simple example.
  In the discourse segment in 3, the zero in the second sentence is understood as referring
