rly, Cati + Cati+ I will be interpreted as an instruction to &amp;quot;append&amp;quot; the ith entry and i+ 1 th entry of the table.10 Let us consider a system where syntactic processing strictly precedes semantic and pragmatic processing.
    In such a system, how could we incorporate semantic and pragmatic heuristics once we have already parsed the input sentence and found that it was the sum of two Catalans?
    The parser can simply subtract the inappropriate interpretations.
    If the oracle says that &amp;quot;total&amp;quot; is a verb, then (16a) would be subtracted from the combined sum, and if the oracle says that &amp;quot;total&amp;quot; is a noun, then (16b) would be subtracted.
    On the other hand, our analysis is also useful in a system that interleaves syntactic processing with semantic and pragmatic processing.
    Suppose that we had a semantic routine that could disambiguate &amp;quot;total,&amp;quot; but only at a very high cost in execution time.
    We need a way to estimate the usefu
