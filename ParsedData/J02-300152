ion and either of the syntactic relations is redundant.
    As an experiment to see how much can be accomplished with as simple a system as possible, we constructed the minimal lattice of Figure 9, which includes just two distributions, along with a prior for the target word to be used as a last resort when no data are available.
    This structure assumes that head word and grammatical function are independent.
    It further makes no use of the voice feature.
    We chose the path feature as the representation of grammatical function in this case.
    This system classified 76.3% of frame elements correctly, indicating that one can obtain roughly nine-tenths the performance of the full system with a simple approach.
    (We will return to a similar system for the purposes of cross-domain experiments in Section 9.)
  
  
    In this section we examine the system&#8217;s performance on the task of locating the frame elements in a sentence.
    Although our probability model considers the question of finding t
