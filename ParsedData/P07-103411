zed according to the target domain distribution pt(x, y).
    The exact objective function is thus Our idea of domain adaptation is to exploit the labeled instances in the source domain to help obtain B&#65533; t .
    Let Ds = {(xsi, ysi )}Ns i=1 denote the set of labeled instances we have from the source domain.
    Assume that we have a (small) set of labeled and a (large) set of unlabeled instances from the target domain, denoted by Dt,l = {(xt,l k=1 , respectively.
    We now show three ways to approximate the objective function above, corresponding to using three different sets of instances to approximate the instance space X.
    Using Ds: Using ps(y|x) to approximate pt(y|x), we obtain Here we use only the labeled instances in Ds but we adjust the weight of each instance by pt(x) ps(x).
    The major difficulty is how to accurately estimate pt(x) Note that this is the standard supervised learning method using only the small amount of labeled target instances.
    The major weakness of this approximati
