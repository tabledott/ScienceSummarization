    How can a language learner sort out the grammatical from the ungrammatical strings?
    (The non-fluencies of speech are of course but one aspect of the degeneracy of input that makes language acquisition a puzzle.)
    The self-correction system I have described suggests that many non-fluent strings can be resolved with little detailed linguistic knowledge.
    As Table 1 shows, about a quarter of the editing signals result in expunction of only non-linguistic material.
    This requires only an ability to distinguish linguistic from nonlinguistic stuff, and it introduces the idea that edit signals signal an expunction site.
    Almost a third are resolved by the Surface Copying rule, which can be viewed s
