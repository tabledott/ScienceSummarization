    Further feature types are derived using the method of Kamps and Marx (2002) of using WordNet relationships to derive three values pertinent to the emotive meaning of adjectives.
    The three values correspond to the potency (strong or weak), activity (active or passive) and the evaluative (good or bad) factors introduced in Charles Osgood&#8217;s Theory of Semantic Differentiation (Osgood et al., 1957).
    These values are derived by measuring the relative minimal path length (MPL) in WordNet between the adjective in question and the pair of words appropriate for the given factor.
    In the case of the evaluative factor (EVA) for example, the comparison is between the MPL between the adjective and &#8220;good&#8221; and the MPL between the adjective and &#8220;bad&#8221;.
    Only adjectives connected by synonymy to each of the opposites are considered.
    The method results in a list of 5410 adjectives, each of which is given a value for each of the three factors referred to as EVA, POT, and
