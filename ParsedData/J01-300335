    For example, for the simple sets of characters above, the ratio would be 3/5, yielding a value of .60 for the CAUS feature. manual determination of the animacy of extracted subjects, or reference to an on-line resource such as WordNet for determining animacy.
    To approximate animacy with a feature that can be extracted automatically, and without reference to a resource external to the corpus, we take advantage of the well-attested animacy hierarchy, according to which pronouns are the most animate (Silverstein 1976; Dixon 1994).

    After eliminating repetitions, 94 occurrences we
