 between clusters CK and C1 and DLI is similarly defined for clusters CL and C1.
    This is simply the average number of mismatches between each component of the new cluster and the existing cluster.
    Unlike Ward's method, McQuitty's method makes no assumptions concerning the distribution of the data sample.
  
  
    The expectation maximization algorithm (Dempster, Laird, and Rubin, 1977), commonly known as the EM algorithm, is an iterative estimation procedure in which a problem with missing data is recast to make use of complete data estimation techniques.
    In our work, the sense of an ambiguous word is represented by a feature whose value is missing.
    In order to use the EM algorithm, the parametric form of the model representing the data must be known.
    In these experiments, we assume that the model form is the Naive Bayes (Duda and Hart, 1973).
    In this model, all features are conditionally independent given the value of the classification feature, i.e., the sense of the ambiguous word.
