such as information extraction and retrieval, has also been demonstrated (Miyao et al. 2006; Yakushiji et al.
    2006; Chun 2007).
    From our extensive investigation of HPSG parsing, we observed that exploration of new types of features is indispensable to further improvement of parsing accuracy.
    A possible research direction is to encode larger contexts of parse trees, which has been shown to improve accuracy (Toutanova and Manning 2002; Toutanova, Markova, and Manning 2004).
    Future work includes not only the investigation of these features but also the abstraction of predicate&#8211;argument dependencies using semantic classes.
    Experimental results also suggest that an improvement in grammar coverage is crucial for higher accuracy.
    This indicates that an improvement in the quality of the grammar is a key factor for the improvement of parsing accuracy.
    The feature forest model provides new insight into the relationship between a linguistic structure and a unit of probability.
