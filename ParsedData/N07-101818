			As stated in the introduction, the primary contribu tion of this paper is introducing MCMC methods for Bayesian inference to computational linguistics.
			Bayesian inference using MCMC is a technique of generic utility, much like Expectation-Maximizationand other general inference techniques, and we be lieve that it belongs in every computational linguist?s toolbox alongside these other techniques.Inferring a PCFG to describe the syntactic structure of a natural language is an obvi ous application of grammar inference techniques,and it is well-known that PCFG inference us ing maximum-likelihood techniques such as theInside-Outside (IO) algorithm, a dynamic program ming Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm for PCFGs, performs extremely p
