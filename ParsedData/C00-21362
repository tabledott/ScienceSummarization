  The fundamental problem we face in port- ing an extraction system to a new scenario is to identify the many ways in which intbrmation about a type of event may be expressed in the text;.
  Typically, there will be a few common tbrms of expression which will quickly come to nfind when a system is being developed.
  How- ever, the beauty of natural language (and the challenge tbr computational linguists) is that there are many variants which an imaginative writer cast use, and which the system needs to capture.
  Finding these variants may involve studying very large amounts of text; in the sub- ject domain.
  This has been a major impediment to the portability and performance of event ex- traction systems.
  We present; in this paper a new approach to finding these variants automatically flom a large corpus, without the need to read or amLo- tate the corpus.
  This approach as been evalu- ated on actual event extraction scenarios.
