    Many words are ambiguous in their part of speech.
    For example, &amp;quot;tag&amp;quot; can be a noun or a verb.
    However, when a word appears in the context of other words, the ambiguity is often reduced: in &amp;quot;a tag is a part-of-speech label,&amp;quot; the word &amp;quot;tag&amp;quot; can only be a noun.
