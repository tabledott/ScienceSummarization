orpus tokens.
    It is worth noting that, as would be expected, the observed distribution is highly Zipfian (Zipf 1935).
    Differences in evaluation corpora makes comparison difficult.
    However, some idea of the difficulty of WSD can be gained by calculating properties of the evaluation corpus.
    Gale, Church, and Yarowsky (1992a) suggest that the lowest level of performance which can be reasonably expected from a WSD system is that achieved by assigning the most likely sense in all cases.
    Since the first sense in LDOCE is usually the most frequent, we calculate this baseline figure using a heuristic which assumes the first sense is always correct.
    This is the same baseline heuristic we used for the experiments reported in Section 3, although those were for the homograph level.
    We applied the naive heuristic of always choosing the first sense in our corpus and found that 30.9% of senses were correctly disambiguated.
    Another measure that gives insight into an evaluation corpus is to cou
