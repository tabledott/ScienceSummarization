   In order to test the performance of the estimation method, a pseudo-disambiguation task is used, together with two alternative estimation methods.
    Each method uses a different generalization procedure; the first alternative uses the minimum description length principle, and the second uses Resnik&#8217;s measure of selectional preference.
    In addition, the performance of our method is investigated using both the standard Pearson chisquare statistic and the log-likelihood chi-square statistic.
  
  
    This article concerns the problem of how to estimate the probabilities of noun senses appearing as particular arguments of predicates.
    Such probabilities can be useful for a variety of natural language processing (NLP) tasks, such as structural disambiguation and statistical parsing, word sense disambiguation, anaphora resolution, and language modeling.
    To see how such knowledge can be used to resolve structural ambiguities, consider the following prepositional phrase attachment ambiguity: Fre
