.6 52.4 Yes 62.8 45.6 50.3 particularly a problem for the Verbmobil task, where the word order of the German- English sentence pair can be quite different.
    As a result, the word order of the automatically generated target sentence can be different from that of the target sentence, but nevertheless acceptable so that the WER measure alone could be misleading.
    In order to overcome this problem, we introduce as additional measure the positionindependent word error rate (PER).
    This measure compares the words in the two senthe word order into account.
    Words that have no matching counterparts are counted as substitution errors.
    Depending on whether the translated sentence is longer or shorter than the target translation, the remaining words result in either insertion or deletion errors in addition to substitution errors.
    The PER is guaranteed to be less than or equal to the WER.
