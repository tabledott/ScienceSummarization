s x 3 language models).
    Finally, the Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level score was included as a feature that captures both syntactic and semantic text properties.
    The Flesch-Kincaid formula estimates readability as a combination of the the average number of syllables per word and the average number of words per sentence: We also enriched Schwarm and Ostendorf&#8217;s (2005) feature space with coherencebased features.
    Each document was represented as a feature vector using the entity transition notation introduced in Section 3.
    We experimented with two models that yielded good performances in our previous experiments: Coreference+Syntax+Salience+ (see Experiment 1) and Coreference&#8722;Syntax+Salience+ (see Experiment 2).
    The transition length was &#8804;2 and entities were considered salient if they occurred &#8805;2 times.
    As in our previous experiments, we compared the entity-based representation against LSA.
    The latter is a measure of the semantic relatedness across pairs of sentences.
