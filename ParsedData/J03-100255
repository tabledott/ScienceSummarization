    For example, when performing a move aj := i, it is necessary to Similar updates have to be performed after a swap.
    In the count collection (step 3), it is possible to use the same matrices as obtained in the last hill-climbing step.
    By restricting in this way the number of matrix entries that need to be updated, it is possible to reduce the number of operations in hill climbing by about one order of magnitude.
    The straightforward algorithm given for performing the count collection has the disadvantage of requiring that all alignments in the neighborhood of alignment a be enumerated explicitly.
    In addition, it is necessary to perform a loop over all targets and a loop over all source positions to update the lexicon/alignment and the fertility counts.
    To perform the count collection in an efficient way, we use the fact that the alignments in the neighborhood N(a) are very similar.
    This allows the sharing of many operations in the count collection process.
