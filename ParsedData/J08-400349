Because &#8710;(p &#8722; 1) &#8804; q, we can use the inductive hypothesis to infer &#928;(p &#8722; 1, k, j) and, from this, &#928;(p, k,j).
    Moreover, because there has to be an earlier configuration cp&#8722;r (r &lt; &#8710;(p)) such that cp&#8722;r = (&#955;1|i, &#955;21, k|&#946;, Acp&#8722;r) and &#8710;(p &#8722; r) &#8804; q, we can use the inductive hypothesis again to infer &#928;(p &#8722; r, i, k) and &#928;(p, i, k).
    &#928;(p, i, k), &#928;(p, k,j), and (j, l, k) &#8712; Acp together entail &#928;(p, i, j).
    Case 2: If the transition tp = NO-ARCp, then there is a node k such that i &lt; k &lt; j, (i, l, k) &#8712; Acp, cp&#8722;1 = (&#955;1|i|k, &#955;2, j|&#946;, Acp ), and cp = (&#955;1|i, k|&#955;2, j|&#946;, Acp ).
    Because &#8710;(p &#8722; 1) &#8804; q, we can again use the inductive hypothesis to infer &#928;(p &#8722; 1, k, j) and &#928;(p, k, j).
    Moreover, there must be an earlier configuration cp&#8722;r (r &lt; &#8710;(p)) such that cp&#8722;r = (&#955;1|i,&#955;21,k
