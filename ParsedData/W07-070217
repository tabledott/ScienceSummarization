eliability of the predictions of the sequence models is impaired due to sparse counts.

			BLUE scores for Dutch-English models which apply CCG supertag sequence models of varying orders In Table 3 we can see that the optimal order for the CCG supertag sequence models is 5.
			4.5 Language Model vs. Supertags.
			The language model makes a great contribution to the correct order of the words in the target sentence.
			In this experiment we investigate whether by using astronger language model the contribution of the sequence model will no longer be relevant.
			The relative contribution of the language mode and different sequence models is investigated for different lan guage model n-gram lengths.
