t in a single grammar.
    Second, having a set ofwide-coverage HPSGs with fairly standardized fundamentals could prove interesting for research on stochastic processing and disambiguation, especially if the languages differ in gross typological features such as word order.
    Finally, there are also computational issues involved in how the grammar matrix would evolve over time as it is used in new grammars.
    The matrix enables the developer of a grammar for a new language to get a quick start on producing a system that parses and generates with non-trivial semantics, while also building the foundation for a widecoverage grammar of the language.
    But the matrix itself may well change in parallel with the development of the grammar for a particular language, so appropriate mechanisms must be developed to support the merging of enhancements to both.
    There is also practical industrial benefit to this project.
    Companies that are consumers of these grammars benefit when grammars of multiple language
