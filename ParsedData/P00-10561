    We discuss here the IBM translation models IBM-1 to IBM-5 (Brown et al., 1993b) and the Hidden-Markov alignment model (Vogel et al., 1996; Och and Ney, 2000).
    The different alignment models we present provide different decompositions of Pr(fil ,41e{).
    An alignment &#226; for which holds = arg max Pr(fil for a specific model is called Viterbi alignment of this model.
    So far, no well established evaluation criterion exists in the literature for these alignment models.
    For various reasons (nonunique reference translation, over-fitting and statistically deficient models) it seems hard to use training/test perplexity as in language modeling.
    Using translation quality is problematic, as translation quality is not well defined and as there are additional influences such as language model or decoder properties.
    We propose in this paper to measure the quality of an alignment model using the quality of the Viterbi alignment compared to a manually prod
