e pcsltlous (using as a source representation a full semantic representa- tion of the text or reducing l t to  a simple frequency table), we deal m tins paper wttb the issue of pro- ducmg a summary from an arbitrary text without re- qmrmg zts full understanding, but using wtdely avad- able knowledge sources Our mare goal is therefore to find a middle ground for source representation, rich enough to braid quality indicative summaries, but easy enough to extract from the source text to work on arbltrary text Over-slmphficatlon can harm the quahty of the source representation As a trivial illustration, con- sider the following two sequences ?
  1 "Dr Kenny has sn~ented an anesthetsc maehsne Thss devwe controls the rate at wh:ch an ana- esthctsc ss pumped into the blood" 2 "Dr Kenny has :nvented an anesthet:c machsne The Doctor spent wo years on thu research" ~Dr Kenny ~ appears once m both sequences and I0 I I I I i I II II I !
