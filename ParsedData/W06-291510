    NB models have been widely used for various classification tasks, including text categorization (Lewis, 1998).
    The NB model is also a building block for the model described later that incorporates sentence-level perspective information.
    To predict the perspective of an unseen document using naive Bayes , we calculate the posterior distribution of D in (5) by integrating out the parameters, However, the above integral is difficult to compute.
    As an alternative, we use Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods to obtain samples from the posterior distribution.
    Details about MCMC methods can be found in Appendix A.
    We introduce a new binary random variable, S, to model how strongly a perspective is reflected at the sentence level.
    The value of S is either s1 or s0, where s1 indicates a sentence is written strongly from a perspective while s0 indicates it is not.
    The whole generative process is modeled as follows: The parameters &#960; and &#952; have the same semantics as in th
