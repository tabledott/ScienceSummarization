ncy parsers, phrase structrue parsers, and machine translation.
	
	
			Highly accurate dependency parsers have high de mands on resources and long parsing times.
			The training of a parser frequently takes several days and the parsing of a sentence can take on averageup to a minute.
			The parsing time usage is impor tant for many applications.
			For instance, dialog systems only have a few hundred milliseconds toanalyze a sentence and machine translation sys tems, have to consider in that time some thousandtranslation alternatives for the translation of a sen tence.
			Parsing and training times can be improved by methods that maintain the accuracy level, or methods that trade accuracy against better parsing times.
			Software developers and researchers areusually unwilling to reduce the quality of their ap plications.
			Consequently, we have to consider atfirst methods to improve a parser, which do not in volve an accuracy loss, such as faster algorithms,faster implementation of algorithms, parallel al g
