ncy is the total number of words, and baseline precision is the proportion of words in subjective elements.
    Words and phrases with higher proportions than this appear more than expected in opinion pieces.
    To further evaluate the quality of a set of PSEs, we also perform the following significance test.
    For a set of PSEs in a given data set, we test the significance of the difference between (1) the proportion of words in opinion pieces that are PSEs and (2) the proportion of words in nonopinion pieces that are PSEs, using the z-significance test for two proportions.
    Before we continue, there are a few more technical items to mention concerning the data preparation and experimental design: In this section, we show that low-frequency words are associated with subjectivity in both the subjective-element and opinion piece data.
    Apparently, people are creative when they are being opinionated.
    Table 2 gives results for unique words in subjective-element data.
    Recall that unique words are
