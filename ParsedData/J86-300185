liary stack (including FSBill) are returned to the main stack.
    Note, however, that this model does not preclude the possibility of a return to some space between FSA and FSB before popping the auxiliary stack.
    Whether there are discourses that include such a return and are deemed coherent is an open question.
    The auxiliary stack model differs from the other two models by the references permitted and by the spaces that can be popped to.
    Given the initial configuration in Figure 9, if the segment with DSPABc were normally embedded, FSABc would just be added to the top of the stack.
    If it were a true interruption, the space would also 'be added to the stack, but with an impenetrable boundary between it and FSBili.
    In the normal stack model, entities in the spaces lower in the stack would be accessible; in the true interruption they would not.
    In either of these two models, however, FSBill would be the space returned to first.
    The auxiliary stack model is obviously more complicated
