i is a capitalized word and false otherwise.
    These flags are added to the contextual probability distributions.
    Instead of and equations (3) to (5) are updated accordingly.
    This is equivalent to doubling the size of the tagset and using different tags depending on capitalization.
    The processing time of the Viterbi algorithm (Rabiner, 1989) can be reduced by introducing a beam search.
    Each state that receives a 6 value smaller than the largest 6 divided by some threshold value 0 is excluded from further processing.
    While the Viterbi algorithm is guaranteed to find the sequence of states with the highest probability, this is no longer true when beam search is added.
    Nevertheless, for practical purposes and the right choice of 0, there is virtually no difference between the algorithm with and without a beam.
    Empirically, a value of 0 = 1000 turned out to approximately double the speed of the tagger without affecting the accuracy.
    The tagger currently tags between 30,000 and 60
