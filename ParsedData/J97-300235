ng, sentence (7) is bracketed as follows: (8) [R[The/e Authority/t] [will/14f, ([be/&#8364; accountable/RN] [to the/e [e/lit] [Financial/k&amp; Secretary/151 111)11] ./. ]
    Flattening the Bracketing.
    In the worst case, both sentences might have perfectly aligned words, lending no discriminative leverage whatsoever to the bracketer.
    This leaves a very large number of choices: if both sentences are of length 1, then there are (2/1)/&#247;, possible bracketings with rank 2, none of which is better justified than any other.
    Thus to improve accuracy, we should reduce the specificity of the bracketing's commitment in such cases.
    An inconvenient problem with ambiguity arises in the simple bracketing grammar above, illustrated by Figure 9; there is no justification for preferring either (a) or (b) over the other.
    In general the problem is that both the straight and inverted concatenation operations are associative.
    That is, [A[AA]] and [[AA]A] generate the same two output strings, which are
