  The least npper bound of these approximations (which will give the least fixed-point) corresponds to the reqnired cyclic structure, ;is desired.
  4 Conc lus ions  and  }~Nl~ure Work We have shown a method of embedding TAGs in a feature structmm based framewo?k.
  This system takes advantage of the extended omain of locality of TAGs and allows lingusitic statements abont cooccurencc of features of dependent i errLs to be stated within elententary trees.
  We have shown thst we can make a clearer statement of adjoining constraints in FTAGa than in TAGs.
  The specification of local constraints in a tAG is by enmneration, which is not satisfactory from the liuguistic point of view.
  We show that in FTAG, we em~ avoid such specilications, instead the dedarative statements nrade about nodes are sufficient o mmure Ihat only the appropriate flees get adjoined at a node.
  Furthermore, we also illu.strate how duplication or iuformation can be
