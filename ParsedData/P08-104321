ve two goals.
    Our primary goal is to exploit the resources that are most appropriate for the task at hand, and our secondary goal is to allow for comparison of our models&#8217; performance against previously reported results.
    When a comparison against previous results requires additional pre-processing, we state it explicitly to allow for the reader to replicate the reported results.
    Data We use the Hebrew Treebank, (Sima&#8217;an et al., 2001), provided by the knowledge center for processing Hebrew, in which sentences from the daily newspaper &#8220;Ha&#8217;aretz&#8221; are morphologically segmented and syntactically annotated.
    The treebank has two versions, v1.0 and v2.0, containing 5001 and 6501 sentences respectively.
    We use v1.0 mainly because previous studies on joint inference reported results w.r.t. v1.0 only.5 We expect that using the same setup on v2.0 will allow a crosstreebank comparison.6 We used the first 500 sentences as our dev set and the rest 4500 for training and repor
