    On the other hand, if we are correct and interest is a relatively difficult word, then it is possible that we have made some progress over the past thirty years...

    We will estimate the lower bound by evaluating the performance of a straw man system, which ignores context and simply assigns the most likely sense in all cases.
    One might hope that reasonable systems should generally seven or eight of them have only one rendering) to some eighty (which would be the number of renderings on the assumption that sixteen words are uniquely rendered and four have three renderings a
