ms with which to characterize the relations' goals/constraints.
    Though the formalization can never be completely finalized &#8212; who can hope to represent something like motivation or justification complete with all ramifications?
    &#8212; the hope is that, by having the requirements stated in rather basic terms, the relations will be easily adaptable to any new representation scheme and domain.

    In addition, the availability of a set of communicative goals more detailed than just say or ask (for example), should make it easier for programs that require output text to interface with the generator.
    This is one focus of current text planning work at ISI.
