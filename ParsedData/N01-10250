  Chunking With Support Vector Machines
  
    We apply Support Vector Machines (SVMs) to identify English base phrases (chunks).
    SVMs are known to achieve high generalization performance even with input data of high dimensional feature spaces.
    Furthermore, by the Kernel principle, SVMs can carry out training with smaller computational overhead independent of their dimensionality.
    We apply weighted voting of 8 SVMsbased systems trained with distinct chunk representations.
    Experimental results show that our approach achieves higher accuracy than previous approaches.
  
  
    Chunking is recognized as series of processes &#8212; first identifying proper chunks from a sequence of tokens (such as words), and second classifying these chunks into some grammatical classes.
    Various NLP tasks can be seen as a chunking task.
    Examples include English base noun phrase identification (base NP chunking), English base phrase identification (chunking), Japanese chunk (bunsetsu) identification and na
