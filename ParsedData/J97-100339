in the first and last words of the chain.
    Since the Morris and Hirst (1991) algorithm attempts to discover attentional/intentional structure, its goals are different than those of TextTiling.
    Specifically, the discourse structure it attempts to discover is hierarchical and more fine-grained than that discussed here.
    Morris (1988) provides five short example texts for which she has determined the intentional structure, and states that the lexical chains generated by her algorithm provide a good indication of the segment boundaries that Grosz and Sidner's theory assumes.
    In Morris (1988) and Morris and Hirst (1991), tables are presented showing the sentences spanned by the lexical chains and by the corresponding segments of the attentional/intentional structure (derived by hand), but no formal evaluation is performed.
    This algorithm is not directly applicable for TextTiling for several reasons.
    First, many words are ambiguous and fall into more than one thesaurus class.
    This is not s
