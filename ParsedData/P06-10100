  Named Entity Transliteration With Comparable Corpora
  
    In this paper we investigate Chinesename transliteration using compacorpora where texts in the two languages deal in some of the same topics &#8212; and therefore share references to named entities &#8212; but are not translations of each other.
    We present two distinct methods for transliteration, one approach using phonetic transliteration, and the second using the temporal distribution of candidate pairs.
    Each of these approaches works quite well, but by combining the approaches one can achieve even better results.
    We then propose a novel score propagation method that utilizes the co-occurrence of transliteration pairs within document pairs.
    This propagation method achieves further improvement over the best results from the previous step.
  
  
    As part of a more general project on multilingual named entity identification, we are interested in the problem of name transliteration across languages that use different scripts.
