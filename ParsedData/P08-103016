us after expert adjudication, a human annotator tends to make more mistakes in trigger classification.
    For example it&#8217;s hard to decide whether &#8220;named&#8221; represents a &#8220;Personnel_Nominate&#8221; or &#8220;Personnel_Start-Position&#8221; event mention; &#8220;hacked to death&#8221; represents a &#8220;Life_Die&#8221; or &#8220;Conflict_Attack&#8221; event mention without following more specific annotation guidelines.
  
  
    The trigger labeling task described in this paper is in part a task of word sense disambiguation (WSD), so we have used the idea of sense consistency introduced in (Yarowsky, 1995), extending it to operate across related documents.
    Almost all the current event extraction systems focus on processing single documents and, except for coreference resolution, operate a sentence at a time (Grishman et al., 2005; Ahn, 2006; Hardy et al., 2006).
    We share the view of using global inference to improve event extraction with some recent research.
