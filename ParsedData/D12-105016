txtdyn = {(l(dyn) Each context (l,v) again constitutes a vector dimension.
    The dimensionality varies strongly depending on the selection of words, but if n does not exceed 4, the dimensionality |ctxtdyn |will typically be substantial enough.
    In this approach, each word&#8217;s vector consists of the values c found along with that word and its context in the tensor.
    In our experiments we compose word vectors to create representations for phrase vectors and sentence vectors.
    The phrases we are interested in consist of two words each: an adjective and a noun like black hair, a compound noun made up of two nouns such as oil industry, or a verbal phrase with a transitive verb and an object noun, e.g., pour tea.
    Conceiving of a phrase phr = (w1,w2) as a binary tuple of words, we obtain its vector from its words&#8217; vectors either by addition: In the same way we acquire a vector senVeci representing a sentence Seni = (w(i) ni ) from the vectors for w1,...,wni.
    We simply sum the existing wo
