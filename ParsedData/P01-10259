P ends up on rank (and thus increases the precision of the -best list) or on rank .
    The -best lists for AMs with low precision values ( ,) contain a particularly small number of TPs.
    Therefore, they are more susceptible to random variation, which illustrates that evaluation based on a small number of -best candidate pairs cannot be reliable.
    With respect to the recall curves (Figures 3 and 4), we find: (i) Examination of 50% of the data in the SLs leads to identification of between 75% (AdjN) and 80% (PNV) of the TPs.
    (ii) For the first 40% of the SLs, and lead to the worst results, with outperforming .
    Examining the precision and recall graphs in more detail, we find that for the AdjN data (Figure 1), log-likelihood and t-test lead to the best results, with log-likelihood giving an overall better result than the t-test.
    The picture differs slightly for the PNV data (Figure 2).
    Here t-test outperforms log-likelihood, and even precision gained by frequency is better than or at least
