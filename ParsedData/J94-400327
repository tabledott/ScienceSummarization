on, since the counts we have, n,, from which we estimate the probabilities of the T, values, count actual occurrences of single syntactic tuples.
    In other words, we count the number of times that each of T1 and T2 actually occur, not the number of times in which each of them could occur.
    Two additional assumptions are introduced by using counts of the occurrences of syntactic tuples of the target language in order to estimate the translation probabilities of source language tuples:
  
  
    An occurrence of the source language syntactic tuple T can indeed be translated to one of Th .
    &#8226; &#8226; Tk.
    Assumption 3 Every occurrence of the target tuple T, can be the translation of only the source tuple T. Assumption 2 is an assumption on the completeness of the linguistic model.
    It is rather reasonable and depends on the completeness of our bilingual lexicon: if the lexicon gives all possible translations of each ambiguous word, then this assumption will hold, since for each syntactic tup
