olation and a local model is trained to maximize the conditional likelihood over the training data of that node.
    At test time, the sequence with the highest product of local conditional scores is calculated and returned.
    We can always find the exact maximizing sequence, but only in the case of an acyclic net is it guaranteed to be the maximum likelihood sequence.
  
  
    The part of speech tagged data used in our experiments is the Wall Street Journal data from Penn Treebank III (Marcus et al., 1994).
    We extracted tagged sentences from the parse trees.5 We split the data into training, development, and test sets as in (Collins, 2002).
    Table 1 lists characteristics of the three splits.6 Except where indicated for the model BEST, all results are on the development set.
    One innovation in our reporting of results is that we present whole-sentence accuracy numbers as well as the traditional per-tag accuracy measure (over all tokens, even unambiguous ones).
    This is the quantity that most s
