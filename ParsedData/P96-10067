 This test example is then compared to every training example.
    The sense of word w in the test example is the sense of w in the closest matching training example, where there is a precise, computational definition of &amp;quot;closest match&amp;quot; as explained later.
    The first step of the algorithm is to extract a set F of features such that each sentence containing an occurrence of iv will form a training example supplying the necessary values for the set F of features.
    Specifically, LEXAS uses the following set of features to form a training example: L3, L2, L1, R1, R2, R3, M, Ki, &#8226; &#8226; &#8226; , Km, C1, &#8226; &#8226; &#8226; C9, V The value of feature Li is the part of speech (POS) of the word i-th position to the left of w. The value of Ri is the POS of the word i-th position to the right of w. Feature M denotes the morphological form of w in the sentence s. For a noun, the value for this feature is either singular or plural; for a verb, the value is one of infinitive (as in the
