rchical phrase reordering model (Galley and Manning, 2008) was proposed to dynamically determine phrase boundaries using efficient shift-reduce parsing.
    Along this line of research, discriminative reordering models based on a maximum entropy classifier (Zens and Ney, 2006; Xiong, et.al., 2006) also showed improvements over the distance based distortion model.
    None of these reordering models changes the word alignment step in SMT systems, therefore, they can not recover from the word alignment errors.
    These models are also limited by a maximum allowed reordering distance often used in decoding.
    The second class of approaches puts syntactic analysis of the target language into both modeling and decoding.
    It has been shown that direct modeling of target language constituents movement in either constituency trees (Yamada and Knight, 2001; Galley et.al., 2006; Zollmann et.al., 2008) or dependency trees (Quirk, et.al., 2005) can result in significant improvements in translation quality for trans
