  Identifying Agreement And Disagreement In Conversational Speech: Use Of Bayesian Networks To Model Pragmatic Dependencies
  
    We describe a statistical approach for modeling agreements and disagreements in conversational interaction.
    Our approach first identifies adjacency pairs using maximum entropy ranking based on a set of lexical, durational, and structural features that look both forward and backward in the discourse.
    We then classify utterances as agreement or disagreement using these adjacency pairs and features that represent various pragmatic influences of previous agreement or disagreement on the current utterance.
    Our approach achieves 86.9% accuracy, a 4.9% increase over previous work.
  
  
    One of the main features of meetings is the occurrence of agreement and disagreement among participants.
    Often meetings include long stretches of controversial discussion before some consensus decision is reached.
    Our ultimate goal is automated summarization of multi-participant m
