did show that this approach makes it possible to achieve percentage agreement of around 95.5%.
    An alternative approach has been to address the problem of the inability of naive coders to make fine-grained distinctions by introducing coarser-grained classification schemes which group together dictionary senses (Bruce and Wiebe, 1998; Buitelaar 1998; V&#180;eronis 1998; Palmer, Dang, and Fellbaum 2007).
    Hierarchical tagsets were also developed, such as HECTOR (Atkins 1992) or, indeed, WordNet itself (where senses are related by hyponymy links).
    In the case of Buitelaar and Palmer, Dang, and Fellbaum, the &#8220;supersenses&#8221; were identified by hand, whereas Bruce and Wiebe and V&#180;eronis used clustering methods such as those from Bruce and Wiebe (1999) to collapse some of the initial sense distinctions.9 Palmer, Dang, and Fellbaum (2007) illustrate this practice with the example of the verb call, which has 28 fine-grained senses in WordNet 1.7: They conflate these senses into a small number
