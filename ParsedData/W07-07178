ear weight, but the weights on the components do not participate in the global loglinear combination.
    One consequence is that it is more difficult to set linear weights using standard minimum-error training techniques, which assume only a &#8220;flat&#8221; loglinear model.
    We used four standard distance metrics to capture the relation between the current source or target text q and each corpus component.1 All are monolingual&#8212;they are applied only to source text or only to target text.
    The tf/idf metric commonly used in information retrieval is defined as cos(vc, vq), where vr and vq are vectors derived from component c and document q, each consisting of elements of the form: &#8722;p(w)log pdoc(w), where p(w) is the relative frequency of word w within the component or document, and pdoc(w) is the proportion of components it appears in.
    Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) (Deerwester et al., 1990) is a technique for implicitly capturing the semantic properties of texts, based on the use of Si
