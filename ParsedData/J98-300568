    Finally, the structure of the template representation is somewhat shallow, being closer to a database record than a knowledge representation.
    This means that the generator's knowledge of different features of the event and relations between them is somewhat shallow.
    One of the more important current goals is to increase coverage of the system by providing interfaces to a large number of on-line sources of news.
    We would ideally want to build a comprehensive and shareable database of profiles that can be queried over the World-Wide Web.
    The database will have a defined interface that will allow for systems such as SUMMONS to connect to it.
    Another goal of our research is the generation of evolving summaries that continuously update the user on a given topic of interest.
    In that case, the system will have a model containing all prior interaction with the user.
    To avoid repetitiveness, such a system will have to resort to using different descriptions (as well as referring expressi
