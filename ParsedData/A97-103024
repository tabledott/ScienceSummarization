    Thus, Washington is likely to co-occur with either President Washington or Washington, D.C., but not with both.
    Indeed, we have observed that if several unambiguous variants do co-occur, as in documents that mention both the owner of a company and the company named after the owner, the editors refrain from using a variant that is ambiguous with respect to both.
    To disambiguate highly ambiguous variants then, we link them to unambiguous ones occurring within the same document.
    Nominator cycles through the list of names, identifying 'anchors', or variant names that unambiguously refer to certain entity types.
    When an anchor is identified, the list of name candidates is scanned for ambiguous variants that could refer to the same entity.
    They are linked to the anchor.
    Our measure of ambiguity is very pragmatic.
    It is based on the confidence scores yielded by heuristics that analyze a name and determine the entity types it can refer to.
    If the heuristic for a certain entity
