d they serve as a gold standard for developing a probabilistic classifier.
    Using bias-corrected tags as gold-standard tags is one way to define a single best tag when there are multiple judges who disagree.
    The coding manual and data from our experiments are available at: hap: / /www.cs.nmsu.edur wiebe/projects.
    In the remainder of this paper, we describe the classification being performed (in section 2), the statistical tools used to analyze the data and produce the bias-corrected tags (in section 3), the case study of improving intercoder agreement (in section 4), and the results of the classifier for automatic subjectivity tagging (in section 5).
  
  
    We address evidentiality in text (Chafe, 1986), which concerns issues such as what is the source of information, and whether information is being presented as fact or opinion.
    These questions are particularly important in news reporting, in which segments presenting opinions and verbal reactions are mixed with segments presenting objectiv
