g corpus with likelihoods equal to their relative frequencies in that corpus.
    Thus the location and labeling on the nonroot nonterminal nodes determine how a PCFG induced from a treebank generalizes from that training data.
    Generally, one might expect that the fewer the nodes in the training corpus trees, the weaker the independence assumptions in the induced language model.
    For this reason, a &amp;quot;flat&amp;quot; tree representation of PP modification is investigated here as well.
    A second method of relaxing the independence assumptions implicit in a PCFG is to encode more information in each node's label.
    Here the intuition is that the label on a node is a &amp;quot;communication channel&amp;quot; that conveys information between the subtree dominated by the node and the part of the tree not dominated by this node, so all other things being equal, appending to the node's label additional information about the context in which the node appears should make the independence assumptions
