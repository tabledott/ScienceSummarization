The first rules created were the results of informed intuition (Greene and Rubin (1972), p. 32).
    1.3 CLAWS Marshall (1983, p. 139) describes the LOB Corpus tagging algorithm, later named CLAWS (Booth (1985)), as &amp;quot;similar to those employed in the TAGGIT program&amp;quot;.
    The tag set used is very similar, but somewhat larger, at about 130 tags.
    The dictionary used is derived from the tagged Brown Corpus, rather than from the untagged.
    It contains 7000 rather than 3000 entries, and 700 rather than 450 suffixes.
    CLAWS treats plural, possessive, and hyphenated words as special cases for purposes of initial tagging.
    The LOB researchers began by using TAGGIT on parts of the LOB Corpus.
    They noticed that While less than 25% of TAGGIT's context frame rules are concerned with only the immediately preceding or succeeding word.
    .
    . these rules were applied in about 80% of all attempts to apply rules.
    This relative overuse of minimally specified contexts indicated that exp
