en vi and the concepts associated to the rest of the words in the context, vj E Uj=,4i Conceptsj.
    Let mdpvi be the set of these shortest paths.
    This BFS computation is repeated for every concept of every word in the input context, storing mdpvi accordingly.
    At the end, we obtain a set of minimum length paths each of them having a different concept as a source.
    The disambiguation graph GD is then just the union of the vertices and edges of the shortest paths, GD = Umi=1{mdpv,/vj E Conceptsi}.
    The disambiguation graph GD is thus a subgraph of the original GKB graph obtained by computing the shortest paths between the concepts of the words co-occurring in the context.
    Thus, we hypothesize that it captures the most relevant concepts and relations in the knowledge base for the particular input context.
    Once the GD graph is built, we compute the traditional PageRank algorithm over it.
    The intuition behind this step is that the vertices representing the correct concepts will be more r
