by Goodman (1999), among others.
    It is also the first to simultaneously accommodate multiple input components and multiple output components.
    When a source document is available in multiple languages, a translator can benefit from the disambiguating information in each.
    Translator CT can take advantage of such information without making the strong independence assumptions of Och &amp; Ney (2001).
    When output is desired in multiple languages, Translator CT offers all the putative benefits of the interlingual approach to MT, including greater efficiency and greater consistency across output components.
    Indeed, the language of multitrees can be viewed as an interlingua.
  
  
    We have explored inference of-dimensional multitrees under a -dimensional grammar, where .
    Now we generalize along the other axis of Figure 1(a).
    Multitext synchronization is most often used to infer-dimensional multitrees without the benefit of an-dimensional grammar.
    One application is inducing a parser
