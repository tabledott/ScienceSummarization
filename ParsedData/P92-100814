speaker intended to delete only &amp;quot;flights.&amp;quot; In the second experiment we attempted to improve robustness by applying the parser to small substrings of the sentence.
    When analyzing long word strings, the parser is more likely to fail due to factors unrelated to the repair.
    For this experiment, the parser was using both syntax and semantics.
    The phrases used for this experiment were the phrases found by the pattern matcher to contain matching strings of length one, with up to three intervening words.
    This set was selected because, as can be seen from Table 4, it constitutes a large subset of the data (186 such phrases).
    Furthermore, pattern matching alone contains insufficient information for reliably correcting these sentences.
    The relevant substring is taken to be the phrase constituting the matched string plus intervening material plus the immediately preceding word.
    So far we have used only phrases where the grammatical category of the matched word was either noun
