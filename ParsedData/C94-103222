word segmentatio,l and part of speech tag assigmnent were laboriously performed by hand.
  In tiffs experilneut, we only used one fourth of the AFt~.
  Corl)us , a portion of the keyl)oard dialogues in the conference registration domain.
  First, we selected 1,000 test sentences for all open test, arid used I.he others for training.
  Tile corpus was divided into 90% R)r training and 10% for test- ing.
  We then selected 1,000 sentences from tile traiu- ing set and used them for a closed test.
  The number of sentences, words, and characters for each test set and training texts are shown iu Pable 2.
  The training texts contained 6580 word types and 6945 tag trigram types.
  There were 247 unknown word types and 213 unknown tag trigram types in tim open test senteuces.
  Thus, both part of speech tri- gralrl l)robabilities alld word output probabilities must be snioothed to handle open texts.
