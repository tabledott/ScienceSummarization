one feature ft that is active2 for eik and fjk if an adjacent pair is an alignment, i.e., This example would produce the probability tables shown in Table 1.
    Note how ft is active for the (a, v) link, and is not active for the (b, u) link.
    This is due to our selected ordering.
    Table 1 allows us to calculate the probability of this alignment as:
  
  
    In this section, we describe a world-alignment algorithm guided by the alignment probability model derived above.
    In designing this algorithm we have selected constraints, features and a search method in order to achieve high performance.
    The model, however, is general, and could be used with any instantiation of the above three factors.
    This section will describe and motivate the selection of our constraints, features and search method.
    The input to our word-alignment algorithm consists of a pair of sentences E and F, and the dependency tree TE for E. TE allows us to make use of features and constraints that are based on linguisti
