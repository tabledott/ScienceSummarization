ents to evaluate our system.
    2It is possible that a word may be near the top of the ranked list during one iteration (and subsequently become a seed word) but become buried at the bottom of the ranked list during later iterations.
    However, we have not observed this to be a problem so far.
  
  
    We performed experiments with five categories to evaluate the effectiveness and generality of our approach: energy, financial, military, vehicles, and weapons.
    The MUC-4 development corpus (1700 texts) was used as the text corpus (MUC-4 Proceedings, 1992).
    We chose these five categories because they represented relatively different semantic classes, they were prevalent in the MUC-4 corpus, and they seemed to be useful categories.
    For each category, we began with the seed word lists shown in Figure 1.
    We ran the bootstrapping algorithm for eight iterations, adding five new words to the seed word list after each cycle.
    After the final iteration, we had ranked lists of potential category wo
