apply both POS tag and supertag sequence mod els (sw, twps).
			Supertags are more informative than POS tags as they contain the syntactic context of a word.
			These experiments were run with the distortion limit set to 6.
			This means that at most 6 words in 4see http://www.statmt.org/wpt05/ 5see http://www.statmt.org/wpt06/ 12 the source sentence can be skipped.
			We tried setting the distortion limit to 15 to see if allowing longer distance reorderings with CCG supertag sequence models could further improve performance, however it resulted in a decrease in performance to a BLEU score of 23.84.
			4.3 Manual Analysis.
			The BLEU score improvement in Table 1 does not explain how the supertag sequence models affect the translation process.
			As suggested by Callison-Burch et al(2006) we perform a focussed manual analysis of the output to see what changes have occurred.
			From the test set, we randomly selected 100 sentences which required reordering of verbs: the Dutch sentences ended with a verb which
