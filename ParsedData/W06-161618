    Our feature set was determined through experimentation with the development set.
    The features are based upon the data provided within the Alpino treebank.
    Along with POS tags the corpus contains several additional attributes such as gender, number and case.
    Our best results on the development set were achieved using the feature set of McDonald et al. (2005a) and a set of features based on the additional attributes.
    These features combine the attributes of the head with those of the child.
    For example, if token i has the attributes a1 and a2, and token j has the attribute a3 then we created the features (a1 &#8743; a3) and (a2 &#8743; a3).
    All the constraints presented in Section 3 were used in our model.
    The set U of unique labels constraints contained su, obj1, obj2, sup, ld, vc, predc, predm, pc, pobj1, obcomp and body.
    Here su stands for subject and obj1 for direct object (for full details see Moortgat et al. (2000)).
