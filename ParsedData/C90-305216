specification of ItPSG linguistic objects, we define SIGNs as being either of type PHRASAL_SIGN or of type LEXICAL-SIGN [15].
  A SIGN has a phono- logical value, represented as a list of words, and syntactic and semantic information (omitted for this comparison).
  The subtypes PHttASAL.SIGN and LEXICAL-SIGN inherit all the attributes and type re- strictions of SIGN.
  (4) SIGN -= (PHRASAL_SIGN V LEXICAL-SIGN) A |PHON: LIST_OF-STRINGS ISYN: CATEGORY LSEM: SEMANTIC_OBJECT PHRASAL_SIGNs (5) differ from LEXICAL_SIGNs (6) by having an additional dtrs (daughters") attribute that gives information about the (lexical or phrasal) signs which are their immediate constituents.
  This attribute encodes the kind of information about constituency conventionally described as constituent structures.
  In addition, the various daughters are distinguished according to what kinds of informa- tion they contribute to the sign as a whole.
  Thus, daughters are classified as heads and complements as in the standard X-bar theory.
