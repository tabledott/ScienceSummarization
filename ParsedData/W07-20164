			OntoNotes (Hovy et al, 2006) is a project that has annotated several layers of semantic information ? including word senses, at a high inter-annotator agreement of over 90%.
			Therefore we decided to use this data for the lexical sample task.
			2.2.1 Data All the data for this task comes from the 1M wordWSJ Treebank.
			For the convenience of the partici pants who wanted to use syntactic parse information as features using an off-the-shelf syntactic parser, we decided to compose the training data of Sections 02-21.
			For the test sets, we use data from Sections 1http://www.cse.unt.edu/?rada/senseval/senseval3/scoring/ 2scorer2 reports Precision and Recall scores for each system.
			For a sys tem that attempts all the words, both Precision and Recall are the same.
			Since a few systems had missing answers, they got different Precision and Recall scores.
			Therefore, for ranking purposes, we consolidated them into an F-score.
