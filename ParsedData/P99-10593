    A context-free grammar (CFG) is a tuple G = (VN, VT , P, S), where VN and VT are finite, disjoint sets of nonterminal and terminal symbols, respectively, and S E VN is the start symbol.
    Set P is a finite set of productions having the form A &#8212;* a, where A E VN , a E (VN U VT)*.
    If every production in P has the form A &#8212;4 BC or A a, for A, B,C E VN , a E VT, then the grammar is said to be in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF).2 Every language that can be generated by a CFG can also be generated by a CFG in CNF.
    In this paper we adopt the following conventions: a, b, c, d denote symbols in VT, w, X, y denote strings in Vat, and a, 0, denote strings in (VN U VT)*.
    The input to the parser will be a CFG G together with a string of terminal symbols to be parsed, w = d1d2 &#8226; &#8226; &#8226; dn.
    Also h,i, j,k denote positive integers, which are assumed to be &lt; n when we are treating them as indices into w. We write wzo for the input substrin
