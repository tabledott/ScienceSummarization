    We conducted two experiments in sentence classification.
    The goal of this task is to classify reviews (in Japanese) for PHS2 as positive reviews or negative reviews.
    A total of 5,741 sentences were collected from a Web-based discussion BBS on PHS, in which users are directed to submit positive reviews separately from negative reviews.
    The unit of classification is a sentence.
    The categories to be identified are &#8220;positive&#8221; or &#8220;negative&#8221; with the numbers 2,679 and 3,062 respectively.
    This task is to classify sentences (in Japanese) by modality.
    A total of 1,710 sentences from a Japanese newspaper were manually annotated according to Tamura&#8217;s taxonomy (Tamura and Wada, 1996).
    The unit of classification is a sentence.
    The categories to be identified are &#8220;opinion&#8221;, &#8220;assertion&#8221; or &#8220;description&#8221; with the numbers 159, 540, and 1,0
