oth using only context features.
    In these cases, MCCA yielded much lower precisions of 26.8 and 31.0 p0.33, respectively.
    For both languages, performance degraded compared to EN-ESfidence system predictions, where the only editing done is to ignore predictions which consist of identical source and target words.
    D and EN-FR-D, presumably due in part to the lack of orthographic features.
    However, MCCA still achieved surprising precision at lower recall levels.
    For instance, at p0.1, MCCA yielded 60.1 and 70.0 on Chinese and Arabic, respectively.
    Figure 3 shows the highest-confidence outputs in several languages.
    There has been previous work in extracting translation pairs from non-parallel corpora (Rapp, 1995; Fung, 1995; Koehn and Knight, 2002), but generally not in as extreme a setting as the one considered here.
    Due to unavailability of data and specificity in experimental conditions and evaluations, it is not possible to perform exact comparisons.
    However, we attempted to
