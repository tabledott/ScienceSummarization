t because character frequencies do not generally reflect word frequencies.
    Once the source text in a digital library exceeds a few megabytes, full-text indexes are needed to process queries in a reasonable time (Witten, Moffat, and Bell 1999).
    Full-text indexing was developed using languages where word boundaries are notated (principally English), and the techniques that were developed rely on wordbased processing.
    Although some techniques&#8212;for example stemming (Frakes 1992) and casefolding&#8212;are not applicable to Chinese information retrieval, many are.
    Examples include heuristics for relevance ranking, and query expansion using a language thesaurus.
    Of course, full-text indexes can be built from individual characters rather than words.
    However, these will suffer from the problem of low precision&#8212;searches will return many irrelevant documents, where the same characters are used in contexts different from that of the query.
