vity detection.
			We also investigated the influence of the size oftraining data on classification performance.
			Fig ure 2 plots the error rates obtained by TwitterSAand Unigrams versus the number of training ex amples.
			The curve corresponding to TwitterSA showed that it achieved good performances evenwith a small training data set, and kept almost constant as more examples were added to the training data, whereas for Unigrams the error rate de creased.
			For instance, with only 2,000 tweets as training data, TwitterSA obtained 20% of error rate whereas Unigrams 34.5%.
			These numbers show that our generic representation of tweets produces models that are able to generalize even with a few examples.
			4.3 Polarity Detection Evaluation.
			We provide the results for polarity detectionin Table 5.
			The best performance was ob tained by TwitterSA(maxconf), which combines results of the 3 classifiers, respectively trained from each source, by taking the output by themost confident classifier, as the fin
