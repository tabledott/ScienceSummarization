that this question asks for a reason, may lead to using a specific strategy for reasons.The above examples indicate that, given that dif ferent answer types may be searched using different strategies, a good classification module may helpthe question answering task.
			Moreover, determin ing the specific semantic type of the answer couldalso be beneficial in locating the answer and veri fying it.
			For example, in the next two questions, knowing that the targets are a city or country willbe more useful than just knowing that they are loca tions.
			Q: What Canadian city has the largest population?
			Q: Which country gave New York the Statue of Liberty?However, confined by the huge amount of man ual work needed for constructing a classifier for a complicated taxonomy of questions, most questionanswering systems can only perform a coarse clas sification for no more than 20 classes.
			As a result, existing approaches, as in (Singhal et al, 2000), have adopted a small set of simple answer entitytypes, which co
