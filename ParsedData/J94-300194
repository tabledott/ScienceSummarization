 operations are all regularity-preserving, we have established the following theorem: For all the application parameters we have considered, every rewriting rule whose components describe regular languages denotes a regular string relation.
    This theorem has an immediate corollary: The input-output string pairs of every such rewriting rule are accepted by some finitestate transducer.
    This theoretical result has important practical consequences.
    The mathematical analysis that establishes the theorem and its corollary is constructive in nature.
    Not only do we know that an appropriate relation and its corresponding transducer exist, we also know all the operations to perform to construct such a transducer from a particular rule.
    Thus, given a careful implementation of the calculus of regular languages and regular relations, our analysis provides a general method for compiling complicated rule conditions and actions into very simple computational devices.
