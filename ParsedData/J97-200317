n order to start writing the output associated to an input string w a or b according to whether n is even or odd, one needs to finish reading the whole input string w, which can be arbitrarily long.
    Sequential functions, namely functions that can be represented by sequential transducers do not allow such unbounded delays.
    More generally, sequential functions can be characterized among rational functions by the following theorem: Let f be a rational function mapping E* to L. f is sequential iff there exists a positive integer K such that: The fact that not all rational functions are sequential could reduce the interest of sequential transducers.
    The following theorem, due to Elgot and Mezei (1965), shows, however, that transducers are exactly compositions of left and right sequential transducers.
    Theorem 4 (Elgot and Mezei 1965) Let f be a partial function mapping E* to A*. f is rational iff there exists a left sequential function 1: E* &#8212;&gt; S2* and a right sequential function r: S-2* &#
