f examples, where an example refers to the feature value vector for each, in this case, potential keyword.
    An example that is a manual keyword is assigned the class positive, and those that are not are given the class negative.
    The machine learning approach used for the experiments is that of rule induction, i.e., the model that is constructed from the given examples, consists of a set of rules2.
    The strategy used to construct the rules is recursive partitioning (or divide-and-conquer), which has as the goal to maximise the separation between the classes for each rule.
    The system used allows for different ensemble techniques to be applied, meaning that a number of classifiers are generated and then combined to predict the class.
    The one used for these experiments is bagging (Breiman, 1996).
    In bagging, examples from the training data are drawn randomly with replacement until a set of the original size is obtained.
    This new set is then used to train a classifier.
