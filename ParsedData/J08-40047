. respectively.
    The relevant coefficient will be indicated with a superscript when an ambiguity may arise (for example, A&#960;e is the expected agreement used for calculating &#960;, and Axe is the expected agreement used for calculating x).
    &#8226; P(&#183;) is reserved for the probability of a variable, and &#710;P(&#183;) is an estimate of such probability from observed data.
    Finally, we use n with a subscript to indicate the number of judgments of a given type: The simplest measure of agreement between two coders is percentage of agreement or observed agreement, defined for example by Scott (1955, page 323) as &#8220;the percentage of judgments on which the two analysts agree when coding the same data independently.&#8221; This is the number of items on which the coders agree divided by the total number of items.
    More precisely, and looking ahead to the following discussion, observed agreement is the arithmetic mean of the agreement value agri for all items i &#8712; I, defined as follows
