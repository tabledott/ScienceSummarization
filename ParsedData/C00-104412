8) all adjectives and their modifiers.
  Al- though the most common use of an adverb modifying an adjective is to function as an intensilier or diminisher (Quirk et al., 1985, p. 445), adverbs can also add to tile semantic ontent of the adjectival phrase instead of pro- viding a grading effect (e.g., immediately available, po- litically vuhmrable), or function as cmphasizers, adding to the force o1 tile base adjective and not lo its degree (e.g., virtually impossible; compare *re O, impossible).
  Therefore, we compiled by hand a list of 73 adverbs and noun phrases (such as a little, exceedingly, somewhat, and veo) that are fiequently used as grading moditicrs.
  The number of times each adjective appears mod ilied by a term form this list becomes a first indicator of gradabil- ity.
  To detect inflected forms o1 adjectives (which, in 15&gt; glish, always indicate gradability st, bject to the excel&gt; tions discussed earlier), we have implemented an auto- matic lnorphology analysis component.
