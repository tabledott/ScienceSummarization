utput of the program as a whole.
    The idea here is to associate sentences that contain words paired in the WAT, giving preference to those word pairs that appear to be more reliable.
    Multiple associations are recorded.
    If there are to be further passes of the main body of the algorithm, a new AST is then constructed in light of the associations in the SAT.
    Associations that are supported some minimum number of times are treated just as the first and last sentences of the texts were initially; that is, as places at which there is known to be a correspondence.
    Possible correspondences are provided for the intervening sentences by the same interpolation method initially used for all sentences in the middle of the texts.
    In preparation for the next pass, a new set of corresponding words is now hypothesized using distributions based on the new AST, and the cycle repeats.
    The main algorithm is a relaxation process that leaves at the end of each pass a new WAT and SAT, each presumably more
