guage the list of words {e~, e2 ..... e,} of the (English) target language into which f can translate, and the probability P(e, I f  ) that such a translation takes place.
  A first approach to a solution that takes advantage ofa large data basc of paired sentences (referred to as training text) may be as follows.
  Suppose for a moment hat in every French / English sentence pair each French wordftranslates into one and only one English word e ,  and that this word is somehow revealed to the computer.
  Then we could proceed by!
  Establish a counter C(e,,f) for each word e~ of the English w~cabulary.
  Initially set C(e~,f) = 0 for words et.
  Find the Jth occurrence of the word f in  the French text.
  Let it take place in the Kth sentence, and let its translate be the qth word in the Kth English sentence E = e~,, e~ .
  Then increment by 1 the counter C(e,,?f).
  Increase J by 1 and repeat steps 2 and 3.
  Setting M(f  ) equal to the sum of all the counters C(e,, f )  at the conclusion of the above operati
