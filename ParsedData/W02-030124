    The accuracies for several major entity classes are also shown.
    The SVM system with the 2-dimensional polynomial kernel achieves the highest accuracy.
    This comparison may be unfair since a polynomial kernel has the effect of using conjunctive features, while the ME system does not use such conjunctive features.
    Nevertheless, the facts: we can introduce the polynomial kernel very easily; there are very few parameters to be tuned;11 we could achieve the higher accuracy; show an advantage of the SVM system.
    It will be interesting to discuss why the SVM systems with the inner product kernel (and the polynomial kernel with d = 1) are outperformed by the ME system.
    We here discuss two possible reasons.
    The first is that the SVM system does not use a dynamic decision such as the Viterbi algorithm, while the ME system uses it.
