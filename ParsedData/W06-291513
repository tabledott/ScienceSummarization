parameter when 5 = s0 shared by both documentlevel perspectives (right branch of the tree).
    We assume that the sentences with little or no perspective information, i.e., 5 = s0, are generated independently of the perspective of a document.
    In other words, sentences that are presenting common background information or introducing an issue and that do not strongly convey any perspective should look similar whether they are in Palestinian or Israeli documents.
    By forcing this constraint, we become more confident that s0 represents sentences of little perspectives and s1 represents sentences of strong perspectives from d1 and d0 documents.
  
  
    We evaluate three different models for the task of identifying perspective at the document level: two naive Bayes models (NB) with different inference methods and Support Vector Machines (SVM) (Cristianini and Shawe-Taylor, 2000).
    NB-B uses full Bayesian inference and NB-M uses Maximum a posteriori (MAP).
    We compare NB with SVM not only because SVM
