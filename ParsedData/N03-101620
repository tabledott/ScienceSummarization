SXL or SXR individually.
    Similarly, B is U (SXMLR, SIXLR).
    There are other useful grammar projections, which are beyond the scope of this paper.
    First, much recent statistical parsing work has gotten value from splitting grammar states, such as by annotating nodes with their parent and even grandparent categories (Johnson, 1998).
    This annotation multiplies out the state space, giving a much larger grammar, and projecting back to the unannotated state set can be used as an outside estimate.
    Second, and perhaps more importantly, this technique can be applied to lexical parsing, where the state projections are onto the delexicalized PCFG symbols and/or onto the word-word dependency structures.
    This is particularly effective when the tree model takes a certain factored form; see Klein and Manning (2003) for details.
    Following (Charniak et al., 1998), we parsed unseen sentences of length 18&#8211;26 from the Penn Treebank, using the grammar induced from the remainder of the treebank.6 W
