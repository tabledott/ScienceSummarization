 parallel corpora containingtens or hundreds of millions of words.
			This can result in millions of rules using even the most conser vative extraction heuristics.
			Efficient algorithms for rule storage and access are necessary for practical decoding algorithms.
			They are crucial to keeping up with the ever-increasing size of parallel corpora, as well as the introduction of new data sources such as web-mined and comparable corpora.
			Until recently, most approaches to this probleminvolved substantial tradeoffs.
			The common practice of test set filtering renders systems impracti cal for all but batch processing.
			Tight restrictions on phrase length curtail the power of phrase-basedmodels.
			However, some promising engineering so lutions are emerging.
			Zens and Ney (2007) use a disk-based prefix tree, enabling efficient access to phrase tables much too large to fit in main memory.
			An alternative approach introduced independently by both Callison-Burch et al (2005) and Zhang and Vogel (2005) is to
