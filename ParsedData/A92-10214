proving its performance.
    The tagger initially tags by assigning each word its most likely tag, estimated by examining a large tagged corpus, without regard to context.
    In both sentences below, run would be tagged as a verb: The run lasted thirty minutes.
    3.
    One of the two preceding (following) words is tagged We run three miles every day.
