ge groups of actor names, companies, etc.
    This also led to convergence issues since the polarity is divided proportional to the size of the dense subgraph.
    Additionally, negative phrases in the graph appeared to be in more densely connected regions, which resulted in the final lexicons being highly skewed towards negative entries due to the influence of multiple paths to seed words.
    For best path propagation, these problems were less acute as each node in the dense subgraph would only get the polarity a single time from each seed, which is decayed by the fact that edge weights are smaller than 1.
    Furthermore, the fact that edge weights are less than 1 results in most long paths having weights near zero, which in turn results in fast convergence.
  
  
    We ran the best path graph propagation algorithm over a graph constructed from the web using manually constructed positive and negative seed sets of 187 and 192 words in size, respectively.
    These words were generated by a set of five huma
