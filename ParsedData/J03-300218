marked a page &#8220;good&#8221; or both marked a page &#8220;bad&#8221;) on 261 page pairs (86 &#8220;good&#8221; and 175 &#8220;bad&#8221;), and it is relative to those 261 that we compute recall.
    A modified version of STRAND was used to obtain English-Chinese pairs (see related work, below), and in a similar formal evaluation, we found that the resulting set had 98% precision and 61% recall for Chinese (http://umiacs.umd.edu/&#8212;resnik/strand/).
    Both these results are consistent with our preliminary findings for English-Spanish using a less rigorous evaluation (using the judgments of the first author rather than independent bilingual evaluators) and a very small test set; precision in this preliminary experiment was near ceiling and recall was in the vicinity of 60% (Resnik 1998).
    2.2.2 Assessing the STRAND Data.
    Although our focus here is finding parallel text, not using it, a natural question is whether parallel text from the Web is in fact of value.
    Two sources of evidence suggest
