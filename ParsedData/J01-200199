o either syntax or semantics.
    To the contrary: I have tried to find the simplest algorithm capable of dealing with the facts as we know them.
    The problem of determining whether two distinct signatures derive from a single larger paradigm would be simplified with such knowledge, but that is the exception and not the rule.
    So in the end, I think that the hypothesis that the child uses an MDL-like analysis has a good deal going for it.
    In any event, it is far from clear to me how one could use information, either grammatical or contextual, to elucidate the problem of the discovery of morphemes without recourse to notions along the lines of those used in the present algorithm.
    Of course, in all likelihood, the task of the present algorithm is not the same as the language learner's task; it seems unlikely that the child first determines what the words are in the language (at least, the words as they are defined in traditional orthographic terms) and then infers the morphemes.
    The more gener
