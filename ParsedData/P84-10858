    Every Speech Event type, DU type and dcu type is associated with a transition network specifying its internal structure.
    As a transition network processes the consecutive constituents of a discourse segment, it builds up, step by step, a representation of the meaning of the segment.
    This representation is stored in a register associated with the network.
    At any stage of the Process, this register contains a representation of the meaning of the discourse segment so far.
    An ATN parser of this sort models important aspects of the discourse process.
    After each clause, the system is in a well-defined state, characterized by the stack of active transition networks and, for each of them, the values in its registers and the place where it was interrupted.
    When we say that discourse participants know &amp;quot;where they are&amp;quot; in a complicated discourse, we mean that they know which discourse constituent is being initiated or continued, as well as which discour
