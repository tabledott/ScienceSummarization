(Lapata, 2003). set of events.
    Our task will be to propose a summary S consisting of sentences in D totaling at most L words.3 Here as in much extractive summarization, we will view each sentence as a bag-of-words or more generally a bag-of-ngrams (see section 5.1).
    The most prevalent example of this data setting is document clusters found on news aggregator sites.
    For model development we will utilize the DUC 2006 evaluation set4 consisting of 50 document sets each with 25 documents; final evaluation will utilize the DUC 2007 evaluation set (section 5).
    Automated evaluation will utilize the standard DUC evaluation metric ROUGE (Lin, 2004) which represents recall over various n-grams statistics from a system-generated summary against a set of humangenerated peer summaries.5 We compute ROUGE scores with and without stop words removed from peer and proposed summaries.
    In particular, we utilize R-1 (recall against unigrams), R-2 (recall against bigrams), and R-SU4 (recall against skip-4 bigra
