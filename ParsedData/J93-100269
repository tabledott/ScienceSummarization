tandard way, but separate probabilities are associated with reduce Parse derivations for the winter holiday camp closed. actions, depending on the state reached after the action; for example, in state 4 with lookahead N@ the probability of reducing with rule 10 is 0.17 if the state reached is 3 and 0.22 if the state reached is 5.
    The actions that have no associated probabilities are ones that have not been utilized during the training phase; each is assigned a smoothed probability that is the reciprocal of the result of adding one to the total number of observations of actions actually taken in that state.
    Differential probabilities are thus assigned to unseen events in a manner analogous to the Good-Turing technique.
    For this reason, the explicit probabilities for each row add up to less than one.
    The goto part of the table is not shown because it is always deterministic and, therefore, we do not associate probabilities with goto transitions.
    The difference between our approach and one ba
