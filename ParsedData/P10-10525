    CRFs are based on the following model where x = (x1, ...,xT) and y = (y1, ... , yT) are, respectively, the input and output sequences2, and Fk(x, y) is equal to PTt=1 fk(yt&#8722;1, yt, xt), where {fk}1&#8804;k&#8804;K is an arbitrary set of feature functions and {&#952;k}1&#8804;k&#8804;K are the associated parameter values.
    We denote by Y and X, respectively, the sets in which yt and xt take their values.
    The normalization factor in (1) is defined by The most common choice of feature functions is to use binary tests.
    In the sequel, we distinguish between two types of feature functions: unigram features fy,x, associated with parameters &#181;y,x, and bigram features fyl,y,x, associated with parameters &#955;y/,y,x.
    These are defined as where 1(cond.) is equal to 1 when the condition is verified and to 0 otherwise.
    In this setting, the number of parameters K is equal to |Y |2x|X|train, where |&#183; |denotes the cardinal and |X|train refers to the numb
