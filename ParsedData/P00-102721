sults in perspective, Mooney and Calif (1995) achieved 82.5% overall accuracy using a fully supervised decision list learner trained on 250 paired past-tense/root verb pairs (in plain text form).
    Although they don't breakdown this performance by word type, their included FOILDL program trained from 250 pairs and applied to our evaluation set achieved 100% accuracy on the pairs with simple +ed concatenation, 84% accuracy on stem changing (non-concat) pairs and 5% accuracy on the highly irregular pairs, with 89% overall accuracy.
    Other available supervised learning results (e.g.
    Ling; Rumelhart and McClelland) are only given for phonological word representations.
    While not directly comparable with our text-based data, their performance is significantly worse than Mooney and Calif's FOILDL on common phonological paired data, suggesting that FOILDL is a generally competitive reference point for our results.
