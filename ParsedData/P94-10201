atic interactions among variables limits the number of parameters to be estimated, supports computational efficiency, and provides an understanding of the data.
    The biggest limitation associated with this method is the need for large amounts of sense-tagged data.
    Because asymptotic distributions of the test statistics are used, the validity of the results obtained using this approach are compromised when it is applied to sparse data (this point is discussed further in Section 2).
    To test the method of model selection presented in this paper, a case study of the disambiguation of the performed. selected because it has been shown in previous studies to be a difficult word to disambiguate.
    We selected as the set of tags all non-idiomatic noun senses of defined in the electronic version of Longman's Dictionary of Contemporary English (LDOCE) ([23]).
    Using the models produced in this study, we are able to assign an sense tag to every usage of a heldout test set with 78% accuracy.
