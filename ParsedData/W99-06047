wi et al., 1998; Wang and Waibel, 1998) but differently approached.
    In section 4 we compare the two methods using the Verbmobil task.
  
  
    In this section, we shortly review a translation approach based on the so-called monotonicity requirement (Tillmann et al., 1997).
    Our aim is to provide a basis for comparing the two different translation approaches presented.
    In Eq.
    (1), Pr (el) is the language model, which is a trigram language model in this case.
    For the translation model Pr (ll lei ) we make the assumption that each source word is aligned to exactly one target word (a relaxation of this assumption is described in section 2.2).
    For our model, the probability of alignment al for position j depends on the previous alignment position a3_1 (Vogel et al., 1996).
    Using this assumption, there are two types of probabilities: the alignment probabilities denoted by p(a31a3 _1) and the lexicon probabilities denoted by P(f3 lea2).
    The string translation probability can be re-wri
