mely, p(f) =1)(f)).
    One final note about features and constraints bears repeating: although the words &amp;quot;feature&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;constraint&amp;quot; are often used interchangeably in discussions of maximum entropy, we will be vigilant in distinguishing the two and urge the reader to do likewise.
    A feature is a binary-valued function of (x, y); a constraint is an equation between the expected value of the feature function in the model and its expected value in the training data.
    Suppose that we are given n feature functions f;, which determine statistics we feel are important in modeling the process.
    We would like our model to accord with these statistics.
    That is, we would like p to lie in the subset C of P defined by Figure 1 provides a geometric interpretation of this setup.
    Here P is the space of all (unconditional) probability distributions on three points, sometimes called a simplex.
    If we impose no constraints (depicted in (a)), then all probability models are
