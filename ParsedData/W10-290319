    Due to space limitations we refer the reader to (Zelle and Mooney, 1996) for a detailed description of the Geoquery domain.
    Recall that the goal of semantic parsing is to produce the following function (Equation (1)): However, given that y and z are complex structures it is necessary to decompose the structure into a set of smaller decisions to facilitate efficient inference.
    In order to define our decomposition we introduce additional notation: c is a constituent (or word span) in the input sentence x and D is the set of all function and constant symbols in the domain.
    The alignment y is defined as a set of mappings between constituents and symbols in the domain y = {(c, s)} where s E D. We decompose the construction of an alignment and logical form into two types of decisions: First-order decisions.
    A mapping between constituents and logical symbols (functions and constants).
