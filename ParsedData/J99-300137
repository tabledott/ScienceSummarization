    In Table 8, we define various sets, which are used for the specification of the Cf ranking criteria in Table 9.
    We distinguish between two different sets of discourse entities, hearer-old discourse entities (OLD) and hearer-new discourse entities (NEW).
    For any two discourse entities (x, pos x) and (y, posy), with x and y denoting the linguistic surface expression of those entities as they occur in the discourse, and posx and posy indicating their respective text position, posx 0 posy, in Table 9 we define the basic ordering constraints on elements in the forward-looking centers Cf(Ui).
    For any utterance U, the ordering of discourse entities in the Cf(U) that can be derived from the above definitions and the ordering constraints (1) to (3) are denoted by the relation Ordering constrain
