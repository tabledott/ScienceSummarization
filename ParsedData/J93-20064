f a word with a particular part of speech in a string of words.
    At the level of syntax (Section 3), an event is the use of a particular structure; the model predicts what the most likely rule is given a particular situation.
    One can similarly use probabilities for assigning semantic structure (Section 4).
    We report in Section 2 on our experiments on the assignment of part of speech to words in text.
    The effectiveness of such models is well known (DeRose 1988; Church 1988; Kupiec 1989; Jelinek 1985), and they are currently in use in parsers (e.g. de Marcken 1990).
    Our work is an incremental improvement on these models in three ways: (1) Much less training data than theoretically required proved adequate; (2) we integrated a probabilistic model of word features to handle unknown words uniformly within the probabilistic model and measured its contribution; and (3) we have applied the forward&#8212;backward algorithm to accurately compute the most likely tag set.
    In Section 3, we demonstra
