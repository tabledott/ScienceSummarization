rtain configurational constraints.
    The algorithm chooses as the antecedent of a pronoun P the first NP, in the tree obtained by left-to-right breadth-first traversal of the branches to the left of the path T such that (i) T is the path from the NP dominating P to the first NP or S dominating this NP, (ii) T contains an NP or S node N that contains the NP dominating P. and (iii) N does not contain NP,.
    If an antecedent satisfying this condition is not found in the sentence containing P. the algorithm selects the first NP obtained by a left-to-right breadth first search of the surface structures of preceding sentences in the text.
    We have implemented a version of Hobbs' algorithm for Slot Grammar.
    The original formulation of the algorithm encodes syntactic constraints on pronominal anaphora in the definition of the domain to which the search for an antecedent NP applies.
    In our implementation of the algorithm, we have factored out the search procedure and substituted RAP's syntactic&#8212;mo
