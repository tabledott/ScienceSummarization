atures we examine with respect to cue phrases is the accent status of each cue; that is, whether or not the cue phrase is accented, or made intonationally prominent, and, if it is accented, what type of pitch accent it bears.
    Pitch accents usually appear as peaks or valleys in the FO contour.
    They are aligned with the stressed syllables of lexical items, making those items prominent.
    Note that, while every lexical item in English has a lexically stressable syllable, which is the rhythmically most prominent syllable in the word, not every stressable syllable is in fact accented; so, lexical stress is distinguished from pitch accent.

    Contrast Figure 1 with Figure 2.
