ected subsets of this sample of verbs. our application, as it yields performance measures across a large number of training data /test data sets, avoiding the problems of outliers in a single random selection from a relatively small data set such as ours.
    The second methodology is a single hold-out training and testing approach.
    Here, the system is run N times, where N is the size of the data set (i.e., the 59 verbs in our case), each time holding out a single data vector as the test case and using the remaining N-1 vectors as the training set.
    The single hold-out methodology yields an overall accuracy rate (when the results are averaged across all N trials), but also&#8212; unlike cross-validation&#8212;gives us classification results on each individual data vector.
    This property enables us to analyze differential performance on the individual verbs and across the different verb classes.
    Under both training and testing methodologies, the baseline (chance) performance in this task&#8212;a
