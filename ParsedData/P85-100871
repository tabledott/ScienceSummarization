    But it is not true that ES = MS, for equality, like quantification, is over entities in the Platonic universe.
    The fact that ES and MS are identical in the real world (call this relation rw-identieel) must be stated explicitly, say, by the expression For reasoning about 're-identical* entities, that is, Platonic entities that are identical in the real world, we may take the following approach.
    Substitution in referentially transparent contexts would be achieved by use of the axiom schema where es is the kth argument of p and p is referentially transparent in its kth argument.
    That is, if et is p's being true of es and ES and e.4 are identical in the real world, then there is a condition es of p's being true of 64, and es is identical to el in the real world.
    Substitution of &amp;quot;rw-identicals' in a condition results not in the same condition but in an &amp;quot;rw-identical' condition.
    There would be such an axiom for the first argument of believe but not for its referentially
