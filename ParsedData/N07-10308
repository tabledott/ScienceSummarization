et is similar (though not equivalent) to that used by Ng and Cardie (2002a).
    We omit details here for the sake of brevity &#8212; the ILP systems we employ here could be equally well applied to many different base classifiers using many different feature sets.
  
  
    As mentioned in the introduction, coreference classifiers such as that presented in section 2 suffer from errors in which (a) they assign an antecedent to a non-anaphor mention or (b) they assign no antecedents to an anaphoric mention.
    Ng and Cardie (2002a) suggest overcoming such failings by augmenting their coreference classifier with an anaphoricity classifier which acts as a filter during model usage.
    Only the mentions that are deemed anaphoric are considered for coreference resolution.
    Interestingly, they find a degredation in performance.
    In particular, they obtain significant improvements in precision, but with larger losses in recall (especially for proper names and common nouns).
    To counteract this, they add ad
