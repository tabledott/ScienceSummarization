    I propose a model for determining the hearer's attentional state which depends solely on a list of salient discourse entities (S-list).
    The ordering among the elements of the S-list covers also the of the center the centering model.

    The model is the basis for an algorithm which operates incrementally, word by word.

    My proposal is inspired by the centering model (Grosz et al., 1983; 1995) and draws on the conclusions of Strube &amp; Hahn's (1996) approach for the ranking of the forward-looking center list for German.
    Their approach has been proven as the point of departure for a new model which is valid for English as well.
