om the implementation of such an algorithm in a practical natural language understanding system.
    We claim that the elements necessary for a theoretically satisfying account of indirect speech acts are independently motivated.
    It is almost certain that a computationally efficient solution to the indirect speech act problem would short-cut many of the inference chains suggested here, although we doubt that all searching can be eliminated in the case of the less standard forms such as 4.6a.
    The implementation in Brachman et al [1980] does just that.
    However, the more fundamental account is necessary to evaluate the correctness of the implementations.
    Many problems remain.
    Other syntactic forms that have significance with respect to illocutionary force determination should be considered.
    For example, tag questions such as &amp;quot;John is coming to the party tonight, isn't he?&amp;quot; have not been analysed here (but see Brown [19801).
    Furthermore, no &amp;quot;why&amp;quot; or
