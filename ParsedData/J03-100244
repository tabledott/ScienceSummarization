good initial parameters.
    Obviously, if we use Model 2 for bootstrapping, we eventually obtain a poor local optimum.
    In Tables 6 and 7, we compare the results obtained by using different numbers of alignments in the training of the fertility-based alignment models.
    We compare the three different approaches described in Section 3: using only the Viterbi alignment, using in addition the neighborhood of the Viterbi alignment, and using the pegged alignments.
    To reduce the training time, we restrict the number of pegged alignments by using only those in which Pr(f, a I e) is not much smaller than the probability of the Viterbi alignment.
    This reduces the training time drastically.
    For the large Hansards corpus, however, there still is an unacceptably large training time.
    Therefore, we report the results for only up to 128,000 training sentences.
    The effect of pegging strongly depends on the quality of the starting point used for training the fertility-based alignment models.
