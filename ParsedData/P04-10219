orrespond to a letter substring in English or vice versa. where there exists an alignment &#947; with and &lt; e, c &gt;K=&lt; xm , yn &gt; .
    A transliteration unit correspondence &lt; e, c &gt; is called a transliteration pair.
    Then, the E2C transliteration can be formulated as and similarly the C2E back-transliteration as An n-gram transliteration model is defined as the conditional probability, or transliteration probability, of a transliteration pair &lt; e, c &gt;k depending on its immediate n predecessor pairs: which provides an alternative to the phonemebased approach for resolving eqn.
    (1) and (2) by eliminating the intermediate phonemic representation.
    Unlike the noisy-channel model, the joint source-channel model does not try to capture how source names can be mapped to target names, but rather how source and target names can be generated simultaneously.
    In other words, we estimate a joint probability model that can be easily marginalized in order to yield conditional probability
