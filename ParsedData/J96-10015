ds with the highest cardinality and correlation factor as the target collocation.
    Finally, it produces the correct word ordering of the target collocation by examining samples in the corpus.
    If word order is variable in the target collocation, Champollion labels it flexible (for example, to take steps to can appear as took immediate steps to, steps were taken to, etc.
    ); otherwise, the correct word order is reported and the collocation is labeled rigid.
    To evaluate Champollion, we used a collocation compiler, XTRACT (Smadja 1993), to automatically produce several lists of source (English) collocations.
    These source collocations contain both flexible word pairs, which can be separated by an arbitrary number of words, and fixed constituents, such as compound noun phrases.
    Using XTRACT on three parts of the English data in the Hansards corpus, each representing one year's worth of data, we extracted three sets of collocations, each consisting of 300 randomly selected collocations occurrin
