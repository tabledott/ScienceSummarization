und that the prefix features for rare words were having a net negative effect on accuracy.
    We do not at present have a good explanation for this phenomenon.
    The addition of the features (1) and (2) and the removal of the prefix features considerably improved the accuracy on unknown words and the overall accuracy.
    The results on the test set after adding these features are shown below: 96.76% 86.76% Unknown word error is reduced by 15% as compared to the Baseline model.
    It is important to note that (2) is composed of information already 'known' to the tagger in some sense.
    This feature can be viewed as the conjunction of two features, one of which is already in the baseline model, and the other of which is the negation of a feature existing in the baseline model &#8212; since for words at the beginning of a sentence, the preceding tag is the pseudo-tag NA, and there is a feature looking at the preceding tag.
    Even though our maximum entropy model does not require independence among the p
