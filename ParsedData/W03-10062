tic frameworks, unlike the very particular surface-syntactic choices made by the linguists who created the PTB syntactic annotation rules.
    The outline of this paper is as follows.
    In Section 2 we introduce the PropBank and describe the problem of predicting semantic tags.
    Section 3 presents an overview of our work and distinguishes it from previous work.
    Section 4 describes the method used to produce the TAGs that are the basis of our experiments.
    Section 5 specifies how training and test data that are used in our experiments are derived from the PropBank.
    Next, we give results on two sets of experiments.
    Those that predict semantic tags given gold-standard linguistic information are described in Section 6.
    Those that do prediction from raw text are described in Section 7.
    Finally, in Section 8 we present concluding remarks.
  
  
    The PropBank (Kingsbury et al., 2002) annotates the PTB with dependency structures (or &#8216;predicateargument&#8217; structures), using sen
