omewhat lower score, than preconditioned CG training.
    The accuracy rate for individual labeling decisions is over-optimistic as an accuracy measure for shallow parsing.
    For instance, if the chunk BTTTTTTT is labled as OTTTTTTT, the labeling accuracy is 87.5%, but recall is 0.
    However, individual labeling errors provide a more convenient basis for statistical significance tests.
    One such test is McNemar test on paired observations (Gillick and Cox, 1989).
    With McNemar&#8217;s test, we compare the correctness of the labeling decisions of two models.
    The null hypothesis is that the disagreements (correct vs. incorrect) are due to chance.
    Table 4 summarizes the results of tests between the models for which we had labeling decisions.
    These tests suggest that MEMMs are significantly less accurate, but that there are no significant differences in accuracy among the other models.
  
  
    We have shown that (log-)linear sequence labeling models trained discriminatively with general-pu
