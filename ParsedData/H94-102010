ion scheme, we have tried to come up with a middle ground which allows annotation of those distinc- tions that seem to hold up across a wide body of material.
  After many attempts to find a reliable test to distinguish between arguments and adjuncts, we have abandoned struc- turally marking this difference.
  Instead, we now label a small set of clearly distinguishable roles, building upon syntactic distinctions only when the semantic intuitions are clear cut.
  Getting annotators to consistently apply even the small set of distinctions we will discuss here is fairly difficult.
  In the earlier corpus annotation scheme, We originally used only standard syntactic labels (e.g.
  NP, ADVP, PP, etc.)
