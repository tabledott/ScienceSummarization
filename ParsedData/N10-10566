perations.
    This involves the desired parameters, which we solve for by estimating the others from data, as described next.
    Estimation Note that P(a  |A, o3) = 0 if A =&#65533; a.
    Thus, if we have estimates for o1-related probabilities, we can derive o2-related probabilities via Equation 1.
    To begin with, we make the working assumption that occurrences of simplification in ComplexEW are negligible in comparison to fixes.
    Since we are also currently ignoring edit spam, we thus assume that only o1 edits occur in ComplexEW.5 Let fC(A) be the fraction of ~dk in C containing A in which A is modified: A natural estimate for the conditional probability of A being rewritten to a under any operation type is based on observations of A &#8211;* a in SimpleEW, since that is the corpus wherein both operations are assumed to occur: Thus, from (1) we get that for A =&#65533; a:
