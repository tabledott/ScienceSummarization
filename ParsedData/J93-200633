resenting an equivalence class of rules with bound variables.
    The &amp;quot;best possible&amp;quot; error rates for each test indicates the percentage of cases for which none of the interpretations produced by the system was judged correct, so that no selection scheme could achieve a lower error rate than that.
    The &amp;quot;chance&amp;quot; score gives the error rate that would be expected with random selection from all interpretations produced.
    The &amp;quot;test&amp;quot; column shows the error rate with the supervised or unsupervised probability model in question.
    The first supervised test had an 81.4% improvement, the second a 50.8% improvement, and the third a 56% improvement.
    These results state how much better than chance the given model did as a percentage of the maximum possible improvement.
    We expect to improve the model's performance by recording probabilities for other features in addition to just the set of rules involved in producing them.
    For example, in the grammar
