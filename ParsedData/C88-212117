he parse.
  Of course, if the sentence is ambiguous, there may be more than one choice.
  If one adopts an off-line parsing algorithm, the parsing problem is reduced to the following two steps: t First produce the set of structures corresponding to each word in the sentence.
  This step performs the role of an expanded morphological nalysis (or tagging).
  Then put the argument structures into the predicate structures.
  This step performs a modified syntactic analysis.
  In principle any parsing strategy can be applied to execute the second step, since the number of structures produced js finite and since each of them corresponds to a token in the input string, the search space is finite and termination is guaranteed.
  In principle, one can proceed inside out, left to right or in any other way.
  Of course, standard parsing algorithm can be used too.
  In particular, we can use the top-down parsing strategy without encountering the usual problems due to recursion.
