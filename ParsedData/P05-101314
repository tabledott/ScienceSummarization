   More details on the memory-based prediction can be found in Nivre et al. (2004) and Nivre and Scholz (2004).
  
  
    The first experiment uses data from two dependency treebanks.
    The Prague Dependency Treebank (PDT) consists of more than 1M words of newspaper text, annotated on three levels, the morphological, analytical and tectogrammatical levels (Haji&#711;c, 1998).
    Our experiments all concern the analytical annotation, and the first experiment is based only on the training part.
    The Danish Dependency Treebank (DDT) comprises about 100K words of text selected from the Danish PAROLE corpus, with annotation of primary and secondary dependencies (Kromann, 2003).
    The entire treebank is used in the experiment, but only primary dependencies are considered.4 In all experiments, punctuation tokens are included in the data but omitted in evaluation scores.
    In the first part of the experiment, dependency graphs from the treebanks were projectivized using the algorithm described in section 2.
