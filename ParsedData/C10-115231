the dependency parser.
			InExample 2, ?An umbrella term?
			should be a dependency of ?called?.
			But the parser returns ?su perset?
			as the dependency.
			In the future, we will investigate more sophisticated features and rules to enhance TSM.
	
	
			In this paper, we presented a novel large-scale par allel dataset PWKP for sentence simplification.
			We proposed TSM, a tree-based translation model for sentence simplification which covers splitting, dropping, reordering and word/phrase substitution integrally for the first time.
			We also described anefficient training method with speeding up tech niques for TSM.
			The evaluation shows that TSM can achieve better overall readability scores than a set of baseline systems.
