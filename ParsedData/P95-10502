 in a text of another language those words which are translations of A and B should also co-occur more frequently than expected.
    This assumption is reasonable for parallel texts.
    However, in this paper it is further assumed that the co-occurrence patterns in original texts are not fundamentally different from those in translated texts.
    Starting from an English vocabulary of six words and the corresponding German translations, table la and b show an English and a German co-occurrence matrix.
    In these matrices the entries belonging to those pairs of words that in texts co-occur more frequently than expected have been marked with a dot.
    In general, word order in the lines and columns of a co-occurrence matrix is independent of each other, but for the purpose of this paper can always be assumed to be equal without loss of generality.
    If now the word order of the English matrix is permuted until the resulting pattern of dots is most similar to that of the German matrix (see table lc), then
