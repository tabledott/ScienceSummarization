ndency structure with a higher or equal score (where score is the geometric mean of the probability of the dependency structure).
    This tactic also has the effect of eliminating &#8220;spuriously ambiguous&#8221; entries from the chart&#8212; cf.
    Komagata (1997).
    Second, a constituent is only placed in a cell if the score for its dependency structure is within some factor, a, of the highest scoring dependency structure for that cell.
  
  
    Sections 02-21 of the CCGbank were used for training (39 161 sentences); section 00 for development (1 901 sentences); and section 23 for testing (2 379 sentences).8 Sections 02-21 were also used to obtain the category set, by including all categories that appear at least 10 times, which resulted in a set of 398 category types.
    The word-category sequences needed for estimating the probabilities in equation 8 can be read directly from the CCGbank.
    To obtain dependencies for estimating PDC S , we ran the parser over the trees, tracing out the combinator
