systems are processed matters, the decoder produces a separate hypothesis for each order.
    Each iteration expands the previous set of partial hypotheses, resulting in a large space of complete synthetic hypotheses.
    Since this space can grow exponentially, pruning based on scoring of the partial hypotheses is applied when necessary.
    A major component in the scoring of hypothesis translations is a confidence score that is assigned to each of the original translations, which reflects the translation adequacy of the system that produced it.
    We associate a confidence score with each word in a synthetic translation based on the confidence of the system from which it originated.
    If the word was contributed by several different original translations, we sum the confidences of the contributing systems.
    This word confidence score is combined multiplicatively with a score assigned to the word by a trigram language model.
    The score assigned to a complete hypothesis is its geometric average word
