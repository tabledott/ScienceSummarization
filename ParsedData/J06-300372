r (M) is flu (*).
    In English, the modifier (typically a noun or adjective) usually precedes the head noun.
    In the description of purpose, V represents an arbitrary verb.
    In concert hall, the hall is for presenting concerts (V is present) or holding concerts (V is hold) (&#8224;).
    Nastase and Szpakowicz (2003) organized the relations into groups.
    The five capitalized terms in the Relation column of Table 19 are the names of five groups of semantic relations.
    (The original table had a sixth group, but there are no examples of this group in the data set.)
    We make use of this grouping in the following experiments.
    The following experiments use single nearest neighbor classification with leave-one-out cross-validation.
    For leave-one-out cross-validation, the testing set consists of a single noun-modifier pair and the training set consists of the 599 remaining noun-modifiers.
    The data set is split 600 times, so that each noun-modifier gets a turn as the testing word pair.
