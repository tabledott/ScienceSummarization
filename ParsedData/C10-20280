	Enhanced Sentiment Learning Using Twitter Hashtags and Smileys
		Automated identification of diverse sen timent types can be beneficial for manyNLP systems such as review summariza tion and public media analysis.
		In some ofthese systems there is an option of assign ing a sentiment value to a single sentence or a very short text.
		In this paper we propose a supervised sentiment classification framework whichis based on data from Twitter, a popu lar microblogging service.
		By utilizing50 Twitter tags and 15 smileys as sen timent labels, this framework avoids theneed for labor intensive manual annotation, allowing identification and classifi cation of diverse sentiment types of shorttexts.
		We evaluate the contribution of different feature types for sentiment classification and show that our framework successfully identifies sentiment types of untagged sentences.
		The quality of the senti ment identification was also confirmed byhuman judges.
		We also explore dependencies and overlap between different s
