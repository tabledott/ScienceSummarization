ovement in performance relative to a system that relies only on syntactic salience for antecedent selection.
    Our analysis of these results also shows that statistically measured lexical preference patterns alone provide a far less efficient basis for anaphora resolution than an algorithm based on syntactic and attentional measures of salience.'
    We will briefly compare our algorithm with several other approaches to anaphora resolution that have been suggested.
    Hobbs' (1978) algorithm relies on a simple tree search procedure formulated in terms of depth of embedding and left&#8212;right order.
    By contrast, RAP uses a multi-dimensional measure of salience that invokes a variety of syntactic properties specified in terms of the head&#8212;argument structures of Slot Grammar, as well as a model of attentional state.
    Hobbs' tree search procedure selects the first candidate encountered by a left&#8212; right depth first search of the tree outside of a minimal path to the pronoun that satisfies ce
