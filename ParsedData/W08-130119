2004) to correctly determine long distance dependencies, as input to the current dependency conversion system.
    This would presumably be effective, but would make the conversion process much heavier weight.
    Textual Entailment (RTE) challenges (Dagan et al., 2006; Giampiccolo et al., 2007), the increase in the use of SD is clearly apparent.
    The goal in these challenges consists of identifying whether one sentence follows from a piece of text and general background knowledge, according to the intuitions of an intelligent human reader.
    In 2007, out of the 21 systems which participated in the challenge, 5 used the SD representation, whereas the year before only the Stanford entry was using it.
    SD is also widely present in the bioinformatic world where it is used with success (Erkan et al., 2007; Greenwood and Stevenson, 2007; Urbain et al., 2007; Clegg, 2008).
    Fundel et al. (2007) found that, in extraction of relations between genes and proteins, a system based on the SD scheme greatly outp
