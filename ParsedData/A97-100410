rimented with the quantity of training data required to maintain performance.
    Table 3 shows performance on the WSJ corpus as a. function of training set size using the best performing system and the more portable system.
    As can seen from the table, performance degrades a.s the quantity of training data decreases, but even with only 500 example sentences performance is beter than the baselines of 64.00/0 if a. sentence boundary is guessed at every potential site and 78.4%, if only token-final instances of sentence-ending punctuation are assumed to be boundaries.
  
  
    We have described an approach to identifying sentence boundaries which performs comparably to other state-of-the-art systems that require vastly more resources.
    For example, Riley's performance on the Brown corpus is higher than ours, but his system is trained on the Brown corpus and uses thirty times as much data as our system.
    Also, Palmer L Hearst's system requires POS tag information, which limits its use to those genres o
