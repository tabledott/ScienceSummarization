posed on logical forms.
    Derivations involving quantified terms first introduce an assumption that allows one to derive a simple term from a quantified term.
    This assumption is later discharged by the application of a quantifier.
    Conditions on the appropriate introduction and discharge of assumptions in natural deduction systems impose restrictions on the way that quantifiers may legitimately be applied.
    For example, a quantifier assumption may not be discharged if it depends on further assumptions that have not themselves been discharged.
    This prevents the occurrence of free variables in logical form, but without appeal to the syntax of logical form.
    The discharge of terms and term indices when evaluating QLF closely parallels the discharge of quantifier assumptions in categorial semantics.
    Indeed, the terms and the indices are precisely the assumptions introduced by quantified expressions, and which need to be discharged.
    Furthermore, the different orders in which quantifier a
