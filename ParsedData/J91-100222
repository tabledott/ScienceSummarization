 describe a method of building lexical chains for use as an aid in determining the structure of text.
    This section details how these lexical chains are formed, using a thesaurus as the main knowledge base.
    The method is intended to be useful for text in any general domain.
    Unlike methods that depend on a full understanding of text, our method is the basis of a computationally feasible approach to determining discourse structure.
    We developed our method in the following way.
    First, we took five texts, totaling 183 sentences, from general-interest magazines (Reader's Digest, Equinox, The New Yorker, Toronto, and The Toronto Star).
    Using our intuition (i.e., common sense and a knowledge of English), we identified the lexical chains in each text.
    We then formalized our intuitions into an algorithm, using our experience with the texts to set values for the following parameters (to be discussed below).
    The aim was to find efficient, plausible methods that will cover enough cases to e
