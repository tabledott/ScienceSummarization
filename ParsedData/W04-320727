    Fox (2002) has considered English and French, and Hwa et al. (2002) investigate Chinese and English.
    Xia et al. (2000) compare the rule templates of lexicalized tree adjoining grammars extracted from treebanks in English, Chinese, and Korean.
    In the context of machine translation, Dorr (1994) investigated divergences between two languages&#8217; structures.
    Some proposals have sidestepped the empirical issue entirely.

    Note a point of divergence of the SITG from our bilingual parsing system: SITG only allows words, but not higher structures, to match null in the other language and thus requires that the trees in parallel sentences be isomorphic.
    Yamada and Knight (2001) introduced tree-t
