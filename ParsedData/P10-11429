stance where the antecedent of a non-pronominal NP is a pronoun.
    To further reduce class skewness, some researchers employ a filtering mechanism on top of an instance creation method, thereby disallowing the creation of training instances from NP pairs that are unlikely to be coreferent, such as NP pairs that violate gender and number agreement (e.g., Strube et al. (2002), Yang et al.
    (2003)).
    While many instance creation methods are heuristic in nature (see Uryupina (2004) and Hoste and Daelemans (2005)), some are learning-based.
    For example, motivated by the fact that some coreference relations are harder to identify than the others (see Harabagiu et al. (2001)), Ng and Cardie (2002a) present a method for mining easy positive instances, in an attempt to avoid the inclusion of hard training instances that may complicate the acquisition of an accurate coreference model.
    Once a training set is created, we can train a coreference model using an off-the-shelf learning algorithm.
