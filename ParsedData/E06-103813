rely include such features.
    Instead we rely on the accuracy of POS tags to provide enough evidence.
    Next we added features over every dropped word in the original sentence between yj&#8722;1 and yj, if there were any.
    These include the POS of each dropped word, the POS of the dropped words conjoined with the POS of yj&#8722;1 and yj.
    If the dropped word is a verb, we add a feature indicating the actual verb (this is for common verbs like &#8220;is&#8221;, which are typically in compressions).
    Finally we add the POS context (bigram and trigram) of each dropped word.
