 test procedure, each document is scanned for instances of triggers from the training corpus.
    When an instance is found, the system tries to match the environment of the trigger against the set of patterns associated with that trigger.
    This pattern-matching process, if successful, will assign some of the mentions in the sentence as arguments of a potential event mention.
    The argument classifier is applied to the remaining mentions in the sentence; for any argument passing that classifier, the role classifier is used to assign a role to it.
    Finally, once all arguments have been assigned, the reportable-event classifier is applied to the potential event mention; if the result is successful, this event mention is reported.
  
  
    In this section we shall present our motivations based on error analysis for the baseline event tagger.
    Across a heterogeneous document corpus, a particular verb can sometimes be trigger and sometimes not, and can represent different event types.
    However, for
