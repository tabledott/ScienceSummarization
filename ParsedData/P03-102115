    We present results on the 2002 TIDES Chinese&#8211; English small data track task.
    The goal is the translation of news text from Chinese to English.
    Table 1 provides some statistics on the training, development and test corpus used.
    The system we use does not include rule-based components to translate numbers, dates or names.
    The basic feature functions were trained using the training corpus.
    The development corpus was used to optimize the parameters of the log-linear model.
    Translation results are reported on the test corpus.
    Table 2 shows the results obtained on the development corpus and Table 3 shows the results obtained on the test corpus.
    Italic numbers refer to results for which the difference to the best result (indicated in bold) is not statistically significant.
    For all error rates, we show the maximal occurring 95% confidence interval in any of the experiments for that column.
    The confidence intervals are computed
