 H be the set of annotators, T be the set of test items with 2 or more responses (non NIL or NAME) and hi be the set of responses for an item i ? T for annotator h ? H . For each i ? T we calculate the mode (mi) i.e. the most frequent response provided that there is a response more frequent than the others.
			The set of items where there is such a mode is referred to as TM . Let A (and AM ) be the set of items from T(or TM ) where the system provides at least one sub stitute.
			Let ai : i ? A (or ai : i ? AM ) be the set of guesses from the system for item i. For each i we calculate the multiset union (Hi) for all hi for all h ? H and for each unique type (res) in Hi willhave an associated frequency (freqres) for the num ber of times it appears in Hi.
			For example: Given an item (id 9999) for happy;a supposing the annotators had supplied answers as follows: annotator responses 1 glad merry 2 glad 3 cheerful glad 4 merry 5 jovial3The scoring measures are as described in the doc ument at http://nlp.cs.swart
