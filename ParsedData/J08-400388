    The first strictly incremental parser of this kind was described in Nivre (2003) and used for classifier-based parsing of Swedish by Nivre, Hall, and Nilsson (2004) and English by Nivre and Scholz (2004).
    Altogether it has now been applied to 19 different languages (Nivre et al. 2006, 2007; Hall et al.
    2007).
    Most algorithms in this tradition are restricted to projective dependency graphs, but it is possible to recover non-projective dependencies using pseudo-projective parsing (Nivre and Nilsson 2005).
    More recently, algorithms for non-projective classifier-based parsing have been proposed by Attardi (2006) and Nivre (2006a).
    The strictly deterministic parsing strategy has been relaxed in favor of n-best parsing by Johansson and Nugues (2006), among others.
    The dominant learning method in this tradition is support vector machines (Kudo and Matsumoto 2002; Yamada and Matsumoto 2003; Nivre et al. 2006) but memory-based learning has also been used (Nivre, Hall, and Nilsson 2004; N
