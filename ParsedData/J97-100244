e goals of the participants and classifies the segments into 1 of 12 different categories, some of which initiate a discourse expectation and some of which respond to an existing expectation.
    The coders were able to reproduce the most important aspects of the coding reliably, such as move segmentation, classifying moves as initiations or responses, and subclassifying initiation and response types.
    The game coding shows how moves are related to each other by placing into one game all moves that contribute to the same discourse goal, including the possibility of embedded games, such as those corresponding to clarification questions.
    The game coding was somewhat less reproducible but still reasonable.
    Individual coders can come to internally stable views of game structure.
    Finally, the transaction coding divides the entire dialogue into subdialogues corresponding to major steps in the participants' plan for completing the task.
    Although transaction coding has some problems, the coding can
