ssions that are about specific items, and use manually developed patterns to classify polarity.
			These patterns are high-quality, yielding quite highprecision, but very low recall.
			Their system classifies a much smaller proportion of the sentiment ex pressions in a corpus than ours does.
	
	
			In this paper, we present a new approach to phrase-level sentiment analysis that first determines whether an expression is neutral or polar and then disambiguates the polarity of the polar expressions.
			With this approach, we are able to automatically identify the contextual polarity for a large subset ofsentiment expressions, achieving results that are sig nificantly better than baseline.
