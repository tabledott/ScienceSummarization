d candidate sentence, the higher we want the measure to evaluate the distance between these sentences.
    State-of-the-art evaluation measures for MT penalize movement of blocks rather severely: ngram based scores such as BLEU or NIST still yield a high unigram precision if blocks are reordered.
    For higher-order n-grams, though, the precision drops.
    As a consequence, this affects the overall score significantly.
    WER, which is based on Levenshtein distance, penalizes the reordering of blocks even more heavily.
    It measures the distance by substitution, deletion and insertion operations for each word in a relocated block.
    PER, on the other hand, ignores the ordering of the words in the sentences completely.
    This often leads to an overly optimistic assessment of translation quality.
    The approach we pursue in this paper is to extend the Levenshtein distance by an additional operation, namely block movement.
    The number of blocks in a sentence is equal to the number of gaps among the
