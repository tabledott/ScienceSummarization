 we created a test set of analogy questions of the form &#8220;a is to b as c is to &#8221; testing base/comparative/superlative forms of adjectives; singular/plural forms of common nouns; possessive/non-possessive forms of common nouns; and base, past and 3rd person present tense forms of verbs.
    More precisely, we tagged 267M words of newspaper text with Penn Treebank POS tags (Marcus et al., 1993).
    We then selected 100 of the most frequent comparative adjectives (words labeled JJR); 100 of the most frequent plural nouns (NNS); 100 of the most frequent possessive nouns (NN POS); and 100 of the most frequent base form verbs (VB).
    We then systematically generated analogy questions by randomly matching each of the 100 words with 5 other words from the same category, and creating variants as indicated in Table 1.
    The total test set size is 8000.
    The test set is available online.
    1 In addition to syntactic analogy questions, we used the SemEval-2012 Task 2, Measuring Relation Similarity (J
