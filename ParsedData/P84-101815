tute a type of description that is structurally identical an ordinary FD but is distinguished on the grounds that it behaves slightly differently under unification.
    In particular, it is possible to unify a grammar with another grammar to produce a new grammar, but it is also possible to unify a grammar with a FD, in which case the result is a new FD.
    The rules for unifying grammars with grammars are the same as those for unifying FDs with FDs.
    The rules for unifying grammars with FDs, however, are slightly different and in the difference lies the ability of FUG to describe structures recursively and hence to provide for sentences of unbounded size.
    The rule for unifying grammars with FDs requires the grammars to be unified&#8212;following the rules for FD unification&#8212;with each individual constituent of the FD.
    By way of illustration, consider the grammar in (3).
    Like most grammars, it is a disjunction of clauses, one for each (nonterminal) category or constituent type in the lang
