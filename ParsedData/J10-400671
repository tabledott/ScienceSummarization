ked, not the ones originally selected by Pad&#180;o and Lapata for their tests).
    Frequencies are summed across dependency path links for word&#8211;link&#8211;word triples with the same first and second words.
    Suppose that soldier and gun occur in the tuples (soldier, have, gun) (frequency 3) and (soldier, use, gun) (frequency 37).
    In DepDM, this results in two features for soldier: (have, gun) and (use, gun).
    In DV, we would derive a single gun feature with frequency 40.
    As for the DM models, the Win and DV counts are converted to LMI weights, and negative LMI values are raised to 0.
    Win is a 30,693 x 30,693 matrix with about 110 million non-zero entries (density: 11.5%).
    DV is a 30,693 x 30,693 matrix with about 38 million non-zero values (density: 4%).

    Our first challenge comes from the classic data set of Rubenstein and Goodenough (1965), consisting of 65 noun pairs rated by 51 subjects on a 0&#8211;4 similarity scale.
