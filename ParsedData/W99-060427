eans that the sentence is semantically wrong.
    The human examiner was offered the translated sentences of the two approaches at the same time.
    As a result we expect a better possibility of reproduction.
    The results of the translation experiments using the single-word based approach and the alignment template approach on text input and on speech input are summarized in Table 2.
    The results are shown with and without the use of domain-specific preprocessing.
    The alignment template approach produces better translation results than the single-word based approach.
    From this we draw the conclusion that it is important to model word groups in source and target language.
    Considering the recognition word error rate of 31% the degradation of about 20% by speech input can be expected.
    The average translation time on an Alpha workstation for a single sentence is about one second for the alignment template appreach and 30 seconds for the single-word based search procedure.
