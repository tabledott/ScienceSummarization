 would like to be able to work with smaller test sets.
    The trade-off between fast testing and having meaningful results is at the very heart of this paper: The statistical significance tests we propose give us the means to assess the significance of test results.
    Let us start with the following experiment: We break up the test set into 100 blocks of 300 consecutive sentences each, translate each block, and compute the BLEU score for each block.
    We plot in Figure 2 the BLEU scores for each of the 100 blocks for the Spanish system.
    The BLEU scores for the 100 blocks vary from 21% to 37%.
    Many factors influence why some sentences are easier to translate than others: unknown words, sentence length, degree of syntactic and semantic divergence, and how the input and reference translation were generated &#8212; in case of Europarl they may be both translations from a third language.
    Factors that influence translation difficulty may be clustered.
    For instance, the original language, or the
