 1982) and allows the formation of compound tags; thus, the contraction I m is tagged as PPSS+BEM (PPSS for "non-third person nominative per- sonal pronoun" and BEM for "am, m".
  2 Subsequent projects have tended to elaborate the Brown Corpus tagset.
  For instance, the Lancaster-Oslo/Bergen (LOB) Corpus uses about 135 tags, the Lancaster UCREL group about 165 tags, and the London-Lund Cor- pus of Spoken English 197 tags.
  3 The rationale behind developing such large, richly articulated tagsets is to approach "the ideal of providing distinct codings for all classes of words having distinct grammatical behaviour" (Garside, Leech, and Sampson 1987, p. 167).
  2.1.1 Recoverability.
  Like the tagsets just mentioned, the Penn Treebank tagset is based on that of the Brown Corpus.
  However, the stochastic orientation of the Penn Tree- bank and the resulting concern with sparse data led us to modify the Brown Corpus tagset by paring it down considerably.
  A key strategy in reducing the tagset was to eliminate re
