facts (in a way that echoes Marcu's approach to some extent).
    We have done this by making certain restrictions on the RS trees that we are prepared to build.
    In particular, we make the following assumptions: With these assumptions, an RS tree is characterised (almost) by the sequence of facts at its leaves.
    Indeed, we have an algorithm that almost deterministically builds a tree from a sequence of facts, according to these principles.
    (The algorithm is not completely deterministic, because there may be more than one non-elaboration relation that can be used with two given facts as nucleus and satellite - our evaluation function won't, of course, differentiate between these).
    The algorithm for building a tree from a sequence essentially makes a tree that can be processed by a reader with minimal short-term memory.
    The tree will be right-branching and if the reader just remembers the last fact at any point, then they can follow the connection between the text so far and the next fact2 In
