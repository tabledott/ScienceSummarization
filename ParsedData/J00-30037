main we chose to model is the Switchboard corpus of human-human conversational telephone speech (Godfrey, Holliman, and McDaniel 1992) distributed by the Linguistic Data Consortium.
    Each conversation involved two randomly selected strangers who had been charged with talking informally about one of several, selfselected general-interest topics.
    To train our statistical models on this corpus, we combined an extensive effort in human hand-coding of DAs for each utterance, with a variety of automatic and semiautomatic tools.
    Our data consisted of a substantial portion of the Switchboard waveforms and corresponding transcripts, totaling 1,155 conversations.
    Before hand-labeling each utterance in the corpus with a DA, we needed to choose an utterance segmentation, as the raw Switchboard data is not segmented in a linguistically consistent way.
    To expedite the DA labeling task and remain consistent with other Switchboard-based research efforts, we made use of a version of the corpus that had been
