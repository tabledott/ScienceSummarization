dvantage is gradually diminished by the negative effect of error propagation due to the greedy inference strategy as sentences and dependencies get longer.
    MSTParser has a more even distribution of errors, which is expected given that the inference algorithm and feature representation should not prefer one type of arc over another.
    This naturally leads one to ask: Is it possible to integrate the two models in order to exploit their complementary strengths?
    This is the topic of the remainder of this paper.
  
  
    There are many conceivable ways of combining the two parsers, including more or less complex ensemble systems and voting schemes, which only perform the integration at parsing time.
    However, given that we are dealing with data-driven models, it should be possible to integrate at learning time, so that the two complementary models can learn from one another.
    In this paper, we propose to do this by letting one model generate features for the other.
