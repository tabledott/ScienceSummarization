nal framework we build on, in essence that of [Marcus 80], and explore briefly what a parser for this kind of grammar might look like; in appearance, its data structures and grammar will be little different from that developed in [Berwick 82].
    A series of syntactic phenomena will then be explored which resist elegant account within the earlier framework.
    For each phenomenon, we will present a simple Dtheoretic solution together with exposition of the relevant aspects of D-theory.
    One final introductory comment: That D-theory expresses syntactic structure in terms of dominance rather than direct dominance may be reminiscent of [Lasnik &amp; Kupin 19771 (henceforth L-K), but our use of the dominance predicate differs fundamentally from the L-K formulation both in the primacy of the predicate to the theory, and in the theory of syntax implied.
    Lasnik and Kupin's formalization of the Extended Standard Theory derives domination relations from their primary representation of linguistic structure, na
