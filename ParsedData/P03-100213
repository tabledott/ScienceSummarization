    Often, predicates are lexicalized by phrasal verbs, e.g. put up, put off.

    The results presented in this paper were obtained by training on Proposition Bank (PropBank) release 2002/7/15 (Kingsbury et al., 2002).
    Syntactic information was extracted from the gold-standard parses in TreeBank Release 2.
    As named entity information is not available in PropBank/TreeBank we tagged the training corpus with NE information using an open-d
