algorithm.
    When only one sequence is possible, disambiguation is successful.
    The samples used for calibration and testing were limited.
    First, Klein and Simmons (1963) performed &amp;quot;hand analysis of a sample [size unspecified] of Golden Grammatical Category Disambiguation by Statistical Optimization Book Encyclopedia text&amp;quot; (p. 342).
    Later, &amp;quot;[w]hen it was run on several pages from that encyclopedia, it correctly and unambiguously tagged slightly over 90% of the words&amp;quot; (p. 344).
    Further tests were run on small from the Americana from Scientific American.
    Klein and Simmons (1963) assert that &amp;quot;[o]riginal fears that sequences of four or more unidentified parts of speech would occur with great frequency were not substantiated in fact&amp;quot; (p. 3).
    This felicity, however, is an artifact.
    First, the relatively small set of categories reduces ambiguity.
    Second, a larger sample would reveal both (a) low-frequency ambiguities and (b) many
