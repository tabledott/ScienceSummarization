possible, and the addition of the full parse tree?based features is the only difference.
  The most interesting result of this comparison is that although each step of the shallow parsing information?based system exhibits very good performance, the overall performance is significantly inferior to the system that uses full parsing information.
  Our explanation is that chaining multiple processing stages to produce the final SRL analysis is crucial to understanding this analysis.
  Specifically, the quality of the information passed from one stage to the other is a decisive issue, and it is not necessarily judged simply by considering the F-measure.
  We conclude that, for the system architecture used in our study, the significance of full parsing information comes into play mostly at the pruning stage, where the candidates to be processed later are determined.
  In addition, we produce a state-of-the-art SRL system by combining different SRL systems based on two automatic full parsers (Collins 1999; Charniak
