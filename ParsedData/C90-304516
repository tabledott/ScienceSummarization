			The determiner can be introduced with the simple pair leading to the derivation step a3.
			Completing the deriva- tion using analogous elementary tree pairs, we might generate the final tree pair a4 of Figure 3.
			This final pairing associates the meaning By : vegetablc' (y).Vx : politician' (z).hates' ( z, y) with the sentence "Every politician hates some veg- etable."
			It should be clear that in a structure such as this with multiple NPs, the order of substitution of NPs de- termines the relative scope of the quantifiers, although it has no effect whatsoever on the syntactic structure.
			De- veloping this line of reasoning has led to several detailed predictions of this analysis of quantifier scope, which is beyond this paper's purview.
			In summary, however, the analysis is slightly more restrictive than that of Hobbs and Shieber (1987), making predictions regarding the scop
