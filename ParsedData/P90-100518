n CDG parsing, every word has k roles, so there are nx k nodes in total.
    A role can have nx possible values, where 1 is the size of L, so the maximum domain size is ax 1.
    Binary constraints may be imposed on arbitrary pairs of roles, and therefore the number of constraint matrices is at most proportional to (nk)2.
    Since the size of a constraint matrix is (n1)2, the total space complexity of the constraint network is 0(1210n4).
    Since k and 1 are grammatical constants, it is 0(n4) for the sentence length n. As the initial formation of a constraint network takes a computation time proportional to the size of the constraint network, the time complexity of the initial formation of a constraint network is OM.
    The complexity of adding new constraints to a constraint network never exceeds the complexity of the initial formation of a constraint network, so it is also bounded by 0(0).
    The most efficient filtering algorithm developed so far runs in 0(ea2) time, where e is the number of arcs and a
