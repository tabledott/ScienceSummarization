e uniform smoothing gives ploglin(x) = p1(x)&#945;/(p1(x)&#945; + q1(x)&#945;).
    This is actually less smooth than the original distribution p1(x): it preserves extreme values 0 and 1, and makes intermediate values more extreme.
    On the other hand, plinear(x) = &#945;p1(x) + (1 &#8722; &#945;)/2, which has the opposite properties: it moderates extreme values and tends to preserve intermediate values.
    An advantage of loglinear interpolation is that we can tune loglinear weights so as to maximize the true objective function, for instance BLEU; recall that our translation model is itself loglinear, with weights set to minimize errors.
    In fact, a limitation of the experiments described in this paper is that the loglinear weights for the glass-box techniques were optimized for BLEU using Och&#8217;s algorithm (Och, 2003), while the linear weights for black-box techniques were set heuristically.
    Obviously, this gives the glass-box techniques an advantage when the different smoothing techniques are
