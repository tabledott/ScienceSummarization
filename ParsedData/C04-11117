			An instance such as pear is assigned a hypernym fruit not because it necessarily occurs in any par ticular syntactic relationship with the word fruit, but because it belongs to the class of instances that does.
			The labeling of semantic classes is performed in three phases, as outlined below.
			3.1 Phase I. In the first phase of the algorithm, feature vec tors are extracted for each word that occurs in a semantic class.
			Each feature corresponds to a grammatical context in which the word occurs.
			For example, ?catch __?
			is a verb-object context.
			If the word wave occurred in this context, then the con text is a feature of wave.
			We then construct a mutual information vector MI(e) = (mie1, mie2, ?, miem) for each word e, where mief is the pointwise mutual information between word e and context f, which is defined as: N c N c N c ef m j ej n i if ef mi ??
			== ? = 11 log Table 2.
