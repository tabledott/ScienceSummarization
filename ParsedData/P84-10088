les given above all represent such cases.
    The first example, [case: -dat], arises in the plural paradigm of words like &amp;quot;Kind&amp;quot; child in German.
    Such words have two forms in the plural: &amp;quot;Kinder&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Kindern.&amp;quot; The latter is used only in the plural dative, the former in the other three cases (nominative, genitive, accusative).
    If we accept the view that there should be just one rather than three entries for the plural suffix &amp;quot;-er&amp;quot;, we have the choice between [ [ number; pi case: [-oat] The second alternative seems preferrable given the fact that there is, in this particular declension, a clear twoway contrast.
    The marked dative is in opposition with an unmarked form representing all the other cases.
    The Aecond example is from English.
    Although the features &amp;quot;number&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;person&amp;quot; are both clearly needed in English verb morphology, most verbs are very incompletely specified for them.
