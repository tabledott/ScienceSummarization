current text similarity metrics will fail in identifying any kind of connection between these texts.
    The only exception to this trend is perhaps the latent semantic analysis (LSA) method (Landauer et al., 1998), which represents an improvement over earlier attempts to use measures of semantic similarity for information retrieval (Voorhees, 1993), (Xu and Croft, 1996).
    LSA aims to find similar terms in large text collections, and measure similarity between texts by including these additional related words.
    However, to date LSA has not been used on a large scale, due to the complexity and computational cost associated with the algorithm, and perhaps also due to the &#8220;black-box&#8221; effect that does not allow for any deep insights into why some terms are selected as similar during the singular value decomposition process.
    In this paper, we explore a knowledge-based method for measuring the semantic similarity of texts.
    While there are several methods previously proposed for finding the
