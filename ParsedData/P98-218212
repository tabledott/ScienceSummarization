ave the same probability, the rightmost noun is chosen.)
    Once the head of the word is determined, the ratio of count 1 (with the head noun chosen) to count 2 is compared to an empirically set cutoff.
    If it falls below that cutoff, it is omitted.
    If it does not fall below the cutoff, then it is kept (provided its head noun is not later omitted).
  
  
    The input to the algorithm is a parsed corpus and a set of initial seed words for the desired category.
    Nouns are matched with their plurals in the corpus, and a single representation is settled upon for both, e.g. car(s).
    Co-Occurrence bigrams are collected for head nouns according to the notion of co-occurrence outlined above.
    The algorithm then proceeds as follows:
  
  
    We ran our algorithm against both the MUC-4 corpus and the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) corpus for a variety of categories, beginning with the categories of vehicle and weapon, both included in the five categories that Rk,S investigated in their paper.
