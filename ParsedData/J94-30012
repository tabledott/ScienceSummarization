lso defines a regular relation.
    A single finitestate transducer whose behavior simulates the whole set can therefore be constructed by composing the transducers corresponding to the individual rules.
    This transducer can be incorporated into efficient computational procedures that are far more economical in both recognition and production than any strategies using ordered rules directly.
    Since orthographic rules have similar formal properties to phonological rules, our results generalize to problems of word recognition in written text.
    The mathematical techniques we develop to analyze rewriting rule systems are not limited just to that particular collection of formal devices.
    They can also be applied to other recently proposed phonological or morphological rule systems.
    For example, we can show that Koskenniemi's (1983) two-level parallel rule systems also denote regular relations.
    Section 2 below provides an intuitive grounding for the rest of our discussion by illustrating the cor
