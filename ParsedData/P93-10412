rms the clauses or sentences into a segment.
    Youmans (1991) proposed VMP (vocabulary management profile) as an indicator of segment boundaries.
    VMP is a record of the number of new vocabulary terms introduced in an interval of text.
    However, VMP does not work well on a high-density text.
    The reason is that coherence of a segment should be determined not only by reiteration of words but also by lexical cohesion.
    Morris and Hirst (1991) used Roget's thesaurus to determine whether or not two words have lexical cohesion.
    Their method can capture almost all the types of lexical cohesion, e.g. systematic and non-systematic semantic relation.
    However it does not deal with strength of cohesiveness which suggests the degree of contribution to coherence of the segment.
    Kozima and Furugori (1993) defined lexical cohesiveness as semantic similarity between words, and proposed a method for measuring it.
    Similarity between words is computed by spreading activation on a semantic network w
