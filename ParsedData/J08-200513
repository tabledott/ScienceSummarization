  An argument is considered embedded in another argument if the second argument completely covers the first one.
  Arguments are exclusively overlapping if they are overlapping but are not embedded.

  In particular, the goal of pruning and argument identification is to identify argument candidates for a given verb predicate.
  In the first three stages, however, decisions are independently made for each argument, and information across arguments is not 260 Punyakanok, Roth, and Yih Importance of Parsing and Inference in SRL incorporated.
  The final inference stage allows us to use this type of information along with linguistic and structural constraints in order to make consistent global predictions.
