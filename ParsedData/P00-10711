finding answers in large collections of documents relies on natural language processing (NLP) techniques in novel ways.
    First, we perform the processing of the question by combining syntactic information, resulting from a shallow parse, with semantic information that characterizes the question (e.g. question type, question focus).
    Secondly, the search for the answer is based on a novel form of indexing, called paragraph indexing (Moldovan and Mihalcea 2000).
    Finally, in order to extract answers and to evaluate their correctness, we use a battery of abductive techniques (Hobbs et al.1993), some based on empirical methods, some on lexicosemantic information.
    The principles that have guided our paragraph indexing and the abductive inference of the answers are reported in (Harabagiu and Maiorano 1999).
    2 Overview of the LASSO Q/A System The architecture of LASSO (Moldovan, Harabagiu et. al 1999) comprises three modules: Question Processing module, Paragraph Indexing module and Answer Processin
