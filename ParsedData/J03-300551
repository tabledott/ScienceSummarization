    To summarize, the results presented in this section indicate that Web counts are indeed a valid way of obtaining counts for bigrams that are unseen in a given corpus: They correlate reliably with counts re-created using class-based smoothing.
    For seen bigrams, we found that Web counts correlate with counts that were re-created using smoothing techniques (after removing the seen bigrams from the training corpus).
    For the task of predicting plausibility judgments, we were able to show that Web counts outperform re-created counts, both for seen and for unseen bigrams.
    Finally, we found that Web counts for seen bigrams correlate better than re-created counts with the real corpus counts.
    It is beyond the scope of the present study to undertake a full comparison between Web counts and frequencies re-created using all available smoothing techniques (and all available taxonomies that might be used fo
