    We performed several types of analysis to better understand why the new model performs better.
    We first look at global changes, and then at changes at the sentence level.
    It is important to keep in mind that while the reranker seems to be key to our performance improvement, the reranker per se never sees the extra data.
    It only sees the 50-best lists produced by the first-stage parser.
    Thus, the nature of the changes to this output is important.
    We have already noted that the first-stage parser&#8217;s one-best has significantly improved (see Table 1).
    In Table 4, we see that the 50-best oracle rate also improves from 95.5% for the original first-stage parser, to 96.4% for our final model.
    We do not show it here, but if we self-train using first-stage one-best, there is no change in oracle rate.
    The first-stage parser also becomes more &#8220;decisive.&#8221; The average (geometric mean) of 1092(Pr(1best) / Pr(50th-best)) (i.e. the ratios between the probabilities in log sp
