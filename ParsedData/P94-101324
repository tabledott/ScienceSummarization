ous, as determined in Step 1, the correct pattern is printed.
    Ambiguous words have a table of the possible accent patterns and a pointer to a decision list, either for that specific word or its ambiguity class (as determined in Step 6).
    This given list is searched for the highest ranking match in the word's context, and a classification number is returned, indicating the most likely of the word's accent patterns given the context'.
    From a statistical perspective, the evidence at the top of this list will most reliably disambiguate the target word.
    Given a word in a new context to be assigned an accent pattern, if we may only base the classification on a single line in the decision list, it should be the highest ranking pattern that is present in the target context.
    This is uncontroversial, and is solidly based in Bayesian decision theory.
    The question, however, is what to do with the lessreliable evidence that may also be present in the target context.
    The common tradition is to co
