ly .50 precision and .81 recall.
    However, all three studies are done on different test collections and so comparisons are at best suggestive.
    This article has described an algorithm that uses changes in patterns of lexical repetition as the cue for the segmentation of expository texts into multi-paragraph subtopic structure.
    It has also advocated the investigation and use of the multi-paragraph discourse unit, something that had not been explored .in the computational literature until this work was introduced.
    The algorithms described here are fully implemented, and use term repetition alone, without requiring thesaural relations, knowledge bases, or inference mechanisms.
    Evaluation reveals acceptable performance when compared against human judgments of segmentation, although there is room for improvement.
    TextTiles have already been integrated into a user interface in an information retrieval system (Hearst 1995) and have been used successfully for segmenting Arabic newspaper texts, w
