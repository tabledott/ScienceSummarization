l of these aspects of context are necessary for disambiguation, yet none is sufficient.
    We propose a probabilistic model of context for disambiguation in parsing, HBG, which incorporates the intuitions of these previous works into one unified framework.
    Let p(T, w) be the joint probability of generating the word string w7 and the parse tree T. Given /42, our parser chooses as its parse tree that tree T* for which where P(7.4) is the set of all parses produced by the grammar for the sentence w7.
    Many aspects of the input sentence that might be relevant to the decision-making process participate in the probabilistic model, providing a very rich if not the richest model of context ever attempted in a probabilistic parsing model.
    In this paper, we will motivate and define the HBG model, describe the task domain, give an overview of the grammar, describe the proposed HBG model, and present the results of experiments comparing HBG with an existing state-ofthe-art model.
