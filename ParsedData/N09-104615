this, an additional feature was added that fired when a proposed segment was one of a set N of 30 nonwords that we saw quite frequently.
    The weights shown in Table 2 are those learned by maximum likelihood training on models both with and without the special German features, which are indicated with &#8224;.
  
  
    To give some sense of the performance of the model in terms of its ability to generate lattices independently of a translation task, we present precision and recall of segmentations for pruning parameters (cf.
    Section 3.2) ranging from &#945; = 0 to &#945; = 5.
    Precision measures the number of paths in the hypothesized lattice that correspond to paths in the reference lattice; recall measures the number of paths in the reference lattices that are found in the hypothesis lattice.
    Figure 3 shows the effect of manipulating the density parameter on the precision and recall of the German lattices.
    Note that very high recall is possible; however, the German-only features have a sig
