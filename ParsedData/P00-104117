    Problems with evaluation: Some of the statistics that we presented in the previous discussion suggest that this relatively simple statistical summarization system is not very good compared to some of the extraction based summarization systems that have been presented elsewhere (e.g., (Radev and Mani, 1997)).
    However, it is worth emphasizing that many of the headlines generated by the system were quite good, but were penalized because our evaluation metric was based on the word-error rate and the generated headline terms did not exactly match the original ones.
    A quick manual scan of some of the failures that might have been scored as successes 7Unlike the data in Table 1, these headlines contain only six words or fewer. in a subjective manual evaluation indicated that some of these errors could not have been avoided without adding knowledge to the system, for example, allowing the use of alternate terms for referring to collective nouns.
    Some of these errors are shown in Table 3
