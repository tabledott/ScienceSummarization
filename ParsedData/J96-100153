t P'.
    When given official languages as input, the first iteration of Step 2 simply sets P' to P, the second iteration selects 35 word pairs out of the possible 110 candidates, the third iteration selects 61 word triplets, and so on until the final (ninth) iteration when none of the three elements of P passes the threshold Td and thus P' has no elements.
    Stage 2&#8212;Step 3: Identifying the locally best translation.
    Once the set of surviving translations P' has been computed, Champollion checks if it is empty.
    If it is, there cannot be any more translations to be considered, so Champollion proceeds to Step 5.
    If P' is not empty, Champollion locates the translation that looks locally the best; that is, among all members of P' analyzed at this iteration, the translation that has the highest Dice coefficient value with the source collocation.
    This translation is saved in a table C of candidate final translations, along with its length in words and its similarity score.
