ivial 0.25 accuracy score obtained by assigning each test pair in the balanced dataset to one of the four classes): judgments returned by the two classifiers are composed into a single multi-directional judgment (&#8220;YES-YES&#8221;=&#8220;bidirectional&#8221;, &#8220;YESNO&#8221;=&#8220;forward&#8221;, &#8220;NO-YES&#8221;=&#8220;backward&#8221;, &#8220;NO-NO&#8221;=&#8220;no entailment&#8221;); Both the baselines have been calculated with the LIBSVM package (Chang and Lin, 2011), using a linear kernel with default parameters.
    Baseline results are reported in Table 2.
    Although the four CLTE datasets are derived from the same monolingual EN-EN corpus, baseline results present slight differences due to the effect of translation into different languages.
  
  
    Participants were allowed to submit up to five runs for each language combination.
    A total of 17 teams registered to participate in the task and downloaded the training set.
    Out of them, 12 downloaded the test set and 10 (including o
