hibit) and the causative/inchoative alternation (which the unaccusatives exhibit); thus, her method does not discriminate two of our classes.
    It is likely that a combination of our method, which makes the necessary thematic distinctions, and her more sophisticated method of detecting alternations would give very good results.
    The classification results show that our method is powerful, and suited to the classification of unknown verbs.
    However, we have not yet addressed the problem of verbs that can have multiple classifications.
    We think that many cases of ambiguous classification of the lexical entry for a verb can be addressed with the notion of intersective sets introduced by Dang et al. (1998).
    This is an important concept, which proposes that &amp;quot;regular&amp;quot; ambiguity in classification&#8212;i.e., sets of verbs that have the same multi-way classifications according to Levin (1993)&#8212;can be captured with a finer-grained notion of lexical semantic classes.
    Thus, sub
