case.As expected, the Single Malt parser has lower preci sion than recall for root dependents, but the Blendedparser has even lower precision (and somewhat bet ter recall), indicating that the fragmentation is even more severe in this case.10 By contrast, we see that precision and recall for other dependencies improve across the board, especially for longer dependencies,which probably means that the effect of error propa gation is mitigated by the use of an ensemble system,even if each of the component parsers is determinis tic in itself.
	
	
			We have shown that deterministic, classifier-based dependency parsing, with careful optimization, can give highly accurate dependency parsing for a wide range of languages, as illustrated by the performanceof the Single Malt parser.
			We have also demonstrated that an ensemble of deterministic, classifier based dependency parsers, built on top of a tuned single-parser system, can give even higher accuracy, as shown by the results of the Blended parser, whichhas the h
