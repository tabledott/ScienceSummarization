    Figures 8 and 9 show the BLEU scores obtained by our MT systems.
    The 95% confidence intervals of the scores computed by bootstrap resampling (Koehn 2004) are marked on the graphs; the delta value is around 1.2 for Arabic-English and 1 for Chinese-English.
    As the results show, the automatically extracted additional training data yields significant improvements in performance over most initial training corpora for both language pairs.
    At least for Chinese-English, the improvements are quite comparable to those produced by the human-translated data.
    And, as can be expected, the impact of the extracted data decreases as the size of the initial corpus increases.
    In order to check that the classifier really does something important, we performed a few experiments without it.
    After the article selection step, we simply paired each foreign document with the best-matching English one, assumed they are parallel, sentence-aligned them with a generic sentence alignment metho
