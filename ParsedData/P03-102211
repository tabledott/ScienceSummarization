tures mdist 3mf3p and mdist 3n (21, 22) are refinements of the mdist feature.
    They measure the distance in markables between antecedent and anaphor, but in doing so they take the agreement value of the anaphor into account.
    For anaphors with an agreement value of 3mf or 3p, mdist 3mf3p is measured as D = 1 + the number of NP-markables between anaphor and potential antecedent.
    Anaphors with an agreement value of 3n, (i.e. it or that), on the other hand, potentially have non-NP-antecedents, so mdist 3n is measured as D + the number of anaphorically accessible4 Sand VP-markables between anaphor and potential antecedent.
    The feature ante tfifd (23) is supposed to capture the relative importance of an expression for a dialogue.
    The underlying assumption is that the higher the importance of a non-NP expression, the higher the probability of its being referred back to.
    For our purposes, we calculated TF for every word by counting its frequency in each of our twenty Switchboard dialogues separ
