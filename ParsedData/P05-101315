    As shown in Table 3, the proportion of sentences containing some non-projective dependency ranges from about 15% in DDT to almost 25% in PDT.
    However, the overall percentage of non-projective arcs is less than 2% in PDT and less than 1% in DDT.
    The last four columns in Table 3 show the distribution of nonprojective arcs with respect to the number of lifts required.
    It is worth noting that, although nonprojective constructions are less frequent in DDT than in PDT, they seem to be more deeply nested, since only about 80% can be projectivized with a single lift, while almost 95% of the non-projective arcs in PDT only require a single lift.
    In the second part of the experiment, we applied the inverse transformation based on breadth-first search under the three different encoding schemes.
    The results are given in Table 4.
    As expected, the most informative encoding, Head+Path, gives the highest accuracy with over 99% of all non-projective arcs being recovered correctly in both data sets
