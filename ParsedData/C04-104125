hin some factor, ?, of the highest scoring category forthat cell in the chart.
			Here we simply use the ex ponential of the inside score of a category as the beam score; the inside score for a category c is the sum over all sub-derivations dominated by c of the weights of the features in those sub-derivations (see Clark and Curran (2004).5The value of ? that we use here reduces the accu racy of the parser on section 00 by a small amount (0.3% labelled F-score), but has a significant impacton parser speed, reducing the parse times by a fur ther 33%.
			The final parser beam row combines thebeam search with the fast, reduced coverage config uration of the parser, producing speeds of over 50 sentences per second.
			Table 5 gives the percentage of sentences which are parsed at each supertagger level, for both the new and old parsing strategies.
			The results show that, for the old approach, most of the sentences areparsed using the least restrictive setting of the supertagger (?
