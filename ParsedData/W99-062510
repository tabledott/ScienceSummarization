r of textual units in which the primitive appeared in the corpus.
    For a primitive element which compares single words, this is the number of textual units which contain that word in the corpus; for a noun phrase, this is the number of textual units that contain noun phrases that share the same head; and similarly for other primitive types.
    We multiply each feature's value by: number of textual units (2) Number of textual units containing this primitive Since each normalization is optional, there are four variations for each primitive feature.
    4.2 Composite Features addition to the above that compare single items from each text unit, we which combine pairs of primitive features.
    Composite features are defined by placing different types of restrictions on the participating primitive features: 205 Figure 2: A composite feature over word primitives with a restriction on order would count the pair &amp;quot;two&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;contact&amp;quot; as a match because they occur with the same re
