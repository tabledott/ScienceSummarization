nd using a training corpus.
    They are then stored in a table and loaded at running time.
    Step 5: Final Decision.
    The final reduction decisions are based on the results from all the earlier steps.
    To decide which phrases to remove, the system traverses the sentence parse tree, which now have been annotated with different types of information from earlier steps, in the top-down order and decides which subtrees should be removed, reduced or unchanged.
    A subtree (i.e., a phrase) is removed only if it is not grammatically obligatory, not the focus of the local context (indicated by a low importance score), and has a reasonable probability of being removed by humans.
    Figure 1 shows sample output of the reduction program.
    The reduced sentences produced by humans are also provided for comparison.
  
  
    We define a measure called success rate to evaluate the performance of our sentence reduction program.
