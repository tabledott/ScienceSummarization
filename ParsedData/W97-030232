 this is not unlikely.
    Hwa (personal communication) using a model similar to PCFGs, Stochastic Lexicalized Tree Insertion Grammars, also was not able to obtain a speedup using this technique.
    There is previous work in the speech recognition community on automatically optimizing some parameters (Schwartz et al., 1992).
    However, this previous work differed significantly from ours both in the techniques used, and in the parameters optimized.
    In particular, previous work focused on optimizing weights for various components, such as the language model component.
    In contrast, we optimize thresholding parameters.
    Previous techniques could not be used or easily adapted to thresholding parameters.
  
  
    The inner loop of the CKY algorithm, which determines for every pair of cells what nodes must be added to the parent, can be written in several different ways.
    Which way this is done interacts with thresholding techniques.
    There are two possibilities, as shown in Figure 7.
    We use
