parser to one or possibly several closely-matching derivations and these are used to derive probabilities for the LR table using (weighted) Laplace estimation.
    Actions in the table involving rules marked as peripheral are assigned a uniform low prior probability to ensure that derivations involving such rules are consistently lower ranked than those involving only core rules.
    To improve performance on WSJ text, we examined some parse failures from sections other than section 23 to identify patterns of consistent failure.
    We then manually modified and extended the grammar with a further 6 rules, mostly to handle cases of indirect and direct quotation that are very common in this dataset.
    This involved 3 days&#8217; work.
    Once completed, the parser was retrained on the original data.
    A subsequent limited inspection of top-ranked parses led us to disable 6 existing rules which applied too freely to the WSJ text; these were designed to analyse auxiliary ellipsis which appears to be rare in
