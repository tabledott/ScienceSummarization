 that a larger corpus for learning SPs may be needed to support stronger performance on the more restrictive methods.
    The system in Figure 1b), selected for maximizing sensitivity while maintaining high specificity, was 70% correct in predicting correct inferences.
    Figure 2 illustrates the ROC curve for all our systems and parameter combinations on the TEST set.
    ROC curves plot the true positive rate against the false positive rate.
    The near-diagonal line plots the three baseline systems.
    Several trends can be observed from this figure.
    First, systems using the semantic classes from WordNet tend to perform less well than systems using CBC classes.
    As discussed in Section 4.2, we used a very simplistic extraction of semantic classes from WordNet.
    The results in Figure 2 serve as a lower bound on what could be achieved with a better extraction from WordNet.
    Upon inspection of instances that WordNet got incorrect but CBC got correct, it seemed that CBC had a much higher lexica
