ould note that the results in Collins et al (1999) are different then reported here due to different training and testing data sets.One concern raised in Section 2.2.1 is that search ing the entire space of non-projective trees couldcause problems for languages that are primarily projective.
			However, as we can see, this is not a prob lem.
			This is because the model sets its weights with respect to the parsing algorithm and will disfavor features over unlikely non-projective edges.
			Since the space of projective trees is a subset ofthe space of non-projective trees, it is natural to won der how the Chu-Liu-Edmonds parsing algorithm performs on projective data since it is asymptotically better than the Eisner algorithm.
			Table 2 shows theresults for English projective dependency trees ex tracted from the Penn Treebank (Marcus et al, 1993) using the rules of Yamada and Matsumoto (2003).
