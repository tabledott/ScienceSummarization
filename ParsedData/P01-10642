 broadcast news story into individual stories (Allan et al., 1998).
    In this application, systems relying on supervised learning (Yamron et al., 1998; Beeferman et al., 1999) achieve good performance because there are plenty of training data in the domain.
    These systems, however, can not be applied to domains for which no training data exist.
    The text segmentation algorithm described in this paper is intended to be applied to the summarization of documents or speeches.
    Therefore, it should be able to handle domain-independent texts.
    The algorithm thus does not use any training data.
    It requires only the given documents for segmentation.
    It can, however, incorporate training data when they are available, as discussed in Section 5.
    The algorithm selects the optimum segmentation in terms of the probability defined by a statistical model.
    This is a new approach for domain-independent text segmentation.
    Previous approaches usually used lexical cohesion to segment texts into t
