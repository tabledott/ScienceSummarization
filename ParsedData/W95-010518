, w2_1 and using those choices, assumed to be correct, as the basis for disambiguating wi.
    The algorithm presented here falls between those two alternatives.
    A final, important difference between this algorithm and previous algorithms for sense disambiguation is that it offers the possibility of assigning higher-level WordNet categories rather than lowest-level sense labels.
    It is a simple modification to the algorithm to assign values of co not only to synsets directly containing words in W, but to any ancestors of those synsets &#8212; one need only let the list of synsets associated with each word wi (i.e, Si in the problem statement of Section 2.1) also include any synset that is an ancestor of any synset containing word wi.
    Assuming that num senses (w[i] ) and s ens e [ , k] are reinterpreted accordingly, the algorithm will compute co not only for the synsets directly including words in W, but also for any higher-level abstractions of them.
    Example.
    Consider the word group doctor,
