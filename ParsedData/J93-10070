  Retrieving Collocations From Text: Xtract
  
    Natural languages are full of collocations, recurrent combinations of words that co-occur more often than expected by chance and that correspond to arbitrary word usages.
    Recent work in lexicography indicates that collocations are pervasive in English; apparently, they are common in all types of writing, including both technical and nontechnical genres.
    Several approaches have been proposed to retrieve various types of collocations from the analysis of large samples of textual data.
    These techniques automatically produce large numbers of collocations along with statistical figures intended to reflect the relevance of the associations.
    However, none of these techniques provides functional information along with the collocation.
    Also, the results produced often contained improper word associations reflecting some spurious aspect of the training corpus that did not stand for true collocations.
    In this paper, we describe a set of techniqu
