ssifier is exposed to non-NP-antecedents without being able to differentiate between NP- and non-NP-antecedents.
    By adding the feature ante exp type the classifier is enabled to address NP- and non-NP-antecedents differently, which results in a considerable gain in performance.
    Substituting the wdist feature with the wdist ic feature also improves the performance considerably.
    The ante tfidf feature only contributes marginally to the overall performance.
    &#8211; These results show that it pays off to consider features particularly designed for spoken dialogue.
    Table 6 presents the results for 3p pronouns, which do not have non-NP-antecedents.
    Many of these pronouns do not have an antecedent at all.
    Others are vague in that human annotators felt them to be referential, but could not determine an antecedent.
    Since we did not address that issue in depth, the classifier tries to find antecedents for these pronouns indiscriminately, which results in rather low precision figures, as
