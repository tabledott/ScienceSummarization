ilter to an individual user&#8217;s inbox because the user has her own, and presumably very different, distribution of emails and notion of spams.
    Despite the importance of domain adaptation in NLP, currently there are no standard methods for solving this problem.
    An immediate possible solution is semi-supervised learning, where we simply treat the target instances as unlabeled data but do not distinguish the two domains.
    However, given that the source data and the target data are from different distributions, we should expect to do better by exploiting the domain difference.
    Recently there have been some studies addressing domain adaptation from different perspectives (Roark and Bacchiani, 2003; Chelba and Acero, 2004; Florian et al., 2004; Daum&#180;e III and Marcu, 2006; Blitzer et al., 2006).
    However, there have not been many studies that focus on the difference between the instance distributions in the two domains.
    A detailed discussion on related work is given in Section 5.
