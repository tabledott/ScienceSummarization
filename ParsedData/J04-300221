 annotation project involved a single annotator, who performed subjective-element annotations on the newsgroup corpus NG-SE.
    The agreement results above suggest that good levels of agreement can be achieved at higher levels of classification (sentence and document), but agreement at the expression level is more challenging.
    The agreement values are lower for the expression-level annotations but are still much higher than that expected by chance.
    Note that our word-based analysis of agreement is a tough measure, because it requires that exactly the same words be identified by both annotators.
    Consider the following example from WSJ-SE: D: (played the role well) (obligatory ragged jeans a thicket of long hair and rejection of all things conventional) M: played the role (well) (obligatory) (ragged) jeans a (thicket) of long hair and (rejection) of (all things conventional) Judge D in the example consistently identifies entire phrases as subjective, while judge M prefers to select discrete lexical
