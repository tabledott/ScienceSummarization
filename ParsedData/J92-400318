 Obviously, Ik-i = Ik(i,j).
    The values of Pk-1, prk_i, and qk_...1 can be obtained easily from Pk, plk, prk, and qk.
    If 1 and m both denote indices neither of which is equal to either i or j, then it is easy to establish that Finally, we must evaluate sk_1(i) and Lk_1(/, i) from equations 15 and 16.
    Thus, the entire update process requires something on the order of V2 computations in the course of which we will determine the next pair of clusters to merge.
    The algorithm, then, is of order V3.
    Although we have described this algorithm as one for finding clusters, we actually determine much more.
    If we continue the algorithm for V - 1 merges, then we will have a single cluster which, of course, will be the entire vocabulary.
    The order in which clusters are merged, however, determines a binary tree the root of which corresponds reps representatives representative rep Sample subtrees from a 1,000-word mutual information tree. to this single cluster and the leaves of which correspond to
