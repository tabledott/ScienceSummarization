of the features and relations in DepBank.
    They compare performance of a grammatically cut-down and complete version of the XLE parser to the publically available version of Collins&#8217; parser.
    One fifth of DepBank is held out to optimize the speed and accuracy of the three systems.
    They conclude from the results of these experiments that the cut-down XLE parser is two-thirds the speed of Collins&#8217; Model 3 but 12% more accurate, while the complete XLE system is 20% more accurate but five times slower.
    F1-score percentages range from the mid- to high-70s, suggesting that the relational evaluation is harder than PARSEVAL.
    Both Collins&#8217; Model 3 and the XLE Parser use lexicalized models for parse selection trained on the rest of the WSJ PTB.
    Therefore, although Kaplan et al. demonstrate an improvement in accuracy at some cost to speed, there remain questions concerning viability for applications, at some remove from the financial news domain, for which substantial treebanks ar
