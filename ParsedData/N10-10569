at not many new simplifications were found; so, again, we do not report results here.
    An important direction for future work is to differentially weight the edit instances within a revision, as opposed to placing equal trust in all of them; this could prevent our bootstrapping methods from giving common fixes (e.g., &#8220;a&#8221; &#8212;* &#8220;the&#8221;) high scores.
  
  
    We obtained the revision histories of both SimpleEW (November 2009 snapshot) and ComplexEW (January 2008 snapshot).
    In total, &#8212;1.5M revisions for 81733 SimpleEW articles were processed (only 30% involved textual changes).
    For ComplexEW, we processed &#8212;16M revisions for 19407 articles.
    Extracting lexical edit instances.
    For each article, we aligned sentences in each pair of adjacent versions using tf-idf scores in a way similar to Nelken and Shieber [6] (this produced satisfying results because revisions tended to represent small changes).
    From the aligned sentence pairs, we obtained the aforementi
