re from the CoNLL shared-tasks on dependency parsing (Buchholz and Marsi, 2006; Nivre et al., 2007).
    We use English (en) only as a source language throughout the paper.
    Additionally, we use the following eight languages as both source and target languages: Danish (da), Dutch (nl), German (de), Greek (el), Italian (it), Portuguese (pt), Spanish (es) and Swedish (sv).
    For languages that were included in both the 2006 and 2007 tasks, we used the treebank from the latter.
    We focused on this subset of languages because they are Indo-European and a significant amount of parallel data exists for each language.
    By presenting results on eight languages our study is already more comprehensive than most previous work in this area.
    However, the restriction to Indo-European languages does make the results less conclusive when one wishes to transfer a parser from English to Chinese, for example.
    To account for this, we report additional results in the discussion for non-IndoEuropean languages.
