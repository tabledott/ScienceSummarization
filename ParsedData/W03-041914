ng and Johnson (2003).
    We have combined the results of the sixteen system in order to see if there was room for improvement.
    We converted the output of the systems to the same IOB tagging representation and searched for the set of systems from which the best tags for the development data could be obtained with majority voting.
    The optimal set of systems was determined by performing a bidirectional hill-climbing search (Caruana and Freitag, 1994) with beam size 9, starting from zero features.
    A majority vote of five systems (Chieu and Ng, 2003; Florian et al., 2003; Klein et al., 2003; McCallum and Li, 2003; Whitelaw and Patrick, 2003) performed best on the English development data.
    Another combination of five systems (Carreras et al., 2003b; Mayfield et al., 2003; McCallum and Li, 2003; Munro et al., 2003; Zhang and Johnson, 2003) obtained the best result for the German development data.
    We have performed a majority vote with these sets of systems on the related test sets and obtained
