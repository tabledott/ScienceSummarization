			= pS,0,n. The second step of the sampling algorithm uses the function SAMPLE, which returns a sample from PG(t|w, ?) given the PCFG (G, ?) and the insidetable pA,i,k. SAMPLE takes as arguments a non terminal A ? N and a pair of string positions 0 ? i &lt; k ? n and returns a tree drawn from PGA(t|wi,k, ?).
			It functions in a top-down fashion, selecting the production A ? BC to expand the A, and then recursively calling itself to expand B and C respectively.
