 each input word by means of marker passing; disambiguation is accomplished because only one concept node associated with a given input word is likely to be involved in the most direct path found between the two input words.
    Quillian's work informed later dictionary-based approaches to WSD (see Section 2.3.1).
    Subsequent AI-based approaches exploited the use of frames containing information about words and their roles and relations to other words in individual sentences.
    For example, Hayes (1976, 1977a, 1977b, 1978) uses a combination of a semantic network and case frames.
    The network consists of nodes representing noun senses and links represented by verb senses; case frames impose IS-A and PART-OF relations on the network.
    As in Quillian's system, the network is traversed to find chains of connections between words.
    Hayes work shows that homonyms can be fairly accurately disambiguated using this approach, but it is less successful for other kinds of polysemy.
