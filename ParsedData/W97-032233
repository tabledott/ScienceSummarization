    Supervised learning approaches to word&#8212;sense disambiguation fall victim to the knowledge acquisition bottleneck.
    The creation of sense tagged text sufficient to serve as a training sample is expensive and time consuming.
    This bottleneck is eliminated through the use of unsupervised learning approaches which distinguish the sense of a word based only on features that can be automatically identified.
    In this study, we evaluated the performance of three unsupervised learning algorithms on the disambiguation of 13 words in naturally occurring text.
    The algorithms are McQuitty's similarity analysis, Ward's minimum-variance method, and the EM algorithm.
    Our findings show that each of these algorithms is negatively impacted by highly skewed sense distributions.
    Our methods and feature sets were found to be most successful in disambiguating nouns rather than adjectives or verbs.
    Overall, the most successful of our procedures was McQuitty's similarity analysis in c
