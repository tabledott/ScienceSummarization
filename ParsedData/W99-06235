nstituents with no crossing brackets.
    There are simply not enough votes remaining to allow any of the crossing structures to enter the hypothesized constituent set.
    Lemma: If the number of votes required by constituent voting is greater than half of the parsers under consideration the resulting structure has no crossing constituents.
    IL+-1Proof: Assume a pair of crossing constituents appears in the output of the constituent voting technique using k parsers.
    Call the crossing constituents A and B.
    A receives a votes, and B receives b votes.
    Each of the constituents must have received at least 1 votes from the k parsers, so a &gt; I1 and 2 &#8212; 2k&#177;-1 b &gt; ri-5-111.
    Let s = a + b.
    None of the parsers produce parses with crossing brackets, so none of them votes for both of the assumed constituents.
    Hence, s &lt; k. But by addition of the votes on the two parses, s &gt; 2N-11&gt; k, a contradiction.
