ord in the original lexicon to identify all potential circumfixes that could have been valid for the word.
    For example, suppose that the lists of potential suffixes and prefixes contained &#8220;-ed&#8221; and &#8220;re-&#8221; respectively.
    Note also that NULL exists by default in both lists as well.
    If we consider the word &#8220;realigned&#8221; from our lexicon SC,, we would find that its potential circumfixes would be NULL/ed, re/NULL, and re/ed and the corresponding pseudo-stems would be &#8220;realign,&#8221; &#8220;aligned,&#8221; and &#8220;align,&#8221; respectively, From SC,, we also note that circumfixes re/ed and NULL/ing share the pseudo-stems &#8220;us,&#8221; &#8220;align,&#8221; and &#8220;view&#8221; so a rule could be created: re/ed&lt;NULL/ing.
    This means that word pairs such as &#8220;reused/using&#8221; and &#8220;realigned/aligning&#8221; would be deemed PPMVs.
    Although the choices in T1 through T4 is somewhat arbitrary, we chose T1=T2=T 3=10 and T4=3.
