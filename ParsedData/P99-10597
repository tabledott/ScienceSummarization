s 0(n5 &#8226; IVD13).
    In other words, it is a factor of n2 slower than a comparable non-lexicalized CFG.
  
  
    In this section we give a recognition algorithm for bilexical CNF context-free grammars, which runs in time 0(n4 &#8226; max(p, IVO)) 0(n4 &#8226; VDI).
    Here p is the maximum number of productions sharing the same pair of terminal symbols (e.g., the pair (b, a) in production (1)).
    The new algorithm is asymptotically more efficient than the CKY algorithm, when restricted to input instances satisfying the relation n &lt; IVTI.
    Where CKY recognizes only constituent substrings of the input, the new algorithm can recognize three types of subderivations, shown and described in Figure 1(a).
    A declarative specification of the algorithm is given in Figure 1(b).
    The derivability conditions of (a) are guaranteed by (b), by induction, and the correctness of the acceptance condition (see caption) follows.
    This declarative specification, like CKY, may be implemented by bottom-up dy
