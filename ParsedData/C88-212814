t-out manner (treating the agenda s a stack) we have a "greedy" parsing algorithm, which pursues parsing possibilities depth- first and backtracks when dead-ends occur.
  An interesting possibility involves ordering lemmas as follows: ?
  Highest priority are prediction items, then lexical items, then other conditional items, then other nonconditional items.
  If (1) does not order items, items ending farther to the right have higher priority?
  If (1) and (2) do not order items, items constructed from the instantiation of longer rules have higher priority.
  This complex ordering implements a quite simple parsing strategy.
  The first condition guarantees that no nonconditional items will be added until conditional items have been computed?
  Thus, items cor- responding to the closure (in the sense of LI~ parsing) of the non- conditional items are always added to the table.
  Unlike LI~ parsing, 4For formalisms with complex structured nonterminals, the start "symbol" need only be unifiable with the left-haud
