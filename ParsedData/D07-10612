			(a man-made object).
			Several existing algorithms compute relatedness only by traversing the hyper nymy taxonomy and find that ?furnace?
			and ?stove?
			are relatively unrelated.
			However, WordNet provides other types of semantic links in addition to hypernymy, such as meronymy (part/whole relationships), antonymy, andverb entailment, as well as implicit links defined by over lap in the text of definitional glosses.
			These links can provide valuable relatedness information.
			If we assume that relatedness is transitive across a wide variety of such links, then it is natural to follow paths such as furnace?
			crematory?gas oven?oven?kitchen appliance?stove and find a higher degree of relatedness between ?furnace?
			and ?stove.?
			This paper presents the application of random walkMarkov chain theory to measuring lexical semantic re latedness.
			A graph of words and concepts is constructedfrom WordNet.
