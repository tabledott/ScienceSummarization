    Figure 3 shows the relationship between the size of the training data and the parsing accuracy.
    This figure also shows the accuracy with and without the dynamic features.
    Generally, the results with the dynamic feature set is better than the results without it.
    The dynamic features constantly outperform static features when the size of the training data is large.
    In most cases, the improvements is considerable.
    Table 3 summarizes the performance without some dynamic features.
    From these results, we can conclude that all dynamic features are effective in improving the performance.
    Table 4 summarizes recent results on Japanese dependency analysis.
    Uchimoto et al. (2000) report that using the Kyoto University Corpus for their training and testing, they achieve around 87.93% accuracy by building statistical model based on the Maximum Entropy framework.
    They extend the original probabilistic model, which learns only two class; &#8216;modify&#8216; and &#8216;not modif
