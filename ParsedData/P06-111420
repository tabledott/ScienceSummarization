turned as the system&#8217;s answer to the question.
    Results from this method are presented in Table 9.
    Method 2.
    In this experiment, entailment information was used to rank passages returned by the PR module.
    After an initial relevance ranking was determined from the PR engine, the top 50 passages were paired with the original question and were submitted to the TE system.
    Passages were re-ranked using the entailment judgment and the entailment confidence computed for each pair and then submitted to the AP module.
    Features derived from the entailment confidence were then combined with the keyword- and relation-based features described in (Harabagiu et al., 2005a) in order to produce a final ranking of candidate answers.
    Results from this method are presented in Table 9.
    Method 3.
    In the third experiment, TE was used to select AGQs that were entailed by the question submitted to the Q/A system.
    Here, AutoQUAB was used to generate questions for the top 50 candidate answer
