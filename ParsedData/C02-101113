			Algorithm of EM-TF-IDF 3.4 Advantage of Using EM Algorithm.
			The uses of EM-NBC-Ensemble and EM-TF-IDF can be viewed as extensions of existing methods for word or phrase translation using non-parallel corpora.
			Particularly, the use of the EM Algorithm can help to accurately transform a frequency vector from one language to another.
			Suppose that we are to determine if ?
			is a translation of ?information age?
			(actually it is).
			The frequency vectors of context words for ?information age?
			and ?
			are given in A and D in Figure 5, respectively.
			If for each English word we only retain the link connecting to the Chinese translation with the largest frequency (a link represented as a solid line) to establish a many-to-one mapping and transform vector A from English to Chinese, we obtain vector B. It turns out, however, that vector B is quite different from vector D, although they should be similar to each other.
			We will refer to this method as ?Major Translation?
