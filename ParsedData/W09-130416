 have used the same features used for the system that finds the scope of negation.
    The features of the first three classifers are: The fourth classifier, a metalearner, is also a CRFs as implemented in CRF++.
    The features of this classifier are: Hedge cues in the BioScope corpus always scope over a consecutive block of tokens, including the cue token itself.
    However, the classifiers only predict the first and last element of the scope.
    We need to process the output of the classifers in order to build the complete sequence of tokens that constitute the scope.
    We apply the following postprocessing: (5) - If one token has been predicted as FIRST and one as LAST, the sequence is formed by the tokens between first and last.
    - If one token has been predicted as FIRST and none has been predicted as LAST, the sequence is formed by the token predicted as FIRST.
    - If one token has been predicted as LAST and none as FIRST, the sequence will start at the hedge cue and it will finish at the tok
