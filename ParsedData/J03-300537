a calibration phase, designed to familiarize subjects with the task, in which they had to estimate the length of five horizontal lines; (2) a practice phase, in which subjects judged the plausibility of eight bigrams (similar to the ones in the stimulus set); (3) the main experiment, in which each subject judged one of the six stimulus sets (90 bigrams).
