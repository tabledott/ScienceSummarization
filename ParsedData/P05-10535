04) approached relation classification by combining various lexical and syntactic features with bootstrapping on top of Support Vector Machines.
    Tree kernel-based approaches proposed by Zelenko et al (2003) and Culotta et al (2004) are able to explore the implicit feature space without much feature engineering.
    Yet further research work is still expected to make it effective with complicated relation extraction tasks such as the one defined in ACE.
    Complicated relation extraction tasks may also impose a big challenge to the modeling approach used by Miller et al (2000) which integrates various tasks such as part-of-speech tagging, named entity recognition, template element extraction and relation extraction, in a single model.
    This paper will further explore the feature-based approach with a systematic study on the extensive incorporation of diverse lexical, syntactic and semantic information.
    Compared with Kambhatla (2004), we separately incorporate the base phrase chunking information, w
