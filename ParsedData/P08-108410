n order to properly align the cognate root ktb.
    In the following section, we describe a model that can model both generic cross-lingual patterns (fy and b-), as well as cognates between related languages (ktb for Hebrew and Arabic).
  
  
    Overview In order to simultaneously model probabilistic dependencies across languages as well as morpheme distributions within each language, we employ a hierarchical Bayesian model.2 Our segmentation model is based on the notion that stable recurring string patterns within words are indicative of morphemes.
    In addition to learning independent morpheme patterns for each language, the model will prefer, when possible, to join together frequently occurring bilingual morpheme pairs into single abstract morphemes.
    The model is fully unsupervised and is driven by a preference for stable and high frequency cross-lingual morpheme patterns.
    In addition the model can incorporate character-to-character phonetic correspondences between alphabets as prior information
