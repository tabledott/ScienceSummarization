d for Simplicity-DOP is that all subtrees should be assigned equal probabilities.
    Then the shortest derivation is equal to the most probable derivation and can be computed by standard Viterbi optimization, which can be seen as follows: if each subtree has a probability p then the probability of a derivation involving n subtrees is equal to pn, and since 0&lt;p&lt;1, the derivation with the fewest subtrees has the greatest probability.
    For SL-DOP and LS-DOP, we first compute either n likeliest or n simplest trees by means of Viterbi optimization.
    Next, we either select the simplest tree among the n likeliest ones (for SL DOP) or the likeliest tree among the n simplest ones (for LS-DOP).
    In our experiments, n will never be larger than 1,000.
  
  
    For our experiments we used the standard division of the WSJ (Marcus et al. 1993), with sections 2 through 21 for training (approx.
    40,000 sentences) and section 23 for testing (2416 sentences 100 words); section 22 was used as development set.
