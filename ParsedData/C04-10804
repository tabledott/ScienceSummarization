t-of-speech tags for a given sentence.
			When estimating tag sequence probabilities, an HMM tagger, such as that described in Merialdo (1991), typically takes into account a history consisting of the previous two tags -- e.g. we compute P(ti | ti-1, ti-2).
			Kupiec (1992) describes a modified trigram HMM tagger in which he computes word classes for which lexical probabilities are then estimated, instead of computing probabilities for individual words.
			Words contained within the same equivalence classes are those which possess the same set of possible parts of speech.
			Another highly-accurate method for part-of speech tagging from unlabelled data is Brill?s unsupervised transformation-based learner (UTBL) (Brill, 1995).
			Derived from his supervised transformation-based tagger (Brill, 1992), UTBL uses information from the distribution of unambiguously tagged data to make informed labeling decisions in ambiguous contexts.
			In contrast to the HMM taggers previously described, which make use of contextu
