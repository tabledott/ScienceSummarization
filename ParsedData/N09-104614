art preceding the letters si1 &#183; &#183; &#183; si4.
    We found it beneficial to include a feature that was the probability of a certain string of characters beginning a word, for which we used a reverse 5-gram character model and predicted the word boundary given the first five letters of the hypothesized word split.3 Since we did have expertise in German morphology, we did build a special German model.
    For this, we permitted the strings s, n, and es to be deleted between words.
    Each deletion fired a count feature (listed as fugen in the table).
    Analysis of errors indicated that the segmenter would periodically propose an incorrect segmentation where a single word could be divided into a word and a nonword consisting of common in3In general, this helped avoid situations where a word may be segemented into a frequent word and then a non-word string of characters since the non-word typically violated the phonotactics of the language in some way.
