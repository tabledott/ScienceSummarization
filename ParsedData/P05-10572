f natural languages.
    For example, the alignment of words within idiomatic expressions, free translations, and missing content or function words is problematic.
    When two languages widely differ in word order, finding word alignments is especially hard.
    Therefore, it is necessary to incorporate all useful linguistic information to alleviate these problems.
    Tiedemann (2003) introduced a word alignment approach based on combination of association clues.
    Clues combination is done by disjunction of single clues, which are defined as probabilities of associations.
    The crucial assumption of clue combination that clues are independent of each other, however, is not always true.
    Och and Ney (2003) proposed Model 6, a log-linear combination of IBM translation models and HMM model.
    Although Model 6 yields better results than naive IBM models, it fails to include dependencies other than IBM models and HMM model.
    Cherry and Lin (2003) developed a statistical model to find word alignments
