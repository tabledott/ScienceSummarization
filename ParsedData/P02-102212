 reference corpus.
    First of all, the tool is run in generation mode to produce a set of texts annotated by the system.
    These texts are stored for future use.
    The tool can then be run in three ways: 1.
    Comparing the annotated set with the reference set; 2.
    Comparing the annotated set with the set produced by a more recent version of the system resources (the latest set); 3.
    Comparing the latest set with the reference set.
    In each case, performance statistics will be provided for each text in the set, and overall statistics for the entire set, in comparison with the reference set.
    In case 2, information is also provided about whether the figures have increased or decreased in comparison with the annotated set.
    The annotated set can be updated at any time by rerunning the tool in generation mode with the latest version of the system resources.
    Furthermore, the system can be run in verbose mode, where for each figure below a certain threshold (set by the user), the non-coex
