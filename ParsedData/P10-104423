nt topics, which can be useful in their own right.
    For instance, one could use them for tasks such as set-expansion (Carlson et al., 2010) or automatic thesaurus induction (EtWe now evaluate LDA-SP&#8217;s ability to improve performance at an end-task.
    We choose the task of improving textual entailment by learning selectional preferences for inference rules and filtering inferences that do not respect these.
    This application of selectional preferences was introduced by Pantel et. al.
    (2007).
    For now we stick to inference rules of the form r1(a1, a2) ==&gt;' r2(a1, a2), though our ideas are more generally applicable to more complex rules.
    As an example, the rule (X defeats Y) ==&gt;- (X plays Y) holds when X and Y are both sports teams, however fails to produce a reasonable inference if X and Y are Britain and Nazi Germany respectively.
    In order for an inference to be plausible, both relations must have similar selectional preferences, and further, the arguments must obey the select
