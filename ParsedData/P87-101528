d by a grammar in a LCFRS formalism in logspace, and hence show that each family can be recognized in polynomial time.
    We define an ATM, M, recognizing a language generated by a grammar, G, having the properties discussed in Section 43.
    It can be seen that M performs a top-down recognition of the input al ... nin logspace.
    The rewrite rules and the definition of the composition operations may be stored in the finite state control since G uses a finite number of them.
    Suppose M has to determine whether the k substrings ,.. .,ak can be derived from some symbol A.
    Since each zi is a contiguous substring of the input (say ai,), and no two substrings overlap, we can represent zi by the pair of integers (i2, i2).
    We assume that M is in an existential state qA, with integers i1 and i2 representing zi in the (2i &#8212; 1)th and 22th work tape, for 1 &lt; i &lt; k. For each rule p : A fp(B, C) such that fp is mapped onto the function fp defined by the following rule. jp((xi,.. &#8226; ,rnt), (
