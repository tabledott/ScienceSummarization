ning.
    However, it is still much faster than GIS.
    We believe that the superior convergence rate of preconditioned CG is due to the use of approximate second-order information.
    This is confirmed by the performance of L-BFGS, which also uses approximate second-order information.2 Although there is no direct relationship between F scores and log-likelihood, in these experiments F score tends to follow log-likelihood.
    Indeed, Figure 3 shows that preconditioned CG training improves test F scores much more rapidly than GIS training.
    Table 3 compares run times (in minutes) for reaching a target penalized log-likelihood for various training methods with prior u = 1.0.
    GIS is the only method that failed to reach the target, after 3,700 iterations.
    We cannot place the voted perceptron in this table, as it does not optimize log-likelihood and does not use a prior.
    However, it reaches a fairly good F-score above 93% in just two training sweeps, but after that it improves more slowly, to a s
