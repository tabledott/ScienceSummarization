    The relations may be of several types (lexico-semantic, coocurrence relations, etc.) and may have some weight attached to them.
    The disambiguation is typically performed by applying a ranking algorithm over the graph, and then assigning the concepts with highest rank to the corresponding words.
    Given the computational cost of using large graphs like WordNet, many researchers use smaller subgraphs built online for each target context.
    In this paper we present a novel graph-based WSD algorithm which uses the full graph of WordNet efficiently, performing significantly better that previously published approaches in English all-words datasets.
    We also show that the algorithm can be easily ported to other languages with good results, with the only requirement of having a wordnet.
    The algorithm is publicly available2 and can be applied easily to sense inventories and knowledge bases different from WordNet.
    Our analysis shows that our algorithm is efficient compared to previously proposed
