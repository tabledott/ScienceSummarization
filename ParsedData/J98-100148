all Street Journal in which all occurrences of 191 words are hand-tagged with their WordNet senses (see Ng and Lee [1996]).
    Also, the Cognitive Science Laboratory at Princeton has undertaken the hand-tagging of 1,000 words from the Brown Corpus with WordNet senses (Miller et al. 1993) (so far, 200,000 words are available via ftp), and hand-tagging of 25 verbs in a small segment of the Wall Street Journal (12,925 sentences), is also underway (Wiebe et al.
    1997).
    However, these corpora are far smaller than those typically used with statistical methods.
    Several efforts have been made to automatically sense-tag a training corpus via bootstrapping methods.
    Hearst (1991) proposed an algorithm (CatchWord) that includes a training phase during which each occurrence of a set of nouns to be disambiguated is manually sense-tagged in several occurrences.'
    Statistical information extracted from the context of these occurrences is then used to disambiguate other occurrences.
