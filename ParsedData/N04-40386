    APT yields 90% accuracy on a tag set of 131 tags including both POS and inflection morphology information.
    APT is a two-step hybrid system with rules and a Viterbi algorithm for statistically determining the appropriate POS tag.
    Given the tag set, APT is more of a morphological analyzer than a POS tagger.
  
  
    In the literature, various machine learning approaches are applied to the problem of POS tagging and BP Chunking.
    Such problems are cast as a classification problem where, given a number of features extracted from a predefined linguistic context, the task is to predict the class of a token.
    Support Vector Machines (SVMs) (Vapnik, 1995) are one class of such model.
    SVMs are a supervised learning algorithm that has the advantage of being robust where it can handle a large number of (overlapping) features with good generalization performance.
    Consequently, SVMs have been applied in many NLP tasks with great success (Joachims, 1998; Kudo and Matsumato, 2000; Hacioglu and
