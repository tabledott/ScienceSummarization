ied PSEs described in Section 3, for which results are given in Table 9.
    Second, in Figure 4, we assess precision with respect to the document-level classes (lines 7&#8211;8).
    The test data are OP1.
    An interesting question arose when we were defining the PSE instances: What should be done with words that are identified to be PSEs (or parts of PSEs) according to multiple criteria?
    For example, sunny, radiant, and exhilarating are all unique in corpus OP1, and are all members of the adjective PSE feature defined for testing on OP1.
    Collocations add additional complexity.
    For example, consider the sequence and splendidly, which appears in the test data.
    The sequence and splendidly matches the ugen-2-gram (and-conj U-adj), and the word splendidly is unique.
    In addition, a sequence may match more than one n-gram feature.
    For example, is it that matches three fixed-n-gram features: is it, is it that, and it that.
    In the current experiments, the more PSEs a word matches, the m
