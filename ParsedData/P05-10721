    The architecture underlying all of these systems introduces two distinct sub-problems: the identification of syntactic constituents that are semantic roles for a given predicate, and the labeling of the those constituents with the correct semantic role.
    A detailed error analysis of our baseline system indicates that the identification problem poses a significant bottleneck to improving overall system performance.
