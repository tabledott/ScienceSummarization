FP segmentations.
    Among the FNP segmentations, FNP1 was penalized the most and FNP2 the least.
    To see why, we examine the results for the FP segmentations.
    WD penalizes pure false positives the same amount regardless of how close they are to a boundary; the only way false positives are underpenalized is if they occur in bunches.
    As mentioned earlier, this is most likely to happen in FP3.
    It is least likely to happen in FP1, since in FP1 there is a maximum of one false positive per segment, and this false positive is not necessarily close to a boundary.
    In FP2, false positives are also limited to one per segment, but they are also more likely to be close to boundaries.
    This increases the likelihood that 2 false positives will be within k sentences of each other and thus makes WD give a slightly lower score to the FP2 segmentation than to the FP1 segmentation.
    Now let us look at the FNP segmentations.
    FNP3 is penalized less than FNP1 for the same reason described above, and F
