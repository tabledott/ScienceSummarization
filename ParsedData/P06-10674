    Therefore, SMT decoders typically limit the number of permutations considered for efficiency reasons by placing reordering restrictions.
    Reordering restrictions for word-based SMT decoders were introduced by (Berger et al., 1996) and (Wu, 1996).
    (Berger et al., 1996) allow only reordering of at most n words at any given time.
    (Wu, 1996) propose using contiguity restrictions on the reordering.
    For a comparison and a more detailed discussion of the two approaches see (Zens and Ney, 2003).
    A different approach to allow for a limited reordering is to reorder the input sentence such that the source and the target sentences have similar word order and then proceed to monotonically decode the reordered source sentence.
    Monotone decoding translates words in the same order they appear in the source language.
    Hence, the input and output sentences have the same word order.
    Monotone decoding is very efficient since the optimal decoding can be found in polynomial time.
