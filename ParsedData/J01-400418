und similarly between ((union)13, (its unions)22).
    As another example, neither noun phrase in chain d, (Pay-Cut)di and (wage reductions)d2, matches with any machine-extracted noun phrase boundaries.
    In this case, no positive or negative example is formed for noun phrases in chain d. The next step is to use a machine learning algorithm to learn a classifier based on the feature vectors generated from the training documents.
    The learning algorithm used in our coreference engine is C5, which is an updated version of C4.5 (Quinlan 1993).
    C5 is a commonly used decision tree learning algorithm and thus it may be considered as a baseline method against which other learning algorithms can be compared.
    Before determining the coreference chains for a test document, all possible markables need to be extracted from the document.
    Every markable is a possible anaphor, and every markable before the anaphor in document order is a possible antecedent of the anaphor, except when the anaphor is nested.
