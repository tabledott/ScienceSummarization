31 sentences in the 756-utterance fair test set (4.1%).
    A simplified example of a syntactic rule is np: [wh=ynq, pers_num=N] , s: [sentence_type=ynq, form=tnsd, gapsin=np: [pers_num=N] , gapsout=null]] ) .
    This syntax rule (named whq_ynq_slash_np) says that a sentence (category s) can be built by finding a noun phrase (category up) followed by a sentence.
    It requires that the daughter up have the value ynq for its wh feature and that it have the value N (a variable) for its person-number feature.
    It requires that the daughter sentence have a category value for its gaps in feature, namely an up with a person number value N, which is the same as the person number value on the wh-bearing noun phrase.
    The interpretation of the entire rule is that a gapless sentence with sentence_type whq can be built by finding a wh-phrase followed by a sentence with a noun phrase gap in it that has the same person number as the wh-phrase.
    Semantic rules are written in much the same rule format, except tha
