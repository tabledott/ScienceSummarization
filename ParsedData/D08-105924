based model, while the differences include the choice of learning and decoding algorithms, the definition of feature templates and our application of the &#8220;early update&#8221; strategy.
    Our combined parser makes the biggest contribution of this paper.
    In contrast to the models above, it includes both graph-based and transition-based components.
    An existing method to combine multiple parsing algorithms is the ensemble approach (Sagae and Lavie, 2006a), which was reported to be useful in improving dependency parsing (Hall et al., 2007).
    A more recent approach (Nivre and McDonald, 2008) combined MSTParser and MaltParser by using the output of one parser for features in the other.
    Both Hall et al. (2007) and Nivre and McDonald (2008) can be seen as methods to combine separately defined models.
    In contrast, our parser combines two components in a single model, in which all parameters are trained consistently.
