ural language (Gazdar and Mellish 1989), it is clear that wide-coverage CFGs will need to be very large indeed, and this will lead to difficulties of (manual) development of consistent grammars and, possibly, to computational intractability at parse time (particularly during the already computationally expensive training phase).
    Secondly, associating probabilities with CF rules means that information about the probability of a rule applying at a particular point in a parse derivation is lost.
    This leads to complications distinguishing the probability of different derivations when the same rule can be applied several times in more than one way.
    Grammar 1 below is an example of a probabilistic CFG, in which each production is associated with a probability and the probabilities of all rules expanding a given nonterminal category sum to one.
    Grammar 1 The probability of a particular parse is the product of the probabilities of each rule used in the derivation.
    Thus the probability of parse a)
