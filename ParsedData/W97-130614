considered.
    The text was pre-processed with a part-of-speech tagger over which basal noun phrases were delimited and finite clauses and their relative nesting were identified by machine.
    This pre-processing was subjected to hand correction in order to make comparison with Hobbs as fair as possible since that was an entirely hand executed algorithm, but CogNIAC was otherwise machine run and scored.
    Errors were not chained, i.e. in left-to-right processing of the text, earlier mistakes were corrected before processing the next noun phrase.
    Since the Naive Algorithm resolves all pronouns, two lower precision rules were added to rules 1-6) for comparisons sake.
    The rules are: The last two rules are lower precision than the first six, but perform well enough to merit their inclusion in a 'resolve all pronouns' configuration.
    Rule 7 performed reasonably well with 77% precision in training (10/13 correct for 201 pronouns), and rule 8 performed with 65% precision in training (44/63 correct).
