refore, 569,994 vectors were classified in51.11 seconds.
			The initialization time can be disre garded because we can reuse the above coefficents.
			Consequently, XQK is 224.8 (=11,488.13/51.11) times faster than TinySVM for OTHER.
			TinySVM took 6 hours to process all the word classes, whereas XQK took only 17 minutes.
			XQK is 102 times faster than SVM-Light 3.50 which took 1.2 days.
