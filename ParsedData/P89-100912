  Suppose U has N elements, where N &gt; I.
  Then, any attribute-value pair true of the intended referent zl will be true of n entities in this set, where n &gt;_ i.
  For any attribute-value pair &lt; a, v &gt; that is true of the intended referent, we can compute the discriminatory power (notated here as F) of that attribute-value pair with respect to U as fol- lows" ~(&lt; ~,v&gt;, U) = ~-~ l&lt;n&lt;N F thus has as its range the interval [0,1], where a value of 1 for a given attribute-value pair indi- cates that the attribute-value pair singles out the intended referent from the conte?t, and a value of 7] DS -~- i ndez  = z2 s ta tus  = SSf~t SpSC -~ [ #/uen= + ] unique = + number  = sg agr  = countab le  ---- + type  = ] categor l !
