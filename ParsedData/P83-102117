 we noted before, our view of parsing as deduction makes it possible to derive general parsing mechanisms for augmented phrase-structure grammars with gaps and unbounded dependencies.
    It is difficult (especially in the case of pure bottom-up parsing strategies) to augment chart parsers to handle gaps and dependencies (Thompson, 1981).
    However, if gaps and dependencies are specified by extra predicate arguments in the .clauses that correspond to the rules, the general proof procedures will handle those phenomena without further change.
    This is the technique used in DCGs and is the basis of the specialized extraposition grammar formalism (Pereira, 1081).
    The increased generality of our approach in the area of parsing strategy stems from the fact that chart parsing strategies correspond to specialized proof procedures for definite clauses with string arguments.
    In other words, the origin of these proof procedures means that string arguments are treated differently from other arguments, as the
