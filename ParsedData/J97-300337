 as, for instance, Using these replicates, we calculated the mean and standard error of the whole bootstrap distribution as follows: where This way of calculating the estimated standard error for the mean does not assume the normal distribution and hence provides more accurate results.
    We noticed a certain inconsistency in the markup of proper nouns (NNP) in the Brown Corpus supplied with the Penn Treebank.
    Quite often obvious proper nouns as, for instance, Summerdale, Russia, or Rochester were marked as common nouns (NN) and sometimes lower-cased common nouns such as business or church were marked as proper nouns.
    Thus we decided not to count as an error the mismatch of the NN/NNP tags.
    Using the HMM tagger with the lexicon containing all the words from the Brown Corpus, we obtained the error rate (mean) 0* (.
    )=4.003093 with the standard error s^eB=0.155599.
    This agrees with the results on the closed dictionary (i.e., without unknown words) obtained by other researchers for this clas
