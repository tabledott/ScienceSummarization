e size counterbalances the quadratic running time of average-link to make Buckshot efficient: O(K?T?n + nlogn).
			The parameters K and T are usually considered to be small numbers.
	
	
			Following (Lin 1998), we represent each word by a feature vector.
			Each feature corresponds to a context in which the word occurs.
			For example, ?threaten with __?
			is a context.
			If the word handgun occurred in this context, the context is a feature of handgun.
			The value of the feature is the pointwise mutual information (Manning and Sch?tze 1999 p.178) between the feature and the word.
			Let c be a context and Fc(w) be the frequency count of a word w occurring in context c. The pointwise mutual information between c and w is defined as: ( ) ( ) ( ) N jF N wF N wF cw j c i i c mi ???
			=, where N = ( )??
			i j i jF is the total frequency counts of all words and their contexts.
			A well known problem with mutual information is that it is biased towards infrequent words/features.
			We therefore multiplied miw
