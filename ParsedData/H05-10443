ent analysis.
			Negation may be local (e.g., not good), or involve longer-distance dependencies such as the negation of the proposition (e.g., does not look very good) or the negation of the subject (e.g., 347 no one thinks that it?s good).
			In addition, certain phrases that contain negation words intensify ratherthan change polarity (e.g., not only good but amaz ing).
			Contextual polarity may also be influenced by modality (e.g., whether the proposition is asserted to be real (realis) or not real (irrealis) ? no reason at all to believe is irrealis, for example); word sense (e.g.,Environmental Trust versus He has won the people?s trust); the syntactic role of a word in the sen tence (e.g., polluters are versus they are polluters);and diminishers such as little (e.g., little truth, lit tle threat).
			(See (Polanya and Zaenen, 2004) for amore detailed discussion of contextual polarity in fluencers.)This paper presents new experiments in automat ically distinguishing prior and contextual polarity.
