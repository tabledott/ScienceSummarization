    In order to compute the distributions, we reverse the source and target languages and repeat the procedure.
    As we mentioned above, in GIZA-Lex the average number of possible translations for a source word is 12.
    In LLR-Lex that average is 5, which is a significant decrease.
    Intuitively speaking, our method tries to distinguish between source fragments that have a translation on the target side, and fragments that do not.
    In Figure 4 we show the sentence pair from Figure 2, in which we have underlined those words of each sentence that have a translation in the other sentence, according to our lexicon LLR-Lex.
