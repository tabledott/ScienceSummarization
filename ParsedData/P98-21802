edures such as MindNet's provide the only credible prospect for acquiring world knowledge on the scale needed to support common-sense reasoning.
    At the same time, we acknowledge the potential need for the hand vetting of such information to insure accuracy and consistency in production level systems.
  
  
    The extraction of the semantic information contained in MindNet exploits the very same broadcoverage parser used in the Microsoft Word 97 grammar checker.
    This parser produces syntactic parse trees and deeper logical forms, to which rules are applied that generate corresponding structures of semantic relations.
    The parser has not been specially tuned to process dictionary definitions.
    All enhancements to the parser are geared to handle the immense variety of general text, of which dictionary definitions are simply a modest subset.
    There have been many other attempts to process dictionary definitions using heuristic pattern matching (e.g., Chodorow et al. 1985), specially constructed
