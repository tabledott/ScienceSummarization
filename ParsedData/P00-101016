    Our work in this area is highly preliminary.
    To extract temporal relations between events, we have developed an eventordering component, following (Song and Cohen 1991).
    We encode the tense associated with each verb using their modified Reichenbachian (Reichenbach 1947) representation based on the tuple &lt;si, lge, ri, lge, ei&gt;.
    Here si is an index for the speech time, ri for the reference time, and ei for the event time, with lge being the temporal relations precedes, follows, or coincides.
    With each successive event, the temporal focus is either maintained or shifted, and a temporal ordering
