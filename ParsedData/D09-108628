an&#8221;), quiero is the child of decir.
    In German coordinations, the coordinands all attach to the first, but in English, they all attach to the last.
    These particular divergences in annotation style hurt all of our models equally (since none of them have access to labeled trees).
    These annotation divergences are one motivation for experiments below that include some target trees. model tagger on a few thousand tagged sentences.
    This is the only supervised data we used in the target.
    We created versions of each training corpus with the first thousand, ten thousand, and hundred thousand sentence pairs, each a prefix of the next.
    Since the target-language-only baseline converged much more slowly, we used a version of the corpora with sentences 15 target words or fewer.
    Using the target side of the bitext as training data, we initialized our model parameters as described in &#167;5.2 and ran EM.
    We checked convergence on a development set and measured unlabeled dependency accura
