    Their tree kernels require the matchable nodes to be at the same layer counting from the root and to have an identical path of ascending nodes from the roots to the current nodes.
    The two constraints make their kernel high precision but very low recall on the ACE 2003 corpus.
    Bunescu and Mooney (2005) proposed another dependency tree kernel for relation extraction.
    Their kernel simply counts the number of common word classes at each position in the shortest paths between two entities in dependency trees.
    The kernel requires the two paths to have the same length; otherwise the kernel value is zero.
    Therefore, although this kernel shows performance improvement over the previous one (Culotta and Sorensen, 2004), the constraint makes the two dependency kernels share the similar behavior: good precision but much lower recall on the ACE corpus.
    The above discussion shows that, although kernel methods can explore the huge amounts of implicit (structured) features, until now the feature-b
