e representation will generalize better to the target domain.
    This representation is learned using a method we call structural correspondence learning (SCL).
    The key idea of SCL is to identify correspondences among features from different domains by modeling their correlations with pivot features.
    Pivot features are features which behave in the same way for discriminative learning in both domains.
    Non-pivot features from different domains which are correlated with many of the same pivot features are assumed to correspond, and we treat them similarly in a discriminative learner.
    Even on the unlabeled data, the co-occurrence statistics of pivot and non-pivot features are likely to be sparse, and we must model them in a compact way.
    There are many choices for modeling co-occurrence data (Brown et al., 1992; Pereira et al., 1993; Blei et al., 2003).
    In this work we choose to use the technique of structural learning (Ando and Zhang, 2005a; Ando and Zhang, 2005b).
