ts are nouns and the contexts are verbs that take the nouns as direct objects.
    Our problem can be seen as that of learning a joint distribution of pairs from a large sample of pairs.
    The pair coordinates come from two large sets H and V, with no preexisting internal structure, and the training data is a sequence S of N independently drawn pairs From a learning perspective, this problem falls somewhere in between unsupervised and supervised learning.
    As in unsupervised learning, the goal is to learn the underlying distribution of the data.
    But in contrast to most unsupervised learning settings, the objects involved have no internal structure or attributes allowing them to be compared with each other.
    Instead, the only information about the objects is the statistics of their joint appearance.
    These statistics can thus be seen as a weak form of object labelling analogous to supervision.
    While clusters based on distributional similarity are interesting on their own, they can also be pr
