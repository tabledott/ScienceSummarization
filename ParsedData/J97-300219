f children or righthand-side symbols), which dictates the span over which matchings may cross.
    As the number of subtrees of an Li-constituent grows, the number of possible matchings to subtrees of the corresponding L2-constituent grows combinatorially, with corresponding time complexity growth on the matching process.
    Moreover, if constituents can immediately dominate too many tokens of the sentences, the crossing constraint loses effectiveness&#8212;in the extreme, if a single constituent immediately dominates the entire sentence-pair, then any permutation is permissible without violating the crossing constraint.
    Thus, we would like to constrain the rank as much as possible, while still permitting some reasonable degree of permutation flexibility.
    Recasting this issue in terms of the general class of context-free (syntax-directed) transduction grammars, the number of possible subtree matchings for a single constituent grows combinatorially with the number of symbols on a production's righthan
