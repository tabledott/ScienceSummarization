the distribution of definite descriptions in the three classes above: we found that about half. of the definite descriptions were discourse-new.
    The distribution of the definite descriptions in classes in our first experiment according to annotators A and 13 are shown in Tables 1 and 2, respectively.
    (Class IV includes cases of idiomatic expressions or doubts expressed by the annotators).
    The third main result was that we found very little agreement between our subjects on identifying briding descriptions: in our second experiment, the agreement on bridging descriptions was K 0.24.
    This was due in part to the fact that many definite descriptions could be classified in more than one class (e.g., either anaphoric or bridging, depending on which antecedent was chosen) and in part to the fact that in the case of descriptions indirectly related to their antecedents, the discourse might provide more than one distinct equally suitable anchor (Poesio and Vieira 1998).
