    We write [n] to refer to the set of positive integers up to and including n. Throughout this paper, we use standard terminology and notation from graph theory to talk about dependency graphs.
    In particular, we refer to the elements of the set V as nodes, and to the elements of the set E as edges.
    We write i --&gt; j to mean that there is an edge from the node i to the node j (i.e., (i, j) E E), and i --&gt;* j to mean that the node i dominates the node j, i.e., that there is a (possibly empty) path from i to j.
    For a given node i, the set of nodes dominated by i is the yield of i.
    We use the notation 3r(i) to refer to the projection of i: the yield of i, arranged in ascending order.
    Most of the literature on dependency grammar and dependency parsing does not allow arbitrary dependency graphs, but imposes certain structural constraints on them.
    In this paper, we restrict ourselves to dependency graphs that form forests.
