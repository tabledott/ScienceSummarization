 on high-level natural language constraints in order to reduce the search space.
    But this time, n-gram methods have become the methods of choice because they seem to work better than the alternatives, at least when the search space is measured in terms of entropy.
    Ideally, we might hope that someday parsers might reduce entropy beyond that of n-grams, but right now, parsers seem to be more useful for other tasks such as understanding who did what to whom, and less useful for predicting what the speaker is likely to say.
    In the midst of all of this excitement over high-level, knowledged-based NLP techniques, IBM formed a new speech group around the nucleus of an existing group that was moved from Raleigh, North Carolina, to Yorktown Heights early in 1972.
    The Raleigh group brought to Yorktown a working speech recognition system, that had been designed in accordance with prevailing anti-empiricist attitudes of the time, though it would soon serve as a foundation for the revival of empiricism in
