of length 18 This is a reasonable, and convenient, assumption, but it may not be precise enough for all work.
    A more refined measure would take the length of a letter to be &#8212;1 times the binary log of its frequency.
    A still more refined measure would base the probability of a letter on bigram context; this matters for English, where stem final t is very common.
    In addition, there is information in the linear order in which the letters are stored, roughly equal to for a string of length n (compare the information that distinguishes the lexical representation of anagrams).
    This is an additional consideration in an MDL analysis of morphology pressing in favor of breaking words into morphemes when possible.
    Goldsmith Unsupervised Learning of the Morphology of a Natural Language and a pointer to a signature a is of length We have now settled the question of how to determine the length of our initial model; we next must determine the probability that the model assigns to each word in the co
