    The third added liller-gap dependency information as well so that the gap proliferaticm priiblem was removed.
    The final restrictor added verb form information.
    The last cohunn shows the percentage of edges that were eliminated by using this final restrictor.
    Several facts should be kept in mind about the data above.
    First, for sentences with no Wh-movement or relative clauses, no gaps were ever predicted.
    In other words, the top-down filtering is in some sense maximal with respect to gap hypothesis.
    Second, the subcategorization information used in top-down filtering removed all hypotheses of constituents except for those directly subcategorized for.
    Finally, the grammar used contained constructs that would cause nonterrnination in the unrestricted extension of Earley's algorithm.
    This technique of restriction of complex-feature structures into a finite set of equivalence classes can be used for a wide variety of
