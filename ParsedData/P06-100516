 used roughly 85 GB.
    Using the test set from Bergsma (2005), we were only able to boost performance from an FScore of 85.4% to one of 88.0% (Table 3).
    This result led us to re-examine the high performance of Bergsma&#8217;s web-based approach.
    We realized that the corpus-based and web-based approaches are not exactly symmetric.
    The corpus-based approaches, for example, would not pick out gender from a pattern such as &#8220;John and his friends...&#8221; because &#8220;Noun and pronoun&#8217;s NP&#8221; is not one of the manually-defined gender extraction patterns.
    The web-based approach, however, would catch this instance with the &#8220;John * his/her/its/their&#8221; template, where &#8220;*&#8221; is the Google wild-card operator.
    Clearly, there are patterns useful for capturing gender and number information beyond the predefined set used in the corpus-based extraction.
    We thus decided to capture gender/number information from coreferent paths.
    If a noun is connected to a p
