hould be displaced, we will also provide MT evalu ation scores (in Section 6) for a set of classes that distinguishes between left and right discontinuity{M,S,Dl,Dr}, a choice that is admittedly more lin guistically motivated.Table 2 displays orientation probabilities for con crete examples.
			Each example was put under one of the four categories that linguistically seems thebest match, and we provide probabilities for that cat egory according to each model.
			Note that, whilewe have so far only discussed left-to-right reorder ing models, it is also possible to build right-to-leftmodels by substituting ai?1 with ai+1 in Eq.
			3.
			Ex amples for right-to-left models appear in the second half of the table.
			The table strongly suggests that the hierarchical model more accurately determinesthe orientation of phrases with respect to large contextual blocks.
			In Examples 1 and 2, the hierarchi cal model captures the fact that coordinated clauses almost always remain in the same order, and that words should
