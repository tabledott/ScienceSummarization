s Our primary purpose is to compare the performance of our bilingual model with its fully monolingual counterpart.
    However, to demonstrate the competitiveness of this baseline model, we also provide results using MORFESSOR (Creutz and Lagus, 2007), a state-of-the-art unsupervised system for morphological segmentation.
    While developed originally for Finnish, this system has been successfully applied to a range of languages including German, Turkish and English.
    The probabilistic formulation of this model is close to our monolingual segmentation model, but it uses a greedy search specifically designed for the segmentation task.
    We use the publicly available implementation of this system.
    To provide some idea of the inherent difficulty of this segmentation task, we also provide results from a random baseline which makes segmentation decisions based on a coin weighted with the true segmentation frequency.
  
  
    Table 1 shows the performance of the various automatic segmentation methods.
