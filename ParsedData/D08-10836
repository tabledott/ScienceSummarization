  (2005), and Moilanen and Pulman (2007).2) In our experiments, we compare learning- and non-learning-based approaches to expression-level polarity classification &#8212; with and without compositional semantics &#8212; and find that (1) simple heuristics based on compositional semantics outperform (89.7% in accuracy) other reasonable heuristics that do not incorporate compositional semantics (87.7%); they can also perform better than simple learning-based methods that do not incorporate compositional semantics (89.1%), (2) combining learning with the heuristic rules based on compositional semantics further improves the performance (90.7%), (3) content-word negators play an important role in determining the expression-level polarity, and, somewhat surprisingly, we find that (4) expression-level classification accuracy uniformly decreases as additional, potentially disambiguating, context is considered.
    In what follows, we first explore heuristic-based approaches in &#167;2, then we present learning-based
