e commonest method for combining the vectors is to average them.
    Vector averaging is unfortunately insensitive to word order, and more generally syntactic structure, giving the same representation to any constructions that happen to share the same vocabulary.
    This is illustrated in the example below taken from Landauer et al. (1997).
    Sentences (1-a) and (1-b) contain exactly the same set of words but their meaning is entirely different.
    (1) a.
    It was not the sales manager who hit the bottle that day, but the office worker with the serious drinking problem. b.
    That day the office manager, who was drinking, hit the problem sales worker with a bottle, but it was not serious.
    While vector addition has been effective in some applications such as essay grading (Landauer and Dumais, 1997) and coherence assessment (Foltz et al., 1998), there is ample empirical evidence that syntactic relations across and within sentences are crucial for sentence and discourse processing (Neville et al., 19
