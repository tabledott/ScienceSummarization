lation is missing, and cannot be inferred deterministically from the Treebank analysis without further manual re-annotation.
    We discuss these residual problems here, because they are likely to present obstacles to the extraction of linguistically adequate grammars in any formalism.
    Our translation algorithm requires a distinction between complements and adjuncts.
    In many cases, this distinction is easily read off the Treebank annotation, but it is in general an open linguistic problem (McConnell-Ginet 1982).
    Because the Treebank annotation does not explicitly distinguish between complements and adjuncts, researchers typically develop their own heuristics&#8212;see, for example, Kinyon and Prolo (2002).
    For prepositional phrases, we rely on the -CLR (&#8220;closely related&#8221;) function tag to identify complements, although it is unclear whether the Treebank annotators were able to use this tag consistently.
    Not all PP arguments seem to have this function tag, and some PPs that have
