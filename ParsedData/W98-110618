e developed by applying an initial set of case frames to hundreds of sample texts and looking for places where the case frames failed to recognize desired information.
    But this approach is extremely timeconsuming unless the answers are known in advance (i.e., the information that should have been extracted), which is unrealistic for most applications.
    It should be possible, however, to learn case frame structures automatically from a text corpus.
    Toward this end, we have been developing a corpus-based approach to conceptual case frame acquisition.
    Our approach builds upon earlier work on corpus-based methods for generating extraction patterns (Riloff, 1996b) and semantic lexicons (Riloff and Shepherd, 1997).
    Our new system constructs conceptual case frames by learning semantic preferences for extraction patterns and merging syntactically compatible patterns into more complex structures.
    The resulting case frames can have slots for multiple role objects and each slot has a set of learne
