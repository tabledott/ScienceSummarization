 sentences were rejected).
    It was also much slower than SVMpar in parsing the test set, taking 127 minutes.
    In addition, the total memory required for running MBLpar (including the classifier) was close to 1 gigabyte (including the trained classifier), while SVMpar required only about 200 megabytes (including all the classifiers).
    Table 1 shows a summary of the results of our experiments with SVMpar and MBLpar, and also results obtained with the Charniak (2000) parser, the Bikel (2003) implementation of the Collins (1997) parser, and the Ratnaparkhi (1997) parser.
    We also include the dependency accuracy from Yamada and Matsumoto&#8217;s (2003) SVM-based dependency parser, and Nivre and Scholz&#8217;s (2004) MBL-based dependency parser.
    These results show that the choice of classifier is extremely important in this task.
    SVMpar and MBLpar use the same algorithm and features, and differ only on the classifiers used to make parsing decisions.
    While in many natural language processing
