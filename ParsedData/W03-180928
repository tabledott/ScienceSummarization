ositionality somewhat in its reliance upon substitution.
    We now suggest another technique which we claim is based on sounder principles.
    The underlying intuition is that identifying the degree of semantic similarity between a VPC and its component verb and/or particle will indicate whether that component part contributes independent semantics.
    This is similar to the assumption made in Schone and Jurafsky (2001), except that we make a distinction between the contribution of the different component parts.
    We again used the knowledge-free semantic similarity measure.
    We performed a pairwise comparison of all VPCs with all verbs and all particles, obtaining cosine similarity scores for each pair.
    In order to measure the usefulness of this score, we performed a logistic regression of the similarity scores and the human judgements as to whether the given verb or particle is entailed by the VPC.
    We did this for the majority human judgements, and also the centroid annotator scores.
    We
