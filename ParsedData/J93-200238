n question is a verb, board presents many more opportunities for error than operate.
    This violates the assumption that the probability of error for a given frame is approximately uniform across verbs.
    These limitations do not constitute a major impediment to applications of the current results.
    For example, an applied system can be provided with the rough estimates that 80-95 percent of verbs take a direct object, while 1-2 percent take a direct object followed by a tensed clause.
    Such estimates can be expected to reduce misclassification significantly.
    Further, an existing dictionary could be used to &amp;quot;train&amp;quot; a statistical model on familiar verbs.
    A trained system would probably be more accurate in classifying new verbs.
    Finally, the lexical ambiguity problem could probably be reduced substantially in the applied context by using a statistical tagging program (Brill 1992; Church 1988).
