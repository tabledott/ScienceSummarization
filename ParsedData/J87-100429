l a directed acyclic graph (dag) rather than a tree.
    This is because some value may be shared by two different attributes in the same sentence (e.g., the &amp;quot;agreement&amp;quot; attributes of subject and main verb).
    Pereira (1985) introduced a method to share dag structures.
    However, the dag structure sharing method is much more complex and computationally expensive than tree structure sharing.
    Therefore, we handle only treestructured functional structures for the sake of efficiency and simplicity.6 In the example, the &amp;quot;agreement&amp;quot; attributes of subject and main verb may thus have two different values.
    The identity of these two values is tested explicitly by a test in the augmentation.
    Sharing treestructured functional structures requires only a minor modification on the subtree sharing method for the shared-packed forest representation described in subsection 3.1.
    Local ambiguity packing for augmented context-free grammars is not as easy.
    Suppose two cer
