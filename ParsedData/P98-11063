 constituents are the projections of the nodes of the dependency tree.
    Projectivity is therefore equivalent, in phrase structure markers, to continuity of constituent.
    The strong constraints introduced by the projectivity property on the relationship between hierarchical order and linear order allow us to describe word order of a projective dependency tree at a local level: in order to describe the linear position of a node, it is sufficient to describe its position towards its governor and sister nodes.
    The domain of locality of the linear order rules is therefore limited to a subtree of depth equal to one.
    It can be noted that this domain of locality is equal to the domain of locality of sub-categorization rules.
    Both rules can therefore be represented together as in (Gaffman, 1965) or separately as will be proposed in 3.
    Although most linguistic structures can be represented as projective trees, it is well known that projectivity is too strong a constraint for dependency trees, as s
