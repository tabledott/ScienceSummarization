    Chinese text is provided as a sequence of characters, and it is unclear which characters have to be grouped together to obtain entities that can be interpreted as words.
    For statistical MT, it would be possible to ignore this fact and treat the Chinese characters as elementary units and translate them into English.
    Yet preliminary experiments showed that the existing alignment models produce better results if the Chinese characters are segmented in a preprocessing step into single words.
    We use the LDC segmentation tool.5 For the English corpus, the following preprocessing steps are applied.
    First, the corpus is tokenized; it is then segmented into sentences, and all uppercase characters are converted to lowercase.
    As the final evaluation criterion does not distinguish case, it is not necessary to deal with the case information.
    Then, the preprocessed Chinese and English corpora are sentence aligned in which the lengths of the source and target sentences are sig
