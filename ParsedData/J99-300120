grammatical roles, which we repeat in Table 1.
    The centering model, in addition, defines transition relations across pairs of adjacent utterances (Table 2).
    These transitions differ from each other according to whether backward-looking centers of successive utterances are identical or not, and, if they are identical, whether they match the most highly ranked element of the current forwardlooking center list, the Cp(Ui), or not.
    Grosz, Joshi, and Weinstein (1995) also define two rules on center movement and realization: If any element of Cf(u) is realized by a pronoun in U,+1, then the Cb(U11) must be realized by a pronoun also.
    Sequences of continuation are to be preferred over sequences of retaining; and sequences of retaining are to be preferred over sequences of shifting.
    Rule 1 states that no element in an utterance can be realized by a pronoun unless the backward-looking center is realized by a pronoun, too.
    This rule is intended to capture one function of the use of pronominal an
