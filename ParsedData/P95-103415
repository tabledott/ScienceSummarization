neration difficulties can be traced to the existence of constraints between words and phrases.
    Our generator operates on lexical islands, which do not interact with other words or concepts.6 How to identify such islands is an important problem in NLG: grammatical rules (e.g., agreement) may help group words together, and collocational knowledge can also mark the boundaries of some lexical islands (e.g., nominal compounds).
    When no explicit information is present, we can resort to treating single words as lexical islands, essentially adopting a view of maximum compositionality.
    Then, we rely on the statistical model to correct this approximation, by identifying any violations of the compositionality principle on the fly during actual text generation.
    The type of the lexical islands and the manner by which they have been identified do not affect the way our generator processes them.
    Each island corresponds to an independent component of the final sentence.
