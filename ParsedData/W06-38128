is more efficient.
    Another algorithm that uses only local contexts for time-linear clustering is DBSCAN as, described in (Ester et al. 1996), needing two input parameters (although the authors propose an interactive approach to determine them).
    DBSCAN is especially suited for graphs with a geometrical interpretation, i.e. the objects have coordinates in a multidimensional space.
    A quite similar algorithm to CW is MAJORCLUST (Stein &amp; Niggemann 1996), which is based on a comparable idea but converges slower.
    As CW is a special case of Markov-ChainClustering (MCL) (van Dongen, 2000), we spend a few words on explaining it.
    MCL is the parallel simulation of all possible random walks up to a finite length on a graph G. The idea is that random walkers are more likely to end up in the same cluster where they started than walking across clusters.
    MCL simulates flow on a graph by repeatedly updating transition probabilities between all nodes, eventually converging to a transition matrix afte
