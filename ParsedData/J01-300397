sets of verbs that occur in the intersection of two or more Levin classes form in themselves a coherent semantic (sub)class.
    Extending our work to exploit this idea requires only defining the classes appropriately; the basic approach will remain the same.
    Given the current demonstration of our method on fine-grained classes that share subcategorization alternations, we are optimistic regarding its future performance on intersective sets.
    Because we assume that thematic properties are reflected in alternations of argument structure, our features require searching for relations across occurrences of each verb.
    This motivated our initial experimental focus on verb types.
    However, when we turn to consider ambiguity, we must also address the problem that individual instances of verbs may come from different classes, and we may (like Lapata and Brew [1999]) want to classify the individual tokens of a verb.
    In future research we plan to extend our method to the case of ambiguous tokens, by ex
