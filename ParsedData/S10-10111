ic senses (Pantel and Lin, 2002), they often contain general definitions and suffer from the lack of explicit semantic or contextual links between concepts (Agirre et al., 2001).
    More importantly, the definitions of hand-crafted lexical databases often do not reflect the exact meaning of a target word in a given context (V&#180;eronis, 2004).
    Unsupervised Word Sense Induction (WSI) aims to overcome these limitations of handconstructed lexicons by learning the senses of a target word directly from text without relying on any hand-crafted resources.
    The primary aim of SemEval-2010 WSI task is to allow comparison of unsupervised word sense induction and disambiguation systems.
  
  
    The target word dataset consists of 100 words, 50 nouns and 50 verbs.
    For each target word, participants were provided with a training set in order to learn the senses of that word.
    In the next step, participating systems were asked to disambiguate unseen instances of the same words using their learned senses.
