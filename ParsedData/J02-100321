e Section 2); Case (ii), on the other hand, implies that hence, x E [[BV ]] while x E&#65533; [[Vi,j]].
    But r E [[BV]] n [[Vi,j]], so [[BV]] and [[Vi,j]] are not disjoint.
    Consequently, by Assumption (1), Case (ii) implies that [[Vi,a1]] n &#183; &#183; &#183; n [[Vi,an]] n [[Vi,j]] is a real subset of [[Vi,a1]] n &#183; &#183; &#183; n [[Vi,an]] n [[BV ]], contradicting the fact that FindBestValue prefers a more general Value (i.e., BV ) over a more specific one (i.e., Vi,j) only if it removes the same distractors.
  
  
    Both versions of the Incremental Algorithm have been proven to be intersectively complete.
    Now we widen the issue to include all other Boolean combinations, involving negation (i.e., complementation) and disjunction (i.e., union).5 This is natural, since properties expressed by Boolean combinations are implicit in the KB: if the KB lists the property POODLE and the property ALSATIAN, then it implicitly contains the property of being either a poodle or an Alsatian.
    This mo
