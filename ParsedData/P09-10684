by the shared protagonist.
    An event is a verb together with its constellation of arguments.
    An event slot is a tuple of an event and a particular argument slot (grammatical relation), represented as a pair (v, d) where v is a verb and d E {subject, object, prep}.
    A chain is a tuple (L, O) where L is a set of event slots and O is a partial (temporal) ordering.
    We will write event slots in shorthand as (X pleads) or (pleads X) for (pleads, subject) and (pleads, object).
    Below is an example chain modeling criminal prosecution.
    In this example, the protagonist of the chain is the person being prosecuted and the other unspecified event slots remain unfilled and unconstrained.
    Chains in the Chambers and Jurafsky (2008) model are ordered; in this paper rather than address the ordering task we focus on event and argument induction, leaving ordering as future work.
    The Chambers and Jurafsky (2008) model learns chains completely unsupervised, (albeit after parsing and resolving coreferen
