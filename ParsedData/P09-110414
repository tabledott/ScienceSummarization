termediary symbol I (see Figure 2(b)).
    Null productions are also a source of double counting, as there are many possible orders in which to attach null alignments to a bitext cell; we address this by adapting the grammar to force a null attachment order.
    We introduce symbols N00, N10, and N11 to represent whether a normal cell has taken no nulls, is accepting foreign nulls, or is accepting English nulls, respectively.
    We also introduce symbols I00, I10, and I11 to represent inverse cells at analogous stages of taking nulls.
    As Figures 2 (c) and (d) illustrate, the directions in which nulls are attached to normal and inverse cells differ.
    The N00 symbol is constructed by one or more &#8216;complete&#8217; inverted cells I11 terminated by a no-null I00.
    By placing I00 in the lower right hand corner, we allow the larger N00 to unambiguously attach nulls.
    N00 transitions to the N10 symbol and accepts any number of (e, &#183;) English terminal alignments.
    Then N10 transitions to N11
