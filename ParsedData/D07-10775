equired in languages such as English.
			Our results show that Chinese parses are useful in SMT in spite of this problem.
			We report results showing the precisionof the reordering rules?essentially testing how of ten the Chinese sentences are correctly reordered?
			to give more insight into this issue.
			We also report experiments which assess the impact of each type of reordering rule on translation accuracy.
	
	
			A number of researchers (Brown et al, 1992; Bergeret al, 1996; Niessen and Ney, 2004; Xia and McCord, 2004; Collins et al, 2005) have described ap proaches that preprocess the source language input in SMT systems.
			We are not, however, aware of work on this topic for translation from Chinese to English.
			Brown et al (1992) describe an analysis component for French which moves phrases around (in addition to other transformations) so the source and target sentences are closer to each other in word order.
			Berger et al (1996) describe an approach for French that reorders phrases of the for
