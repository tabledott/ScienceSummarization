ing the online texts available on the World Wide Web, Internet news, and E-mails.
    Until recently, a number of machine learning algorithms have been applied to this problem and have been proven successful in many domains (Sebastiani, 2002).
    In the traditional text classification tasks, one has to identify predefined text &#8220;topics&#8221;, such as politics, finance, sports or entertainment.
    For learning algorithms to identify these topics, a text is usually represented as a bag-of-words, where a text is regarded as a multi-set (i.e., a bag) of words and the word order or syntactic relations appearing in the original text is ignored.
    Even though the bag-of-words representation is naive and does not convey the meaning of the original text, reasonable accuracy can be obtained.
    This is because each word occurring in the text is highly relevant to the predefined &#8220;topics&#8221; to be identified.
