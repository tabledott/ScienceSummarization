ions, we ran experimentson POS tagging and text chunking with standard En glish data sets.
			Although achieving the best accuracy is not the primary purpose of this paper, we explored usefulfeature sets and parameter setting by using develop ment data in order to make the experiments realistic.
			4.1 Part-of-speech tagging experiments.
			We split the Penn Treebank corpus (Marcus et al, 1994) into training, development and test sets as in(Collins, 2002).
			Sections 0-18 are used as the train ing set.
			Sections 19-21 are the development set, andsections 22-24 are used as the test set.
			All the ex periments were carried out on the development set, except for the final accuracy report using the best setting.
			For features, we basically adopted the feature set Method Accuracy Speed (%) (tokens/sec) Left-to-right (Viterbi) 96.92 844 Right-to-left (Viterbi) 96.89 902 Dependency Networks 97.06 1,446 Easiest-last 96.58 2,360 Easiest-first 97.13 2,461 Full bidirectional 97.12 34Table 2: POS tagging accuracy a
