ollocations&amp;quot; to reflect its full generality; the features could be context words as well as collocations.
    In fact, the method subsumes the method of context words &#8212; it does everything that method does, and resolves conflicts among its features as well.
    To facilitate the conflict resolution, it sorts the features by decreasing strength.
    Like the method of context words, the method of collocations has one main parameter to tune: t, the maximum number of syntactic elements in a collocation.
    Since the number of collocations grows exponentially with e, it was only practical to vary t from 1 to 3.
    We tried this on some practice confusion sets, and found that all values of t gave roughly comparable performance.
    We selected t = 2 to use from here on, as a compromise between reducing the expressive power of collocations (with t = 1) and incurring a. high computational cost (with f = 3).
    Table 3 shows the results of varying E for the usual confusion sets.
    There is no clear
