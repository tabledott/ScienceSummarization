7).
    We go beyond the single sub-tree mapping model to propose a tree sequence alignment-based translation model.
    To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to empirically explore the tree sequence alignment based model in SMT.
    The leaf nodes of a sub-tree in a tree sequence can be either non-terminal symbols (grammar tags) or terminal symbols (lexical words).
    Given a pair of source and target parse trees (1 ) Fig.
    1, Fig.
    2 illustrates two examples of tree sequences derived from the two parse trees.
    A tree sequence translation rule r is a pair of aligned tree sequences r =&lt; TS f j , two tree sequences, satisfying the following condition: `d (i, j) E A : i1 &lt; i &lt; i2 H j1 &lt; j &lt; j2 .
    Fig.
    3 shows two rules extracted from the tree pair shown in Fig.
    1, where r1 is a tree-to-tree rule and r2 is a tree sequence-to-tree sequence rule.
    Obviously, tree sequence rules are more powerful than phrases or tree rules as they can capture all phrases (inc
