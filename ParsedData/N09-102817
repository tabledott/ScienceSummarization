n either automatically extracted syntactic rules (Xia and McCord, 2004; Habash, 2007) or manually written rules (Collins et.al., 2005; Wang et.al., 2007).
    Compared to these approaches, our work has a few differences.
    First of all, we study a wide range of SOV languages using manually extracted precedence rules, not just for one language like in these studies.
    Second, as we will show in the next section, we compare our approach to a very strong baseline with more advanced distance based reordering model, not just the simplest distortion model.
    Third, our precedence reordering rules, like those in Habash, 2007, are more flexible than those other rules.
    Using just one verb rule, we can perform the reordering of subject, object, preposition modifier, auxiliary verb, negation and the head verb.
    Although we use manually written rules in this study, it is possible to learn our rules automatically from alignments, similarly to Habash, 2007.
    However, unlike Habash, 2007, our manually writte
