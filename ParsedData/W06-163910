    We also removed speech segments containing the term &#8220;amendment&#8221;, since we found during initial inspection that these speeches generally reflect a speaker&#8217;s opinion on an amendment, and this opinion may differ from the speaker&#8217;s opinion on the underlying bill under discussion.
    We randomly split the data into training, test, and development (parameter-tuning) sets representing roughly 70%, 20%, and 10% of our data, respectively (see Table 1).
    The speech segments remained grouped by debate, with 38 debates
