at no operation is needed.'
    (2) There was no cost estimate for the There was estimate for phase the d d second phase second no cost i s Note that the metric is symmetric.
    When we tally the results we obtain the score shown in the first column of Table 1.
    Note that if there are insertions and deletions, the number of operations may be larger than the number of tokens involved for either one of the two strings.
    As a result, the simple string accuracy metric may .be,:negative (though_ Bever -greater than 1, of course).
    The simple string accuracy metric penalizes a misplaced token twice, as a deletion from its expected position and insertion at a different position.
    This is particularly worrisome in our case, since in our evaluation scenario the generated sentence is a permutation of the tokens in the reference string.
    We therefore use a second metric, Generation String Accuracy, shown in Equation (3), which treats deletion of a token at one location in the string and the insertion of
