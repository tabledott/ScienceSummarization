    We conclude from these preliminary experiments that it is worthwhile to explore corpus-based techniques, rather than relying on prior intuitions, to select good indicator features and to perform sentiment classification in general.
    These experiments also provide us with baselines for experimental comparison; in particular, the third baseline of 69% might actually be considered somewhat difficult to beat, since it was achieved by examination of the test data (although our examination was rather cursory; we do not claim that our list was the optimal set of fourteen words).
  
  
    Our aim in this work was to examine whether it suffices to treat sentiment classification simply as a special case of topic-based categorization (with the two &#8220;topics&#8221; being positive sentiment and negative sentiment), or whether special sentiment-categorization methods need to be developed.
