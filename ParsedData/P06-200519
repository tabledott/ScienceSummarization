pping model.
    We then conducted the experiment using the proposed method (Bi-gram LM plus a phrase-based lexical mapping model) through a five-fold cross validation on the 5000 parallel SMS messages.
    Table 6 shows the results.
    An average score of 0.8070 is obtained.
    Compared with the baseline performance in Table 5, the improvement is very significant.
    It suggests that the phrase-based lexical mapping model is very useful and our method is effective for SMS text normalization.
    Figure 2 is the learning curve.
    It shows that our algorithm converges when training data is increased to 3000 SMS parallel messages.
    This suggests that our collected corpus is representative and enough for training our model.
    Table 7 illustrates some examples of the normalization results.
    Experimental result analysis reveals that the strength of our model is in its ability to disambiguate mapping as in &#8220;2&#8221; to &#8220;two&#8221; or &#8220;to&#8221; and &#8220;w&#8221; to &#8220;with&#8221
