ining experiment run on the Penn Treebank, we apply these transformations to a separate training corpus.
    New supervised transformations are then learned by comparing the tagged corpus that results from applying these transformations with the correct tagging, as indicated in the manually annotated training corpus.
    In table 2, we show tagging accuracy on a separate test set using different sizes of manually annotated corpora.
    In each case, a 120,000 word untagged corpus was used for initial unsupervised training.
    This table also gives results from supervised training using the annotated corpus, without any prior unsupervised training.12 In all cases, the combined training outperformed the purely supervised training at no added cost in terms of annotated training text.
    Conclusions In this paper, we have presented a new algorithm for unsupervised training of a rule-based part of speech tagger.
    The rule-based tagger trained using this algorithm significantly outperforms the traditional meth
