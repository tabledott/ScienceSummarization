mples of subjective and objective sentences: In sentence 4, there is no uncertainty or evaluation expressed toward the speaking event.
    Thus, from one point of view, one might have considered this sentence to be objective.
    However, the object of the sentence is not presented as material that is factual to the reporter, so the sentence is classified as subjective.
    Linguistic categorizations usually do not cover all instances perfectly.
    For example, sentences may fall on the borderline between two categories.
    To allow for uncertainty in the annotation process, the specific tags used in this work include certainty ratings, ranging from 0, for least certain, to 3, for most certain.
    As discussed below in section 3.2, the certainty ratings allow us to investigate whether a model positing additional categories provides a better description of the judges' annotations than a binary model does.
    Subjective and objective categories are potentially important for many text processing applications
