s of cooccurrence with cues for NP.
    It does not matter what these frequencies are as long as they are greater than r_Np.
    If a coin has probability p of flipping heads, and if it is flipped n times, the probability of its coming up heads exactly m times is given by the binomial distribution: The probability of coming up heads m or more times is given by the obvious sum: Analogously, P(m+,n,r_s) gives the probability that m or more occurrences of a -S verb V will be followed by a cue for S out of n occurrences total.
    If m out of n occurrences of V are followed by cues for S, and if P(m+,n,7r_s) is quite small, then it is unlikely that V is -S. Traditionally, a threshold less than or equal to .05 is set such that a hypothesis is rejected if, assuming the hypothesis were true, the probability of outcomes as extreme as the observed outcome would be below the threshold.
    The confidence attached to this conclusion increases as the threshold decreases.
