    It has been our experience that it is very hard to design an experiment of any kind which will produce the desired agreement among judges.
    We are very happy with the 96.8% agreement that we were able to show, even if it is limited to a much easier task than the one that Jorgensen was interested in.
    We originally designed the experiment in Gale et al. (1992) to test the hypothesis that multiple uses of a polysemous word tend to have the same sense within a common discourse.
    A simple (but non-blind) pilot experiment provided some suggestive evidence confirming the hypothesis.
