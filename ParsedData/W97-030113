re sorted in decreasing order according to q(ailb), we only consider exploring those actions {al ... am} that hold most of the probability mass, where m is defined as follows: and where Q is a threshold less than 1.
    The search also uses a Tag Dictionary constructed from training data, described in (Ratnaparkhi, 1996), that reduces the number of actions explored by the tagging model.
    Thus there are three parameters for the search heuristic, namely K ,M, and Q and all experiments reported in this paper use K = 20, M = 20, and Q = .951 Table 4 describes the top K BFS and the semantics of the supporting functions.
    It should be emphasized that if K&gt; 1, the parser does not commit to a single POS or chunk assignment for the input sentence before building constituent structure.
    All three of the passes described in section 2 are integrated in the search, i.e., when parsing a test sentence, the input to the second pass consists of K of the best distinct POS tag assignments for the input sentence.
