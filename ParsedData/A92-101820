    Once a model has been estimated, selecting the most likely underlying sequence of state transitions corresponding to an observation S can be thought of as a maximization over all sequences that might generate S. An efficient dynamic programming procedure, known as the Viterbi algorithm [Viterbi, 1967], arranges for this computation to proceed in time proportional to T. Suppose V = {v(t)} 1 &lt; t &lt; T is a state sequence that generates S, then the probability that V generates S is, To find the most probable such sequence we start by defining 01(i) = rabi(Si) for 1 &lt; i &lt; N and then perform the recursion for 2 &lt; t &lt; T and 1 &lt; j &lt; N. The crucial observation is that for each time t and each state i one need only consider the most probable sequence arriving at state i at time t. The probability of the most probable sequence is maxi&lt;,&lt;N[OT(i)] while the sequence itself can be reconstructed by defining v(T) = max&lt;N OT(i) and v(t - 1) = Ike(qt) for T &gt; t &gt; 2.
