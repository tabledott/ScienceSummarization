 similarity in the local context, rather than on global alignment.
    Consider the two sentences in Figure 2.
    Analyzing the contexts surrounding &#8220; ?
    &#8221;marked blanks in both sentences, one expects that they should have the same meaning, because they have the same premodifier &#8220;empty&#8221; and relate to the same preposition &#8220;in&#8221; (in fact, the first &#8220; ?
    &#8221; stands for &#8220;sky&#8221;, and the second for &#8220;heavens&#8221;).
    Generalizing from this example, we hypothesize that if the contexts surrounding two phrases look similar enough, then these two phrases are likely to be paraphrases.
    The definition of the context depends on how similar the translations are.
    Once we know which contexts are good paraphrase predictors, we can extract paraphrase patterns from our corpus.
    Examples of such contexts are verb-object relations and noun-modifier relations, which were traditionally used in word similarity tasks from non-parallel corpora (Pereira et
