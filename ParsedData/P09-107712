xtRels data include a no-relation category which consists of sentences from the same text that are separated by at least three other sentences.
    To identify features useful for classifying comparison vs other relations, we chose a random sample of 5000 examples for Contrast and 5000 Other relations (2500 each of Cause and No-relation).
    For the complete set of 10,000 examples, word pair features were computed.
    After removing word pairs that appear less than 5 times, the remaining features were ranked by information gain using the MALLET toolkit1.
    Table 1 lists the word pairs with highest information gain for the Contrast vs. Other and Cause vs. Other classification tasks.
    All contain very frequent stop words, and interestingly for the Con1mallet.cs.umass.edu trast vs. Other task, most of the word pairs contain discourse connectives.
    This is certainly unexpected, given that word pairs were formed by deleting the discourse connectives from the sentences expressing Contrast.
