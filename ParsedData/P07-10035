igns to a target word outside of c, then the root of c is a frontier node.
    The remaining interior nodes do not generate rules, but can play a secondary role in a translation system.1 The roots of null-aligned constituents are not frontier nodes, but can attach productively to multiple minimal rules.
    Two transducer rules, t1 &#8212;* s1 and t2 &#8212;* s2, can be combined to form larger translation units by composing t1 and t2 at a shared frontier node and appropriately concatenating s1 and s2.
    However, no technique has yet been shown to robustly extract smaller component rules from a large transducer rule.
    Thus, for the purpose of maximizing the coverage of the extracted translation model, we prefer to extract many small, minimal rules and generate larger rules via composition.
    Maximizing the number of frontier nodes supports this goal, while inducing many aligned interior nodes hinders it.
    We now turn to the interaction between word alignments and the transducer extraction algorithm.
