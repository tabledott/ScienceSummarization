 to model monolingual sense differences.
    The use of dictionary definitions as an optional seed for the unsupervised algorithm stems from a long history of dictionary-based approaches, including Lesk (1986), Guthrie et al. (1991), Veronis and Ide (1990), and Slator (1991).
    Although these earlier approaches have used often sophisticated measures of overlap with dictionary definitions, they have not realized the potential for combining the relatively limited seed information in such definitions with the nearly unlimited co-occurrence information extractable from text corpora.
    Other unsupervised methods have shown great promise.
    Dagan and Itai (1994) have proposed a method using co-occurrence statistics in independent monolingual corpora of two languages to guide lexical choice in machine translation.
    Translation of a Hebrew verb-object pair such as lahtom (sign or seal) and hoze (contract or treaty) is determined using the most probable combination of words in an English monolingual corpus.
