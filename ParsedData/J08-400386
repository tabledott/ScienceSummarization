f distinct dependency labels for Japanese and the low percentage of non-projective dependencies for Bulgarian are factors that mitigate the effect of enlarging the set of dependency labels in pseudo-projective parsing.
    We conclude that the relative efficiency of non-projective and pseudo-projective parsing depends on several factors, of which sentence length appears to be the most important, but where the number of distinct dependency labels and the percentage of non-projective dependencies also play a role.
  
  
    Data-driven dependency parsing using supervised machine learning was pioneered by Eisner (1996), who showed how traditional chart parsing techniques could be adapted for dependency parsing to give efficient parsing with exact inference over a probabilistic model where the score of a dependency tree is the sum of the scores of individual arcs.
    This approach has been further developed in particular by Ryan McDonald and his colleagues (McDonald, Crammer, and Pereira 2005; McDonald et al. 20
