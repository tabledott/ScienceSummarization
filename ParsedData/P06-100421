e effectiveness of the algorithm.
    To test this hypothesis, we discard edges between nodes that are more than a certain number of sentences apart.
    We test the system on a range of data sets, including the Physics and AI lectures and the synthetic corpus created by Choi (2000).
    We also include segmentation results on Physics ASR transcripts.
    The results in Table 4 confirm our hypothesis &#8212; taking into account non-local lexical dependencies helps across different domains.
    On manually transcribed Physics lecture data, for example, the algorithm yields 0.394 Pk measure when taking into account edges separated by up to ten sentences.
    When dependencies up to a hundred sentences are considered, the algorithm yields a 25% reduction in Pk measure.
    Figure 3 shows the ROC plot for the segmentation of the Physics lecture data with different cutoff parameters, again demonstrating clear gains attained by employing longrange dependencies.
    As Table 4 shows, the improvement is consistent ac
