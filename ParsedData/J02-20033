    The problem with estimating a probability model defined over a large vocabulary of predicates and noun senses is that this involves a huge number of parameters, which results in a sparse-data problem.
    In order to reduce the number of parameters, we propose to define a probability model over senses in a semantic hierarchy and to exploit the fact that senses can be grouped into classes consisting of semantically similar senses.
    The assumption underlying this approach is that the probability of a particular noun sense can be approximated by a probability based on a suitably chosen class.
    For example, it seems reasonable to suppose that the proba
