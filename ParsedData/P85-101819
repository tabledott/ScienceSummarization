ext-freebased PATR-II, we make one more purely notational change.
    Rather than associating with each grammar rule a set of unifications, we instead associate a dag that incorporates all of those unifications implicitly, i.e., a rule is associated with a dag D, such that for all unifications of the form p q in the rule.
    D,(p) = D,(q).
    Similarly, unifications of the form p = a where a is atomic would require that D,(p) = a.
    For the rule mentioned above, such a dag would be Thus a rule can be thought of as an ordered pair (P, D) whore P is a production of the form Xo &#8212; &#8226; &#8226; X&#8222; and D is a (lag with top-level features X0, , X&#8222; and with atomic values for the cat feature of each of the top-level subdags.
    The two notational conventions&#8212;using sets of unifications instead of dags, and putting the cat feature information implicitly in the names of the constituents&#8212;allow us to write rules in the more compact and familiar.format above, rather than this final cumb
