rammar&#8217;s start symbol.
    Stolcke&#8217;s innovation, as regards prefix probabilities is to add two additional pieces of information to each state: &#945;, the forward, or prefix probability, and y the &#8220;inside&#8221; probability.
    He notes that path An (unconstrained) Earley path, or simply path, is a sequence of Earley states linked by prediction, scanning, or completion. constrained A path is said to be constrained by, or generate a string x if the terminals immediately to the left of the dot in all scanned states, in sequence, form the string x. .

    .
    The significance of Earley paths is that they are in a one-to-one correspondence with left-most derivations.
    This will allow us to talk about probabilities of derivations, strings and prefixes in terms of the actions performed by Earley&#8217;s parser.
    (Stolcke, 1995, page 8) This correspondence between paths of parser operations and derivations enables the computation of the prefix probability &#8211; the sum of all deriva
