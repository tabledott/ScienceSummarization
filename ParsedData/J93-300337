ults, we compared characteristics of phrasing and accent for host and nonhost data.
    The results showed no significant differences between host and caller tokens in terms of the hypotheses proposed above.
    First, host (n=37) and callers (n=63) produced discourse and sentential tokens in roughly similar proportions-40.5% sentential for the host and 34.9% for his callers.
    Similarly, there was no distinction between host and nonhost data in terms of choice of accent type, or accenting versus deaccenting.
    Our findings for position within phrase also hold for both host and nonhost data.
    However, in tendency to set discourse now apart as a separate intonational or intermediate phrase, there was an interesting distinction.
    While callers tended to choose from among the two options for discourse now in almost equal numbers (48.8% of their discourse nows were separate phrases), the host chose this option only 27.3% of the time.
    However, although host and caller data differed in the proportion
