from compound splitting in languages like German (Hollink et al., 2004), whereas automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems prefer having longer words in the speech lexicon (Gao et al., 2005).
    However, despite a decade of very intense work on Chinese to English machine translation (MT), the way in which Chinese word segmentation affects MT performance is very poorly understood.
    With current statistical phrase-based MT systems, one might hypothesize that segmenting into small chunks, including perhaps even working with individual characters would be optimal.
    This is because the role of a phrase table is to build domain and application appropriate larger chunks that are semantically coherent in the translation process.
    For example, even if the word for smallpox is treated as two one-character words, they can still appear in a phrase like &#8220;&#10095; It&#8212;*smallpox&#8221;, so that smallpox will still be a candidate translation when the system translates &#8220;&#10095;&#8221; &#8220;It&#8
