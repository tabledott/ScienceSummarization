on (SMT) has many hurdles to overcome.
    While it excels at translating domain-specific terminology and fixed phrases, grammatical generalizations are poorly captured and often mangled during translation (Thurmair, 04).
    State-of-the-art phrasal SMT systems such as (Koehn et al., 03) and (Vogel et al., 03) model translations of phrases (here, strings of adjacent words, not syntactic constituents) rather than individual words.
    Arbitrary reordering of words is allowed within memorized phrases, but typically only a small amount of phrase reordering is allowed, modeled in terms of offset positions at the string level.
    This reordering model is very limited in terms of linguistic generalizations.
    For instance, when translating English to Japanese, an ideal system would automatically learn largescale typological differences: English SVO clauses generally become Japanese SOV clauses, English post-modifying prepositional phrases become Japanese pre-modifying postpositional phrases, etc.
