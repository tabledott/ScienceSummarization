ses which cover different parts of the input sentence.
    This makes the comparison of the costs somewhat problematic.
    Therefore we integrate an (optimistic) estimation of the remaining costs to arrive at a full translation.
    This can be done efficiently by determining in advance for each word in the source language sentence a lower bound for the costs of the translation of this word.
    Together with the bit-vector stored in a partial hypothesis it is possible to achieve an efficient estimation of the remaining costs.
  
  
    The &amp;quot;Verbmobil Task&amp;quot; (Wahlster, 1993) is a speech translation task in the domain of appointment scheduling, travel planning, and hotel reservation.
    The task is difficult because it consists of spontaneous speech and the syntactic structures of the sentences are less restricted and highly variable.
    The translation direction is from German to English which poses special problems due to the big difference in the word order of the two languages.
    We p
