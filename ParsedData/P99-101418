ry limited degree of genuine interdefinability of lexical items and on Putnam's arguments for contextual determination of lexical meaning, indicate that the number of basic concepts has the order of magnitude of the lexicon itself.
    More concretely, a lexicon constructed along the above principles would identify verbs which are labelled with the same latent classes; for instance it might identify the representations of grab and touch.
    For these reasons, a semantically adequate lexicon must include additional relational constants.
    We meet this requirement in a simple way, by including as a conjunct a unique constant derived from the open-class root, as in the third tree in Fig.
    11.
    We introduce indexing of the open class root (copied from the class index) in order that homophony of open class roots not result in common conjuncts in semantic representations&#8212;for instance, we don't want the two senses of decline exemplified in decline the proposal and decline five percent to have an commo
