rammar defines a set of possible strings in the language and also defines a set of possible leftmost derivations under the grammar.
    Each derivation corresponds to a tree-sentence pair that is well formed under the grammar.
    A probabilistic context-free grammar is a simple modification of a context-free grammar in which each rule in the grammar has an associated probability P(&#946;  |X).
    This can be interpreted as the conditional probability of X&#8217;s being expanded using the rule X &#8594; &#946;, as opposed to one of the other possibilities for expanding X listed in the grammar.
    The probability of a derivation is then a product of terms, each term corresponding to a rule application in the derivation.
    The probability of a given tree-sentence pair (T, S) derived by n applications of context-free rules LHSi &#8594; RHSi (where LHS stands for &#8220;left-hand side,&#8221; RHS for &#8220;right-hand side&#8221;), 1 &lt; i &lt; n, under the PCFG is Booth and Thompson (1973) specify the condi
