ge of decomposition takes us from bags of words to the words that they contain.
    The following bag pair generation process illustrates how a wordto-word translation model can be embedded in a bag-to-bag translation model for languages Li and &#163;2: from LI x according to the distribution trans(ti, V), to lexicalize the concept in the two languages.'
    Some concepts are not lexicalized in some languages, so one of it, and V, may be empty.
    A pair of bags containing m and n nonempty word sequences can be generated by a process where / is anywhere between 1 and m n. For notational convenience, the elements of the two bags can be labeled so that Bi ,10 and B2 {Irlt &#8226; &#8226; &#8226; , VI}, where some of the ti's and V's may be empty.
    The elements of an assignment, then, are pairs of bag element labels: A {(ii, (ii,.//)}, where each i ranges over {di, , each] ranges over {VI, &#8226; &#8226; &#8226; , V.1}, each i is distinct, and each j is distinct.
    The label pairs in a given assignment ca
