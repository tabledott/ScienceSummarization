 in D, OrED R(r)&#8226; Then, the reverse value of an item can be formally defined as Next, we argue that this last expression equals the expression on the right-hand side of Equation 9, EDD v(D)cp,x).
    For an item x, any outer part of an item derivation tree for x can be combined with any inner part to form a complete item derivation tree.
    That is, any 0 E outer(x) and any I E inner(x) can be combined to form an item derivation tree D containing x, and any item derivation tree D containing x can be decomposed into such outer and inner trees.
    Thus, the list of all combinations of outer and inner trees corresponds exactly to the list of all item derivation trees containing x.
    In fact, for an item derivation tree D containing C(D, x) instances of x, there are C(D, x) ways to form D from combinations of outer and inner trees.
    Also, notice that for D combined from 0 and I completing the proof.
    0 There is a simple, recursive formula for efficiently computing reverse values.
    Recall that t
