  A Comparative Study On Reordering Constraints In Statistical Machine Translation
  
    In statistical machine translation, the generation of a translation hypothesis is computationally expensive.
    If arbitrary wordreorderings are permitted, the search problem is NP-hard.
    On the other hand, if we restrict the possible word-reorderings in an appropriate way, we obtain a polynomial-time search algorithm.
    In this paper, we compare two different reordering constraints, namely the ITG constraints and the IBM constraints.
    This comparison includes a theoretical discussion on the permitted number of reorderings for each of these constraints.
    We show a connection between the ITG constraints and the since 1870 known We evaluate these constraints on two tasks: the Verbmobil task and the Canadian Hansards task.
    The evaluation consists of two parts: First, we check how many of the Viterbi alignments of the training corpus satisfy each of these constraints.
    Second, we restrict the search to ea
