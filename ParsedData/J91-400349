 rather than an attribute over the entire noun denotation, as illustrated in Example 53 for fast motorway (cf.
    Pustejovsky and Boguraev [1991] for discussion).
    As our final example of how the qualia structure contributes to the semantic interpretation of a sentence, observe how the nominals window and door in Examples 54 and 55 carry two interpretations (cf.
    Lakoff [1987] and Pustejovsky and Anick [19881): a. John crawled through the window. b.
    The window is closed.
    Each noun appears to have two word senses: a physical object denotation and an aperture denotation.
    Pustejovsky and Anick (1988) characterize the meaning of such &amp;quot;Double Figure-Ground&amp;quot; nominals as inherently relational, where both parameters are logically part of the meaning of the noun.
    In terms of the qualia structure for this class of nouns, the formal role takes as its value the Figure of a physical object, while the constitutive role assumes the Invert-Figure value of an aperture.24 The foreground
