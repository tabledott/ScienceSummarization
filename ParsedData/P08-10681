ion is seen as crucial to resolving ambiguous relationships, yet lexicalized statistics are sparse and difficult to estimate directly.
    It is therefore attractive to consider intermediate entities which exist at a coarser level than the words themselves, yet capture the information necessary to resolve the relevant ambiguities.
    In this paper, we introduce lexical intermediaries via a simple two-stage semi-supervised approach.
    First, we use a large unannotated corpus to define word clusters, and then we use that clustering to construct a new cluster-based feature mapping for a discriminative learner.
    We are thus relying on the ability of discriminative learning methods to identify and exploit informative features while remaining agnostic as to the origin of such features.
    To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we conduct experiments in dependency parsing, which has been the focus of much recent research&#8212;e.g., see work in the CoNLL shared tasks on dependency parsing (Buchholz
