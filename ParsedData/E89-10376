    The formal picture developed by Kaplan and Bresnan, as clarified in Kaplan (1987), is illustrated in the following structures for sentence (1): The c-structure appears on the left, the f-structure on the right.
    The c-structureto-f-structure correspondence, 4), is shown by the linking lines.
    The correspondence 4) is a many-to-one function taking the S, VP and V nodes all into the same outermost unit of the f-stucture, The node-configuration at the top of the tree satisfies the statement S --0 NP VP in the context-free description language for the c-structure.
    As suggested by Kaplan (1987), this is a simple way of defining a collection of more specific properties of the tree, such as the fact that the S node (labeled ni) is the mother of the NP node (n2).
    These facts could also be written in equational form as M(n2)= where M denotes the function that takes a tree-node into its mother.
    Similarly, the outermost f-structure satisfies the assertions (Ii TENSE) = past, (fi SUM =12, and (f
