learns narrative-like knowledge in the form of IE templates; we learn sets of related events and semantic roles, as shown in this sample output from our system: {detonate, blow up, plant, explode, defuse, destroy} Perpetrator: Person who detonates, plants, blows up Instrument: Object that is planted, detonated, defused Target: Object that is destroyed, is blown up A semantic role, such as target, is a cluster of syntactic functions of the template&#8217;s event words (e.g., the objects of detonate and explode).
    Our goal is to characterize a domain by learning this template structure completely automatically.
    We learn templates by first clustering event words based on their proximity in a training corpus.
    We then use a novel approach to role induction that clusters the syntactic functions of these events based on selectional preferences and coreferring arguments.
    The induced roles are template-specific (e.g., perpetrator), not universal (e.g., agent or patient) or verb-specific.
    After learn
