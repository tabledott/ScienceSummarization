at a tree building deterministic parser cannot examine the context necessary to determine what is conjoined to what without constructing nodes which may turn out to be spurious, given the (ultimate) correct analysis.
    In what follows, we will illustrate each of these problems in more detail and sketch an approach to the analysis of coordinate structures which we believe can be extended to handle such structures deterministically and without semantic interaction.
    Consider the problem of analyzing sentences like (11.1-2).
    These two sentences are identical at the level of preterminal symbols; they differ only in the particular lexical items chosen as nouns, with the schematic lexical structure indicated by (11.3).
    However, (11.1) has the favored reading that the apples, pears and cherries are all ripe and from local orchards, while in (11.2), only the cheese is ripe and only the cider is from local orchards.
    From this, it is clear that (11.1) is read as a conjunction of three nouns within one
