to measures for the words that the multiword contains but this failed to improve performance, using WordNet and other machine readable resources as gold-standards for evaluation.
    There was some success though in using latent semantic analysis (LsA) models to identify multiwords by the fact that the component words are typically non-substitutable, but they felt that much of what is captured by this is already handled by the statistics that they employ.
    Lin (1999) had already done something similar to the substitutability experiments using the method he had proposed earlier (Lin, 1998a) for automatic thesaurus construction.
    He identified general multiwords involving several open-class words output from his parser and filtered by the log-likelihood statistic.
    Using the parser yielded much better results than just a simple window for co-occurrence relationships.
    Lin proposed that if there is a multiword obtained by substitution of either the head or modifier in the multiword with a near neighb
