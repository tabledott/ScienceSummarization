nd burnt, with the higher probability analysis typically occupying the root slot and the lower probability form typically forced to seek alignment elsewhere.
    Indeed, the pigeonhole principle is the most problematic of all the The remaining errors typically are due to sparse statistics for the lower frequency irregular forms.
    Mappings such as slew slay are particularly difficult because, with a corpus frequency of only 4, there is too little data to estimate a good context profile or an effectively discriminatory frequency profile.
    Enlarging the raw corpus size should improve performance in both of these cases.
  
  
    This paper has presented an original algorithm capable of inducing the accurate morphological analysis of even highly irregular verbs, starting with no paired &lt;inflection,root&gt; examples for training and no prior seeding of legal morphological transformations.
    It does so by treating morphological analysis predominantly as an alignment task in a large corpus, performing the
