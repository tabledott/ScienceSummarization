stical parsing.
			In the following section, we follow the notation in (Collins, 1997).
			Each non-terminal X in the tree is a syntactic label, which is lexicalized by annotating it with a word, w, and a POS tag, t syn . Thus, we write a non-.
			terminal as X(x), where X is a syntactic label and x = hw; t syn i. X(x) is then what is generated by the generative model.
			Each production LHS ) RHS in the PCFG is in the form: P (h)!L n (l n ):::L 1 (l 1 )H(h)R 1 (r 1 ):::R m (r m )where H is the head-child of the phrase, which in herits the head-word h from its parent P . L 1 :::L n and R 1 :::R m are left and right modifiers of H . Sparse data makes the direct estimation ofP(RHSjLHS) infeasible.
			Therefore, it is decom posed into several steps ? first generating the head, then the right modifiers from the head outward, then the left modifiers in the same way.
			Syntactic subcategorization frames, LC and RC, for the leftand right modifiers respectively, are generated be fore the generation of the modifiers.
