seful exercise, but rather than assessing the naive coders' accuracy, it in fact measures how well the instructions convey what these researchers think they do.
    (Krippendorff gives well-established techniques that generalize on this sort of &amp;quot;odd-man-out&amp;quot; result, which involve isolating particular coders, categories, and kinds of units to establish the source of any disagreement.)
    In Passonneau and Litman, the reason for comparing to the majority opinion is less clear.
    Despite our argument, there are occasions when one opinion should be treated as the expert one.
    For instance, one can imagine determining whether coders using a simplified coding scheme match what can be obtained by some better but more expensive method, which might itself be either objective or subjective.
    In these cases, we would argue that it is still appropriate to use the kappa statistic, in a variation which looks only at pairings of agreement with the expert opinion rather than at all possible pairs o
