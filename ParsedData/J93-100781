information retrieval, automatic thesauri compilation, and speech recognition are also discussed in Smadja (1991).

    For example, Quirk et al. in their extensive grammar book (1972) devote some 100 pages to such noun&#8212;determiner combinations.
    They include a large number of rules and list exceptions to those rules.
    Corpus analysis is a relatively recent domain of research.
    With the availability of large samples of textual data and automated tools such as part-of-speech taggers, it has become possible to develop and use automatic techniques for retrieving lexical information from textual corpora.
    In this paper some original techniques for the automatic extraction of collocations have been presented.
    The techniques have been implemented in a system, Xtract, and tested on several corpora.
    Although some other attempts have been made to retrieve collocations from textual corpora, no work has been able to retrieve the full range of the
