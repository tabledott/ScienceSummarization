nator (Reynar and Ratnaparkhi, 1997).

    It certainly would have been preferable to have four experts on the topics do the annotation but this was not possible.
    The following manual annotations were performed: The 63 double annotated gene regulation abstracts (set a) contained 547 sentences.
    The additional abstracts (set b) marked by Light' contained 344 sentences summing to 891 sentences of gene regulation abstracts.
    Thus, there is an average of almost 9 sentences per gene regulation abstract.
    The 100 turmeric abstracts (set e) contained 738 sentences.
    The other sets contain twice as man
