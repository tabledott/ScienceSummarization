 a predicate.
    Given such level of semantic information available at the RE level, we introduce two new features6.
    I SEMROLE the semantic role argumentpredicate pairs of REi.
    J SEMROLE the semantic role argumentpredicate pairs of REQ.
    For the ACE 2003 data, 11,406 of 32,502 automatically extracted noun phrases were tagged with 2,801 different argument-predicate pairs.
  
  
    We report in the following tables the MUC score (Vilain et al., 1995).
    Scores in Table 2 are computed for all noun phrases appearing in either the key or the system response, whereas Tables 3 and 4 refer to scoring only those phrases which appear in both the key and the response.
    We therefore discard those responses not present in the key, as we are interested in establishing the upper limit of the improvements given by our semantic features.
    That is, we want to define a baseline against which to establish the contribution of the semantic information sources explored here for coreference resolution.
