eting sentences in discourse can be viewed as the process of providing the best explanation of why the sentences would be true.
    In the TACITUS Project at SRI, we have developed a scheme for abductive inference that yields a significant simplification in the description of such interpretation processes and a significant extension of the range of phenomena that can be captured.
    It has been implemented in the TACITUS System (Stickel, 1982; Hobbs, 1986; Hobbs and Martin, 1987) and has been and is being used to solve a variety of interpretation problems in casualty reports, which are messages about breakdowns in machinery, as well as in other texts.1 It is well-known that people understand discourse so well because they know so much.
    Accordingly, the aim of the TACITUS Project has been to investigate how knowledge is used in the interpretation of discourse.
    This has involved building a large knowledge base of commonsense and domain knowledge (see Hobbs et al., 1986), and developing procedures for u
