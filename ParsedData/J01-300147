    All collocates are searched for within the sentence which contains the ambiguous word.
    If some particular collocation does not exist for an ambiguous word, for example if it is the first or last word in a sentence, then a null value (NoColl) is stored instead.
    Rather than storing the surface form of the cooccurrence, morphological roots are stored instead, as this allows for a smaller set of collocations, helping to cope with data sparseness.
    The surface form of the ambiguous word is
