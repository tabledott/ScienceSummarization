Word alignment for a German- English sentence pair.
			To describe these word-by-word aligmnents, we introduce the mapping j ---+ aj, which assigns a word f j in position j to a word el in position { = aj.
			The concept of these alignments i similar to the ones introduced by (Brown et al, 1990), but we wilt use another type of dependence in the probability distributions.
			Looking at such align- ments produced by a hmnan expert, it is evident that the mathematical model should try to cap- ture the strong dependence of aj on the previous aligmnent.
			Therefore the probability of alignment aj for position j should have a dependence on the previous alignment aj _ 1 : p(a j ia j_ l , i ) , where we have inchided the conditioning on the total length \[ of the English sentence for normal- ization reasons.
			A sinfilar approach as been cho- sen by (Da.gan et al, 1993).
			Thus the problem formulation is similar to that of the time align- ment problem in speech recognition, where the so-called IIidden Markov mode
