e derivations mirror the dependency analysis implicit in the head-percolation rules of (Magerman, 1995; Collins, 1997).
    For each node T1, these rules classify exactly one child of T1 as a head and the rest as either arguments or adjuncts.
    Using this classification we can construct a TAG derivation (including elementary trees) from a derived tree as follows: Rules (1) and (2) produce the desired result; rule (3) changes the analysis somewhat by making subtrees with recursive arguments into predicative auxiliary trees.
    It produces, among other things, the analysis of auxiliary verbs described in the previous section.
    It is applied in a greedy fashion, with potential rjs considered top-down and potential Bs bottomup.
    The complicated restrictions on 0 are simply to ensure that a well-formed TIG derivation is produced.
    Now that we have augmented the training data to include TAG derivations, we could try to directly estimate the parameters of the model from Section 2.
    But since the numbe
