 the head word of a constituent is valuable in predicting the constituent&#8217;s role.
    Of all the distributions presented, An example of overlap between identified frame elements and the true boundaries, caused by parser error.
    In this case two frame elements identified by the classifier (shaded subtrees) are entirely within the human annotation (indicated below the sentence), contributing two instances to row 2 of Table 9.
    P(r I h, pt, t) predicts the correct role most often (87.4% of the time) when training data for a particular head word have been seen.
    Because of the large vocabulary of possible head words, however, it also has the smallest coverage, meaning that it is likely that, for a given case in the test data, no frame element with the same head word will have been seen in the set of training sentences for the target word in question.
    To capitalize on the information provided by the head word, we wish to find a way to generalize from head words seen in the training data to other
