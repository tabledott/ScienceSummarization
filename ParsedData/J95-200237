ion contributes a term in which the rule probability is multiplied by the product of the e variables corresponding to the RHS nonterminals, unless the RHS contains a terminal (in which case the production contributes nothing to ex because it cannot possibly lead to E).
    The resulting nonlinear system can be solved by iterative approximation.
    Each variable ex is initialized to P(X -4 6), and then repeatedly updated by substituting in the equation right-hand sides, until the desired level of accuracy is attained.
    Convergence is guaranteed, since the ex values are monotonically increasing and bounded above by the true values P(X e) &lt; 1.
    For grammars without cyclic dependencies among &amp;producing nonterminals, this procedure degenerates to simple backward substitution.
    Obviously the system has to be solved only once for each grammar.
    The probability ex can be seen as the precomputed inner probability of an expansion of X to the empty string; i.e., it sums the probabilities of all Earle
