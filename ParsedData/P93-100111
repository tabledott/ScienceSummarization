    Figure 7 shows the errors for the &amp;quot;easy&amp;quot; dataset (&#8212; 1&#177;57 bytes), which ironically, happens to be somewhat harder for char_align because the &amp;quot;easy&amp;quot; set is 2.75 times longer than the &amp;quot;hard&amp;quot; dataset.
    (As in Figure 6, errors with an absolute value greater than 200 have been omitted; less than 1% of the data fall into this category.)
  
  
    How does char_align work?
    The program assumes that there will often be quite a number of words near x that will be the same as, or nearly the same as some word near f(x).
    This is especially true for historically related language pairs such as English and French, which share quite a number of cognates, e.g., government and gouvernement, though it also holds fairly well for almost any language pair that makes use of the Roman alphabet since there will usually be a fair number of proper nouns (e.g., surnames, company names, place names) and numbers (e.g., dates, times) that
