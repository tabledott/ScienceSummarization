    Variants (9) and (10) can be shown to be worse than (7) and (8) because they violate the centering rules presented in the next section.
    This example suggests that pronominalization and subject position are possible linguistic mechanisms for establishing and continuing some entity as the Cb.
    In the second utterance of these sequences, Susan is realized by a pronoun in subject position; 'she' is the Cb of this utterance.
    Utterance (7c) continues Susan as Cb, whereas utterance (8c) merely retains her.
    Utterances like (8c) may be used to provide a basis for a shift in Cb.11 However, this leaves open questions of the independence of syntactic role and pronominalization, and the predominance of either, for controlling centering.
    The fact that being in subject position contributes in and of itself to the likelihood an entity will be the highest-ranked Cf (i.e. likely to be the next Cb) can be seen by contrasting the following two sequences, which differ only in their final utterances: 11
