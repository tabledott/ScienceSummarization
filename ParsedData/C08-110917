t comparison with our approach difficult.Although our recall figures may seem low, es pecially when compared to other NLP tasks such as parsing and anaphora resolution, this is really a reflection of how difficult the task is. For example, in the problem of preposition selection in native text, a baseline using the most frequent preposition(of) results in precision and recall of 26%.
			In addi tion, the cloze tests presented earlier indicate thateven in well-formed text, agreement between na tive speakers on preposition selection is only 75%.In texts written by non-native speakers, rater dis agreement increases, as will be shown in the next section.
	
	
			While developing an error detection system forprepositions is certainly challenging, given the re sults from our work and others, evaluation also poses a major challenge.
			To date, single human annotation has typically been the gold standard for grammatical error detection, such as in the work of (Izumi et al, 2004), (Han et al, 2006), (Nagata et al, 200
