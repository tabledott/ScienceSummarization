ets, respectively.
    Perhaps more encouragingly, gains in Fmeasure are accompanied by simultaneous increase in recall and precision for all three data sets.
    Feature contribution.
    In an attempt to gain additional insight into the contribution of partition-based features and method-based features, we train our ranking model using each type of features in isolation.
    Results are shown in rows 4 and 5 of Table 3.
    For the NPAPER and NWIRE data sets, we still see gains in F-measure over both baseline systems when the model is trained using either type of features.
    The gains, however, are smaller than those observed when the two types of features are applied in combination.
    Perhaps surprisingly, the results for BNEWS do not exhibit the same trend as those for the other two data sets.
    Here, the method-based features alone are strongly predictive of good candidate partitions, yielding even slightly better performance than when both types of features are applied.
    Overall, however, these
