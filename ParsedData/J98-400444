n PCFG parsing models, it seems that the general transformation/detransformation approach can be applied to a wider range of probA(Average of Precision and Recall) lems.
    For example, it would be interesting to know to what extent the performance of more sophisticated parsing systems, such as those described by Collins (1996) and Charniak (1997), depends on the particular tree representations they are trained on.
  
  
    I would like to thank Dick Oehrle and Chris Manning, Eugene Charniak and my other colleagues at Brown, and the CL reviewers for their excellent advice in this research.
