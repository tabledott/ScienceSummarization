f this representation offers several advantages: /top&#176; /wh-question process: semantic labels identify the basic units of meaning, while syntactic structures help identify relationships between those units.
    The parsing model is a probabilistic recursive transition network similar to those described in (Miller et al. 1994) and (Seneff 1992).
    The probability of a parse tree T given a word string W is rewritten using Bayes rule as: Since P(W) is constant for any given word string, candidate parses can be ranked by considering only the product P(T) P(W I 7).
    The probability P(7) is modeled by state transition probabilities in the recursive transition network, and P(W I 7) is modeled by word transition probabilities.
    P(location/pp I arrivaL/vp-head, arrival/vp) is the probability of a location/pp following an arrivaMvphead within an arrivallvp constituent. probability along the path corresponding to T. Transition probabilities are estimated directly by observing occurrence and transition freque
