Fs (Sha and Pereira, 2003), that is, Thus, we can easily optimize L1 by using the forward-backward algorithm since this paper solely focuses on a sequence model and a gradient-based optimization algorithm in the same manner as those used in supervised CRF parameter estimation.
    We cannot naturally incorporate unlabeled data into standard discriminative learning methods since the correct outputs y for unlabeled data are unknown.
    On the other hand with a generative approach, a well-known way to achieve this incorporation is to use maximum marginal likelihood (MML) parameter estimation, i.e., (Nigam et al., 2000).
    Given unlabeled data Du = {xm}Mm=1, MML estimation in our setting maximizes the marginal distribution of a joint PM over a missing (hidden) variable y, namely, it maximizes Em log Ey&#8712;Y p(xm, y; &#952;).
    Following this idea, there have been introduced a parameter estimation approach for non-generative approaches that can effectively incorporate unlabeled data (Suzuki et al., 2007).
