the word is monosemous (has a single sense in WordNet), assign that sense to it.
  If the word is polysemous (has more than one sense in Word- Net), choose asense at random with a probability of l/n, where n is the number of different senses of that word.
  This guess.ing heuristic was then used with the sample of 103 pas- sages from the Brown Corpus.
  Given the distribution ofopen-class words in those passages and the number of senses of each word in WordNet, estimating the probability of a correct sense identification is a straightforward calculation.
  The result was that 45.0% of the 101,284 guesses would be correct.
  When the percent correct was calculated for just the 76,067 polysemous word tokens, it was 26.8%.
  THE MOST-FREQUENT HEURIST IC Data on sense frequencies do exist.
  During the 1930s, Lorge [4] hired students at Columbia University to count how often each of the senses in the Oxford English Dictionary occurred in some 4,500,000 running words of prose taken from magazines of the day.
