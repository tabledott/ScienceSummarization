le labeling, we assume the existence of a separate parsing model that can assign a parse tree t to each sentence, and the task then is to label each node in the parse tree with the semantic role of the phrase it dominates, or NONE, if the phrase does not fill any role.
    We do stress however that the joint framework and features proposed here can also be used when only a shallow parse (chunked) representation is available as in the CoNLL-2004 shared task (Carreras and M`arquez, 2004).
    In the February 2004 version of the PropBank corpus, annotations are done on top of the Penn TreeBank II parse trees (Marcus et al., 1993).
    Possible labels of arguments in this corpus are the core argument labels ARG[0-5], and the modifier argument labels.
    The core arguments ARG[3-5] do not have consistent global roles and tend to be verb specific.
    There are about 14 modifier labels such as ARGM-LOC and ARGM-TMP, for location and temporal modifiers respectively.'
