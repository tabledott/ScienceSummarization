plete syntactic analyses of all input and on semantic analysis based on handcrafted knowledge.
    However, grammars are incomplete, text often contains new words, and there are errors in text.
    Furthermore, as research activities tackle broader domains, if the research results are to scale up to realistic applications, handcrafting knowledge must give way to automatic knowledge base construction.
    An alternative to traditional parsers is represented in FIDDITCH (Hindle 1983), MITFP (de Marcken 1990), and CASS (Abney 1990).
    Instead of requiring complete parses, a forest is frequently produced, each tree in the forest representing a nonoverlapping fragment of the input.
    However, algorithms for finding the semantics of the whole from the disjoint fragments have not previously been developed or evaluated.
    We have been comparing several differing algorithms from various sites to evaluate both the effectiveness of such a strategy in correctly predicting fragments.
    This is reported first (Sect
