u late WSD models so that they produce features that can directly be used in translation decisions taken by the SMT system.
			It is therefore necessary for the WSD and SMT systems to consider exactly the same translation candidates for a given word in the input language.
			Assuming a standard phrase-based SMT system(e.g., Koehn et al (2003)), WSD senses are thus ei ther words or phrases, as learned in the SMT phrasal translation lexicon.
			Those ?sense?
			candidates arevery different from those typically used even in ded icated WSD tasks, even in the multilingual Sensevaltasks.
			Each candidate is a phrase that is not neces sarily a syntactic noun or verb phrase as in manuallycompiled dictionaries.
			It is quite possible that dis tinct ?senses?
			in our WSD for SMT system could beconsidered synonyms in a traditional WSD frame work, especially in monolingual WSD.In addition to the consistency requirements for integration, this requirement is also motivated by empirical studies, which show that predefine
