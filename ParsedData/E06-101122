The treebank contains a small number of inter-sentence and cyclic dependencies and we removed all sentences that contained such structures.
    The resulting data set contained 5384 sentences.
    We partitioned the data into contiguous 80/20 training/testing splits.
    We held out a subset of the training data for development purposes.
    We compared three systems, the standard second-order projective and non-projective parsing models, as well as our modified second-order non-projective model that allows for the introduction of multiple parents (Section 3).
    All systems use gold-standard part-of-speech since no trained tagger is readily available for Danish.
    Results are shown in Figure 3.
    As might be expected, the nonprojective parser does slightly better than the projective parser because around 1% of the edges are non-projective.
    Since each word may have an arbitrary number of parents, we must use precision and recall rather than accuracy to measure performance.
    This also means that th
