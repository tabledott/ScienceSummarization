    Most words in natural language have multiple possible meanings that can only be determined by considering the context in which they occur.
    Given a target word used in a number of different contexts, word sense discrimination is the process of grouping these instances of the target word together by determining which contexts are the most similar to each other.
    This is motivated by (Miller and Charles, 1991), who hypothesize that words with similar meanings are often used in similar contexts.
    Hence, word sense discrimination reduces to the problem of finding classes of similar contexts such that each class represents a single word sense.
    Put another way, contexts that are grouped together in the same class represent a particular word sense.
    While there has been some previous work in sense discrimination (e.g., (Sch&#168;utze, 1992), (Pedersen and Bruce, 1997), (Pedersen and Bruce, 1998), (Sch&#168;utze
