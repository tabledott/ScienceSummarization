    We believe we can easily make it faster by programming techniques, for example, using distributed puting. com Out of 31 queries, the system is unable to build any tables for 11 queries.
    The major reason is that the IR component can&#8217;t find enough newspaper articles on the topic.
    It retrieved only a few articles for topics like &#8220;born&#8221;, &#8220;divorce&#8221; or &#8220;injure&#8221; from The New York Times.
    For the moment, we will focus on the 20 queries for which tables were built.
    The Appendix shows some examples of queries and the generated tables.
    In total, 127 tables are created for the 20 topics, with one to thirteen tables for each topic.
    The number of columns in a table ranges from 2 to 10, including the document ID column, and the average number of columns is 3.0.
    The number of rows in a table range from 3 to 125, and the average number of rows is 16.9.
    The created tables are usually not fully filled; the average rate is 20.0%.
