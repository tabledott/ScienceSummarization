following a tf.idf like approach.
    The results show that our methods clearly outperform Tsatsa07.
    The fact that the Spr method works better suggests that the traditional PageRank algorithm is a superior method for ranking the subgraph nodes.
    As stated before, all methods presented here use some LKB for performing WSD.
    (Mihalcea, 2005) and (Sinha and Mihalcea, 2007) use WordNet relations as a knowledge source, but neither of them specify which particular version did they use.
    (Tsatsaronis et al., 2007) uses WordNet 1.7 enriched with eXtended WordNet relations, just as we do.
    Both (Navigli and Velardi, 2005; Navigli and Lapata, 2007) use WordNet 2.0 as the underlying LKB, albeit enriched with several new relations, which are manually created.
    Unfortunately, those manual relations are not publicly available, so we can&#8217;t directly compare their results with the rest of the methods.
    In (Agirre and Soroa, 2008) we experiment with different LKBs formed by combining relations of di
