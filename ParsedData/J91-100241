, the automation would require a significant effort.
    A machine-readable thesaurus with automated index searching and lookup is required.
    The texts we have analyzed, here and elsewhere (Morris 1988) are general-interest articles taken from magazines.
    They were chosen specifically to illustrate that lexical cohesion, and hence this tool, is not domain-specific.
    The methods used in this work improve on those from Halliday and Hasan (1976).
    Halliday and Hasan related words back to the first word to which they are tied, rather than forming explicit lexical chains that include the relationships to intermediate words in the chain.
    They had no notions of transitivity, distance between words in a chain, or chain returns.
    Their intent was not a computational means of finding lexical chains, and they did not suggest a thesaurus for this purpose.
    Ventola (1987) analyzed lexical cohesion and text structure within the framework of systemic linguistics and the specific domain of service encou
