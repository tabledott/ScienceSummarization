tachment score (LAS), that is, the percentage of tokens that are assigned the correct head and dependency label, as well as the unlabeled attachment score (UAS), that is, the percentage of tokens with the correct head, and the label accuracy (LA), that is, the percentage of tokens with the correct dependency label.
    All scores were computed with the scoring software from the CoNLL-X shared task, eval.pl, with default settings.
    This means that punctuation tokens are excluded in all scores.
    In addition to parsing accuracy, we evaluated efficiency by measuring the learning time and parsing time in seconds for each data set.
    Before turning to the results of the evaluation, we need to fulfill the promise from Remarks 1 and 2 to discuss the way in which treebank-induced classifiers approximate oracles and to what extent they satisfy the condition of constant-time operation that was assumed in all the results on time complexity in Sections 4 and 5.
    When predicting the next transition at run-time,
