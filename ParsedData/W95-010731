iscover some rules that allowed it to fix certain classes of VBG and VBN mistaggings, for example, rules that retagged VBNs as I when they preceded an NN or NNS tagged I.
    However, many also remained unresolved, and many of those appear to be cases that would require more than local word and part-of-speech patterns to resolve.
    The second most common class of errors involved conjunctions, which, combined with the former class, make up half of all the errors in the sample.
    The Treebank tags the words &amp;quot;and&amp;quot; and frequently &amp;quot;,&amp;quot; with the part-of-speech tag CC, which the baseline system again predicted would fall most often outside of a baseNP3.
    However, the Treebank parses do also frequently classify conjunctions of Ns or NPs as a single baseNP, and again there appear to be insufficient clues in the word and tag contexts for the current system to make the distinction.
    Frequently, in fact, the actual choice of structure assigned by the Treebank annotators seemed
