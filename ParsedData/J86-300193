    One would expect that there might be cue phrases that would distinguish among all four of these kinds of changes.
    Just that is so.
    There are cue phrases that announce one and only one kind of change.
    The cue phrases mentioned above for new dominance are never used for the three kinds of discourse interruption pushes.
    The cue phrases for true-interruptions express the intention to interrupt (e.g.
    Excuse me a minute, or I must interrupt) while the distinct cue phrase for flashbacks (e.g.
