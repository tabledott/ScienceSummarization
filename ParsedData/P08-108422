the relevant Chinese Restaurant Processes (with a minor adjustment to take into account the number of stray and abstract morphemes resulting from each decision).
    See (Neal, 1998) for general formulas for Gibbs sampling from distributions with Dirichlet process priors.
    All results reported are averaged over five runs using simulated annealing.
  
  
    Morpheme Definition For the purpose of these experiments, we define morphemes to include conjunctions, prepositional and pronominal affixes, plural and dual suffixes, particles, definite articles, and roots.
    We do not model cases of infixed morpheme transformations, as those cannot be modeled by linear segmentation.
    Dataset As a source of parallel data, we use the Hebrew Bible and translations.
    For the Hebrew version, we use an edition distributed by Westminster Hebrew Institute (Groves and Lowery, 2006).
    This Bible edition is augmented by gold standard morphological analysis (including segmentation) performed by biblical scholars.
