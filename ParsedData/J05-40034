 in the figure connect sentence pairs that are approximate translations of each other.
    Discovering these links automatically is clearly non-trivial.
    Traditional sentence alignment algorithms (Gale and Church 1991; Wu 1994; Fung and Church 1994; Melamed 1999; Moore 2002) are designed to align sentences in parallel corpora and operate on the assumption that there are no reorderings and only limited insertions and deletions between the two renderings of a parallel document.
    Thus, they perform poorly on comparable, non-parallel texts.
    What we need are methods able to judge sentence pairs in isolation, independent of the (potentially misleading) context.
    This article describes a method for identifying parallel sentences in comparable corpora and builds on our earlier work on parallel sentence extraction (Munteanu, Fraser, and Marcu 2004).
    We describe how to build a maximum entropy-based classifier that can reliably judge whether two sentences are translations of each other, without making u
