that the the refor- mation acquired is coarse-grained.
  There are many ways that the structure of a lan- guage can indicate the meanings of lexical items, but the difficulty lies in finding constructions that fre- quently and reliably indicate the relation of interest.
  It might seem tbat because free text is so varied in form and content (as compared with the somewhat regular structure of the dictionary) that it may not be possible to find such constructions.
  However, we have identified a set of lexico-syntactic patterns, in- cluding the one shown in (In) above, that indicate the hyponymy relation and that satisfy the following desiderata: (i) They occur frequently and in many text genres.
  (ii) They (almost) always indicate the relation of in- terest.
  (iii) They can be recognized with little or no pre- encoded knowledge.
  Item (i) indicates that the pattern will result in the discovery of many instances of the relation, item (ii) that the information extracted will not be erroneous, and item (iii) t
