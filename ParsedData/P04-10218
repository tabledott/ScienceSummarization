 example.
    Although we can arrive at an obvious segmentation /s-mi-th/, there are three Chinese characters for each of /s-/, /-mi-/ and /-th/.
    Furthermore, /s-/ and /-th/ correspond to overlapping characters as well, as shown next.
    A human translator will use transliteration rules between English syllable sequence and Chinese character sequence to obtain the best mapping &#21490;&#23494;-&#26031;, as indicated in italic in the table above.
    To address the issues in transliteration, we propose a direct orthographic mapping (DOM) framework through a joint source-channel model by fully exploring orthographic contextual information, aiming at alleviating the imprecision introduced by the multiple-step phoneme-based approach.
  
  
    In view of the close coupling of the source and target transliteration units, we propose to estimate P(E,C) by a joint source-channel model, or n-gram transliteration model (TM).
    For K aligned transliteration units, we have characters.
    A Chinese character may c
