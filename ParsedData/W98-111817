vs. a prediction in the main body of text.
    Proteus, like many hand-coded systems, is more accurate in the main body of the text than in headline-type material.
    We found that this compound feature gave the system slightly higher performance than we got when we just used section features and external system features separately.
    It seems reasonable that adding an ability to handle fully general compound features (i.e. feature A fires if features B and C both fire) would improve system performance based on this limited experiment.
    In addition to allowing us to predict futures based on multi-word patterns, it would also let us use other promising combinations of features such as distinguishing between capitalization in a headline vs. in the main body of the text.
    Unfortunately, this experiment will have to wait until we deploy a more sophisticated method of feature selection, as discussed in the next section.
  
  
    Features are chosen by a very simple method.
