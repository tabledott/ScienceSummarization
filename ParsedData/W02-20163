ilities are mutually independent, P(D|B) can be rewritten as: modifies bj. fzj is an n dimensional feature vector that represents various kinds of linguistic features related to the segments bz and bj.
    We obtain Dbest = argmaxD P(D|B) taking into all the combination of these probabilities.
    Generally, the optimal solution Dbest can be identified by using bottom-up parsing algorithm such as CYK algorithm.
    The problem in the dependency structure analysis is how to estimate the dependency probabilities accurately.
    A number of statistical and machine learning approaches, such as Maximum Likelihood estimation (Fujio and Matsumoto, 1998), Decision Trees (Haruno et al., 1999), Maximum Entropy models (Uchimoto et al., 1999; Uchimoto et al., 2000; Kanayama et al., 2000), and Support Vector Machines (Kudo and Matsumoto, 2000), have been applied to estimate these probabilities.
    In order to apply a machine learning algorithm to dependency analysis, we have to prepare the positive and negative examples.
