ntent and, at the same time, must be able to generate references to entities and events that were previously described.
    At the current stage, the description generator has the following coverage: person's profile with the profile of the organization of which he is a member.
    We should note that extensive research in this field exists and we plan to make use of one of the proposed methods (Wacholder, Ravin, and Choi 1997) to solve this problem.
    An important issue is portability of SUMMONS to other domains.
    There are no a priori restrictions in our approach that would limit SUMMONS to template-based inputs (and hence, shallow knowledge representation schemes without recursion).
    It would be interesting to determine the actual number of different representation schemes for news in general.
    Since there exist systems that can learn extraction rules for unrestricted domains (Lehnert et al. 1993), the information extraction doesn't seem to present any fundamental bottleneck either.
    Rather t
