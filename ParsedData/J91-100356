metaphorical relation.
    Any other match of cells is interpreted as not analogical and thus an anomalous semantic relation is recognized (see Fass 1986; 1987).
    The third component of CS is the semantic vector which is a form of representation, like the sense-frame; but sense-frames represent lexical knowledge, whereas semantic vectors represent coherence.
    Semantic vectors are therefore described as a kind of coherence representation.
    A semantic vector is a data structure that contains nested labels and ordered arrays structured by a simple dependency syntax.
    The labels form into sets.
    The outer sets of labels indicate the application of the three kinds of lexical semantic constraints.
    The outermost set of labels is 'preference' and 'assertion.'
    The middle set is 'relevant' and 'nonrelevant.'
    The innermost set is the kind of mapping used: 'network path' and 'cell matches.'
    The nesting of labels shows the order in which each source of knowledge was introduced.
    The order
