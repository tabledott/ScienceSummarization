ing, most sites spent several days just studying the scenario description and annotated corpus, in order to understand tile sce- nario definition, before coding began.
  Perhaps a micro-MUC 9 with an even simpler template struc- ture, is needed to push the limits of port, ability.
  Getting systems which can be custonfized by oth- ers is also a tall order, given the complexity and variety of knowledge sources needed for a typical MUC information extraction task.
  With respect to performance, tile bunching of scores uggests that many sites were able to solve a common set of "easy" problems, but were stymied in processing messages which involved "hard" problems.
  Whether this is true, and just what the hard problems are, will require more extensive analysis of the results of MUC-6.
  Are the short- comings due primarily to a lack of coverage in the basic patterns, to a lack of background knowledge in the domain, to failures in coreference, or some- thing else?
  may hope that the failings are primarily in one
