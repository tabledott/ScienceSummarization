pological order, and finally at the root node TOP, we can compute the best global F-score by maximizing over different numbers of test brackets (line 7).
    The oracle tree y+ can be recursively restored by keeping backpointers for each ora[v](t), which we omit in the pseudocode.
    The time complexity of this algorithm for a sentence of l words is O(JEJ &#183; l2(a&#8722;1)) where a is the arity of the forest.
    For a CKY forest, this amounts to O(l3 &#183; l2) = O(l5), but for general forests like those in our experiments the complexities are much higher.
    In practice it takes on average 0.05 seconds for forests pruned by p = 10 (see Section 4.2), but we can pre-compute and store the oracle for each forest before training starts.
    Our forest pruning algorithm (Jonathan Graehl, p.c.) is very similar to the method based on marginal probability (Charniak and Johnson, 2005), except that ours prunes hyperedges as well as nodes.
    Basically, we use an Inside-Outside algorithm to compute the Viterbi in
