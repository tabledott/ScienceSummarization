g constituents to be syntactically motivated does not lead to better constituent pairs, but only fewer constituent pairs, with loss of a good amount of valuable knowledge.&#8221; This statement is consistent with our findings.
    However, most of the knowledge loss could be prevented by allowing a gap.
    With a parse tree constraining constituents on the English side, the coverage failure rate was 61% for the Chinese/English bitext (top row of Table 3), but allowing a gap decreased it to 6%.
    Zhang and Gildea (2004) found that their alignment method, which did not use external syntactic constraints, outperformed the model of Yamada and Knight (2001).
    However, Yamada and Knight&#8217;s model could explain only the data that would pass the nogap test in our experiments with one constraining tree (first column of Table 3).
    Zhang and Gildea&#8217;s conclusions might have been different if Yamada and Knight&#8217;s model were allowed to use discontinuous constituents.
