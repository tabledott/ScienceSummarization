o judges: Rank each constituent translation from Best to Worst relative to the other choices (ties are allowed).
    Grade only the highlighted part of each translation.
    Please note that segments are selected automatically, and they should be taken as an approximate guide.
    They might include extra words that are not in the actual alignment, or miss words on either end.
    The criteria that we used to select which constituents were to be evaluated were: The final criterion helped reduce the number of alignment errors.
    We collected judgments using a web-based tool.
    Shared task participants were each asked to judge 200 sets of sentences.
    The sets consisted of 5 system outputs, as shown in Figure 3.
    The judges were presented with batches of each type of evaluation.
    We presented them with five screens of adequacy/fluency scores, five screens of sentence rankings, and ten screens of constituent rankings.
    The order of the types of evaluation were randomized.
