he extensions and adaptations needed for applying our anaphora resolution system (M&#168;uller et al., 2002; Strube et al., 2002) to pronoun resolution in spoken dialogue.
    There are important differences between written text and spoken dialogue which have to be accounted for.
    The most obvious difference is that in spoken dialogue there is an abundance of (personal and demonstrative) pronouns with non-NP-antecedents or no antecedents at all.
    Corpus studies have shown that a significant amount of pronouns in spoken dialogue have non-NP-antecedents: Byron &amp; Allen (1998) report that about 50% of the pronouns in the TRAINS93 corpus have non-NP-antecedents.
