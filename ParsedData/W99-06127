for boundaries that will match the actual separators, this second approach represents a generalization of the one using tokenized text.
    However, the first method, in which the text is tokenized, presents the advantage that statistics for both tokens and types can be kept and, as the results show, the statistics for types seem to be more reliable than those for tokens.
    Using the second method, there is no single definition of &amp;quot;type&amp;quot;, given that there are multiple possible boundaries for each token instance, but there are ways to gather statistics, such as considering what we may call &amp;quot;probable types&amp;quot; according to the boundary probabilities or keeping statistics on sistrings (semi-infinite strings).
    Some other advantages and disadvantages of the two methods will be discussed below.
  
  
    Before describing the algorithm, we will present a brief overview of some of its goals: Three important concepts are used in our model: 2.1 Trie structures are used for both m
