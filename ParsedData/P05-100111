    The idea is to discover useful features (which do not necessarily appear in the labeled data) from the unlabeled data through learning auxiliary problems.
    Clearly, auxiliary problems more closely related to the target problem will be more beneficial.
    However, even if some problems are less relevant, they will not degrade performance severely since they merely result in some irrelevant features (originated from irrelevantO-components), which ERM learners can cope with.
    On the other hand, potential gains from relevant auxiliary problems can be significant.
    In this sense, our method is robust.
    We present two general strategies for generating useful auxiliary problems: one in a completely unsupervised fashion, and the other in a partiallysupervised fashion.
    In the first strategy, we regard some observable substructures of the input dataXas auxiliary class labels, and try to predict these labels using other parts of the input data.
