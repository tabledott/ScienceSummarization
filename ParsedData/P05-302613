    Table 1 shows the scores of the three systems, with their names obscured to protect their privacy.
    Also shown are the score of MEMT&#8217;s output and the score of the oracle system that chooses the best original translation on a sentence-by-sentence basis.
    The score of the MEMT system is significantly better than any of the original systems, and the sentence oracle.
    On the first 140 sentences, the oracle system that selects the best hypothesis translation generated by the MEMT generator has a METEOR score of 0.5883.
    This indicates that the scoring algorithm used to select the final MEMT output can be significantly further improved.
  
  
    Our MEMT algorithm shows consistent improvement in the quality of the translation compared any of the original systems.
    It scores better than an &#8220;oracle&#8221; that chooses the best original translation on a sentence-by-sentence basis.
    Furthermore, o
