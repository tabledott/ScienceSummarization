nstraints that forbid some arc configurations.
    Their formulation includes an exponential number of constraints&#8212;one for each possible cycle.
    Since it is intractable to throw in all constraints at once, they propose a cuttingplane algorithm, where the cycle constraints are only invoked when violated by the current solution.
    The resulting algorithm is still slow, and an arc-factored model is used as a surrogate during training (i.e., the hard constraints are only used at test time), which implies a discrepancy between the model that is optimized and the one that is actually going to be used.
    Here, we propose ILP formulations that eliminate the need for cycle constraints; in fact, they require only a polynomial number of constraints.
    Not only does our model allow expert knowledge to be injected in the form of constraints, it is also capable of learning soft versions of those constraints from data; indeed, it can handle features that are not arc-factored (correlating, for example, sibling
