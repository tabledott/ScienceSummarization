er for extracting training instances (Bender et al., 2003; Hendrickx and Van den Bosch, 2003) or obtaining extra named entities for gazetteers (De Meulder and Daelemans, 2003; McCallum and Li, 2003).
    A reasonable number of groups have also employed unannotated data for obtaining capitalization features for words.
    One participating team has used externally trained named entity recognition systems for English as a part in a combined system (Florian et al., 2003).
    Table 4 shows the error reduction of the systems Table 4: Error reduction for the two development data sets when using extra information like gazetteers (G), unannotated data (U) or externally developed named entity recognizers (E).
    The lines have been sorted by the sum of the reduction percentages for the two languages. with extra information compared to while using only the available training data.
    The inclusion of extra named entity recognition systems seems to have worked well (Florian et al., 2003).
    Generally the systems th
