rect on Test (3.1% error reduction) and M 97.07% (3.9% error reduction).
  
  
    Our experiment shows that, at least for the task at hand, combination of several different systems allows us to raise the performance ceiling for data driven systems.
    Obviously there is still room for a closer examination of the differences between the combination methods, e.g. the question whether Memory-Based combination would have performed better if we had provided more training data than just Tune, and of the remaining errors, e.g. the effects of inconsistency in the data (cf.
    Ratnaparkhi 1996 on such effects in the Penn Treebank corpus).
    Regardless of such closer investigation, we feel that our results are encouraging enough to extend our investigation of combination, starting with additional component taggers and selection strategies, and going on to shifts to other tagsets and/or languages.
    But the investigation need not be limited to wordclass tagging, for we expect that there are many other NLP tasks w
