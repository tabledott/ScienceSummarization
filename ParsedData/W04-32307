 differences.
    For instance, some suffixes (e.g., san or kun) appear after names, and are helpful to detect words with Name POS.
    In addition, the conjugation form (cfrom) must be distinguished appearing only in the succeeding position in a bi-gram, since it is dominated by the word appearing in the next.
    Asahara et al. extended HMMs so as to incorporate 1) position-wise grouping, 2) word-level statistics, and 3) smoothing of word and POS level statistics (Asahara and Matsumoto, 2000).
    However, the proposed method failed to capture non-independent features such as suffixes and character types and selected smoothing parameters in an ad-hoc way.
    It is known that maximum entropy Markov models (MEMMs) (McCallum et al., 2000) or other discriminative models with independently trained nextstate classifiers potentially suffer from the label bias (Lafferty et al., 2001) and length bias.
    In Japanese morphological analysis, they are extremely serious problems.
    This is because, as shown in Figur
