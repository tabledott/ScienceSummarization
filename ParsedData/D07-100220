ce TREC doesn?t supply an answer for them.
			We used the FrameNet V1.3 lexical database.It contains 10,195 predicates grouped into 795 se mantic frames and 141,238 annotated sentences.
			Figure 4 shows the number of annotated sentences available for different predicates.
			As can be seen,there are 3,380 predicates with no annotated sentences and 1,175 predicates with less than 5 anno tated sentences.
			All FrameNet sentences, questions, and answer sentences were parsed using MiniPar (Lin, 1994), a robust dependency parser.As mentioned in Section 4 we extract depen dency relation paths by traversing the dependency tree from the frame element node to the predicate node.
			We used all dependency relations providedby MiniPar (42 in total).
			In order to increase cov erage, we combine all relation paths for predicates that evoke the same frame and are labeled with the same POS tag.
			For example, found and establish are both instances of the frame Intentionally createbut the database does not have any annot
