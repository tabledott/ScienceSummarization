ase now in a recorded, transcribed radio call-in program (Hirschberg and Litman 1987).
    Our corpus consisted of four days of the radio call-in program &amp;quot;The Harry Gross Show: Speaking of Your Money,&amp;quot; recorded during the week of February 1, 1982 (Pollack, Hirschberg, and Webber 1982).
    In this Philadelphia program, Gross offered financial advice to callers; for the February 3 show, he was joined by an accountant friend, Fred Levy.
    The four shows provided approximately ten hours of conversation between expert(s) and callers.
    The corpus was transcribed by Martha Pollack and Julia Hirschberg in 1982, in connection with another study.
    We chose now for this initial study for several reasons.
    First, the corpus contained numerous instances of both discourse and sentential usages of now (approximately 350 in all).
    Second, now often appears in conjunction with other cue phrases, e.g., well now, ok now, right now.
    This allowed us to study how adjacent cue phrases interact J
