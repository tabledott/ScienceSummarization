    There are seven pairs of dependency relationships, depicted by seven arcs from heads to dependents.
    Currently, the mainstream of dependency parsing is conducted on lexical elements: relations are built between single words.
    A major information loss of this word level dependency tree compared with constituent tree is that it doesn&#8217;t explicitly provide local structures and syntactic categories (i.e.
    NP, VP labels) of phrases (Xia and Palmer, 2001).
    On the other hand, dependency tree provides connections between distant words, which are useful in extracting long distance relations.
    Therefore, compromising between the two, we extend the dependency tree node with phrases.
    That implies a noun phrase &#8220;Cannon SD500 PowerShot&#8221; can be a dependent that modifies a verb phrase head &#8220;really enjoy using&#8221; with relation type &#8220;dobj&#8221;.
    The feasibility behind is that a phrase is a syntactic unit regardless of the length or syntactic category (Santo
