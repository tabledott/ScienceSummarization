leted (D) words each algorithm predicts for each hypothesized conflation set.
    If Xw represents word w's conflation set according to an algorithm, and if Yw represents its CELEX-based conflation set, then, In making these computations, we disregard any CELEX words absent from our data set and vice versa.
    Most capital words are not in CELEX so this process also discards them.
    Hence, we also make an augmented CELEX to incorporate capitalized forms.
    Table 5 uses the above scoring mechanism to compare the F-Scores (product of precision and recall divided by average of the two ) of our system at a cutoff threshold of 85% to those of our earlier algorithm (&#8220;S/J2000&#8221;) at the same threshold; Goldsmith; and a baseline system which performs no analysis (claiming that for any word, its conflation set only consists of itself).
    The &#8220;S&#8221; and &#8220;C&#8221; columns respectively indicate performance of systems when scoring for suffixing and circumfixing (using the unaugmented CELEX)
