 FSA patterns.
    Table 3 also shows that the new IE paradigm performs better when the predicate argument structures are recognized with the inductive learning model.
    The cause is the substantial difference in quality of the argument identification task between the two models.
    The Table shows that the new IE paradigm with the inductive learning model achieves about 90% of the performance of the FSA-based system for both domains, even though one of the domains uses mainly verbs rarely seen in training (e.g.
    &#8220;die&#8221; appears 5 times in PropBank).
    Another way of evaluating the integration of predicate argument structures in IE is by comparing the number of events identified by each architecture.
    Table 4 shows the results.
    Once again, the new IE paradigm performs better when the predicate argument structures are recognized with the inductive learning model.
    More events are missed by the statistical model which does not recognize argument constituents as well the inductive lea
