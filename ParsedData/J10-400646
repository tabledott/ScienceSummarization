abstract level, DM and PairClass differ in the basic strategy with which unification in distributional semantics is pursued.
    Turney&#8217;s approach amounts to picking a task (identifying pairs expressing the same relation) and reinterpreting other tasks as its particular instances.
    Thus, attributional and relational similarity are unified by considering the former as a subtype of the latter.
    Conversely, DM assumes that each semantic task may keep its specificity, and unification is achieved by designing a sufficiently general distributional structure, populating a specific instance of the structure, and generating semantic spaces on demand from the latter.
    This way, DM is able to address a wider range of semantic tasks than Turney&#8217;s model.
    For instance, language is full of productive semantic phenomena, such as the selectional preferences of verbs with respect to unseen arguments (eating topinambur vs. eating sympathy).
    Predicting the plausibility of unseen pairs cannot, by defi
