 in the number of documents in the corpus, and constant in the number of relations.
    Open IE is ideally suited to corpora such as the Web, where the target relations are not known in advance, and their number is massive.
    The relationship between standard RE systems and the new Open IE paradigm is analogous to the relationship between lexicalized and unlexicalized parsers.
    Statistical parsers are usually lexicalized (i.e. they make parsing decisions based on n-gram statistics computed for specific lexemes).
    However, Klein and Manning (2003) showed that unlexicalized parsers are more accurate than previously believed, and can be learned in an unsupervised manner.
    Klein and Manning analyze the tradeoffs beTraditional Information Extraction (IE) takes a relation name and hand-tagged examples of that relation as input.
    Open IE is a relationindependent extraction paradigm that is tailored to massive and heterogeneous corpora such as the Web.
    An Open IE system extracts a diverse set of rel
