 only; and baseline POStagger to refer to the Collins tagger which performs POS tagging only (given segmentation).
    The features used by the baseline segmentor are shown in Table 1.
    The features used by the POS tagger, some of which are different to those from Collins (2002) and are specific to Chinese, are shown in Table 2.
    The word segmentation features are extracted from word bigrams, capturing word, word length and character information in the context.
    The word length features are normalized, with those more than 15 being treated as 15.
    The POS tagging features are based on contextual information from the tag trigram, as well as the neighboring three-word window.
    To reduce overfitting and increase the decoding speed, templates 4, 5, 6 and 7 only include words with less than 3 characters.
    Like the baseline segmentor, the baseline tagger also normalizes word length features.
    Templates 15 and 16 in Table 2 are inspired by the CTBMorph feature templates in Tseng et al. (2005), w
