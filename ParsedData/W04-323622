    In addition, since the out-of-vocabulary (OOV) rate for Chinese words is much higher than the OOV rate for Chinese characters, in the presence of an unknown word, using the component characters in the word to help predict the correct POS tag is a good heuristic.
    One-at-a-time or all-at-once?
    The all-at-once approach, which considers all aspects of available information in an integrated, unified compared with the all-at-once, character-based approach previously proposed. framework, can make better informed decisions, but incurs a higher computational cost.
  
  
    Much previous research on Chinese language processing focused on word segmentation (Sproat et al., 1996; Teahan et al., 2000; Sproat and Emerson, 2003).
    Relatively less work has been done on Chinese POS tagging.
    Kwong and Tsou (2003) discussed the implications of POS ambiguity in Chinese and
