4 Head and Punctuation Mark.
    With the exception of some dashes and parentheses (see Section 4), the category of a punctuation mark is identical to its POS tag, and the head has the same category as its parent.
    4.3.5 The Final Derivation.
    Figure 2 shows the complete CCG derivation of our example.
    The category assignment procedure corresponds to a top-down normal-form derivation, which almost always uses function application.
    In the basic case presented here, composition is only used to provide a uniform analysis of adjuncts.
    Long-range dependencies represented in the Penn Treebank by traces such as *T* and *RNR* require extensions to the basic algorithm, which result in derivations that make use of typeraising, composition, and (occasionally) substitution rules like those in (5) wherever syntactically necessary.
    We defer explanation of these rules until Section 6, which presents the constructions that motivate them.
    Finally, we need to obtain the word&#8211;word dependencies whi
