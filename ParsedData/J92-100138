    There is a wide variety of information about which sense is the correct one, and the challenge is to decide when and how to use this information.
    The danger of a combinatorial explosion of possibilities makes it advantageous to try to resolve ambiguities as early as possible.
    Indeed, efficient preprocessing of texts can elicit a number of cues for word senses, set up preferences, and help control the parse.
    Then, the parse and semantic interpretation of the text will provide the cues necessary to complete the task of resolution.
    Without actually parsing a text, a preprocessor can identify for each word its morphology,2 its syntactic tag or tags,3 and whether it is part of a collocation; for each sense, it can identify whether the sense is preferred or deprecated and whether it is supported by a cluster.
    These properties are all either retrievable directly from a knowledge base or computable from short sequences of words.
    To identify whether the input satisfies the
