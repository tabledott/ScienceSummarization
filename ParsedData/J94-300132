f string-tuple length and n-way concatenation and the correspondence to finite-state transducers.
    The regular relations differ from the regular languages, however, in that they are not closed under intersection and complementation.
    Suppose that R1 is the relation {(an,bnc*) 1 n &gt; 0} and R2 is the relation { (an ,b*cn) I n &gt; 0}.
    These relations are regular, since they are defined by the regular expressions a:b* &#8364;:c* and e: b* a:c respectively.
    The intersection R1 n R2 is { (an, bn cn ) I n &gt; 0}.
    The range of this relation is the context-free language Pic&amp;quot;, which we have seen is not possible if the intersection is regular.
    The class of regular relations is therefore not closed under intersection, and it immediately follows that it is also not closed under complementation: by De Morgan's law, closure under complementation and union would imply closure under intersection.
    Nonclosure under complementation further implies that some regular relations are accepted b
