ples in order to induce xRS rules for several models.
    In our simplest model, we assume that each tuple (7r, F, A) in our automatically annotated corpus could be produced by applying a combination of minimally syntactified, lexicalized, phrase-based compatible xRS rules, and minimal/necessary, non-lexicalized xRS rules.
    We call a rule non-lexicalized whenever it does not have any directly aligned source-to-target words.
    Rules r9&#8211;r12 in Figure 1 are examples of non-lexicalized rules.
    Minimally syntactified, lexicalized, phrasebased-compatible xRS rules are extracted via a simple algorithm that finds for each foreign phrase FZj , the smallest xRS rule that is consistent with the foreign phrase FZj , the English syntactic tree 7r, and the alignment A.
    The algorithm finds for each foreign/source phrase span its projected span on the English side and then traverses the English parse tree bottom up until it finds a node that subsumes the projected span.
    If this node has children that fa
