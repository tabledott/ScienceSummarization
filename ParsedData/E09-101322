 text in the training corpora, was parsed using RASP (Briscoe and Carroll, 2002), to extract part-of-speech tags, lemmas, and dependency information.
    For instances containing more than one occurrence of the target word, we disambiguate the first occurrence.
    Instances which were not correctly recognized by the parser (e.g., a target word labeled with the wrong lemma or part-of-speech), were automatically assigned to the largest sensecluster.3
  
  
    Model Selection The framework presented in Section 3 affords great flexibility in modeling the empirical data.
    This however entails that several parameters must be instantiated.
    More precisely, our model is conditioned on the Dirichlet hyperparameters &#945; and &#946; and the number of senses S. Additional parameters include the number of iterations for the Gibbs sampler and whether or not the layers are assigned different weights.
    Our strategy in this paper is to fix &#945; and &#946; and explore the consequences of varying S. The value for
