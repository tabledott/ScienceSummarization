ignores.
    To test whether using tagged data would make a difference, the freely available Brill tagger (Brill, 1993) was applied to the corpus.
    Since no manually tagged training data is available for our corpus, the tagger's default rules were used (these rules were produced by Brill by training on the Brown corpus).
    This results in rather poor tagging accuracy, so it is quite possible that a manually tagged corpus would produce better results.
    Three training schemes have been used and the tuned analysis procedures applied to the test set.
    Figure 5 shows the resulting accuracy, with accuracy values from figure 3 displayed with dotted lines.
    If anything, admitting additional training data based on the tagger introduces more noise, reducing the accuracy.
    However, for the pattern training scheme an improvement was made to the dependency model, producing the highest overall accuracy of 81%.
  
  
    The experiments above demonstrate a number of important points.
