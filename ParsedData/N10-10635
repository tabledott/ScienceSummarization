ontains other useful indicators for parallel sentence extraction.
    The many hyperlinks found in articles have previously been used as a valuable source of information.
    (Adafre and de Rijke, 2006) use matching hyperlinks to identify similar sentences.
    Two links match if the articles they refer to are connected by an &#8220;interwiki&#8221; link.
    Also, images in Wikipedia are often stored in a central source across different languages; this allows identification of captions which may be parallel (see Figure 1).
    Finally, there are other minor forms of markup which may be useful for finding similar content across languages, such as lists and section headings.
    In Section 3.3, we will explain how features are derived from this markup.
    Fung and Cheung (2004) give a more fine-grained description of the types of non-parallel corpora, which we will briefly summarize.
    A noisy parallel corpus has documents which contain many parallel sentences in roughly the same order.
