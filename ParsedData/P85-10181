eral technique we call restriction.
    As a particular example of such an extension, we present a complete, correct, terminating extension of Earley's algorithm that uses restriction to perform top-down filtering.
    Our implementation of this algorithm demonstrates the drastic elimination of chart edges that can be achieved by this technique.
    Finally, we describe further uses for the technique&#8212;including parsing other grammar formalisms, including definite-clause grammars; extending other parsing algorithms, including LR methods and syntactic preference modeling algorithms; and efficient indexing.
