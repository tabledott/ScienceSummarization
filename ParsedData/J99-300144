s the leftmost evoked discourse entity in (2d), hence ranked highest in the Cf(2d) and the most preferred antecedent for the pronoun he in (2e).
  
  
    In this section, we discuss two evaluation experiments on naturally occurring data.
    We first compare the success rate of the functional centering algorithm with that of the BFP algorithm.
    This evaluation uses the basic Cf ranking constraints from Table 9.
    We then introduce a new cost-based evaluation method, which we use for comparing the extended Cf ranking constraints from Table 11 with several other approaches.
    5.1.1 Data.
    In order to compare the functional centering algorithm (i.e., the basic algorithm from Table 3 operating with the basic functional Cf ranking constraints from Table 9) with the BFP algorithm, we analyzed a sample of English and German texts.
    The test set (Table 13) consisted of the begirmings of three short stories by Ernest Hemingway,' three articles from the New York Times (NYT),16 the first three chapters of
