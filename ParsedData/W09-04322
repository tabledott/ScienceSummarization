 knowledge on translation phrase pairs or target language n-grams is almost impractical.
    Second, language is highly variable with respect to several dimensions, style, genre, domain, topics, etc.
    Even apparently small differences in domain might result in significant deviations in the underlying statistical models.
    While data sparseness corroborates the need of large language samples in SMT, linguistic variability would indeed suggest to consider many alternative data sources as well.
    By rephrasing a famous saying we could say that &#8220;no data is better than more and assorted data&#8221;.
    The availability of language resources for SMT has dramatically increased over the last decade, at least for a subset of relevant languages and especially for what concerns monolingual corpora.
    Unfortunately, the increase in quantity has not gone in parallel with an increase in assortment, especially for what concerns the most valuable resource, that is bilingual corpora.
    Large parallel data av
