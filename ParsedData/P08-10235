inal symbols in N, and whose frontier nodes are labeled by source-side terminals in E or variables from a set X = {x1, x2, ...1; s E (X U A)* is the target-side string where A is the target language terminal set; and 0 is a mapping from X to nonterminals in N. Each variable xi E X occurs exactly once in t and exactly once in s. We denote R to be the translation rule set.
    A similar formalism appears in another form in (Liu et al., 2006).
    These rules are in the reverse direction of the original string-to-tree transducer rules defined by Galley et al. (2004).
    Finally, from step (d) we apply rules r4 and r5 which perform phrasal translations for the two remaining subtrees, respectively, and get the Chinese translation in (e).
  
  
    We now extend the tree-based idea from the previous section to the case of forest-based translation.
    Again, there are two steps, parsing and decoding.
    In the former, a (modified) parser will parse the input sentence and output a packed forest (Section 3.1) rathe
