r &amp;quot;The car drank coffee&amp;quot; together via the matches of their relevant cells.
    In those matches, the arrows are sensenetwork paths found between the elements of the two target cells.
    The network paths indicated in grey, that connect the two abridged semantic vectors, show processing of coherence representations.
    The particular network paths found (indicated in italics), a descendant path and two same &amp;quot;paths,&amp;quot; show that the same relevant analogy is used in both semantic relations &#8212; that both semantic relations involve a match between animals drinking potable liquids and vehicles (including cars) using gasoline &#8212; hence sentence (20) as a whole is metaphorical.
    Figure 20 is therefore unlike any of the coherence representations shown previously, because it shows a representation of a metaphorical sentence, not just two isolated metaphorical relations.
    Compare Figure 20 with Figure 21, a sentence representation for (27).
