acketing.
    While we are investigating the latter in current work, local repair heuristics have the advantage of keeping the training and bracketing algorithms both simple and fast.
    The effect of these heuristics on recall and precision is shown in Table 3.
    We see consistent improvements for both corpora and both pruning methods, achieving approximately 94P/R for the Empire corpus and approximately 91P/R for the R&amp;M corpus.
    Note that these are the final results reported in the introduction and conclusion.
    Although these experiments represent only an initial investigation into the usefulness of local repair heuristics, we are very encouraged by the results.
    The heuristics uniformly boost precision without harming recall; they help the R&amp;M corpus even though they were designed in response to errors in the Empire corpus.
    In addition, these three heuristics alone recover 1/2 to 1/3 of the improvements we can expect to obtain from lexicalization based on the R&amp;M results.
