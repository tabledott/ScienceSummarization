    There is nothing in the syntax to disambiguate these cases, and we find that they are better left to downstream processing, where there may be access to world knowledge.
    As noted in Section1.5, the internal syntax of number names is surprisingly parallel between English and Japanese, but their external syntax differs dramatically.
    English number names can appear directly as modifiers of NPs and are treated semantically as adjectives in the ERG.
    Japanese number names can only modify nouns in combination with numeral classifiers.
