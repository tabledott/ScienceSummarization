    However, it does much better than every other group on the entity-based CEAFe, and this is the primary reason for its 1.8 point advantage in the official score.
    If the CEAFe measure does indicate the accuracy of entities in the response, this suggests that the lee system is doing better on getting coherent entities than any other system.
    This could be partly due to the fact that that system is primarily a precision-based system that would tend to create purer entities.
    The CEAFe measure also seems to penalize other systems more harshly than do the other measures.
    We cannot compare these results to the ones obtained in the SEMEVAL-2010 coreference task using a small portion of OntoNotes data because it was only using nominal entities, and had heuristically added singleton mentions to the OntoNotes data22 21The cai system specifically mentions that, and the only resource that the uryupina system used outside of the closed track setting was the Stanford named entity tagger.
