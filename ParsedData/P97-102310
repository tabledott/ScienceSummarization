the sameorientation type.
    However, we can improve performance by noting that conjunctions using but exhibit the opposite pattern, usually involving adjectives of different orientations.
    Thus, a revised but still simple rule predicts a different-orientation link if the two adjectives have been seen in a but conjunction, and a same-orientation link otherwise, assuming the two adjectives were seen connected by at least one conjunction.
    Morphological relationships between adjectives also play a role.
    Adjectives related in form (e.g., adequate-inadequate or thoughtful-thoughtless) almost always have different semantic orientations.
    We implemented a morphological analyzer which matches adjectives related in this manner.
    This process is highly accurate, but unfortunately does not apply to many of the possible pairs: in our set of 1,336 labeled adjectives (891,780 possible pairs), 102 pairs are morphologically related; among them, 99 are of different orientation, yielding 97.06% accuracy for t
