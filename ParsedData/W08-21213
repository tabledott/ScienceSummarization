cs used and a discussion of the two shared task challenges, i.e., closed and open.
    The data format used in this shared task was highly influenced by the formats used in the 2004&#8211;2007 shared tasks.
    The data follows these general rules: Table 1 describes the fields stored for each token in the closed-track data sets.
    Columns 1&#8211;3 and 5&#8211;8 are available at both training and test time.
    Column 4, which contains gold-standard part-ofspeech (POS) tags, is not given at test time.
    The same holds for columns 9 and above, which contain the syntactic and semantic dependency structures that the systems should predict.
    The PPOS and PPOSS fields were automatically predicted using the SVMTool POS tagger (Gim&#180;enez, 2004).
    To predict the tags in the training set, a 5-fold cross-validation procedure was used.
    The LEMMA and SPLIT LEMMA fields were predicted using the built-in lemmatizer in WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998) based on the most frequent sense for the form and part-of-speec
