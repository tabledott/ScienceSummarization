NP2 is penalized even less than FNP3.
    The closer a Type C error is to the boundary, the lower the penalty.
    FNP2 has more errors distributed near the boundaries than the others: thus, the FNP2 segmentation is penalized less than either FNP1 or FNP3.
    The same tests were run for different error occurrence probabilities (p = 0.05 and p = 0.25), achieving results similar to those for p = 0.5 just described.
    There is a slight difference for the case of p = 0.05 because the error probability is too small for some of the trends to manifest themselves.
    In particular, the differences in the way WD treats the different segmentations disappear when the error probability is this small.
    We also performed a small set of tests to verify the theoretical finding that Pk and Pk overpenalize near-miss errors as compared with pure false positives, and that WD does the opposite, overpenalizing the pure false positives.
    Space limitations prevent detailed reporting of these results, but the simulations di
