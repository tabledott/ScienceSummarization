 algorithm than with another.
    It is noteworthy that there are no consistent differences in learning time between the strictly projective parsers and their pseudo-projective counterparts, despite the fact that the pseudo-projective technique increases the number of distinct classes (because of its augmented arc labels), which in turn increases the number of binary classifiers that need to be trained in order to perform multi-class classification with the one-versus-one method.
    The number of classifiers is m(m&#8722;1) 2 , where m is the number of classes, and the pseudo-projective technique with the encoding scheme used here can theoretically lead to a quadratic increase in the number of classes.
    The fact that this has no noticeable effect on efficiency indicates that learning time is dominated by other factors, in particular the number of training instances.
    Turning to parsing efficiency, we may first note that parsing time is also dependent on the size of the training set, through a dependenc
