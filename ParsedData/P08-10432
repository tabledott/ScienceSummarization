1;) in &#8216;bcl&#8217; may then attach higher than the bare noun cl (&#8220;shadow&#8221;).
    This leads to word- and constituent-boundaries discrepancy, which breaks the assumptions underlying current state-of-the-art statistical parsers.
    One way to approach this discrepancy is to assume a preceding phase of morphological segmentation for extracting the different lexical items that exist at the token level (as is done, to the best of our knowledge, in all parsing related work on Arabic and its dialects (Chiang et al., 2006)).
    The input for the segmentation task is however highly ambiguous for Semitic languages, and surface forms (tokens) may admit multiple possible analyses as in (BarHaim et al., 2007; Adler and Elhadad, 2006).
    The aforementioned surface form bcl, for example, may also stand for the lexical item &#8220;onion&#8221;, a Noun.
    The implication of this ambiguity for a parser is that the yield of syntactic trees no longer consists of spacedelimited tokens, and the expected numb
