the binary production distribu tion as their cross-product ?Bz = lzr T z . This alsoyields a distribution over symbol pairs and hence de fines a different type of nonparametric PCFG.
			This model is simpler and does not require any additional machinery beyond the HDP-HMM.
			However, the modeling assumptions imposed by this alternative are unappealing as they assume the left child and right child are independent given the parent, which is certainly not the case in natural language.
			2.5 HDP-PCFG for grammar refinement.
			An important motivation for the HDP-PCFG is thatof refining an existing treebank grammar to alle viate unrealistic independence assumptions and to improve parsing accuracy.
			In this scenario, the set of symbols is known, but we do not know howmany subsymbols to allocate per symbol.
			We in troduce the HDP-PCFG for grammar refinement (HDP-PCFG-GR), an extension of the HDP-PCFG, for this task.
			The essential difference is that now we have a collection of HDP-PCFG models for each symbol
