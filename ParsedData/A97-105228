erators).
    It is 'shallow' in that no atof which thetempt is made to fully analyse unbounded dependencies.
    However, the distinction between arguments and adjuncts is expressed, following X-bar theory (e.g.
    Jackendoff, 1977), by Chomsky-adjunction to maximal projections of adjuncts (XP XP Adjunct) as opposed to 'government' of arguments (i.e. arguments are sisters within X1 projections; X1 XO Argl... ArgN).
    Furthermore, all analyses are rooted (in S) so the grammar assigns global, shallow and often 'spurious' analyses to many sentences.
    There are 29 distinct values for VSUBCAT and 10 for PSUBCAT; these are analysed in patterns along with specific closed-class head lemmas of arguments, such as it (dummy subjects), whether (wh-complements), and so forth, to classify patterns as evidence for one of the 160 subcategorization classes.
    Each of these classes can be parameterized for specific predicates by, for example, different prepositions or particles.
    Currently, the coverage of this gra
