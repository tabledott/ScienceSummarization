ce it attempts to identify and extract key sentences from an article using statistical techniques that locate important phrases using various statistical measures.
    This has been successful in different domains (Preston and Williams 1994) and is, in fact, the approach used in recent commercial summarizers (Apple [Boguraev and Kennedy 1997], Microsoft, and in)(ight).
    Rau, Brandow, and Mitze (1994) report that statistical summaries of individual news articles were rated lower by evaluators than summaries formed by simply using the lead sentence or two from the article.
    This follows the principle of the &amp;quot;inverted pyramid&amp;quot; in news writing, which puts the most salient information in the beginning of the article and leaves elaborations for later paragraphs, allowing editors to cut from the end of the text without compromising the readability of the remaining text.
    Paice (1990) also notes that problems for this approach center around the fluency of the resulting summary.
