lassify general-domain noun-modifier pairsinto 30 different classes of semantic relations.
			Tur ney (2006) later addressed the same problem using 8000 automatically generated patterns.One of the tasks in SemEval 2007 was the clas sification of semantic relations between nominals (Girju et al, 2007).
			The problem is to classifysemantic relations between nouns and noun com pounds in the context of a sentence.
			The task attracted 14 teams who created 15 systems, all of which used supervised machine learning with features that were lexicon-based, corpus-based, or both.PairClass is most similar to the algorithm of Tur ney (2006), but it differs in the following ways:?
			PairClass does not use a lexicon to find syn onyms for the input word pairs.
			One of our goals in this paper is to show that a pure corpus-based algorithm can handle synonymswithout a lexicon.
			This considerably simpli fies the algorithm.
			PairClass uses a support vector machine (SVM) instead of a nearest neighbour (NN) learning algori
