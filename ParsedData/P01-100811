e contain a number of identical words, which serve as a strong clue to the matching process.
    Alignment is performed using dynamic programming (Gale and Church, 1991) with a weight function based on the number of common words in a sentence pair.
    This simple method achieves good results for our corpus, because 42% of the words in corresponding sentences are identical words on average.
    Alignment produces 44,562 pairs of sentences with 1,798,526 words.
    To evaluate the accuracy of the alignment process, we analyzed 127 sentence pairs from the algorithm&#8217;s output.
    120(94.5%) alignments were identified as correct alignments.
    We then use a part-of-speech tagger and chunker (Mikheev, 1997) to identify noun and verb phrases in the sentences.
    These phrases become the atomic units of the algorithm.
    We also record for each token its derivational root, using the CELEX(Baayen et al., 1993) database.
  
  
    Given the aforementioned differences between translations, our method builds on
