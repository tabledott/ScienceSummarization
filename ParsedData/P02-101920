sponding pronunciations where m is the number of pronunciations of the correct word r2 in our dictionary.
    Each of those m samples is the most probable pronunciation of w2 according to our letter-to-phone model paired with one of the possible pronunciations of r2.
    Using this training set, we run the algorithm of Brill and Moore to estimate a set of substitution probabilities a !
    , for sequences of phones to sequences of phones.
    The probability PPH(pron wjpron r) is then computed as a product of the substitution probabilities in the most probable alignment, as Brill and Moore did.
  
  
    We tested our system and compared it to the Brill and Moore model on a dataset of around 10, 000 pairs of misspellings and corresponding correct words, split into training and test sets.
    The exact data sizes are 7, 385 word pairs in the training set and 1, 812 word pairs in the test set.
    This set is slightly different from the dataset used in Brill and Moore&#8217;s experiments because we removed from
