bility is that minority values are opposite to error values.
    In this case, the minority values of F&#175; are error values, and disagreement between F and G upper bounds the error of F&#175;.
    This case is admitted by theorem 2.
    In the final two cases, minority values are the same regardless of the value of Y .
    In these cases, however, the predictors do not satisfy the &#8220;nontriviality&#8221; condition of theorem 2, which requires that mina Pr[F = u] be greater than the disagreement between F and G.
  
  
    Rule independence is a very strong assumption; one remarkable consequence will show just how strong it is.
    The precision of a rule F is defined to be Pr[Y = +|F = +].
    (We continue to assume non-abstaining binary rules.)
    If rule independence holds, knowing the precision of any one rule allows one to exactly compute the precision of every other rule given only unlabeled data and knowledge of the size of the target concept.
    Let F and G be arbitrary rules based on independe
