 an optimal solution for the sum of dCD and lpmisc.
    The idea behind the absolute miscoverage is that one can construct a valid &#8211; but not necessarily optimal &#8211; dLJ path from a given dCD path.
    This procedure is illustrated in Figure 3 and takes place in two steps: 1.
    For each block of over-covered candidate words, replace the aligned substitution and/or identity edges by insertion edges; move the long jump at the beginning of the block accordingly.
    2.
    For each block of under-covered candidate words, add the corresponding number of deletion edges; move the long jump at the beginning of the block accordingly.
    This also shows that there cannot be4 a polynomial time algorithm that calculates the minimum of dCD + lpmisc for arbitrary pairs of sentences, because this minimum is equal to dLJ.
    With these miscoverage penalties, inexpensive lower and upper bounds for dLJ can be calculated, because the following inequality holds: All automatic error measures which are based on the e
