ger the outside context, the farther the gap between the true cost and the estimate.
    Figure 9 shows average outside estimates for Viterbi edges as span size increases.
    For small outside spans, all estimates are fairly good approximations of TRUE.
    As the span increases, the approximations fall behind.
    Beyond the smallest outside spans, all of the curves are approximately linear, but the actual value&#8217;s slope is roughly twice that of the estimates.
    The gap between our empirical methods and the true cost grows fairly steadily, but the differences between the empirical methods themselves stay relatively constant.
    This reflects the nature of these estimates: they have differing local information in their summaries, but all are equally ignorant about the more distant context elements.
    The various local environments can be more or less costly to integrate into a parse, but, within a few words, the local restrictions have been incorporated one way or another, and the estimates are all
