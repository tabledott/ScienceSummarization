y models, as described in the next section.
  
  
    Our solution to the problem is a dynamic programming algorithm for computing inside/outside &#945;-products.
    Inside/outside &#945;-products roughly correspond to inside/ outside probabilities in PCFGs.
    In maximum entropy models, a probability is defined as a normalized product of &#945;fj j(= exp(&#955;jfj)).
    Hence, similar to the algorithm of computing (&#65533; ) inside/outside probabilities, we can compute exp j &#955;jfj , which we define as the &#945;-product, for each node in a tree structure.
    If we can compute &#945;-products at a tractable cost, the model expectation &#181;i is also computed at a tractable cost.
    We first define the notion of a feature forest, a packed representation of a set of an exponential number of tree structures.
    Feature forests correspond to packed charts in CFG parsing.
    Because feature forests are generalized representations of forest structures, the notion is not only applicable to syntactic par
