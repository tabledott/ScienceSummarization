 into a CFG-like rule based systems, and then use some mechanism to ensure only the trees prodnced by the "lAG itself are generateda)~ In tbd:feature structures 2It is eometime~ possible for "dependent" iterem to belong to an elementary tree and the immediate auxiliary tree that is adjoined in it.
  aSuch a scheme wotdd be an alternate way of embedding TAGs in an unifieational framework.
  IIowever, it does not capture the linguistic intuitions tmderlying TAGs, and losc~ the attractive f ature of localizing depende~tcles.
  associated with the elementary trees, we can state the constraints among the dependent nodes dircctly.
  IIence, in an initial tree corresponding to a simple sentence, wc can state that the main verb and the subject NP (which are part of the same initial tree) share the agreement feature.
  Thus, such checking, in many cases, can be precompiled (of course only after lexical insertion) and need not be done dynamically.
