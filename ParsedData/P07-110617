t comparison between open test results is less informative.
    In this paper, we focus only on the closed test.
    However, the perceptron model allows a wide range of features, and so future work will consider how to integrate open resources into our system.
    In this experiment, the agenda size was set to 16, for both training and testing.
    Table 2 shows the precision, recall and F-measure for the development set after 1 to 10 training iterations, as well as the number of mistakes made in each iteration.
    The corresponding learning curves for both the non-averaged and averaged perceptron are given in Figure 3.
    The table shows that the number of mistakes made in each iteration decreases, reflecting the convergence of the learning algorithm.
    The averaged perceptron algorithm improves the segmentation accuracy at each iteration, compared with the nonaveraged perceptron.
    The learning curve was used to fix the number of training iterations at 6 for the remaining experiments.
