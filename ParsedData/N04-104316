ype of discriminative training (averaged perceptron), only one type of clustering (bigram mutual information), and only one simple confidence measure for active learning.
    It seems likely that some additional gains could be realized by alternative discriminative methods (e.g. conditional random fields estimated with conjugate-gradient training).
    Similarly, alternative clustering techniques, perhaps based on different contextual features or different distance measures, could further improve performance.
    On the application side, it would be interesting to apply the technique to other language problems.
    Applying it to parsing would yield a rare sense of closure, knitting together the word clustering of Magerman&#8217;s (1995) Spatter parser &#8211; arguably the first successful broadcoverage statistical parser &#8211; with structural elements of the now-dominant Collins (1997) style parsers.
    Because our combined method promises to require substantially less training data, it may also prove use
