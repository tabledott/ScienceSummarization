    The first of these suggests a strong interaction between dialogue verbs and centering, which is also apparent in direct-speech dialogue examples.
    The relationship between this kind of lexical&#8211;semantic influence over centering and that of so-called 'empathy' verbs, e.g., Kameyama (1985), Walker, Iida, and Cote (1994), remains to be determined.

    Thus, the discourses in (11)&#8212;(14) suggest that gra
