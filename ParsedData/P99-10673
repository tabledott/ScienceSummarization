in a specific field: They read texts corresponding to this field in both languages and draw their conclusions on word correspondences from the usage of the terms.
    Of course, the translators and interpreters can understand the texts, whereas our programs are only considering a few statistical clues.
    For non-parallel texts the first clue, which is usually by far the strongest of the three mentioned above, is not applicable at all.
    The second clue is generally less powerful than the first, since most words are ambiguous in natural languages, and many ambiguities are different across languages.
    Nevertheless, this clue is applicable in the case of comparable texts, although with a lower reliability than for parallel texts.
    However, in the case of unrelated texts, its usefulness may be near zero.
    The third clue is generally limited to the identification of word pairs with similar spelling.
    For all other pairs, it is usually used in combination with the first clue.
    Since the first clu
