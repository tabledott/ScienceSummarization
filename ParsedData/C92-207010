heel, shaft, tooth, piston and cylinder), typical functions of machines (cut, rotate, move, turn, pull), typical objecls of those actions (wood, metal), as well as typical modifiers for machines (electric, mechanical, pneumatic).
  The list for a category typically contains over 3000 words, and is far richer than can be derived from a dictionary definition.
  2.3 Step 3: Use the resul t ing weights  to predict the appropr ia te  category  for a word  in novel text When any of the salient words derived in step 2 appear in the context of an ambiguous word, there is evidence that the word belongs to the indicated category.
  If several such words appear, the evidence is compounded.
  Using Bayes rule, we sum their weights, over all words in context, and determine the category for which the sum is greatest ~.
  ARGMAX ~ log Pr(w[RCat)  x Pr(RCat) Rca: w i~ co,,~1 Pr (w) The context is defined to extend 50 words to the left and 50 words to the right of the polysemous word.
