ferred by summing over the contribution for every position j that is not in the coverage vector c(n) (here X denotes different possibilities to choose the heuristic The situation in the case of the alignment template approach is more complicated, as not every word is translated alone, but typically the words are translated in context.
    Therefore, the basic quantity for the heuristic function in the case of the alignment template approach is a function r(Z) that assigns to every alignment template instantiation Z a maximal probability.
    Using r(Z), we can induce a position-dependent heuristic function r(j): Here, J(Z) denotes the number of source language words produced by the alignment template instantiation Z and j(Z) denotes the position of the first source language word.
    It can be easily shown that if r(Z) is admissible, then r(j) is also admissible.
    We have to show that for all nonoverlapping sequences ZK1 the following holds: Here, k(j) denotes the phrase index k that includes the target la
