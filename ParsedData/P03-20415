sed as fast as CFG.
    But without an adjunction operation,2, one cannot break the training trees into linguistically minimal units.
    An elementary tree pair A = (elle est finalement partie, finally she left) cannot be further decomposed into B = (elle est partie, she left) and C = (finalement, finally).
    This appears to miss a generalization.
    Our perspective is that the generalization should be picked up by the statistical model that defines the probability of elementary tree pairs. p(A) can be defined using mainly the same parameters that define p(B) and p(C), with the result that p(A) ,: p(B) &#183; p(C).
    The balance between the STSG and the statistical model is summarized in the last paragraph of this paper.
    Third, our version of the STSG formalism is more flexible than previous versions.
    We carefully address the case of empty trees, which are needed to handle freetranslation &#8220;mismatches.&#8221; In the example, an STSG cannot replace beaucoup d&#8217; (&#8220;lots of&#8221;) i
