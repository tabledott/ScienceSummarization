 function &#8212; first by removing a single sample from the training data, we construct the decision function on the basis of the remaining training data, and then test the removed sample.
    In this fashion, we test allsamples of the training data usingdifferent decision functions.
    (3) is a natural consequence bearing in mind that support vectors are the only factors contributing to the final decision function.
    Namely, when the every removed support vector becomes error in Leave-OneOut procedure, becomes the r.h.s. term of (3).
    In practice, it is known that this bound is less predictive than the VC bound.
  
  
    There are mainly two types of representations for proper chunks.
    One is Inside/Outside representation, and the other is Start/End representation.
    This representation was first introduced in (Ramshaw and Marcus, 1995), and has been applied for base NP chunking.
    This method uses the following set of three tags for representing proper chunks.
