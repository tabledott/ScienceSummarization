yntactic and semantic knowledge: (c) ordering of prenominal adjectives, (d) compound noun bracketing, (e) compound noun interpretation, and (f) noun countability detection.
    Table 1 gives an overview of these tasks and their properties.
    In all cases, we propose a simple, unsupervised n-gram based model whose parameters are estimated using web counts.
    We compare this model both against a baseline (same model, but parameters estimated on the BNC) and against state-of-the-art models from the literature, which are either supervised (i.e., use annotated training data) or unsupervised but rely on taxonomies to recreate missing counts.
  
  
    Following Keller and Lapata (2003), web counts for ngrams were obtained using a simple heuristic based on queries to the search engine Altavista.1 In this approach, the web count for a given n-gram is simply the number of hits (pages) returned by the search engine for the queries generated for this n-gram.
    Three different types of queries were used for the NLP
