Collocations The collocations as produced in the previous stages are already useful for lexicography.
    For computational use, however, functional information is needed.
    For example, the collocations should have some syntactic properties.
    It is not enough to say that &amp;quot;make&amp;quot; goes with &amp;quot;decision&amp;quot;; we need to know that &amp;quot;decision&amp;quot; is used as the direct object of the verb.
    The advent of robust parsers such as Cass (Abney 1990) and Fidditch (Hindle 1983) has made it possible to process large text corpora with good performance and thus combine statistical techniques with more symbolic analysis.
    In the past, some similar attempts have been done.
    Debili (1982) parsed corpora of French texts to identify nonambiguous predicate argument relations.
    He then used these relations for disambiguation.
    Hindle and Rooth (1990) later refined this approach by using bigram statistics to enhance the task of prepositional phrase attachment.
