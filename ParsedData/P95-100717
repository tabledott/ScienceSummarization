ases, thus putting the dependency model on an equal footing with the adjacency model above.
    The equations presented above for the dependency model differ from those developed in Lauer and Dras (1994) in one way.
    There, an additional weighting factor (of 2.0) is used to favour a left-branching analysis.
    This arises because their construction is based on the dependency model which predicts that left-branching analyses should occur twice as often.
    Also, the work reported in Lauer and Dras (1994) uses simplistic estimates of the probability of a word given its thesaurus category.
    The equations above assume these probabilities are uniformly constant.
    Section 3.2 below shows the result of making these two additions to the method.
  
  
    Eight different training schemes have been used to estimate the parameters and each set of estimates used to analyse the test set under both the adjacency and the dependency model.
    The schemes used are: The accuracy on the test set for all these experi
