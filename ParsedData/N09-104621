tter since it recovers from infelicitous splits that the one-best segmenter makes.
    For example, one class of error we frequently observe is that the one-best segmenter splits an OOV proper name into two pieces when a portion of the name corresponds to a known word in the source language (e.g. tom tancredo&#8594;tom tan credo which is then translated as tom tan belief).6 Figure 4 shows the effect of manipulating the density parameter (cf.
    Section 3.2) on the performance and decoding time of the Turkish-English translation system.
    It further confirms the hypothesis that increased diversity of segmentations encoded in a segmentation lattice can improve translation performance; however, it also shows that once the density becomes too great, and too many implausible segmentations are included in the lattice, translation quality will be harmed.
