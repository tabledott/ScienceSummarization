  board/v4); the fre- quencies of all eleven senses in the semantic oncordance an he tabulated separately todetermine the most frequent board/n and the most frequent hoard/v.
  The fact that the words that occur most frequently in standard English tend to be the words that are most polysemous creates a bad news, good news situation.
  The bad news is that most of the content words in textual corpora require disambiguation.
  The good news is that polysemous words occur frequently enough that statist- ical estimates are possible on the basis of relatively small samples.
  It is possible., therefore, to pose the question: on the basis of the available sample, how often would the most frequent sense be correct?
  A larger semantic concordance would undoubtedly yield a more precise lower bound, but at least an approximate estimate can be obtained.
