th respect to two commonly-used coreference scoring programs: the MUC scorer (Vilain et al., 1995) and the B-CUBED scorer (Bagga and Baldwin, 1998).
    Baseline systems.
    We employ as our baseline systems two existing coreference resolvers: our duplication of the Soon et al. (2001) system and the Ng and Cardie (2002b) system.
    Both resolvers adopt the standard machine learning approach and therefore can be characterized using the four elements discussed in Section 3.1.
    Specifically, Soon et al.&#8217;s system employs a decision tree learner to train a coreference classifier on instances created by Soon&#8217;s method and represented by Soon&#8217;s feature set, coordinating the classification decisions via closest-first clustering.
    Ng and Cardie&#8217;s system, on the other hand, employs RIPPER to train a coreference classifier on instances created by N&amp;C&#8217;s method and represented by N&amp;C&#8217;s feature set, inducing a partition on the given NPs via best-first clustering.
