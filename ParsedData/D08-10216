nly calculated using maximum likelihood estimation (Koehn et al., 2003): where the counts are collected by enumerating all bilingual phrase pairs that are consistent with the word alignments for sentence pairs in a bilingual parallel corpus.
    Various phrase extraction heuristics are possible.
    Och and Ney (2004) defined consistent bilingual phrase pairs as follows: where f1 is a foreign sentence, ei is an English sentence and A is a set of word alignment points.
    The heuristic allows unaligned words to be included at the boundaries of the source or target language phrases.
    For example, when enumerating the consistent phrase pairs for the sentence pair given in Figure 1, la igualdad would align not only to equal, but also to create equal, and to create equal.
    In SMT these alternative translations are ranked by the translation probabilities and other feature functions during decoding.
    The interaction between the phrase extraction heuristic and unaligned words results in an undesirable effec
