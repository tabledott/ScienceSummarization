.
    In addition, this approach is broadly integrative, incorporating aspects of transaction success, concept accuracy, multiple cost measures, and user satisfaction.
    In our framework, transaction success is reflected in K, corresponding to dialogues with a P(A) of 1.
    Our performance measure also captures information similar to concept accuracy, where low concept accuracy scores translate into either higher costs for acquiring information from the user, or lower K scores.
    One limitation of the PARADISE approach is that the task-based success measure does not reflect that some solutions might be better than others.
    For example, in the train timetable domain, we might like our task-based success measure to give higher ratings to agents that suggest express over local trains, or that provide helpful information that was not explicitly requested, especially since the better solutions might occur in dialogues with higher costs.
    It might be possible to address this limitation by using the inter
