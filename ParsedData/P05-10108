rd probabilities, we obtain the update formulas in Figure 2.
  
  
    In theory, we can use PCFG-LAs to parse a given sentence by selecting the most probable parse: where denotes the set of possible parses for under the observable grammar .
    While the optimization problem in Eq.
    4 can be efficiently solved for PCFGs using dynamic programming algorithms, the sum-of-products form of in PCFG-LA models (see Eq.
    2 and Eq.
    3) makes it difficult to apply such techniques to solve Eq.
    4.
    Actually, the optimization problem in Eq.
    4 is NPhard for general PCFG-LA models.
    Although we omit the details, we can prove the NP-hardness by observing that a stochastic tree substitution grammar (STSG) can be represented by a PCFG-LA model in a similar way to one described by Goodman (1996a), and then using the NP-hardness of STSG parsing (Sima&#180;an, 2002).
    The difficulty of the exact optimization in Eq.
    4 forces us to use some approximations of it.
