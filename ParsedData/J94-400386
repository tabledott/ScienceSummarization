en to be very useful for sense disambiguation: the different mapping between words and word senses among different languages, and the importance of lexical co-occurrence within syntactic relations.
    The first phenomenon provides the solution for the circularity problem in acquiring sense disambiguation data.
    Using a bilingual lexicon and a monolingual corpus of the target language, we can acquire statistics on word senses automatically, without manual tagging.
    As explained in Section 7, this method has significant practical and theoretical advantages over the use of aligned bilingual corpora.
    We pay for these advantages by introducing an additional level of noise, in mapping individual words independently to the other language.
    Our results show, however, that the precision of the selection algorithm is high despite this additional noise.
    This work also emphasizes the importance of lexical co-occurrence within syntactic relations for the resolution of lexical ambiguity.
