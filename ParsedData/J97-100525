 their own segmentation criteria, and to modify the criteria to fit the evolving discourse.
    Two structural constraints were also imposed on the content units that subjects were asked to identify.
    First, subjects were asked to perform a linear rather than a hierarchical segmentation, where a linear segmentation simply consists of dividing a narrative into sequential units.
    Second, subjects were restricted to placing boundaries between the prosodic phrases identified by Chafe (1980).
    Subjects were presented with transcripts of the narratives formatted so that each non-indented new line was the beginning of a new prosodic phrase.
    The pause locations and durations transcribed by Chafe (see Section 4.1.2) were omitted, but otherwise all lexical and nonlexical articulations were retained.
    The instructions given to the subjects were designed to have as little bias as possible regarding segment size, and total number of segments.'
    As we discuss further below, both the rate at which subject
