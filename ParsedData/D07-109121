), followed by a simple lemmatizer based on tagging results.
			Experimental results are summarized in Table 2.
			For this data set, we also see an improvement when using a part-of-speech language model ? the BLEUscore increases from 18.19% to 19.05% ? consis tent with the results reported in the previous section.
			However, moving from a surface word translation mapping to a lemma/morphology mapping leads to a deterioration of performance to a BLEU score of 14.46%.Note that this model completely ignores the sur face forms of input words and only relies on the 2Made available for the WMT07 workshop shared task http://www.statmt.org/wmt07/ 873 German?English Model BLEU baseline (surface) 18.19% + POS LM 19.05% pure lemma/morph model 14.46% backoff lemma/morph model 19.47% Table 2: Experimental results with morphological analysis and generation model (Figure 2), using News Commentary corpus more general lemma and morphology information.
