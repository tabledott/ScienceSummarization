    The ultimate goal for a coreference system is to process unannotated text.
    We use the term end-toend coreference for a system capable of determining coreference on plain text.
    We describe the challenges associated with an end-to-end system, describe our approach, and report results below.
    Developing an end-to-end system requires detecting and classifying mentions, which may degrade coreference results.
    One challenge in detecting mentions is that they are often heavily nested.
    Additionally, there are issues with evaluating an end-to-end system against a gold standard corpus, resulting from the possibility of mismatches in mention boundaries, missing mentions, and additional mentions detected, along with the need to align detecte
