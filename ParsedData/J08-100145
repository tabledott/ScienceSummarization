rpus7 (350 million words) using a term&#8211;document matrix.
    We used SVD to reduce the semantic space to 100 dimensions obtaining thus a space similar to LSA.
    We estimated the coherence of a document using Equations (1) and (2).
    A ranking can be trivially inferred by comparing the 7 Our selection of this corpus was motivated by two factors: (a) the corpus is large enough to yield a reliable semantic space, and (b) it consists of news stories and is therefore similar in style, vocabulary, and content to most of the corpora employed in our coherence experiments.
    Barzilay and Lapata Modeling Local Coherence coherence score assigned to the original document against each of its permutations.
    Ties are resolved randomly.
    Both LSA and our entity-grid model are local&#8212;they model sentence-to-sentence transitions without being aware of global document structure.
    In contrast, the content models developed by Barzilay and Lee (2004) learn to represent more global text properties by capturi
