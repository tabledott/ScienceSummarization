  For example, the article Viking program is judged as correct for ?Viking Landers?, for which there is no separate article in the Wi- kipedia collection.
  Linking a surface form to a wrong Wikipedia article was counted as an error regardless whether or not an appropriate Wikipedia article existed.
  When the system could not disam- biguate a surface form (e.g.
  ?Bama?, and ?Harris County Jail?
  ), we performed a search in Wikipedia for the appropriate entity.
  If an article for that entity existed (e.g., ?N Sync and Alabama) then we counted that instance as an error.
  Other- wise, we counted it separately as non-recallable (e.g.
  there is no Wikipedia article for the Harris County Jail entity and the article for Harris County, Texas does not discuss the jail system).
  The test set contained 756 surface forms, of which 127 were non-recallable.
  The proposed sys- tem obtained an accuracy of 91.4%, versus a 51.7% baseline (significant at p = 0.01).
