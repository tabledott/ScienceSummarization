formance of different approaches in the pronoun and non-pronoun resolution, respectively.
    In these tables we focus on the abilities of different approaches in resolving an anaphor to its antecedent correctly.
    The recall measures the number of correctly resolved anaphors over the total anaphors in the MUC test data set, and the precision measures the number of correct anaphors over the total resolved anaphors.
    The F-measure F=2*RP/(R+P) is the harmonic mean of precision and recall.
    The experimental result demonstrates that our competition learning approach achieves a better performance than the baseline approaches in resolving pronominal anaphors.
    As shown in Table 2, our approach outperforms Ng and Cardie&#8217;s singlecandidate based approach by 3.7 and 5.4 in Fmeasure for MUC-6 and MUC-7, respectively.
    Besides, compared with Strube&#8217;s S-list algorithm, our approach also achieves gains in the F-measure by 3.2 (MUC-6), and 1.6 (MUC-7).
    In particular, our approach obtains signi
