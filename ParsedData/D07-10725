components have equal probability.
			For each mixture component z ? {1, . . .
			,K}, the parameters of the component ?z aredrawn from some prior G0.
			Given the model param eters (?,?), the data points are generated i.i.d. by first choosing a component and then generating from a data model F parameterized by that component.
			In document clustering, for example, each datapoint xi is a document represented by its term frequency vector.
			Each component (cluster) z has multinomial parameters ?z which specifies adistribution F (?;?z) over words.
			It is custom ary to use a conjugate Dirichlet prior G0 =Dirichlet(??, . . .
			over the multinomial parameters, which can be interpreted as adding ???1 pseu docounts for each word.
			2.2 DP mixture model.
			We now consider the extension of the Bayesian finite mixture model to a nonparametric Bayesian mixture model based on the Dirichlet process.
			We focus on the stick-breaking representation (Sethuraman,1994) of the Dirichlet process instead of the stochastic
