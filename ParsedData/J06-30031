s in a large corpus.
    LRA extends the VSM approach in three ways: (1) The patterns are derived automatically from the corpus, (2) the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) is used to smooth the frequency data, and (3) automatically generated synonyms are used to explore variations of the word pairs.
    LRA achieves 56% on the 374 analogy questions, statistically equivalent to the average human score of 57%.
    On the related problem of classifying semantic relations, LRA achieves similar gains over the VSM.
  
  
    There are at least two kinds of similarity.
    Relational similarity is correspondence between relations, in contrast with attributional similarity, which is correspondence between attributes.
    When two words have a high degree of attributional similarity, we call them synonyms.
    When two pairs of words have a high degree of relational similarity, we say that their relations are analogous.
    For example, the word pair mason:stone is analogous to the pair carpenter:wood.
