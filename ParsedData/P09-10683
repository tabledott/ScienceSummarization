ects of narrative structure (&#8216;narrative chains&#8217;) by extracting events that share a single participant, the protagonist.
    In this paper we extend this work to represent sets of situation-specific events not unlike scripts, caseframes (Bean and Riloff, 2004), and FrameNet frames (Baker et al., 1998).
    This paper shows that verbs in distinct narrative chains can be merged into an improved single narrative schema, while the shared arguments across verbs can provide rich information for inducing semantic roles.
  
  
    This paper addresses two areas of work in event semantics, narrative event chains and semantic role labeling.
    We begin by highlighting areas in both that can mutually inform each other through a narrative schema model.
    Narrative Event Chains are partially ordered sets of events that all involve the same shared participant, the protagonist (Chambers and Jurafsky, 2008).
    A chain contains a set of verbs representing events, and for each verb, the grammatical role filled
