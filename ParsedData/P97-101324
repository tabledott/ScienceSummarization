r system, but we nevertheless expect them to reduce the number of valid discourse trees that can be associated with a text.
    We also expect that other robust methods for determining coherence relations between textual units, such as those described by Harabagiu and Moldovan (1995), will improve the accuracy of the routines that hypothesize the rhetorical relations that hold between adjacent units.
    We are not aware of the existence of any other rhetorical parser for English.
    However, Sumita et al. (1992) report on a discourse analyzer for Japanese.
    Even if one ignores some computational &amp;quot;bonuses&amp;quot; that can be easily exploited by a Japanese discourse analyzer (such as co-reference and topic identification), there are still some key differences between Sumita's work and ours.
