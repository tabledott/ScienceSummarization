e coding, is reduced by all disagreements&#8212;both random and systematic.
    The most appropriate measures of reliability for this purpose are therefore single-distribution coefficients like &#960; and &#945;, which generalize over the individual coders and exclude marginal disagreements from the expected agreement.
    This argument has been presented recently in much detail by Krippendorff (2004b) and reiterated by Craggs and McGee Wood (2005).
    At the same time, individual-distribution coefficients like &#954; provide important information regarding the trustworthiness (validity) of the data on which the annotators agree.
    As an intuitive example, think of a person who consults two analysts when deciding whether to buy or sell certain stocks.
    If one analyst is an optimist and tends to recommend buying whereas the other is a pessimist and tends to recommend selling, they are likely to agree with each other less than two more neutral analysts, so overall their recommendations are likely to be le
