r the translation direction German to English.
    Again, the word order difference between the two languages is mainly due to the German verb group.
    During the translation process, the English verb group is decomposed as shown in Figure 7.
    When the sentence is translated monotonically from left to right, the translation of the English finite verb can is moved, and it is translated as the German left verbal brace before the English noun phrase my colleague, which is the subject of the sentence.
    The translations of the infinitive visit and of the negation particle not are skipped until later in the translation process.
    For this translation direction, the translation of one source sentence position may be moved for a distance of up to L = 4 source positions, and the translation of up to two source positions may be skipped for a distance of up to R = 10 source positions (we take over the L and R notation from the previous section).
    Thus, the role of the skipping and the moving are simply reve
