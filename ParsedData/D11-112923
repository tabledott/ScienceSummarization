    In this section, we briefly describe the evaluation of our model against this dataset.
    Following this, we present a new evaluation task extending the experimental methodology of Mitchell and Lapata (2008) to transitive verb-centric sentences, and compare our model to those discussed by Mitchell and Lapata (2008) within this new experiment.
    First Dataset Description The first experiment, described in detail by Mitchell and Lapata (2008), evaluates how well compositional models disambiguate ambiguous words given the context of a potentially disambiguating noun.
    Each entry of the dataset provides a noun, a target verb and landmark verb (both intransitive).
    The noun must be composed with both verbs to produce short phrase vectors the similarity of which is measured by the candidate.
    Also provided with each entry is a classification (&#8220;High&#8221; or &#8220;Low&#8221;) indicating whether or not the verbs are indeed semantically close within the
