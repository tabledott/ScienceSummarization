-occurrences are mostly due to semantic reasons.
    The two words are used in the same context because they are of related meanings; they are not part of a single collocational construct.
    The work we describe in the rest of this paper is along the same lines of research.
    It builds on Choueka's work and attempts to remedy the problems identified above.
    The techniques we describe retrieve the three types of collocations discussed in Section 2, and they have been implemented in a tool, Xtract.
    Xtract retrieves interrupted as well as uninterrupted sequences of words and deals with collocations of arbitrary length (1 to 30 in actuality).
    The following four sections describe and discuss the techniques used for Xtract.
  
  
    Xtract consists of a set of tools to locate words in context and make statistical observation to identify collocations.
    In the upgraded version we describe here, Xtract has been extended and refined.
    More information is computed and an effort has been made to ext
