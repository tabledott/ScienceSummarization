y still get the analysis right, if it also seems probable that j should have a right dependent (in which case it will postpone the attachment); in the second case, it may get a second chance to add the arc if it in fact adds a right dependent to j at a later point.
    It is not so easy to predict what type of structures and annotation will favor the arc-standard parser in this way, but it is likely that having many right dependents attached to (or near) the root could cause problems for the arc-eager algorithms, since these dependencies determine the global structure and often span long distances, which makes it harder to make correct decisions early in the parsing process.
    This is consistent with earlier studies showing that parsers using the arc-eager, stack-based algorithm tend to predict dependents of the root with lower precision than other algorithms.14 Interestingly, the three languages for which the arc-standard parser has the highest improvement (Arabic, Czech, Slovene) have a very similar annot
