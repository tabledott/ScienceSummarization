iIj, m,1), which denotes the probability of connecting position j in a French sentence of length m with position i in an English sentence of length I.
    Since each French position is connected to exactly one English position, the constraint El=c) where e C'f is an irrelevant constant.
    , As in Model 1, equation 3 holds for the maximum likelihood estimates of the translation probabilities.
    The corresponding equation for the maxwhere CO/tile and CON.,, denote sets of connections: the set CO.Arf,, contains all connections in the training data between f and e, and the set CON.,, contains all connections between some French word and e. The probability of a connection, con'.e &#8226; , is the sum of the probabilities of all alignments that contain it.
    Notice that equation 3 satisfies the constraint: E t(fle) = 1, for each English word e. where CONV denotes the set of connections in the training data between positions j and i in French and English sentences of lengths in and 1, respectively.
