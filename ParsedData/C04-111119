ar results for a more lenient evaluation where both correct and partially correct are judged correct.
			For small datasets (below 150MB), the pattern based method achieves higher precision since the co-occurrence method requires a certain critical mass of statistics before it can extract useful class signatures (see Section 3).
			On the other hand, the pattern-based approach has relatively constant precision since most of the is-a relationships se lected by it are fired by a single pattern.
			Once the co-occurrence system reaches its critical mass (at 150MB), it generates much more precise hypo nyms.
			The Kappa statistics for our experiments were all in the range 0.78 ? 0.85.
			Table 7 and Table 8 compare the precision of the pattern-based and co-occurrence-based methods with the human and WordNet hyponyms.
			The variation between the human and WordNet scores across both systems is mostly due to the relative cleanliness of the tokens in the co-occurrencebased system (due to the parser used in the ap pr
