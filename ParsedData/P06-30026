    Vertices represent entities (here: words); the weight of an edge between two vertices indicates their similarity.
    As the data here is collected in feature vectors, the question arises why it should be transformed into a graph representation.
    The reason is, that graph-clustering algorithms such as e.g.
    (van Dongen, 2000; Biemann 2006), find the number of clusters automatically1.
    Further, outliers are handled naturally in that framework, as they are represented as singleton nodes (without edges) and can be excluded from the clustering.
    A threshold s on similarity serves as a parameter to influence the number of non-singleton nodes in the resulting graph.
    For assigning classes, we use the Chinese Whispers (CW) graph-clustering algorithm, which has been proven useful in NLP applications as described in (Biemann 2006).
    It is time-linear with respect to the number of edges, making its application viable even for graphs with several million node
