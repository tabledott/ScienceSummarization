r both languages.
    For example, closed-class words are unlikely to have cognates.
    Indeed, French/English words like a, an, on, and par often produce spurious points of correspondence.
    The same problem is caused by faux amis (&amp;quot;false friends&amp;quot;) (Macklovitch 1996).
    These are words with similar spellings but different meanings in different languages.
    For example, the French word librarie means 'bookstore,' not 'library,' and actuel means 'current,' not 'actual.'
    A matching predicate can use a list of closed-class words and/or a list of pairs of faux amis to filter out spurious matches.
    3 Most published methods for automatically constructing translation lexicons require a preexisting bitext map, which seems to render them useless for the purposes of bitext mapping algorithms.
    Fortunately, only one seed translation lexicon is required for each language pair, or at worst for each sublanguage.
    If we expect to map many bitexts in the same language pair, then it becom
