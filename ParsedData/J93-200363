er petty pseudographic improprieties in the interest of regularizing the French text.
    In all cases, orthographic French can be recovered by rule from our corrupted versions.
    Figures 6-15 show the translation probabilities and fertilities after the final iteration of training for a number of English words.
    We show all and only those probabilities that are greater than 0.01.
    Some words, like nodding, in Figure 6, do not slip gracefully into French.
    Thus, we have translations like (II fait signe que oui I He is nodding), (11 fait un signe de la tete I He is nodding), (II fait un signe de tete affirmatif I He is nodding), or (II hoche la tete affirmativement I He is nodding).

    In French, what is worth saying is worth saying in many different ways.
    We see another facet of this with words like should, in Figure 7, which rarely has a fertility greater than one but stil
