 shown to work for natural language applications.
    These approaches employ heuristic search methods with MDL for the task of unsupervised learning of morphology of natural languages (Goldsmith, 2001; Creutz and Lagus, 2002; Creutz and Lagus, 2005).
    The method proposed in this paper is the first application of the MDL idea to POS tagging, and the first to use an integer programming formulation rather than heuristic search techniques.
    We also note that it might be possible to replicate our models in a Bayesian framework similar to that proposed in (Goldwater and Griffiths, 2007).
  
  
    We presented a novel method for attacking dictionary-based unsupervised part-of-speech tagging.
    Our method achieves a very high accuracy (92.3%) on the 45-tagset and a higher (96.8%) accuracy on a smaller 17-tagset.
    The method works by explicitly minimizing the grammar size using integer programming, and then using EM to estimate parameter values.
    The entire process is fully automated and yields better
