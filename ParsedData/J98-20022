terns obtained by the method were used to resolve PP-attachment ambiguity.
    Experimental results indicate that the proposed method improves upon or is at least comparable with existing methods.
  
  
    We address the problem of automatically acquiring case frame patterns (selectional patterns, subcategorization patterns) from large corpora.
    A satisfactory solution to this problem would have a great impact on various tasks in natural language processing, including the structural disambiguation problem in parsing.
    The acquired knowledge would also be helpful for building a lexicon, as it would provide lexicographers with word usage descriptions.
    In our view, the problem of acquiring case frame patterns involves the following two issues: (a) acquiring patterns of individual case frame slots; and (b) learning dependencies that may exist between different slots.
    In this paper, we confine ourselves to the former issue, and refer the interested reader to Li and Abe (1996), which deals with the l
