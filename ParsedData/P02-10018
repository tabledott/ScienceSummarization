 compilation of decision trees (Sproat and Riley, 1996), (4) as a relation that performs contextual left-to-right replacement of input substrings by a smaller conditional relation (Gerdemann and van Noord, 1999),5 (5) by conditionalization of a joint relation as discussed below.
    A central technique is to define a joint relation as a noisy-channel model, by composing a joint relation with a cascade of one or more conditional relations as in Fig.
    1 (Pereira and Riley, 1997; Knight and Graehl, 1998).
    The general form is illustrated by 3Conceptually, the parameters represent the probabilities of reading another a (A); reading another b (&#957;); transducing b to p rather than q (&#181;); starting to transduce p to a rather than x (p).
    P(v, z) def = Ew,x,y P(v|w)P(w, x)P(y|x)P(z|y), implemented by composing 4 machines.6,7 There are also procedures for defining weighted FSTs that are not probabilistic (Berstel and Reutenauer, 1988).
    Arbitrary weights such as 2.7 may be assigned to arcs or sprink
