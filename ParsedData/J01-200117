robabilities of a letter given the previous letter were independent of the presence of an intervening boundary.
    The question is where real languages distribute themselves along the continuum that stretches between these two extremes.
    A series of publications has explored this question, including Janssen (1992), Klenk (1992), and Flenner (1994, 1995).
    Any brief description that overlooks the differences among these publications is certain to do less than full justice to all of them.
    The procedure described in Janssen (1992) and Flenner (1994, 1995) begins with a training corpus with morpheme boundaries inserted by a human, and hence the algorithm is not in the domain of unsupervised learning.
    Each bigram (and the algorithm has been extended in the natural way to treating trigrams as well) is associated with a triple (whose sum must be less than or equal to 1.0) indicating the frequency in the training corpus of a morpheme boundary occurring to the left of, between, or to the right of that b
