category is linked to some real NP.B WRONG-POS We use procedures that are part of our systems for generating GLARF, a predicate argument framework discussed in (Meyers et al., 2001a; Meyers et al., 2001b), to detect incorrect parts of speech in the Penn Treebank.
    If an instance is predicted to be a part of speech other than a common noun, but it is still tagged, that instance is flagged.
    For example, if a word tagged as a singular common noun is the first word in a VP, it is probably tagged with the wrong part of speech.
    The processes described in the previous subsections are used to create a list of annotation instances to check along with short standardized descriptions of what was wrong, e.g., wrong-pos, non-functional (if there were two identical argument roles), etc.
    Annotators do a second pass EEmpty categories mark &#8220;invisible&#8221; constituents in the Treebank, e.g., the subject of want in John wanted e to leave. on just these instances (currently about 5 to 10% of the total).
