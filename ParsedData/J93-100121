aibel and Lee (1990), almost every aspect of most speech recognition systems is dominated by probabilistic models with parameters determined from data.
  
  
    Many of the very same methods are being applied to problems in natural language processing by many of the very same researchers.
    As a result, the empirical approach has been adopted by almost all contemporary part-of-speech programs: Bahl and Mercer (1976), Leech, Garside, and Atwell (1983), Jelinek (1985), Deroualt and Merialdo (1986), Garside, Leech, and Sampson (1987), Church (1988), DeRose (1988), Hindle (1989), Kupiec (1989, 1992), Ayuso et al. (1990), deMarcken (1990), Karlsson (1990), Boggess, Agarwal, and Davis (1991), Merialdo (1991), and Voutilainen, Heikkila, and Anttila (1992).
    These programs input a sequence of words, e.g., The chair will table the motion, and output a sequence of part-of-speech tags, e.g., art noun modal verb art noun.
    Most of these programs correctly tag at least 95% of the words, with practically no restri
