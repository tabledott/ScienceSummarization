    These predictions continue to hold with as many as nine prepositional phrases (4862 parse trees).
  
  
    We could improve EQSP's performance on PPs if we could find a more efficient way to compute Catalan numbers than chart parsing, the method currently employed by EQSP.
    Let us propose two alternatives: table lookup and evaluating expression (10) directly.
    Both are very efficient over practical ranges of n, say no more than 20 phrases or so.8 In both cases, the ambiguity of a sentence in grammar (5a) can be determined by counting the number of occurrences of &amp;quot;and John&amp;quot; and then retrieving the Catalan of that number.
    These approaches both take linear time (over practical ranges of n),9 whereas chart parsing requires cubic time to parse sentences in these grammars, a significant improvement.
    So far we have shown how to compute in linear time the number of ambiguous interpretations of a sentence in an &amp;quot;every way ambiguous&amp;quot; grammar.
