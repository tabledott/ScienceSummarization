    The corpus is stored in a SQL database.
    The degree of automation increases with the amount of data available.
    Sentences annotated in previous steps are used as training material for further processing.

    This amount of data suffices as training material to reliably assign the grammatical functions if the user determines the elements of a phrase and its type (step 1 of the list above).
    Grammatical functions are assigned using standard statistica
