urrence of words in a local context were used recently for monolingual word sense disambiguation (Gale, Church, and Yarowsky 1992b, 1993; Schiitze 1992, 1993) (see Section 7 for more details and Church and Hanks 1990; Smadja 1993, for other applications of these statistics).
    It is possible to apply these methods using statistics of the target language and thus incorporate them within the framework proposed here for target word selection.
    Finding an optimal way of combining the different methods is a subject for further research.
    Our intuition, though, as well as some of our initial data, suggests that statistics on word co-occurrence in the local context can substantially increase the applicability of the selection method.
    Another way to deal with the lack of statistical data for the specific words in question is to use statistics about similar words.
    This is the basis for Sadler's Analogical Semantics (Sadler 1989), which according to his report has not proved effective.
    His results m
