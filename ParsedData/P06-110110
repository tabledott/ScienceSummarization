relations in the implied set I(Rij) not already in T.5 Thus we define the multiplicative change of the full set of implied relations as the product over all new relations: Rewriting the conditional probability in terms of our estimates of the posterior probabilities This definition leads to the following best-first search algorithm for hyponym acquisition, which at each iteration defines the new taxonomy as the union of the previous taxonomy T and the set of novel relations implied by the relation Rij that maximizes AT(I(Rij)) and thus maximizes the conditional probability of the evidence over all possible single relations: Since word senses are not directly observable, if the objects in the taxonomy are word senses (as in WordNet), we must extend our model to allow for a many-to-many mapping (e.g., a word-to-sense mapping) between DE and DT.
    For this setting we assume we know the function senses(i), mapping from the word i to all of is possible corresponding senses.
    We assume that each set of word-pa
