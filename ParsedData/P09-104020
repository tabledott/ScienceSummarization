cies in a post-processing step (Nivre and Nilsson, 2005).
    We will refer to the latter system as Spp.
    All systems use SVM classifiers with a polynomial kernel to approximate the oracle function, with features and parameters taken from Nivre et al. (2006), which was the best performing transition-based system in the CoNLL-X shared task.2 Table 1 shows the labeled parsing accuracy of the parsers measured in two ways: attachment score (AS) is the percentage of tokens with the correct head and dependency label; exact match (EM) is the percentage of sentences with a completely correct labeled dependency tree.
    The score in brackets is the attachment score for the (small) subset of tokens that are connected to their head by a non-projective arc in the gold standard parse.
    For comparison, the table also includes results for the two best performing systems in the original CoNLL-X shared task, Malt-06 (Nivre et al., 2006) and MST-06 (McDonald et al., 2006), as well as the integrated system MSTMalt, which
