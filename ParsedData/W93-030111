ly, CO.A7.3 denotes the set of connections between position j and some English position, in sentences of these lengths.
    Instead of equation 4, we obtain the following equation for the probability of a connection: Notice that Model 1 is a special case of Model 2, where a(i1j,m,l) is held fixed at As before, the EM algorithm is used to compute maximum likelihood estimates for t(fle) and a(i1j, m, 1) (using first equation 7, and then equations 3 and 6).
    However, in this case, Model 2 does not have a unique maximum, and therefore the results depend on the initial guesses.
    Brown et al. therefore use Model 1 to obtain estimates for t(f le) which do not depend on the initial guesses.
    These values are then used as the initial guesses of t(f)e) in Model 2.
    As mentioned in the introduction, we are interested in aligning corpora that are smaller and noisier than the Hansards.
    This implies severe practical constraints on the word alignment algorithm.
    As mentioned earlier, we chose to start wit
