    This observation suggests a combined approach: by using both graph-based information and transition-based information, parsing accuracy can be improved.
    The beam-search framework we have developed facilitates such a combination.
    Our graph-based and transition-based parsers share many similarities.
    Both build a parse tree incrementally, keeping an agenda of comparable state items.
    Both rank state items by their current scores, and use the averaged perceptron with early update for training.
    The key differences are the scoring models and incremental parsing processes they use, which must be addressed when combining the parsers.
    Firstly, we combine the graph-based and the transition-based score models simply by summation.
    This is possible because both models are global and linear.
    In particular, the transition-based model can be written as: If we take ET0&#8712;act(y) &#934;(T0, sT0) as the global feature vector &#934;T(y), we have: which has the same form as the graph-base
