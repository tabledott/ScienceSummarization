de the above-mentioned use of a single hope and fear hypothesis, and the use of hope hypotheses (as opposed to model-best hypotheses) to build the pseudo-corpus for calculating BLEUi.
    These changes were observed to be neutral with respect to translation quality, but resulted in faster running time and simplified implementation.
    With the exception of MIRA, the tuning approaches discussed in this paper are direct optimizers.
    That is, each solves the following optimization problem: where the first term provides regularization, weighted by &#955;.
    Throughout this paper, (4) is optimized with respect to a fixed approximation of the decoder&#8217;s true search space, represented as a collection of k-best lists.
    The various methods differ in their definition of loss and in how they optimize their objective.
    Without the complications added by hope decoding and a time-dependent cost function, unmodified MIRA can be shown to be carrying out dual coordinate descent for an SVM training objective (
