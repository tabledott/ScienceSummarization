ypes).
    The centering model assumes a preference order among transition types&#8212;CONTINUE ranks above RETAIN and RETAIN ranks above SHIFT.
    This preference order reflects the presumed inference load put on the hearer to coherently decode a discourse.
    Since the functional approach generates more CONTINUE transitions (see Table 18), we interpret this as preliminary evidence that this approach provides for a more efficient processing than its competitors.
    In particular, the observation of a predominance of CONTINUES holds irrespective of the various text genres we considered for functional centering and, to a lesser degree, for the modified grammatical ranking constraints.
    5.2.5 Method (Costs of Transition Types).
    The arguments we have given so far do not seem to be entirely convincing.
    Counting single occurrences of transition types, in general, does not reveal the entire validity of the center lists.
    Considering adjacent transition pairs as an indicator of validity should give
