ammatical relations finder of Buchholz, Veenstra, and Daelemans (1999), and the Briscoe and Carroll (2002) parser, using the gold-standard grammatical relations (GRs) from Carroll, Briscoe, and Sanfilippo (1998).
    The Penn Treebank trees of the Collins and Charniak parsers, and the GRs of the Buchholz parser, are mapped into the required grammatical relations, with the result that the GR finder of Buchholz is the most accurate.
    There are a number of problems with such evaluations.
    The first is that, when converting the output of the Collins parser, for example, into the output of another parser, the Collins parser is at an immediate disadvantage.
    This is especially true if the alternative output is significantly different from the Penn Treebank trees and if the information required to produce the alternative output is hard to extract.
    One could argue that the relative lack of grammatical information in the output of the Collins parser is a weakness and any evaluation should measure that.
