    Figure 1 shows how gain threshold has an effect on precision, recall and AER with fixed model scaling factors.
    Figure 2 shows the effect of number of features and size of training corpus on search efficiency for log-linear models.
    Table 4 shows the resulting normalized model scaling factors.
    We see that adding new features also has an effect on the other model scaling factors.
  
  
    We have presented a framework for word alignment based on log-linear models between parallel texts.
    It allows statistical models easily extended by incorporating syntactic information.
    We take IBM Model 3 as base feature and use syntactic information such as POS tags and bilingual dictionary.
    Experimental 3 E &#8594; C (MEC); A2: Model 3 C &#8594; E (MCE); A3: POS E &#8594; C (PEC); A4: POS C &#8594; E (PCE); A5: Dict (normalized such that E5m_1 Am = 1). results show that log-linear models for word alignment significantly outperform IBM translation models.
    However, the search algorithm we propos
