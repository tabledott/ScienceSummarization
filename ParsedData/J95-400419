 X, and of the previous word to Y, if Z holds can easily be handled in the processor-based system, whereas it would be difficult to handle in a classification system.
    In transformation-based learning, the objective function used in training is the same as that used for evaluation, whenever this is feasible.
    In a decision tree, using system accuracy as an objective function for training typically results in poor performance' and some measure of node purity, such as entropy reduction, is used instead.
    The direct correlation between rules and performance improvement in transformation-based learning can make the learned rules more readily interpretable than decision tree rules for increasing population purity.'
    In this section we describe the practical application of transformation-based learning to part-of-speech tagging.'
    Part-of-speech tagging is a good application to test the learner, for several reasons.
    There are a number of large tagged corpora available, allowing for a variety of e
