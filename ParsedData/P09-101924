f MBR translation is close to that of the MAP translation.
    In the NIST systems, MERT yields small improvements on top of MBR with default parameters.
    This is the case for Arabic-English Hiero/SAMT.
    In all other cases, we see no change or even a slight degradation due to MERT.
    We hypothesize that the default MBR parameters (Tromble et al., 2008) are well tuned.
    Therefore there is little gain by additional tuning using MERT.
    In the multi-language systems, the results show a different trend.
    We observe that MBR with default parameters results in gains on 18 pairs, no differences on 9 pairs, and losses on 12 pairs.
    When we optimize MBR features with MERT, the number of language pairs with gains/no changes/drops is 22/5/12.
    Thus, MERT has a bigger impact here than in the NIST systems.
    We hypothesize that the default MBR parameters are sub-optimal for some language pairs and that MERT helps to find better parameter settings.
    In particular, MERT avoids the need for manuall
