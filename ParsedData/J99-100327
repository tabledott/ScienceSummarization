oints of correspondence are relatively sparse, as illustrated in Figure 4.
    Even if one chain of false points of correspondence slips by the chain recognition heuristic, the expanding rectangle is likely to find its way back to the TBM trace before the chain recognition heuristic accepts another chain.
    If the matching predicate generates a reasonably strong signal then the signal-to-noise ratio will be high and SIMR is not likely to get lost, even though it is a greedy algorithm with no ability to look ahead.
    After noise filtering, most TPC chains conform to the pattern illustrated in Figure 5.
    The pattern can be characterized by three properties: SIMR exploits these properties to decide which chains might be TPC chains.
    First, chains that lack the injectivity property are rejected outright.
    The remaining chains are filtered using two threshold parameters: maximum point dispersal and maximum angle deviation.
    The linearity of each chain is measured as the root mean squared Typical pa
