    To summarize, many discourse analysis tasks require a fine-grained, hierarchical model, and consequently require many kinds of discourse cues for segmentation in practice.
    TextTiling attempts a coarser-grained analysis and so gets away with using a simpler feature set.
    Additionally, if we think of subtopic segmentation in terms of detection of shift from one discussion to the next, we can simplify the task to one of detecting where the use of one set of terms ends and another set begins.
    Figure 2 illustrates that lexical distribution information can be used to discover such subtopic shifts.
    The next subsections describe three different strategies for detecting subtopic shift.
    The first is based on the observations of this subsection, that subtopics can be viewed as &amp;quot;clumps&amp;quot; of vocabulary, and the problem of segmentation is one of detecting these clumps.
    The following two subsections describe alternative techniques, derived by recasting other
