			sensors were constructed semi automatically.
			Most question classes have a semantically related word list.
			Features will be extracted for this class ifa word in a question belongs to the list.
			For exam ple, when ?away?, which belongs to a list of words semantically related to the class distance, occurs inthe sentence, the sensor Rel(distance) will be ac tive.
			We note that the features from these sensors are different from those achieved using named entitysince they support more general ?semantic catego rization?
			and include nouns, verbs, adjectives rather than just named entities.
			For the sake of the experimental comparison, wedefine six feature sets, each of which is an incre mental combination of the primitive feature types.
			That is, Feature set 1 (denoted by Word) contains word features; Feature set 2 (Pos) contains featurescomposed of words and pos tags and so on; The fi nal feature set, Feature set 6 (RelWord) contains all the feature types and is the only one that containsthe rel
