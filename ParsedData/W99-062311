when a poor parser is added to the set.
    It is possible one could produce better models by introducing features describing constituents and their contexts because one parser could be much better than the majority of the others in particular situations.
    For example, one parser could be more accurate at predicting noun phrases than the other parsers.
    None of the models we have presented utilize features associated with a particular constituent (i.e. the label, span, parent label, etc.) to influence parser preference.
    This is not an oversight.
    Features and context were initially introduced into the models, but they refused to offer any gains in performance.
    While we cannot prove there are no such useful features on which one should condition trust, we can give some insight into why the features we explored offered no gain.
    Because we are working with only three parsers, the only situation in which context will help us is when it can indicate we should choose to believe a single parser
