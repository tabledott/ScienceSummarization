ck of space, a couple of issues have been glossed over.
    Briefly: results of the next two sections are all based on implementations that handle unaligned elements.
    &#8226; This theory can be generalized quite cleanly to include derivations for which substrings are replaced by sets of trees, rather than one single tree.
    This corresponds to allowing rules that do not require the output to be a single, rooted tree.
    Such a generalization gives some nice power to effectively explain certain linguistic phenomena.
    For instance, it allows us to immediately translate &#8220;va&#8221; as &#8220;does go&#8221; instead of delaying the creation of the auxiliary word &#8220;does&#8221; until later in the derivation.
  
  
    We evaluated the coverage of our model of transformation rules with two language pairs: English-French and English-Chinese.
    These two pairs clearly contrast by the underlying difficulty to understand and model syntactic transformations among pairs: while there is arguably a fair
