 translation or automatic summarization.
    In this paper, we examine how the information provided by modern statistical parsers such as Collins (1997) and Charniak (1997) contributes to solving this problem.
    We measure the effect of parser accuracy on semantic role prediction from parse trees, and determine whether a complete tree is indeed necessary for accurate role prediction.
    Gildea and Jurafsky (2002) describe a statistical system trained on the data from the FrameNet project to automatically assign semantic roles.
    The system first passed sentences through an automatic parser, extracted syntactic features from the parses, and estimated probabilities for semantic roles from the syntactic and lexical features.
    Both training and test sentences were automatically parsed, as no hand-annotated parse trees were available for the corpus.
    While the errors introduced by the parser no doubt negatively affected the results obtained, there was no direct way of quantifying this effect.
