    Arguably, there should be ways to exploit abstract sentences that are slightly reworded in addition to being compressed.
    To use sentence pairs with insertions and substitutions, we must find a way to align tree pairs in order to identify SCFG productions.
    More specifically, we must define a constituent alignment between the paired abstract and document sentences, which determine how the two trees are synchronized in a derivation.
    Obtaining this alignment is no trivial matter as the number of non-deleting edits increases.
    To address this, we synchronized tree pairs by finding the constituent alignment that minimizes the edit distance between the two trees, i.e., minimize the number of terminals and non-terminals insertions, substitutions and deletions.5 While criteria other than minimum tree edit distance may be effective, we found&#8212;after manual inspections of alignments between sentences with less than five nondeleting edits&#8212;that this method generally pro
