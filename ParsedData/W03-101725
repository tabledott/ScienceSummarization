from adjectives, adverbs, and verbs achieves the highest accuracy (90% over a baseline of 48%).
    As in the case of sentence-level classification between opinion and fact, we also found the performance to be higher on Standard B, for which humans exhibited consistent agreement.
  
  
    We presented several models for distinguishing between opinions and facts, and between positive and negative opinions.
    At the document level, a fairly straightforward Bayesian classifier using lexical information can distinguish between mostly factual and mostly opinion documents with very high precision and recall (F-measure of 97%).
    The task is much harder at the sentence level.
    For that case, we described three novel techniques for opinion/fact classification achieving up to 91% precision and recall on the detection of opinion sentences.
    We also examined an automatic method for assigning polarity information to single words and sentences, accurately discriminating between positive, negative, and neutral o
