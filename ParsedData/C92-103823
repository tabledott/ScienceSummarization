 attribute that is subsumed by the initial value, accurately describes the intended referent (i.e., subsumes the value the intended referent possesses for the attribute), rules out as many distractors as possible, and, subject to these constraints, is as close as possible in the taxonomy to the initial value.
  rules-out akes an attribut~.~value pair and returns the elements of the set of remaining distractom that are ruled out by this attr ibute-value pair.
  An  Example Assume the task is to create a referring expression for Objectl in a context that  also includes Object2 and Object3: ?
  Object1: (type, chihuahua), (size, small), (calour, black) ?
  Object2: (type, chihuahua), (size, large), (colour, white) * Object3: (type, siamese-cat), (size, small), (colour, black) In other words, r = 0bject l  and (7 = {Objest2, Object3}.
  Assume that P = {type, colour, size, .
  When make-referring-expression i  called in this con- text, it initializes L to the empty set and D to C, i.e., to {Object2, Object3}.
