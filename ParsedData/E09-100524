lating the MFS baseline.
    We used the Spanish WordNet as LKB, enriched with eXtended WordNet relations.
    It contains 105, 501 nodes and 623,316 relations.
    The results in Table 3 are consistent with those for English, with our algorithm approaching MFS performance.
    Note that for this dataset the supervised algorithm could barely improve over the MFS, suggesting that for this particular dataset MFS is particularly strong.
  
  
    Table 4 shows the time spent by the different algorithms when applied to the Senseval-2 all words dataset, using the WNet17 + Xwn as LKB.
    The dataset consists on 2473 word instances appearing on 476 different sentences.
    The experiments were done on a computer with four 2.66 Ghz processors and 16 Gb memory.
    The table shows that the time elapsed by the algorithms varies between 30 minutes for the Ppr method (which thus disambiguates circa 82 instances per minute) to almost 3 hours spent by the Ppr w2w method (circa 15 instances per minute).
    The Spr method
