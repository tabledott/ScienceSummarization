  The frontier of any derived tree 3 belongs to either ~ ~ ~ U N ~ if 7E D(,~) for some auxiliary tree 0. or to ~ if 3 E Dqcr) for some initial tree a.
  Note if ";, E D(a) for some initial tree ~, then 3 is aim a sententtal tree.
  If 0 is an auxiliary tre~, "7 E D(0) and the frontier of 3 is w I X w 2 {X is a nooterminsJ.wl.w 2 E ~ r~) then the le~ node having this non-terminal symbol X at the frontier is called the foot of 3.
  Sometimes we will be loosely using the phrase "adjoining with a derived tree" "7 E D(~) for some auxiliary tree 0.
  What we mean is that suppose we sdjoin d at some nc~le and then sLdjoin within t~ and so on, we can derive the desired derived tree E D(0) which uses the same adjoining sequence and use this resulting tree to "adioin" at the original node.
