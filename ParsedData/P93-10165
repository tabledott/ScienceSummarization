y are then propagated further to other nodes.
    The principles in GB theory are implemented as a set of constraints that must be satisfied during the propagation and combination of items.
    The constraints are attached to nodes and links in the network.
    Different nodes and links may have different constraints.
    The items received or created by a node must satisfy the constraints at the node.
    The constraints attached to the links serve as filters.
    A link only allows items that satisfy its constraints to pass through.
    For example, the link from V:NP to NP in Figure 1 has a constraint that any item passing through it must be unifiable with (case acc).
    Thus items representing NPs with nominative case, such as &amp;quot;he&amp;quot;, will not be able to pass through the link.
    By default, the attributes of an item percolate with the item as it is sent across a link.
    However, the links in the network may block the percolation of certain attributes.
