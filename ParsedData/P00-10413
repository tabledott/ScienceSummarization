marizers using sophisticated postextraction strategies, such as revision (McKeown et al., 1999; Jing and McKeown, 1999; Mani et al., 1999), and sophisticated grammar-based generation (Radev and McKeown, 1998) have also been presented.
    The work reported in this paper is most closely related to work on statistical machine translation, particularly the &#8216;IBM-style&#8217; work on CANDIDE (Brown et al., 1993).
    This approach was based on a statistical translation model that mapped between sets of words in a source language and sets of words in a target language, at the same time using an ordering model to constrain possible token sequences in a target language based on likelihood.
    In a similar vein, a summarizer can be considered to be &#8216;translating&#8217; between two languages: one verbose and the other succinct (Berger and Lafferty, 1999; Witbrock and Mittal, 1999).
    However, by definition, the translation during summarization is lossy, and consequently, somewhat easier to design and expe
