m-search has been successful in many NLP tasks (Koehn et al., 2003; Collins and Roark, 2004), and can achieve accuracy that is close to exact inference.
    Moreover, a beamsearch decoder does not impose restrictions on the search problem in the way that an exact inference decoder typically does, such as requiring the &#8220;optimal subproblem&#8221; property for dynamic programming, and therefore enables a comparatively wider range of features for a statistical system.
    We develop three parsers.
    Firstly, using the same features as MSTParser, we develop a graph-based parser to examine the accuracy loss from beamsearch compared to exact-search, and the accuracy gain from extra features that are hard to encode for exact inference.
    Our conclusion is that beamsearch is a competitive choice for graph-based parsing.
    Secondly, using the transition actions from MaltParser, we build a transition-based parser and show that search has a positive effect on its accuracy compared to deterministic parsing.
