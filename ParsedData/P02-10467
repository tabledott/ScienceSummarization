pper bounds error.
    First let us consider a lemma, to wit: disagreement upper bounds minority probabilities.
    Define the minority value of F given Y = y to be the value u with least probability Pr[F = u|Y = y]; the minority probability is the probability of the minority value.
    (Note that minority probabilities are conditional probabilities, and distinct from the marginal probability mina Pr[F = u] mentioned in the theorem.)
    In figure 1a, the areas of disagreement are the upper right and lower left quadrants of each box, as marked.
    The areas of minority values are marked in figure 1b.
    It should be obvious that the area of disagreement upper bounds the area of minority values.
    The error values of F are the values opposite to the values of Y : the error value is &#8722; when Y = + and + when Y = &#8722;.
    When minority values are error values, as in figure 1, disagreement upper bounds error, and theorem 2 follows immediately.
    However, three other cases are possible.
