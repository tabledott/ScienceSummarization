rbs could be used as a predictor in providing an event profile.
    We developed two algorithms to: (1) explore WordNet (WN-Verber) to cluster related verbs and build a set of verb chains in a document, much as Morris and Hirst (1991) used Roget's Thesaurus or like Hirst and St. Onge (1998) used WordNet to build noun chains; (2) classify verbs according to a semantic classification system, in this case, using Levin's (1993) English Verb Classes and Alternations (EVCA-Verber) as a basis.
    For source material, we used the manually-parsed Linguistic Data Consortium's Wall Street Journal (WSJ) corpus from which we extracted main and complement of communication verbs to test the algorithms on.
    Using WordNet.
    Our first technique was to use WordNet to build links between verbs and to provide a semantic profile of the document.
    WordNet is a general lexical resource in which words are organized into synonym sets, each representing one underlying lexical concept (Miller et al. 1990).
    These synonym se
