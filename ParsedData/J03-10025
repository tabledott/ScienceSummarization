    The problem is that the notion of &#8220;correspondence&#8221; between words is subjective.
    It is important to keep this in mind in the evaluation of word alignment quality.
    We shall deal with this problem in Section 5.
    The alignment between two word strings can be quite complicated.
    Often, an alignment includes effects such as reorderings, omissions, insertions, and word-tophrase alignments.
    Therefore, we need a very general representation of alignment.
    Formally, we use the following definition for alignment in this article.
    We are given a source (French) stringf1J = f1, ... , fj,.
    .
    .
    , fJ and a target language (English) string eI1 = e1,.
    .
    .
    , ei, ... , eI that have to be aligned.
    We define an alignment between the two word strings as a subset of the Cartesian product of the word positions; that is, an Modeling the alignment as an arbitrary relation between source and target language positions is quite general.
