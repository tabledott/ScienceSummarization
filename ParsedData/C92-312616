parse of s. Implementation Several different implementations of DOP are possible.
  In [Scholtes 1992] a neural net implementation f DOP is proposed, ltere we will show that conventional rule- based parsing strategies can be applied tn DOP, by converting constructions into rules.
  A construction Can be seen as a production rule, where the lefthand-side of the rule is constituted by the root of rite construction and the righthand-side is constituted by the leaves of the construction.
  The only exmt condition is that of every such rule its corresponding construction should be remembered in order to generate a parse-tree for the input string (by composing the constructions that correspond to the rules ilmt are applied).
  For a construction t, the corresponding production rule is given by root(t) ~ leaves(O In order to calculate the pteterredparse of an input string by maximizing the conditional probability, all parses with all possible tuples of constructions must be generated, which becomes highly inefficien
