 in a single group G&#710; of the manual clustering.
    The overall purity of a clustering is obtained as a weighted sum of the individual cluster purities: We calculated the entropy and purity of the clustering produced automatically with the lexical and the semantic method, when compared to the grouping induced by our manual mapping (ODE), and to the grouping manually produced for the English all-words task at Senseval-2 (3,499 senses of 403 nouns).
    We excluded from both gold standards words having a single cluster.
    The figures are shown in Table 3 (good entropy and purity values should be close to 0 and 1 respectively).
    Table 3 shows that the quality of the clustering induced with a semantic function outperforms both lexical overlap and a random baseline.
    The baseline was computed averaging among 200 random clustering solutions for each word.
    Random clusterings were the result of a random mapping function between WordNet and ODE senses.
    As expected, the automatic clusterings have a
