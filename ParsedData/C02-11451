 the year 2003.
			CTB-II will follow the standards set up in the segmentation (Xia 2000b), POS tagging (Xia 2000a) and bracketing guidelines (Xue and Xia 2000) and it will use articles from Peoples' Daily, Hong Kong newswire and material translated into Chinese from other languages in addition to the Xinhua newswire used in CTB-I in an effort to diversify the sources.
			The availability of CTB-I changed our approach to CTB-II considerably.
			Due to the existence of CTB-I, we were able to train new automatic Chinese language processing (CLP) tools, which crucially use annotated corpora as training material.
			These tools are then used for preprocessing in the development of the CTB-II.
			We also developed tools to control the quality of the corpus.
			In this paper, we will address three issues in the development of the Chinese Treebank: annotation speed, annotation accuracy and usability of the corpus.
			Specifically, we attempt to answer four questions: (i) how do we speed up the annotation process, (i
