ndary can range over 0(n) possible values, where n is the length of the longest component of the input multitext.
    We still have 3 nonterminal labels per dimension per inference.
    Also, each inference now needs to compute an RTV at a cost 12The inputs of &#177; must have no overlapping intervals, or else the output is undefined.
    A.C: in 0 (C (G)).
    Thus, the time complexity of Parser A is in 0 (C (G) INI3Dn3c(G)).
    For a binarized L2MTG, which also needs to keep track of two lexical heads per dimension per inference, this complexity rises to Parser B is a generalization of Parser R2B for binarized L2MTGs of arbitrary rank.
    It decomposes inference rule A.0 into ID and LP subrules, using generalized hooks that carry an RTV.
    The decomposition can happen in one of two ways, depending on the heir's role (1 or 2) in the DLV.
    The rules in Section 3.2 are simple examples of B.ID1 and B.LP1.
    Parser B is faster than Parser A, but takes more space.
    The hooks of Parser B must keep trac
