    11Note that, unlike reranking approaches, there are still exponentially many candidate parse trees after pruning.
    The oracle constrained to pick parents from these lists achieves &gt; 98% in every case.
    12The loss-augmented inference problem can also be expressed as an LP for Hamming loss functions that factor over arcs; we refer to Martins et al. (2009) for further details.
    baselines, all of them state-of-the-art parsers based on non-arc-factored models: the second order model of McDonald and Pereira (2006), the hybrid model of Nivre and McDonald (2008), which combines a (labeled) transition-based and a graphbased parser, and a refinement of the latter, due to Martins et al. (2008), which attempts to approximate non-local features.13 We did not reproduce the model of Riedel and Clarke (2006) since the latter is tailored for labeled dependency parsing; however, experiments reported in that paper for Dutch (and extended to other languages in the CoNLL-X task) suggest that their model performs
