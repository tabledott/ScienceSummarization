metrics would lead to perceptibly better translation quality for the system&#8217;s resulting output.
    The primary objectives of WMT are to evaluate the state of the art in machine translation, to disseminate common test sets and public training data with published performance numbers, and to refine evaluation methodologies for machine translation.
    As with previous workshops, all of the data, translations, and collected human judgments are publicly available.1 We hope these datasets form a valuable resource for research into statistical machine translation, system combination, and automatic evaluation of translation quality.
  
  
    The recurring task of the workshop examines translation between English and four other languages: German, Spanish, French, and Czech.
    We created a test set for each language pair by translating newspaper articles.
    We additionally provided training data and two baseline systems.
    The test data for this year&#8217;s task was created by hiring people to translate
