    It looks at consecutive templates in the database, marked as separate paragraphs from the previous stage, and assigns values to &amp;quot;realization switches&amp;quot; that control local choices such as tense and voice.
    They also govern the presence or absence of certain constituents to avoid repetition of constituents and to satisfy anaphora constraints.
    This subsection describes how the algorithm is applied to a set of four templates by tracing the computational process that transforms the raw source into a final natural language summary.
    Excerpts from the four input news articles are shown in Figure 6.
    The four news articles are transformed into four templates that correspond to four separate accounts of two related events and will be included in the set of templates from which the template combiner will work.
    Only the relevant fields are shown.
    Let's now consider the four templates in the order that they appear in the list of templates.
