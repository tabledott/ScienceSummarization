tion (SWAP) to get the full transition set Tu (u for unrestricted).
    The minimal transition set Tp for projective dependency parsing contains three transitions: The system Sp = (C, Tp, cs, Ct) is sound and complete for the set of projective dependency trees (over some label set L) and has been used, in slightly different variants, by a number of transition-based dependency parsers (Yamada and Matsumoto, 2003; Nivre, 2004; Attardi, 2006; Nivre, 2008a).
    For proofs of soundness and completeness, see Nivre (2008a).
    As noted in section 2, the worst-case time complexity of a deterministic transition-based parser is given by an upper bound on the length of transition sequences.
    In 5p, the number of transitions for a sentence x = w1, ... , wn is always exactly 2n, since a terminal configuration can only be reached after n SHIFT transitions (moving nodes 1, ... , n from B to E) and n applications of LEFT-ARCl or RIGHT-ARCl (removing the same nodes from E).
    Hence, the complexity of deterministic pars
