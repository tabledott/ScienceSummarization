fiers for hyponyms (Hearst, 1992), meronyms (Girju, 2003), synonyms (Lin et al., 2003), a variety of verb relations (Chklovski and Pantel, 2004), and general purpose analogy relations (Turney et al., 2003).
    Such classifiers use hand-written or automaticallyinduced patterns like Such NPy as NP,, or NPy like NP,, to determine, for example that NPy is a hyponym of NP,, (i.e., NPy IS-A NP,,).
    While such classifiers have achieved some degree of success, they frequently lack the global knowledge necessary to integrate their predictions into a complex taxonomy with multiple relations.
    Past work on semantic taxonomy induction includes the noun hypernym hierarchy created in (Caraballo, 2001), the part-whole taxonomies in (Girju, 2003), and a great deal of recent work described in (Buitelaar et al., 2005).
    Such work has typically either focused on only inferring small taxonomies over a single relation, or as in (Caraballo, 2001), has used evidence for multiple relations independently from one another, b
