irs of verb classes to decrease (i.e., discriminability would improve) with the addition of TRANS, PASS, or VBN.
    We find that these predictions are confirmed in part.
    First consider the TRANS feature.
    Comparing the second to the first panel of Table 15, we find that unergatives are already accurately classified, and the addition of TRANS to the set does indeed greatly reduce the confusability of unaccusatives and object-drops, with the number of errors dropping from 12 to 6.
    However, we also observe that the confusability of unergatives and unaccusatives is not improved, and the confusability of unergatives and object-drops is worsened with the addition of the TRANS feature, with errors in the latter case increasing from 4 to 7.
    We conclude that the expected three-way discriminability of TRANS is most apparent in the reduced confusion of unaccusative and object-drop verbs.
    Our initial prediction was that PASS and VBN would behave similarly to TRANS&#8212; that is, also making a three-w
