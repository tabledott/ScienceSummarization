 any of the prefixes, as well as segmenting punctuation characters.
    In most cases, this simple approach was able to locate only one of the two necessary boundaries for recognizing full words, and the initial score was understandably low, F=29.8.
    Nevertheless, even from this flawed initial approximation, our rule-based algorithm learned a sequence of 632 transformations which nearly doubled the word recall, improving the score from 29.8 to 53.3, a 33.5% error reduction.
    Since we had a large amount of English data, we also performed a classic experiment to determine the effect the amount of training data had on the ability of the rule sequences to improve segmentation.
    We started with a training set only slightly larger than the test set, 872 sentences, and repeated the maximum matching experiment described in Section 3.4.1.
    We then incrementally increased the amount of training data and repeated the experiment.
    The results, summarized in Table 3, clearly indicate (not surprisingly) that
