epending on whether each of the source collocation (X) and the partial translations (i.e., A and B) appear in it.
    Let the counts of these sentences be 11ABx, nAB)--c, &#8226;, nag, where a bar indicates that the corresponding term is absent.
    We can then find values of the n. 's that cause the algorithm to miss a valid translation as long as the corpus contains a modest number of sentences.
    This happens when one or more of the parts of the final translation appear frequently in the corpus but not together with the other parts or the source collocation.
    This phenomenon occurs even if we are allowed to vary the Dice thresholds at each stage of the algorithm.
    With our current constant Dice threshold Td = 0.1, we may miss a valid translation as long as the corpus contains at least 20 sentences.
    While our algorithm will necessarily miss some valid translations, this is a worst case scenario.
    To study the average-case behavior of our algorithm, we simulated its performance with randomly s
