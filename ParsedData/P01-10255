tially inhomogeneous and not fully grammatically correct, because they include combinations with no grammatical relation between PN and V. PNV collocations were manually annotated.
    The criteria used for the distinction between collocations and arbitrary word combinations are: There is a grammatical relation between the verb and the PP, and the triple can be interpreted as support verb construction and/or a metaphoric or idiomatic reading is available, e.g.
    : zur Verf&#252;gung stellen (at_the availability put, &#8216;make available&#8217;), am Herzen liegen (at the heart lie, &#8216;have at heart&#8217;).7 General statistics for the AdjN and PNV base sets are given in Table 1.
    Manual annotation was performed for AdjN pairs with frequency and PNV triples with only (see section 5 for a discussion of the excluded low-frequency candidates).
  
  
    After extraction of the base data and manual identification of TPs, the AMs are applied, resulting in an ordered candidate list for each measure (hencefo
