 to resolve some of the ambiguous attachments, and the resolved cases are iteratively used to disambiguate the remaining unresolved cases.
    Our procedure differs critically from (Hindle and Rooth, 1993) in that we do not iterate, we extract unambiguous attachments from unparsed input sentences, and we totally ignore the ambiguous cases.
    It is the hypothesis of this approach that the information in just the unambiguous attachment events can resolve the ambiguous attachment events of the test data.
    Given a tagged and chunked sentence, the extraction heuristic returns head word tuples of the form (v,p, n2) or (n,p, n2), where v is the verb, n is the noun, p is the preposition, n2 is the object of the preposition.
    The main idea of the extraction heuristic is that an attachment site of a preposition is usually within a few words to the left of the preposition.
    We extract : (v,p, n2) if Table 1 also shows the result of the applying the extraction heuristic to a sample sentence.
