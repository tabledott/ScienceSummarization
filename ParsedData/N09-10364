f these on the word segmentation task, these choices arise in other nonparametric Bayesian inference problems as well, so our results should be useful more generally.
    The rest of this paper is organized as follows.
    The next section reviews adaptor grammars and presents three different adaptor grammars for word segmentation that serve as running examples in this paper.
    Adaptor grammars contain a large number of adjustable parameters, and Section 3 discusses how these can be estimated using Bayesian techniques.
    Section 4 examines several implementation options within the adaptor grammar inference algorithm and shows that they can make a significant impact on performance.
    Cumulatively these changes make a significant difference in word segmentation accuracy: our final adaptor grammar performs unsupervised word segmentation with an 87% token f-score on the standard Brent version of the Bernstein-Ratner corpus (Bernstein-Ratner, 1987; Brent and Cartwright, 1996), which is an error reduction of
