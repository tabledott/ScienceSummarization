 human evaluations.
    This means that a threshold value is set for each of 19962001 and 1989-1996 so that valid alignments can be extracted by selecting alignments whose AVSIM is larger than the threshold.
    We used the same data in Table 1 to calculate statistics on AVSIM.
    They are shown in Tables 3 and 4 for 1996-2001 and 1989-1996, respectively.
    In these tables, &#8220;N&#8221; means the number of alignments against the corresponding human judgment.
    &#8220;Av.&#8221; means the average value of AVSIM.
    &#8220;Lower&#8221; and &#8220;upper&#8221; mean the lower and upper bounds of the 95% confidence interval for the average.
    &#8220;Th.&#8221; means the threshold for AVSIM that can be used to discriminate between the alignments estimated to be the corresponding evaluations.
    For example, in Table 3, evaluations A and B are separated by 0.168.
    These thresholds were identified through linear discriminant analysis.
