pergraph of arity 1 is a regular graph (lattice).
    Each hyperedge is labeled with a rule re from the SCFG.
    The number of nonterminals on the right-hand side of re corresponds with the arity of e. An example without scores is shown in Figure 1.
    A path in a translation hypergraph induces a translation hypothesis E along with its sequence of SCFG rules D = r1, r2, ..., rK which, if applied to the start symbol, derives E. The sequence of SCFG rules induced by a path is also called a derivation tree for E.
  
  
    Given a set of source sentences F1&#65533; with corresponding reference translations RS , the objective of MERT is to find a parameter set &#65533;&#955;m which minimizes an automated evaluation criterion under a linear model: In the context of statistical machine translation, the optimization procedure was first described in Och (2003) for N-best lists and later extended to phrase-lattices in Macherey et al. (2008).
    The algorithm is based on the insight that, under a loglinear model, th
