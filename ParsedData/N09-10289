we have multiple children with the same weight, while the weight is used to determine the relative order of the children, going from largest to smallest.
    The weight can be any real valued number.
    The order type NORMAL means we preserve the original order of the children, while REVERSE means we flip the order.
    We reserve a special label self to refer to the head node itself so that we can apply a weight to the head, too.
    We will call this tuple a precedence tuple in later discussions.
    In this study, we use manually created rules only.
    Suppose we have a precedence rule: VB &#8594; (nsubj, 2, NORMAL), (dobj, 1, NORMAL), (self, 0, NORMAL).
    For the example shown in Figure 2, we would apply it to the ROOT node and result in &#8220;John the ball can hit .&#8221;.
    Given a set of rules, we apply them in a dependency tree recursively starting from the root node.
    If the POS tag of a node matches the left-hand-side of a rule, the rule is applied and the order of the sentence is changed
