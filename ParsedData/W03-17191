ished report is nonetheless hard to compare fairly with other systems, since the systems are often tested on their own selected test corpora.
    Part of the problem is also that there is no single accepted segmentation standard: There are several, including the four standards used in this evaluation.
    A number of segmentation contests have been held in recent years within Mainland China, in the context of more general evaluations for ChineseEnglish machine translation.
    See (Yao, 2001; Yao, 2002) for the first and second of these; the third evaluation will be held in August 2003.
    The test corpora were segmented according to the Chinese national standard GB 13715 (GB/T 13715&#8211;92, 1993), though some lenience was granted in the case of plausible alternative segmentations (Yao, 2001); so while GB 13715 specifies the segmentation / for Mao Zedong, was also allowed.
    Accuracies in the mid 80&#8217;s to mid 90&#8217;s were reported for the four systems that participated in the first evaluation, wi
