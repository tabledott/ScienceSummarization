ances of fisheries in Table 1 fall into piece 2, and the remaining 16 fall into piece 8.
			Similarly, the first 4 instances of pgches in Table 2 fall into piece 2, and the remaining 17 fall into piece 8.
			Thus, VT= Vp = &lt;2 0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0 &gt; Now, we want to know if VT is similar to Vp, and if we find that it is, then we will suspect that fisheries ---&gt; p~ches.
			In this example, of course, the vectors are identical, so practically any reasonable similarity statistic ought to produce the desired result.
			3.
			fisheries is not file translation of lections Before describing how we estimate the similarity of Vf and Vp, let us see what would happen if we tried to compare fisheries with a completely unrelated word, eg., lections.
			(This word should be the translation of elections, not fisheries.)
			2.
			At most, fisheries can account for only 19 instances of.
			p~ches, leaving at least 2 instances ofp~ches unexplained.
			As can be seen in the concordances in Table 3, for K=10, the vector is
