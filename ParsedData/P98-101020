idal 1993), learns a subsequential transducer in the limit.
    This algorithm was used for natural-language tasks by Vilar, Marzal, and Vidal (1994) for learning translation of a limited-domain language, as well as by Gildea and Jurafsky (1994) for learning phonological rules.
    Ahonen et al. (1994) describe an algorithm for learning (k,h)-contextual regular languages, which they use for learning the structure of SGML documents.
    Apart from deterministic FSMs, there are a number of algorithms for learning stochastic models, eg., (Stolcke and Omohundro, 1992; Carrasco and Oncina, 1994; Ron et al., 1995).
    These algorithms differ mainly by their state-merging strategies, used for generalizing from the training data.
    A major difference between the abovementioned learning methods and our memory-based approach is that the former employ generalized models that were created at training time while the latter uses the training corpus as-is and generalizes only at recognition time.
    Much work aimed at l
