ffer in the domains we are annotating and the design philosophy for the entity guidelines.
    For example, we have been concentrating on explicit concepts for entities like genes rather than developing a wide-range ontology for the various physical instantiations.
    Gene Entity For the sake of this project the definition for &#8221;Gene Entity&#8221; has two significant characteristics.
    First, &#8221;Gene&#8221; refers to a composite entity as opposed to the strict biological definition.
    As has been noted by others, there are often ambiguities in the usage of the entity names.
    For example, it is sometimes unclear as to whether it is the gene or protein being referenced, or the same name might refer to the gene or the protein at different locations in the same document.
    Our approach to this problem is influenced by the named entity annotation in the Automatic Content Extraction (ACE) project (Consortium, 2002), in which &#8220;geopolitical&#8221; entities can have different roles, such as &#
