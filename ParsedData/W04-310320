upported by the fact that neither system used positional features and yet the precision and recall on the all sentence data set is similar to the last two sentences data set.
  
  
    The work presented here is preliminary but promising.
    It seems that the notion of speculative sentence can be characterized enabling manual annotation.
    However, we did not manage to characterize the distinction between high and low speculation.
    In addition, it seems likely that automated systems will be able to achieve useful accuracy.
    Finally, abstracts seem to include a fair amount of speculative information.
    Future work concerning manual annotation would include revising the guidelines, throwing out the High vs. Low distinction, annotating more data, annotating sub-sentential units, annotating the focus of the speculation (e.g., a gene), and annotating full text articles.
    We are also ignorant of work in linguistics that almost certainly exists and may be informative.
    We have started this process b
