			The numerator of(16) estimates the aver- age number of times that a derivation involves the rule t\[.-7/\] -~ t\[..Tirfl\].
			Therefore, for example, (16) estimates the probability of using the rule/\['-~7\] ~ l\["rplt\].
			The algorittun reiterates until H(W, G) is unchanged (within some epsilon) between two iterations.
			Each it- eration of the algoritbm requires at most O(IGIN e) time for each sentence of length N. 5 Grammar In ference w i th.
			SLTAG The reestimation algorithm explained in Section 4 can be used botll to reestimate the paramcters for a SI,TAG derived by some other mean or to infer a grammar from scratch.
			Ill the following, we investigate grammar In- ference from scratch.
			The initial grammar for the reestimation algoritiim consists of all SLIG rules for the tress ill Lexical- ized Normal I~brm (ill short LNF) over a given set = {aill .&lt; i _&lt; T} of terminal symbols, with suit- ably assigned non zero probability: 9 S 0 $4 s h t~ a i The above normal form is
