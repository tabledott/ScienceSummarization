89) note that lexicalized TAGs are an appropriate r presentation language for idiomatic constructions, as their expanded omain of locality can account for many syntactic properties of idioms.
			It seems natural to generalize beyond syntax, as they do, to the claim that lexicalized 'FAGs allow one to deal with semantic noncompositionality.
			Their argument to this claim is based on an intuition that semantics de- pends on the TAG derivation structure, an intuition that synchronous TAGs makes precise.
			For example, the id- iomatic construction "kick the bucket" cashes out as the following tree pair, under its idiomatic interpretation: a3 d}e' $ whereas the literal usage of "kick" is associated with a tree pair similar to that of "hates" in Figure 1.
			Two derivations of the sentence "George kicked the bucket" are possible, each using a different one of these two elementary tree pairs, but both yielding identical de- rived constituency trees for the English.
			They will be associated, of course, with two d
