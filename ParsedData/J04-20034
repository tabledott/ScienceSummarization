s of abstraction is proposed.
    Features from those hierarchy levels are combined to form hierarchical lexicon models, which can replace the standard probabilistic lexicon used in most statistical machine translation systems.
    Apart from the improved coverage, the proposed lexicon models enable the disambiguation of ambiguous word forms by means of annotation with morpho-syntactic tags.
    The article is organized as follows.
    After briefly reviewing the basic concepts of the statistical approach to machine translation, we discuss the state of the art and related work as regards the incorporation of morphological and syntactic information into systems for natural language processing.
    Section 2 describes the information provided by morpho-syntactic analysis and introduces a suitable representation of the analyzed corpus.
    Section 3 suggests solutions for two specific aspects of structural difference, namely, question inversion and separated verb prefixes.
    Section 4 is dedicated to hierarchi
