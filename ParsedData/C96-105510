 example sentences are denoted by the number 1 in the sentence patterns and negative xample sentences are denoted by the number 0 (corresponding to sentences marked with a *).
  3.2 Exper iment  1: Verb -based  Approach In the first experiment, we ignored word sense distinc- tions and considered each verb only once, regardless of whether it occurred in multiple classes.
  In fact;, 46% of the verbs appear more than once.
  In some cases, the verb appears to have a related sense even though it appears in different classes.
  For example, the verb roll appears in two subclasses of Manner of Motion Verbs that are distinguished on the basis of whether the gram- matical subject is animate or inanimate.
  In other cases, tile verb may have (largely) unrelated senses.
  For ex- ample, the verb move is both a Manner of Motion verb 323 and verb of Psychological State.
  To compose the syntactic signatures for each verb, we collect all of the syntactic patterns associated with every class a particular verb appears in,
