    We think it is also possible to identify a compatible set of conceptual domains for characterizing events and therefore, defining verbs as well.
    Initially we are relying on the semantic domains suggested by Levin as relevant to syntactic alternations, such as motion, force, contact, change-of-state and action, etc, (Levin, 1992).
    We will augment these domains as needed to distinguish between different senses for the achievment of accurate lexical selection.
    If words can be defined with concepts in a hierarchical structure, it is possible to measure the meaning similarity between words with an information measure based on WordNet (Resnik, 1993), or structure level information based on a thesaurus (Kurohashi and Nagao, 1992).
    However, verb meanings are difficult to organize in a Literal Inadequacy of selection restrictions for choosing actions - By looking at specific examples, it soon becomes clear that shallow selection restrictions give very little information about the choice of the acti
