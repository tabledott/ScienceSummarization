fforts for further advancement.
    Since then, several improvements have been reported (Miwa et al., 2010b; Poon and Vanderwende, 2010; Vlachos, 2010; Miwa et al., 2010a; Bj&#168;orne et al., 2010).
    For example, Miwa et al. (Miwa et al., 2010b) reported a significant improvement with binding events, achieving 50% of performance level.
    The task introduced in BioNLP-ST 2009 was renamed to Genia event (GE) task, and was hosted again in BioNLP-ST 2011, which also hosted four other IE tasks and three supporting tasks (Kim et al., 2011).
    As the sole task that was repeated in the two events, the GE task was referenced during the development of other tasks, and took the role of connecting the results of the 2009 event to the main tasks of 2011.
    The GE task in 2011 received final submissions from 15 teams.
    The results show the community made a significant progress with the task, and also show the technology can be generalized to full papers at moderate cost of performance.
