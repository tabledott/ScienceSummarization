    First, UNARYINTERNAL marks (with a -U) any nonterminal node which has only one child.
    In isolation, this resulted in an absolute gain of 0.55% (see figure 3).
    The same sentence, parsed using only the baseline and UNARY-INTERNAL, is parsed correctly, because the VP rewrite in the incorrect parse ends with an S&amp;quot;VPU with very low probability.8 Alternately, UNARY-EXTERNAL, marked nodes which had no siblings with &amp;quot;U.
    It was similar to UNARY-INTERNAL in solo benefit (0.01% worse), but provided far less marginal benefit on top of other later features (none at all on top of UNARYINTERNAL for our top models), and was discarded.9 One restricted place where external unary annotation was very useful, however, was at the preterminal level, where internal annotation was meaningless.
    One distributionally salient tag conflation in the Penn treebank is the identification of demonstratives (that, those) and regular determiners (the, a).
    Splitting DT tags based on whether they
