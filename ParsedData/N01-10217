t.
    Starting from a dummy start state in which the dot is just to the left of the grammar&#8217;s start symbol, predict adds new states for rules which could expand the start symbol.
    In these new predicted states, the dot is at the far left-hand side of each rule.
    After prediction, scan checks the input string: if the symbol immediately following the dot matches the current word in the input, then the dot is moved rightward, across the symbol.
    The parser has &#8220;scanned&#8221; this word.
    Finally, complete propagates this change throughout the chart.
    If, as a result of scanning, any states are now present in which the dot is at the end of a rule, then the left hand side of that rule has been recognized, and any other states having a dot immediately in front of the newly-recognized left hand side symbol can now have their dots moved as well.
    This happens over and over until no new states are generated.
    Parsing finishes when the dot in the dummy start state is moved across the g
