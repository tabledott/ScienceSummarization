 character tree, or trie (as in strip all pseudo-prefixes from each word in our lexicon and add the word residuals back into the lexicon as if they were also words.
    Using this final lexicon, we can now seek for suffixes in a manner equivalent to what we had done before (Schone and Jurafsky, 2000).
    To demonstrate how this is done, suppose our initial lexicon SC, contained the words &#8220;align,&#8221; &#8220;real,&#8221; &#8220;aligns,&#8221; &#8220;realign&#8221;, &#8220;realigned&#8221;, &#8220;react&#8221;, &#8220;reacts,&#8221; and &#8220;reacted.&#8221; Due to the high frequency occurrence of &#8220;re-&#8221; suppose it is identified as a pseudo-prefix.
    If we strip off &#8220;re-&#8221; from all words, and add all residuals to a trie, the branch of the trie of words beginning with &#8220;a&#8221; is depicted in Figure 2.
    In our earlier work, we showed that a majority of the regular suffixes in the corpus can be found by identifying trie branches that appear repetitively.
