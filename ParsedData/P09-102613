les of the learned probabilities.
    These probabilities align with what we qualitatively found in our development data.
    For example, the opinions towards &#8220;Storm&#8221; essentially follow the opinions towards &#8220;Blackberry;&#8221; that is, positive opinions toward &#8220;Storm&#8221; are usually found in the vicinity of positive opinions toward &#8220;Blackberry,&#8221; and negative opinions toward &#8220;Storm&#8221; are usually found in the vicinity of negative opinions toward &#8220;Blackberry&#8221; (for example, in the row for storm+, P(blackberry+|storm+) is much higher than the other probabilities).
    Thus, an opinion expressed about &#8220;Storm&#8221; is usually the opinion one has toward &#8220;Blackberry.&#8221; This is expected, as Storm is a type of Blackberry.
    A similar example is ipod+, which follows the opinion toward the iPhone.
    This is interesting because an iPod is not a phone; the association is due to preference for the brand.
    In contrast, the probability dist
