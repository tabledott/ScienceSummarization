 dependency tree for Single-best MIRA training and testing.
			based on edge factorization as described in Section 3.2.
			We use the Chu-Liu-Edmonds algorithm to find the best tree for the test data.
			4.1 Results.
			Results are shown in Table 1.
			There are two mainmetrics.
			The first and most widely recognized is Ac curacy, which measures the number of words that correctly identified their parent in the tree.
			Completemeasures the number of sentences in which the re sulting tree was completely correct.Clearly, there is an advantage in using the ChuLiu-Edmonds algorithm for Czech dependency pars 528 Czech-A Czech-B Accuracy Complete Accuracy CompleteCOLL1999 82.8 - - N&amp;N2005 80.0 31.8 - McD2005 83.3 31.3 74.8 0.0 Single-best MIRA 84.1 32.2 81.0 14.9 Factored MIRA 84.4 32.3 81.5 14.3 Table 1: Dependency parsing results for Czech.
