    To the extent that more information is furnished by any one source, commensurately less is needed from the others.
    The overall processing model must be one of constraint satisfaction that can operate on partial information.
    It must allow for incrementally constraining the range of possibilities on the basis of new information that becomes available as the segment progresses.
    At least three different kinds of information play a role in the determina
