e translation step limited to local adjustments of the target sentence (e.g.
    Sumita 2001).
    When an input sentence closely matches a template, results can be stunning.
    However, MSA achieves its richness of substitution at the cost of generality.
    Inspection reveals that 15 of the 59 MSA paraphrases, or 25.4%, are based on a single high-frequency, domain-specific template (essentially a running tally of deaths in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict).
    Unless one is prepared to assume that similar templates can be found for most sentence types, scalability and domain extensibility appear beyond the reach of MSA.
    In addition, since MSA templates pair entire sentences, the technique can produce semantically different output when there is a mismatch in information content among template training sentences.
    Consider the third and fourth rows of Table 3, which indicate the extent of embellishment and lossiness found in MSA paraphrases and the topranked PR paraphrases.
