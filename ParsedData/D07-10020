	Using Semantic Roles to Improve Question Answering
		Shallow semantic parsing, the automaticidentification and labeling of sentential constituents, has recently received much attention.
		Our work examines whether seman tic role information is beneficial to questionanswering.
		We introduce a general frame work for answer extraction which exploits semantic role annotations in the FrameNetparadigm.
		We view semantic role assignment as an optimization problem in a bipartite graph and answer extraction as an instance of graph matching.
		Experimental results on the TREC datasets demonstrate im provements over state-of-the-art models.
	
	
			Recent years have witnessed significant progress in developing methods for the automatic identificationand labeling of semantic roles conveyed by sentential constituents.1 The success of these methods, often referred to collectively as shallow semantic pars ing (Gildea and Jurafsky, 2002), is largely due to the availability of resources like FrameNet (Fillmore et al., 2003
