0 = 0.2.
    Thus, to choose Ti we require that with confidence level of at least 90% the hypothesis should satisfy ln(pi /p2) &gt; 0.2 (i.e., pl/p2 &gt; e0.2 1.22).
    For the alternative translations of tuple c in Table 1 we got ni = 29 and n2 =- 5.
    For these values Ba -= 1.137.
    In this case Equation 4 is satisfied for 0 = 0.2, and the algorithm selects the word 'progress' as the translation of the Hebrew word hitqaddmut.
    In another case we had to translate the Hebrew word ro'sh, which can be translated to either 'top' or 'head,' in the sentence whose translation is (12) Sihanuk stood at the {top I head} of a coalition of underground groups.
    The two alternative syntactic tuples were For n1 = 10 and n2 = 5, we get Ba = &#8212;0.009 (a negative value means that it is impossible to ensure with a 90% confidence level that p1 &gt; p2).
    Since B, &lt; 0.2, the algorithm will refrain from making a decision in this case.
    This abstention reflects the fact that the difference between the count
