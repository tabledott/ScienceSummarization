lar to w2.
    A special (and stronger) case of similarity is when the two pairs differ only in one of their words (e.g.
    (wi, w'2) and (wi, wz)).
    This special case is less susceptible to noise than unrestricted similarity, as we replace only one of the words in the pair.
    In our experiments, which involved rather noisy data, we have used only this restricted type of similarity.
    The mathematical formulations, though, are presented in terms of the general case.
    The question that arises now is what analogies can be drawn between two similar cooccurrence pairs, (wi, w2) and (w, w).
    Their probabilities cannot be expected to be similar, since the probabilities of the words in each pair can be different.
    However, since we assume that w1 and 01 have similar cooccurrence patterns, and so do w2 and 74, it is reasonable to assume that the mutual information of the two pairs will be similar (recall that mutual information measures the degree of association between the words of the pair).
