    The resulting judgments were compared to the blind judgments of a single judge.
    One hundred ninety-three distinct verbs were chosen at random from the tagged version of the Brown Corpus for comparison.
    Common verbs are more likely to be included in the test sample than rare verbs, but no verb is included more than once.
    Each verb was scored for a given frame only if it cooccurs with a cue for that frame at least once.
