  Forest Rescoring: Faster Decoding with Integrated Language Models
  
    Efficient decoding has been a fundamental problem in machine translation, especially with an integrated language model which is essential for achieving good translation quality.
    We develop faster approaches for problem based on parsing algorithms and demonstrate their effectiveness on both phrase-based and syntax-based MT systems.
    In both cases, our methods achieve significant speed improvements, often by more than a factor of ten, over the conventional beam-search method at the same levels of search error and translation accuracy.
  
  
    Recent efforts in statistical machine translation (MT) have seen promising improvements in output quality, especially the phrase-based models (Och and Ney, 2004) and syntax-based models (Chiang, 2005; Galley et al., 2006).
    However, efficient decoding under these paradigms, especially with integrated language models (LMs), remains a difficult problem.
    Part of the complexity arises f
