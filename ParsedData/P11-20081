tools which might enable a richer linguistic analysis; such tools are typically trained on newstext and have been shown to perform poorly on Twitter (Finin et al., 2010).
    One of the most fundamental parts of the linguistic pipeline is part-of-speech (POS) tagging, a basic form of syntactic analysis which has countless applications in NLP.
    Most POS taggers are trained from treebanks in the newswire domain, such as the Wall Street Journal corpus of the Penn Treebank (PTB; Marcus et al., 1993).
    Tagging performance degrades on out-of-domain data, and Twitter poses additional challenges due to the conversational nature of the text, the lack of conventional orthography, and 140character limit of each message (&#8220;tweet&#8221;).
    Figure 1 shows three tweets which illustrate these challenges.
    In this paper, we produce an English POS tagger that is designed especially for Twitter data.
    Our contributions are as follows: &#8226; we developed features for Twitter POS tagging and conducted experi
