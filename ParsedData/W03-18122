for spill and beans are not readily available at the simplex level other than in the context of this particular MWE, it seems fallacious to talk about them composing together to form the semantics of the idiom.
    Ideally, we would like to be able to differentiate between three classes of MWEs: nondecomposable, idiosyncratically decomposable and simple decomposable (derived from Nunberg et al.&#8217;s sub-classification of idioms (1994)).
    With nondecomposable MWEs (e.g. kick the bucket, shoot the breeze, hot dog), no decompositional analysis is possible, and the MWE is semantically impenetrable.
    The only syntactic variation that non-decomposable MWEs undergo is verbal inflection (e.g. kicked the bucket, kicks the bucket) and pronominal reflexivisation (e.g. wet oneself, wet themselves).
    Idiosyncratically decomposable MWEs (e.g. spill the beans, let the cat out of the bag, radar footprint) are decomposable but coerce their parts into taking semantics unavailable outside the MWE.
    They undergo a
