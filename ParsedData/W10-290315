new examples are added or changed in S. Like the direct approach, this learning framework is makes very few assumptions about the type of structured learner used as a base learner (line 10).3
  
  
    Semantic parsing is the process of converting a natural language input into a formal logic representation.
    This process is performed by associating lexical items and syntactic patterns with logical fragments and composing them into a complete formula.
    Existing approaches rely on extracting a set of parsing rules, mapping text constituents to a logical representation, from annotated training data and applying them recursively to obtain the meaning representation.
    Adapting to new data is a major limitation of these approaches as they cannot handle inputs containing syntactic patterns which were not observed in the training data.
    For example, assume the training data produced the following set of parsing rules: Example 2 Typical parsing rules At test time the parser is given the sentences in Exampl
