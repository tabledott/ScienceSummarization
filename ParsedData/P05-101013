values of parameters.
    In the second set of experiments, we examined the relationship between model types and their parsing performances.
    In the third set of experiments, we compared the three parsing methods described in the previous section.
    Finally, we show the result of a parsing experiment using the standard test set.
    We used sections 2 through 20 of the Penn WSJ corpus as training data and section 21 as heldout data.
    The heldout data was used for early stopping; i.e., the estimation was stopped when the rate of increase in the likelihood of the heldout data became lower than a certain threshold.
    Section 22 was used as test data in all parsing experiments except in the final one, in which section 23 was used.
    We stripped off all function tags and eliminated empty nodes in the training and heldout data, but any other pre-processing, such as comma raising or base-NP marking (Collins, 1999), was not done except for binarizations.
