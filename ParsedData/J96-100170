elected points with integer non-negative coordinates where No is the number of &amp;quot;interesting&amp;quot; sentences in the corpus for the translation under consideration, that is, the number of sentences that contain at least one of X, A, or B.13 Sampling from this six-dimensional polytope in seven-dimensional space is not easy.
    We accomplish it by constructing a mapping from the uniform distribution to each allowed value for the n...'s, using combinatorial methods.
    For example, for No = 50, there are 3,478,761 different points with 11ABx = 0 but only one with nABX = 50.
    Using the above method, we sampled 20,000 points for each of several values for No (N0 = 50, 100, 500, and 1000).
    The results of the simulation were very similar for the different values of No, with no apparent pattern emerging as No increased.
    Therefore, in the following we give averages over the values of No tried.
    We first measured the percentage of missed valid translations when either A or B, or both, do not
