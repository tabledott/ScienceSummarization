sents the precise proba bilities under realistic assumptions.
			Tests such as the Chi-squared test or the log-likelihood-ratio test (yet another approximate test of significance) depend on asymptotic assumptions that are often not valid for small counts.
			Note that the count C(s?, t?)
			can be larger or smaller than c(s?, t?)
			discussed above.
			In most cases, it will be larger, because it counts all co-occurrences of s?
			with t?
			rather than just those that respect the word alignment.
			It can be smaller though because multiple co-occurrences can occur within a single aligned sentence pair and be counted multiple times in c(s?, t?).
			On the other hand, C(s?, t?)
			will not count all of the possible ways that an n,m-grammatch can occur within a single sentence pair; it will count the match only once per sentence pair in which it occurs.Moore (2004) discusses the use of significance testing of word associations using the log likelihood-ratio test and Fisher?s exact test.
			He shows that Fisher?
