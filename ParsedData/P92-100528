e of the principles of QLFbased description is that while interpretation instantiates referent fields in underspecified QLFs, description involves instantiating category and restriction fields for QLFs in which referent fields are already instantiated.
    The preference metrics applied to rank alternative interpretations can be applied equally well to ranking resolved QLFs produced by a nondeterministic description process, so there is a sense in which the preference mechanism can also be made reversible.
