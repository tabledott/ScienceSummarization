to occur in sentences marked with hedging cues.
    Work on hedging in the machine learning field has as a goal to classify sentences into speculative or definite (non speculative).
    Medlock and Briscoe (2007) provide a definition of what they consider to be hedge instances and define hedge classification as a weakly supervised machine learning task.
    The method they use to derive a learning model from a seed corpus is based on iteratively predicting labels for unlabeled training samples.
    They report experiments with SVMs on a dataset that they make publicly available1.
    The experiments achieve a recall/precision break even point (BEP) of 0.76.
    They apply a bag-of-words (BOG) approach to sample representation.
    Medlock (2008) presents an extension of this work by experimenting with more features (part-of-speech (PoS), lemmas, and bigrams).
    Experiments show that the PoS representation does not yield significant improvement over the results in Medlock and Briscoe (2007), whereas with a l
