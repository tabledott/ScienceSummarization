 of the word order information encoded in the slash directions of the lexical entries.
    For example, given the lexicon above, the sentence New York borders Vermont can be parsed to produce: where each step in the parse is labeled with the combinatory rule (&#8722; &gt; or &#8722; &lt;) that was used.
    CCG also includes combinatory rules of forward (&gt; B) and backward (&lt; B) composition: These rules provide for a relaxed notion of constituency which will be useful during learning as we reason about possible refinements of the grammar.
    We also allow vertical slashes in CCG categories, which act as wild cards.
    For example, with this extension the forward application combinator (&gt;) could be used to combine the category S/(S&#65533;NP) with any of S\NP, S/NP, or SNP.
    Figure 1 shows two parses where the composition combinators and vertical slashes are used.
    These parses closely resemble the types of analyses that will be possible under the grammars we learn in the experiments described
