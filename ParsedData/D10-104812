The intuition behind this heuristic is two-fold.
    First, early cluster mentions are usually better defined than subsequent ones, which are likely to have fewer modifiers or are pronouns (Fox, 1993).
    Several of our models use this modifier information.
    Second, by definition, first mentions appear closer to the beginning of the document, hence there are fewer antecedent candidates to select from, and fewer opportunities to make a mistake.
    Search Pruning &#8211; Finally, we prune the search space using discourse salience.
    We disable coreference for first cluster mentions that: (a) are or start with indefinite pronouns (e.g., some, other), or (b) start with indefinite articles (e.g., a, an).
    One exception to this rule is the model deployed in the first pass; it only links mentions if their entire extents match exactly.
    This model is triggered for all nominal mentions regardless of discourse salience, because it is possible that indefinite mentions are repeated in a document when concept
