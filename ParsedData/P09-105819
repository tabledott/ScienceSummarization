C08) generated CTB 3.0 from CTB 4.0.
    Jiang et al. (2008a; 2008b) (Jiang08a, Jiang08b) used CTB 5.0.
    Shi and Wang (2007) used CTB that was distributed in the SIGHAN Bakeoff.
    Besides CTB, they also used HowNet (Dong and Dong, 2006) to obtain semantic class features.
    Zhang and Clark (2008) indicated that their results cannot directly compare to the results of Shi and Wang (2007) due to different experimental settings.
    We decided to follow the experimental settings of Jiang et al. (2008a; 2008b) on CTB 5.0 and Zhang and Clark (2008) on CTB 4.0 since they reported the best performances on joint word segmentation and POS tagging using the training materials only derived from the corpora.
    The performance scores of previous studies are directly taken from their papers.
    We also conducted experiments using the system implemented by Nakagawa and Uchimoto (2007) (N&amp;U07) for comparison.
    Our experiment on the large training corpus is identical to that of Jiang et al. (Jiang et al., 2008a
