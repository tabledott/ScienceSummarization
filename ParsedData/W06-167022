1; is detected, although also &#8220;stand&#8221; has an entry in Wordnet.
    Then, each word identified in this way is assigned its most frequent sense &#8211; the only one available if the word is unambiguous.
    To reduce the number of candidate supersenses we distinguish between common and proper nouns; e.g.
    &#8220;Savannah&#8221; (city/river) is distinguished from &#8220;savannah&#8221; (grassland).
    This method improves slightly the accuracy of the baseline which does not distinguish between different types of nouns.
    Table 4 summarizes overall performance6.
    The first line shows the accuracy of a baseline which assigns possible supersenses of identified words at random.
    The second line shows the performance of the first sense baseline (cf.
    Section 5.3), the marked difference between the two is a measure of the robustness of the first sense heuristic.
    On the Semcor data the tagger improves over the baseline by 10.71%, 31.19% error reduction, while on Senseval-3 the tagger impr
