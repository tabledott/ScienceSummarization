 dependencies in CCGbank which do not appear in DepBank.
    Examples include any dependencies in which a punctuation mark is one of the arguments, and so we removed these from the output of the parser.
    We have made some attempt to fill the subtype slot for some GRs.
    The subtype slot specifies additional information about the GR; examples include the value obj in a passive ncsubj, indicating that the subject is an underlying object; the value num in ncmod, indicating a numerical quantity; and prt in ncmod to indicate a verb particle.
    The passive case is identified as follows: Any lexical category which starts S[pss]\NP indicates a passive verb, and we also mark any verbs POS tagged VBN and assigned the lexical category N/N as passive.
    Both these rules have high precision, but still leave many of the cases in DepBank unidentified.
    Many of those remaining are POS tagged JJ and assigned the lexical category N/N, but this is also true of many non-passive modifiers, so we did not attempt to ext
