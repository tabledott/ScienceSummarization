the inside probability by the outside probability, and normalize.
    This product would give us the overall probability that the node is part of the correct parse.
    Unfortunately, there is no good way to quickly compute the outside probability of a node during bottom-up chart parsing (although it can be efficiently computed afterwards).
    Thus, we instead multiply the inside probability simply by the prior probability of the nonterminal type, P(X), which is an approximation to the outside probability.
    Our final thresholding measure is P(X)x)3(Nfk).
    In Section 7.4, we will show experiments comparing insideprobability beam thresholding to beam thresholding using the inside probability times the prior.
    Using the prior can lead to a speedup of up to a factor of 10, at the same performance level.
    To the best of our knowledge, using the prior probability in beam thresholding is new, although not particularly insightful on our part.
