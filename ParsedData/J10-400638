or of (sergeant, gun) is highly similar to that of (teacher, book).
    Crucially, as can be seen in Table 3, the corpus-derived scores that populate the vectors in these two spaces are exactly the same, just arranged in different ways.
    In DM, attributional and relational similarity spaces are different views of the same underlying tuple structure.
    The other two distinct spaces generated by tensor matricization look less familiar, and yet we argue that they allow us to subsume under the same general DM framework other interesting semantic phenomena.
    We will show in Section 6.3 how the W1LxW2 space can be used to capture different verb classes based on the argument alternations they display.
    For instance, this space can be used to find out that the object slot of kill is more similar to the subject slot of die than to the subject slot of kill (and, generalizing from similar observations, that the subject slot of die is a theme rather than an agent).
    The LxW1W2 space displays similarities am
