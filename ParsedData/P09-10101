nstructions to a sequence of executable actions would enable the automation of tasks that currently require human participation.
    Examples include configuring software based on how-to guides and operating simulators using instruction manuals.
    In this paper, we present a reinforcement learning framework for inducing mappings from text to actions without the need for annotated training examples.
    For concreteness, consider instructions from a Windows troubleshooting guide on deleting temporary folders, shown in Figure 1.
    We aim to map this text to the corresponding low-level commands and parameters.
    For example, properly interpreting the third instruction requires clicking on a tab, finding the appropriate option in a tree control, and clearing its associated checkbox.
    In this and many other applications, the validity of a mapping can be verified by executing the induced actions in the corresponding environment and observing their effects.
    For instance, in the example above we can asse
