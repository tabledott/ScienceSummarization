e relation that holds between c1 and c2 and r?
  is its inverse (i.e., the relation that holds between c2 and c1).
  Finally, the semantic distance between two arbitrary nodes ci and cj is the sum of the distances between the pairs of adjacent nodes along the shortest path connecting them.
  2.5.2 Wu and Palmer?s Conceptual Similarity.
  In a paper on translating English verbs into Mandarin Chinese, Wu and Palmer (1994) introduce a scaled metric for what they call conceptual similarity between a pair of concepts c1 and c2 in a hierarchy as simWP(c1, c2) = 2 ?
  depth(lso(c1, c2)) len(c1, lso(c1, c2)) + len(c2, lso(c1, c2)) + 2 ?
  depth(lso(c1, c2)) (5) Note that depth(lso(c1, c2)) is the ?global?
  depth in the hierarchy; its role as a scaling factor can be seen more clearly if we recast equation 5 from similarity into distance: distWP(c1, c2) = 1 ?
  simWP(c1, c2) = len(c1, lso(c1, c2)) + len(c2, lso(c1, c2)) len(c1, lso(c1, c2)) + len(c2, lso(c1, c2)) + 2 ?
