l derivation structures.
    Figures 2 and 4 illustrate the permutations these operators make to derivation trees.
    The omitted tree structure in these figures denotes the Markov blanket of the operator: the structure which is held constant when enumerating the possible outcomes for an operator.
    The Split/Join operator iterates through the positions between each source word sampling whether a terminal boundary should exist at that position (Figure 2).
    If the source position adjacent nodes in a ternary rule can be re-parented as a binary rule, or vice-versa. falls between two existing terminals whose target phrases are adjacent, then any new target segmentation within those target phrases can be sampled, including null alignments.
    If the two existing terminals also share the same parent, then any possible re-ordering is also a valid outcome, as is removing the terminal boundary to form a single phrase pair.
    Otherwise, if the visited boundary point falls within an existing terminal, then all
