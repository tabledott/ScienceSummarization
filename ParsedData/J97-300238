 unsuitable sentence-pairs.
    If the lengths of the pair of sentences differed by more than a 2:1 ratio, the pair was rejected; such a difference usually arises as the result of an earlier error in automatic sentence alignment.
    Sentences containing more than one word absent from the translation lexicon were also rejected; the bracketing method is not intended to be robust against lexicon inadequacies.
    We also rejected sentence-pairs with fewer than two matching words, since this gives the bracketing algorithm no discriminative leverage; such pairs accounted for less than 2% of the input data.
    A random sample of the bracketed sentence-pairs was then drawn, and the bracket precision was computed under each criterion for correctness.
    Examples are shown in Figure 11.
    The bracket precision was 80% for the English sentences, and 78% for the Chinese sentences, as judged against manual bracketings.
    Inspection showed the errors to be due largely to imperfections of our translation lexicon, wh
