indicate the binned difference in length (in terms of number of preterminals dominated) in adjacent conjuncts in the same coordinated structures, conjoined with a boolean flag that indicates whether the pair is final in the coordinated phrase.
    RightBranch (2) This schema enables the reranker to prefer right-branching trees.
    One instance of this schema returns the number of nonterminal nodes that lie on the path from the root node to the right-most non-punctuation preterminal node, and the other instance of this schema counts the number of the other nonterminal nodes in the parse tree.
    Heavy (1049) This schema classifies nodes by their category, their binned length (i.e., the number of preterminals they dominate), whether they are at the end of the sentence and whether they are followed by punctuation.
    Neighbours (38,245) This schema classifies nodes by their category, their binned length, and the part of speech categories of the E1 preterminals to the node&#8217;s left and the $2 preterminals
