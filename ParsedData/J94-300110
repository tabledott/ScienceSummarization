set of simple operations, each of which implements a simple mathematical fact about regular languages, regular relations, or both.
    Second, our more abstract perspective provides a general framework within which to treat other phonological formalisms, existing or yet to be devised.
    For example, two-level morphology (Koskenniemi 1983), which evolved from our early considerations of rewriting rules, relies for its analysis and implementation on the same algebraic techniques.
    We are also encouraged by initial successes in adapting these techniques to the autosegmental formalism described by Kay (1987).
  
  
    Supposing for the moment that Rule 2 (N n) is optional, Figure 1 shows the transition diagram of a finite-state transducer that models it.
    A finite-state transducer has two tapes.
    A transition can be taken if the two symbols separated by the colon in its label are found at the current position on the corresponding tapes, and the current position advances across those tape symbols.
