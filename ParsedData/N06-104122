that end of sentence punctuation tends to indicate the end of a field and the beginning of a new one.
    Grenager et al. (2005) experiment with manually adding boundary states and biasing transitions from these states to not self-loop.
    We capture this &#8220;boundary&#8221; effect by simply adding a line to our protoype-list, adding a new BOUNDARY state (see figure 2) with a few (hand-chosen) prototypes.
    Since we utilize a trigram tagger, we are able to naturally capture the effect that the BOUNDARY tokens typically indicate transitions between the fields before and after the boundary token.
    As a post-processing step, when a token is tagged as a BOUNDARY
  
  
    token it is given the same label as the previous non-BOUNDARY token, which reflects the annotational convention that boundary tokens are given the same label as the field they terminate.
    Adding the BOUNDARY label yields significant improvements, as indicated by the PROTO+SIM+BOUND setting in Table 5.3, surpassing the best unsupervis
