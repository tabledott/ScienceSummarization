 across different parts of speech and words that tend to appear more frequently in metaphoric, metonymic, and other nonliteral usages (e.g., bank vs. head).
    More seriously, the criteria for evaluating the correctness of sense assignment vary.
    Different studies employ different degrees of sense granularity (see Section 3.2 above), ranging from identification of homographs to fine sense distinctions.
    In addition, the means by which correct sense assignment is finally judged are typically unclear.
    Human judges must ultimately decide, but the lack of agreement among human judges is well documented: Amsler and White (1979) indicate that while there is reasonable consistency in sense assignment for a given expert on successive sense assignments (84%), agreement is significantly lower among experts.
    Ahlswede (1995) reports between 63.3% and 90.2% agreement among judges on his Ambiguity Questionnaire; when faced with on-line sense assignment in a large corpus, agreement among judges is far less, a
