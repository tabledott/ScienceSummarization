ility of generating Y as the left-corner of X with n - 1 intermediate nonterminals.
    Certainly .13'1&amp;quot;(X, Y) is bounded above by the probability that the entire derivation starting at X terminates after n steps, since a derivation couldn't terminate without expanding the left-most symbol to a terminal (as opposed to a nonterminal).
    But that probability tends to 0 as n oo, and hence so must each entry in P. For the unit production matrix Pu a similar argument applies, since the length of a derivation is at least as long as it takes to terminate any initial unit production chain.
    If G is a proper, consistent SCFG without useless nonterminals, then the series for RL and Ru as defined above converge to finite, non-negative values.
    PI converging to 0 implies that the magnitude of PL's largest eigenvalue (its spectral radius) is &lt; 1, which in turn implies that the series E,`&amp;quot;f 0 13'L converges (similarly for Pu).
    The elements of RL and Ru are non-negative since they are the re
