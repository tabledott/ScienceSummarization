t-reduce parsing algorithm, and re lies on a stack (S) of foreign substrings that have already been translated.
			Each time the decoder adds a new block to the current translation hypothesis, it shifts the source-language indices of the block ontoS, then repeatedly tries reducing the top two ele ments of S if they are contiguous.4 This parsingalgorithm was first applied in computational geome try to identify convex hulls (Graham, 1972), and its running time was shown to be linear in the length of the sequence (a proof is presented in (Huang et al., 2008), which applies the same algorithm to the binarization of SCFG rules).
			Figure 3 provides an example of the execution of this algorithm for the translation output shownin Figure 4, which was produced by a decoder in corporating our hierarchical reordering model.
			The decoder successively pushes source-language spans [1], [2], [3], which are successively merged into [1-3], and all correspond to monotone orientations.3We would like to point out an inconsist
