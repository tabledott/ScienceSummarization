l that two trials are significantly different from each other we used the Central Limit Theorem for Bernoulli trials (Grinstead and Snell, 1997), assuming that the recall rates from the various trials represents the probability that a word will be successfully identified, and that a binomial distribution is appropriate for the experiment.
