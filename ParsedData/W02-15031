ages are structured by similar underlying principles.
    Within LFG, f-structures are meant to encode a language universal level of analysis, allowing for crosslinguistic parallelism at this level of abstraction.
    Although the construction of c-structures is governed by general wellformedness principles, this level of analysis encodes language particular differences in linear word order, surface morphological vs. syntactic structures, and constituency.
    The ParGram project aims to test the LFG formalism for its universality and coverage limitations and to see how far parallelism can be maintained across languages.
    Where possible, the analyses produced by the grammars for similar constructions in each language are parallel.
    This has the computational advantage that the grammars can be used in similar applications and that machine translation (Frank, 1999) can be simplified.
    The results of the project to date are encouraging.
    Despite differences between the languages involved and the aims
