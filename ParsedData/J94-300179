 not necessarily provide a singleton output string.
    If the language V) contains more than one string, then outputs will be produced for each of these at each application site.
    Moreover, if 0 contains strings that are suffixes or prefixes (depending on the direction of application) of other strings in 0, then alternatives will be produced for each length of match.
    A particular formalism may specify how such ambiguities are to be resolved, and these stipulations would be modeled by additional restrictions in our formulation.
    For example, the requirement that only shortest 0 matches are rewritten could be imposed by ignoring only one of &lt; or &gt; in the mapping part of Replace, depending on the direction of application.
    There are different formulations for the obligatory application of simultaneous rules, also depending on how competition between overlapping application sites is to be resolved.
    Intersecting the two obligatory filters, as in the following cascade, models the case where
