the UN corpus to translate the English part of the EP data to generate the synthetic &#175;SE-EP corpus.
    Again, any in-domain data were exploited to train this sytem.
    Of course, this system cannot be compared with any other because of the different translation direction.
    In order to compare reported performance with the state-of-the-art, Table 2 also reports results of the best system published in the EuroMatrix project website6 and of the Google online translation engine.7 It is well-known that tuning the SMT system is fundamental to achieve good performance.
    The standard tuning procedure consists of a minimum error rate training (mert) (Och and Ney, 2003) which relies on the availability of a development data set.
    On the other hand, the most important assumption we make is that almost no parallel indomain data are available. the tuning process and BLEU score achieved on the test set by the uniform interpolation weights (first row), and by the optimal weights with different configurations
