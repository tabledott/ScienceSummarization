logical Transformation (MorphTrans) similarity model increases in relative weight as it becomes better trained.
    Table 8 demonstrates the combined measures in action, showing the relative rankings of candidate roots for the inflections took, shook and juegan by the four similarity models after the first iteration (in Columns 2-4).
    The overall consensus similarity measure at the end of Iteration 1 is shown in Column 1.7 Note that even though only one of the four estimators independently ranked shake as the most likely root of shook, after only the first iteration the consensus choice is correct.
    The final column of Table 8 shows the retrained MorphTrans similarity measure after convergence.
    Based on training evidence from the confidently aligned pairs took/take, shook/shake and undertook/undertake from previous iterations, the probability of ake&#8212;xook has increased significantly, further increasing the confidence in the overall alignments at convergence (not shown), but not changing the pre
