ing whether a mention refers to a specific entity or a generic entity requires knowledge of substantially wider context than the window of 5 tokens we currently use in our mention detection systems.
    One way we plan to improve performance for such cases is to separate the task into two parts: one in which the mention type and level are predicted, followed by a genericitypredicting model which uses long-range features, such as sentence or document level features.
    Our entity tracking system currently cannot resolve the coreference of pronouns very accurately.
    Although this is weighted lightly in ACE evaluation, good anaphora resolution can be very useful in many applications and we will continue exploring this task in the future.
    The Arabic and Chinese EDT tasks were included in the ACE evaluation for the first time in 2003.
    Unlike the English case, the systems had access to only a small amount of training data (60k words for Arabic and 90k characters for Chinese, in contrast with 340k words
