gger is a system that uses context to assign parts of speech to words.
    Automatic text tagging is an important first step in discovering the linguistic structure of large text corpora.
    Part-of-speech information facilitates higher-level analysis, such as recognizing noun phrases and other patterns in text.
    For a tagger to function as a practical component in a language processing system, we believe that a tagger must be: Robust Text corpora contain ungrammatical constructions, isolated phrases (such as titles), and nonlinguistic data (such as tables).
    Corpora are also likely to contain words that are unknown to the tagger.
    It is desirable that a tagger deal gracefully with these situations.
    Efficient If a tagger is to be used to analyze arbitrarily large corpora, it must be efficient&#8212;performing in time linear in the number of words tagged.
    Any training required should also be fast, enabling rapid turnaround with new corpora and new text genres.
    Accurate A tagger should att
