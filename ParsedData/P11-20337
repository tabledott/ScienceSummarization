used together with each action to give a score to the local decision.
    Unigram information for S0h, S0l, S0r and N0l The head, left/rightmost modifiers of S0 and the leftmost modifier of N0 have been used by most arc-eager transition-based parsers we are aware of through the combination of their POS-tag with information from S0 and N0.
    Such use is exemplified by the feature templates &#8220;from three words&#8221; in Table 1.
    We further use their word and POS-tag information as &#8220;unigram&#8221; features in Table 2.
    Moreover, we include the dependency label information in the unigram features, represented by l in the table.
    Unigram label information has been used in MaltParser (Nivre et al., 2006a; Nivre, 2006).
    Third-order features of S0 and N0 Higher-order context features have been used by graph-based dependency parsers to improve accuracies (Carreras, 2007; Koo and Collins, 2010).
    We include information of third order dependency arcs in our new feature templates, when availa
