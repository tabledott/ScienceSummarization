.4 and 23.1, but not between phrases 23.1 and 23.2.
    Table 4 shows the average performance of the pause algorithm for statistically validated boundaries at the .0001 level (those boundaries proposed by at least four subjects).
    Recall is 92% (a = .008; max = 1; min = .73), precision is 18% (a = .002; max = .25; min = .09), fallout is 54% (a = .004; max = .65; min = .45), and error is 49% (a = .004 max .61; min = .41).
    Our algorithm thus performs with recall higher than human performance.'
    However, precision is low, and both fallout and error are quite high.
    The summed deviation metric, which takes all the metrics into account, shows that on the whole performance is considerably worse than humans.
    4.2.2 Cue Words.
    Cue words (e.g., now) are words that are sometimes used to explicitly signal the structure of a discourse.
    Hirschberg and Litman (1993) examined a large set of cue words proposed in the literature and showed that certain prosodic and structural features, including a posi
