Although the performance with L.&#172;app sets is still poorer than with L.app sets, the JESS-CM results indicate that the introduction of unlabeled data effectively improves the performance of L.&#172;app sets, even more than that of L.app sets.
    These improvements are essentially very important; when a tagger and chunker are actually used, input data can be obtained from anywhere and this may mostly include words that do not appear in the given labeled training data since the labeled training data is limited and difficult to increase.
    This means that the improved performance of L.&#172;app can link directly to actual use.
    Table 5 also shows the ratios of sentences that are constructed from words that all appeared in the 1G-word Unlabeled data used in our experiments (U.app) in the L.&#172;app and L.app.
    This indicates that most of the words in the development or test sets are covered by the 1G-word unlabeled data.
    This may be the main reason for JESS-CM providing large performance gains f
