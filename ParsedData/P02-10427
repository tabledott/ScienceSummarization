o apply generative modelling techniques (Abney, 1997; Johnson et al., 1999), so we have defined a conditional model, similar to the model of Collins (1996) (see also the conditional model in Eisner (1996b)).
    While the model of Collins (1996) is technically unsound (Collins, 1999), our aim at this stage is to demonstrate that accurate, efficient wide-coverage parsing is possible with CCG, even with an over-simplified statistical model.
    Future work will look at alternative models.4 4The reentrancies creating the DAG-like structures are fairly limited, and moreover determined by the lexical categories.
    We conjecture that it is possible to define a generative model that includes the deep dependencies.
    The parse selection component must choose the most probable dependency structure, given the sentence S. A sentence S w1t1 w2t2 wntn is assumed to be a sequence of word, pos-tag pairs.
    For our purposes, a dependency structure n is a C D pair, where C c1 c2 cn is the sequence of categories assigned
