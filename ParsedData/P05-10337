ences in &#947; and nonterminal occurrences in &#945;. Rewriting begins with a pair of linked start symbols.
    At each step, two coindexed nonterminals are rewritten using the two components of a single rule, such that none of the newly introduced symbols is linked to any symbols already present.
    Thus the hierarchical phrase pairs from our above example could be formalized in a synchronous CFG as: where we have used boxed indices to indicate which occurrences of X are linked by &#8212;.
    Note that we have used only a single nonterminal symbol X instead of assigning syntactic categories to phrases.
    In the grammar we extract from a bitext (described below), all of our rules use only X, except for two special &#8220;glue&#8221; rules, which combine a sequence of Xs to form an S: These give the model the option to build only partial translations using hierarchical phrases, and then combine them serially as in a standard phrase-based model.
