approaches for natural language problems require a relatively large amount of supervision, in the form of labeled training examples.
    Recent results (e.g., (Yarowsky 95; Brill 95; Blum and Mitchell 98)) have suggested that unlabeled data can be used quite profitably in reducing the need for supervision.
    This paper discusses the use of unlabeled examples for the problem of named entity classification.
    The task is to learn a function from an input string (proper name) to its type, which we will assume to be one of the categories Person, Organization, or Location.
    For example, a good classifier would identify Mrs. Frank as a person, Steptoe &amp; Johnson as a company, and Honduras as a location.
    The approach uses both spelling and contextual rules.
    A spelling rule might be a simple look-up for the string (e.g., a rule that Honduras is a location) or a rule that looks at words within a string (e.g., a rule that any string containing Mr. is a person).
    A contextual rule considers words su
