lue of the objective function is then given by the recurrence relation, B(t) = maxt,&lt;t B(t')b(t'+1, t), with the base case B(0) = 1.
    These values can be stored in a table of size T (equal to the number of sentences); this admits a dynamic program that performs inference in polynomial time.3 If the number of segments is specified in advance, the dynamic program is slightly more complex, with a table of size TK.
    The Dirichlet compound multinomial integrates over language models, but we must still set the prior &#952;0.
    We can re-estimate this prior based on the observed data by interleaving gradient-based search in a Viterbi expectation-maximization framework (Gauvain and Lee, 1994).
    In the E-step, we estimate a segmentation z&#65533; of the dataset, as described in Section 3.3.
    In the M-step, we maximize p(&#952;0|X, z) &#8733; p(X|&#952;0, z)p(&#952;0).
    Assuming a non-informative hyperprior p(&#952;0), we maximize the likelihood in Equation 7 across all documents.
