 is united with a top-down prediction, so the &#945; value of the complete-ee is multiplied by the y value of the complete-er.
    Important technical problems involving leftrecursive and unit productions are examined and overcome in (Stolcke, 1995).
    However, these complications do not add any further machinery to the parsing algorithm per se beyond the grammar rules and the dot-moving conventions: in particular, there are no heuristic parsing principles or intermediate structures that are later destroyed.
    In this respect the algorithm observes strong competence &#8211; principle 1.
    In virtue of being a probabilistic parser it observes principle 2.
    Finally, in the sense that predict and complete each apply exhaustively at each new input word, the algorithm is eager, satisfying principle 3.
  
  
    Psycholinguistic theories vary regarding the amount bandwidth they attribute to the human sentence processing mechanism.
    Theories of initial parsing preferences (Fodor and Ferreira, 1998) sugge
