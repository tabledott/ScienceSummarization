lso finds that using document boundaries is more useful than ignoring document boundaries, as is done in some hypertext systems, and that premarked sectional information, if available and not too long, is an appropriate unit for display.)
    Tombaugh, Lickorish, and Wright (1987) explore issues relating to ease of readability of long texts on CRT screens.
    Their study explores the usefulness of multiple windows for organizing the contents of long texts, hypothesizing that providing readers with spatial cues about the location of portions of previously read texts will aid in their recall of the information and their ability to quickly locate information that has already been read once.
    In the experiment, the text is divided using premarked sectional information, and one section is placed in each window.
    They conclude that segmenting the text by means of multiple windows can be very helpful if readers are familiar with the mechanisms supplied for manipulating the display.
