pose strong independence assumptions between features, making it very difficult to incorporate non-independent features over the sentence pairs.
    For instance, as well as detecting that a source word is aligned to a given target word, we would also like to encode syntactic and lexical features of the word pair, such as their partsof-speech, affixes, lemmas, etc.
    Features such as these would allow for more effective use of sparse data and result in a model which is more robust in the presence of unseen words.
    Adding these non-independent features to a generative model requires that the features&#8217; inter-dependence be modelled explicitly, which often complicates the model (eg.
    Toutanova et al. (2002)).
    Secondly, the later IBM models, such as Model 4, have to resort to heuristic search techniques to approximate forward-backward and Viterbi inference, which sacrifice optimality for tractability.
    This paper presents an alternative discriminative method for word alignment.
    We use a co
