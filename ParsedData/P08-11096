    Our conditional random field CFG (CRF-CFG) instead defines local clique potentials &#966;(r|s;&#952;), where s is the sentence, and r contains a one-level subtree of a tree t, corresponding to a rule &#961;, along with relevant information about the span of words which it encompasses, and, if applicable, the split position (see Figure 1).
    These potentials are relative to the sentence, unlike a PCFG where rule scores do not have access to words at the leaves of the tree, or even how many words they dominate.
    We then define a conditional probability distribution over entire trees, using the standard CRF distribution, shown in (1).
    There is, however, an important subtlety lurking in how we define the partition function.
    The partition function Zs, which makes the probability of all possible parses sum to unity, is defined over all structures as well as all labelings of those structures.
    We define &#964;(s) to be the set of all possible parse trees for th
