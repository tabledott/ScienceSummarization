t, an average pairwise kappa score of 0.80 for the 85% of the test set for which the annotators were somewhat sure of their judgments, and an average pairwise kappa score of 0.88 for the 70% of the test set for which the annotators were very sure of their judgments.
    We later asked the same annotators to identify the subjective elements in WSJSE.
    Specifically, each annotator was given the subjective sentences he identified in the previous study and asked to put brackets around the words he believed caused the sentence to be classified as subjective.2 For example (subjective elements are in parentheses): They paid (yet) more for (really good stuff).
    (Perhaps you&#8217;ll forgive me) for reposting his response.
    No other instructions were given to the annotators and no training was performed for the expression-level task.
    A single round of tagging was performed, with no communication between annotators.
    There are techniques for analyzing agreement when annotations involve segment boundarie
