rrelation coefficients for the Rs.
  They are the r12s found in section 2.1.
  As that section mentions, the r12s fbund are just about always positive.
  So at least in our experiments, the Rs are not ill- dependent, but are positively correlated, which violates the assumptions of the test.
  An example of how this test behaves is the following comparison of the precision of two dif- ferent methods at finding the modifier elations using tile stone training and test set.
  The corm- lation coefficient estilnate tor R is 0.35 mid the data is Method 17, 5 t?recision 1 47 48 4!
  )% 2 25 14 64% Placing the l~, and S values into a 2 x 2 table leads to a X 2 value of 2.38. a At t degree of freedom, tile X 2 tables indicate that if the null hypothesis were true, there would 1)e a 10% to 20% chance of producing a X 2 value at least this large.
  So according to this test, this nnlch of an observed difference in precision wouht not be unusual if no actual differ(,ncc in the precision exists between the two nw, thods.
