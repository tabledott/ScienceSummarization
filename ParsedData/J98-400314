e these must be solved by dictionary Alignments between English and Japanese sound sequences, as determined by EM training.
    Best alignments are shown for the English words biscuit, divider, and filter. lookup anyway.
    Only two pairs failed to align when we wished they had&#8212;both involved turning English Y UW into Japanese u, as in ((Y UW K AH L EY L 1Y) +-4 (u k urere)).
    Note also that our model translates each English sound without regard to context.
    We have also built context-based models, using decision trees recoded as WFSTs.
    For example, at the end of a word, English T is likely to come out as (t o) rather than (t).
    However, context-based models proved unnecessary for back-transliteration.
    They are more useful for English-to-Japanese forward transliteration.
    To map Japanese sound sequences like (m o ot a a) onto katakana sequences like ), we manually constructed two WFSTs.
    Composed together, they yield an integrated WFST with 53 states and 303 arcs, producing a kata
