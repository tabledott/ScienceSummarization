ons must hold: (2.3a) Is the salt near you?
    (2.3b) John asked me to ask you to pass the salt.
    GL's postulates directly relate the literal form of one speech act to the indirect form of another.
    Thus they do not predict why certain acts allow certain indirect forms.
    For example, the postulates do not account for why 2.3c-d can be requests while 2.3e-f cannot.
    But 2.3e is infelicitous as a (literal) question since there is no context where one can acquire information by querying one's own mental state.
    Utterance 2.3f is a reasonable question but even if the speaker found out the answer, it would not get him any closer to acquiring the salt (by having the hearer pass it).
    A theory of indirect speech acts should capture these facts; GL's does not (although they agree it should).
    Similarly, GL's postulates fail to explain the relation between indirect forms of different speech acts.
    For example, 2.3g can be an assertion that P and 2.3h cannot, for the same reasons that 2.3i can
