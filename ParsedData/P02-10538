&#8220;excellent&#8221; and &#8220;poor&#8221; were chosen because, in the five star review rating system, it is common to define one star as &#8220;poor&#8221; and five stars as &#8220;excellent&#8221;.
    SO is positive when phrase is more strongly associated with &#8220;excellent&#8221; and negative when phrase is more strongly associated with &#8220;poor&#8221;.
    PMI-IR estimates PMI by issuing queries to a search engine (hence the IR in PMI-IR) and noting the number of hits (matching documents).
    The following experiments use the AltaVista Advanced Search engine5, which indexes approximately 350 million web pages (counting only those pages that are in English).
    I chose AltaVista because it has a NEAR operator.
    The AltaVista NEAR operator constrains the search to documents that contain the words within ten words of one another, in either order.
    Previous work has shown that NEAR performs better than AND when measuring the strength of semantic association between words (Turney, 2001).
