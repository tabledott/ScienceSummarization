o choose independence assumptions which might bias our results.
    Each complete parsing system we propose consists of three components, a probability model for sequences of parser decisions, a Simple Synchrony Network which estimates the parameters of the probability model, and a procedure which searches for the most probable parse given these parameter estimates.
    This paper outlines each of these components, but more details can be found in (Henderson, 2003b), and, for the discriminative model, in (Henderson, 2003a).
    We also present the training methods, and experiments on the proposed parsing models.
  
  
    As with many previous statistical parsers (Ratnaparkhi, 1999; Collins, 1999; Charniak, 2000), we use a history-based model of parsing.
    Designing a history-based model of parsing involves two steps, first choosing a mapping from the set of phrase structure trees to the set of parses, and then choosing a probability model in which the probability of each parser decision is conditioned on t
