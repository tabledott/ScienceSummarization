 between subject domain and sense makes it likely that a fully accurate 'static' subcategorization dictionary of a language is unattainable in any case.
    Moreover, although Schabes (1992) and others have proposed `lexicalized' probabilistic grammars to improve the accuracy of parse ranking, no wide-coverage parser has yet been constructed incorporating probabilities of different subcategorizations for individual predicates, because of the problems of accurately estimating them.
    These problems suggest that automatic construction or updating of subcategorization dictionaries from textual corpora is a more promising avenue to pursue.
    Preliminary experiments acquiring a few verbal subcategorization classes have been reported by Brent (1991, 1993), Manning (1993), and Ushioda et at.
    (1993).
    In these experiments the maximum number of distinct subcategorization classes recognized is sixteen, and only Ushioda et at. attempt to derive relative subcategorization frequency for individual predicates.
