  Domain Adaptation with Active Learning for Word Sense Disambiguation
  
    When a word sense disambiguation (WSD) system is trained on one domain but applied to a different domain, a drop in accuracy is frequently observed.
    This highlights the importance of domain adaptation for word sense disambiguation.
    In this paper, we first show that an active learning approach can be successfully used to perform domain adaptation of WSD systems.
    Then, by using the predominant sense predicted by expectation-maximization (EM) and adopting a count-merging technique, we improve the effectiveness of the original adaptation process achieved by the basic active learning approach.
  
  
    In natural language, a word often assumes different meanings, and the task of determining the correct meaning, or sense, of a word in different contexts is known as word sense disambiguation (WSD).
    To date, the best performing systems in WSD use a corpus-based, supervised learning approach.
    With this approach, one wou
