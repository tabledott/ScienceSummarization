  (s) denote the set of entities that are known to have a surface form s. For example, recalling Figure 1, Colombia (the country) and Columbia University are entities that are known to have the surface form ?Columbia?.

  ?&lt; ,  denotes the scalar product of vectors.
  Note that the quality of an assignment of an entity to a surface form depends on all the other assign- ments made, which makes this a difficult optimiza- tion problem.

  (2) Indeed, using the definition of d and partitioning the context and category components, we can re- write the sum in equation (2) as ( ) (q.e.d.)
