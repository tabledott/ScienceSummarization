  The final evaluation results of Task 1 are shown in Table 5.
    The results on the five event types involving only a single primary theme argument are shown in one merged class, &#8220;Simple Event&#8221;.
    The broad performance range (31%&#8211;70%) indicates even the extraction of simple events is not a trivial task.
    However, the top-ranked systems show encouraging performance, achieving or approaching 70% f-score.
    The performance ranges for Binding (5%&#8211;44%) and Regulation (1%&#8211;40%) events show their extraction to be clearly more challenging.
    It is interesting that while most systems show better performance for binding over regulation events, the systems [ConcordU] and [UT+DBCLS] are better for regulation, showing somewhat reduced performance for Binding events.
    This is in particular contrast to the following two systems, [ViBGhent] and [UTokyo], which show far better performance for Binding than Regulation events.
    As one possible explanation, we find that the latter two
