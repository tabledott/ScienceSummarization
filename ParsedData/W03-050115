gy has outpaced state laws The second type of iterative shortening is the removal of preposed adjuncts.
    The motivation for this type of shortening is that all of the human-generated headlines ignored what we refer to as the preamble of the story.
    Assuming the Projection principle has been satisfied, the preamble is viewed as the phrasal material occurring before the subject of the sentence.
    Thus, adjuncts are identified linguistically as any XP unit preceding the first NP (the subject) under the S chosen by step 1.
    This type of phrasal modifier is invisible to the XP-over-XP rule, which deletes material under a node only if it dominates another node of the same phrasal category.
    The impact of this type of shortening can be seen in the following example: Parse: [S [PP According to a now-finalized blueprint described by U.S. officials and other sources] [Det the] Bush administration plans to take complete, unilateral control of [Det a] postSaddam Hussein Iraq ] Output of Preposed Adjunct Rem
