 translation metrics as follows: Given a source sentence, its machine translations, and its reference translations, we compute the average rank of the reference translations within the combined machine and reference translation list.
			For example, a statistical machine translation system such as ISI?s AlTemp SMT system (Och 2003) can generate a list of n-best alternative translations given a source sentence.
			We compute the automatic scores for the n-best translations and their reference translations.
			We then rank these translations, calculate the average rank of the references in the n-best list, and compute the ratio of the average reference rank to the length of the n-best list.
			We call this ratio ?ORANGE?
			(Oracle1 Ranking for Gisting Evaluation) and the smaller the ratio is, the better the automatic metric is. There are several advantages of the proposed ORANGE evaluation method: ? No extra human involvement ? ORANGE uses the existing human references but not human evaluations.
