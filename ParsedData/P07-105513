duct:NN, a:DT *:JJ *:NN, etc.
    Each predicate, p, is then conjoined with the label information to construct a binary feature.
    For example, if the sentence label set is Y(s) = {subj, obj} and the document set is Y(d) = {pos, neg}, then the system might contain the following feature, { 1 if p E P(si) and y!
    = obj and ysi = subj and yd = neg 0 otherwise Where f(j) is the jth dimension of the feature space.
    For each feature, a set of back-off features are included that only consider the document label yd, the current sentence label ysi , the current sentence and document label ysi and yd, and the current and previous sentence labels ysi and ysi&#65533;1.
    Note that through these back-off features the joint models feature set will subsume the feature set of any individual level model.
    Only features observed in the training data were considered.
    Depending on the data set, the dimension of the feature vector f ranged from 350K to 500K.
    Though the feature vectors can be sparse, the featu
