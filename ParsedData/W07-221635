ity constraints and horizontal/vertical edge Markovization, both of which incorporate information unavailable to an edgefactored model.
    The hardness results provided here are also of interest since both arity constraints and Markovization can be incorporated efficiently in the projective case through the straight-forward augmentation of the underlying chart parsing algorithms used in the projective edge-factored models.
    This highlights a fundamental difference between the nature of projective parsing algorithms and nonprojective parsing algorithms.
    On the projective side, all algorithms use a bottom-up chart parsing framework to search the space of nested constructions.
    On the non-projective side, algorithms are either greedy-recursive in nature (i.e., the Chu-LiuEdmonds algorithm) or based on the calculation of the determinant of a matrix (i.e., the partition function and edge expectations).
    Thus, the existence of bottom-up chart parsing algorithms for projective dependency parsing provid
