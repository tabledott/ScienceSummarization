 state-of-the-art technologies are Katz's (1987) backoff method and Jelinek and Mercer's (1980) interpolation method.
    Both use P(v) to estimate P(v In) when (n, v) is unseen, essentially ignoring the identity of n. An alternative approach is distance-weighted averaging, which arrives at an estimate for unseen cooccurrences by combining estimates for where S(n) is a set of candidate similar words and sim(n, m) is a function of the similarity between n and m. We focus on distributional rather than semantic similarity (e.g., Resnik (1995)) because the goal of distance-weighted averaging is to smooth probability distributions &#8212; although the words &amp;quot;chance&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;probability&amp;quot; are synonyms, the former may not be a good model for predicting what cooccurrences the latter is likely to participate in.
    There are many plausible measures of distributional similarity.
    In previous work (Dagan et al., 1999), we compared the performance of three different functions: the Jens
