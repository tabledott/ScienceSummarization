d accuracy on English at 68.8%.
    Our method also outperforms this approach, without employing lexicalization and sophisticated smoothing as they do.
    This result suggests that combining the complementary strengths of their approach and ours dency rules on English and Spanish.
    For each rule, we evaluate the model using the ruleset excluding that rule, and list the most significant rules for each language.
    The second last column is the absolute loss in performance compared to the setting where all rules are available.
    The last column shows the percentage of the gold dependencies that satisfy the rule. can yield further performance improvements.
    Table 4 also shows the No-Split results where syntactic categories are not refined.
    We find that such refinement usually proves to be beneficial, yielding an average performance gain of 3.7%.
    However, we note that the impact of incorporating splitting varies significantly across languages.
    Further understanding of this connection is an a
