rizes how the 100 AVMs representing each dialogue with Agent A compare with the AVMs representing the relevant scenario keys, while the second matrix summarizes the information exchange with Agent B. Labels vi to v4 in each matrix represent the possible values of depart-city shown in Table 1; v5 to v8 are for arrival-city, etc.
    Columns represent the key, specifying which information values the agent and user were supposed to communicate to one another given a particular scenario.
    (The equivalent column sums in both tables reflects that users of both agents were assumed to have performed the same scenarios).
    Rows represent the data collected from the dialogue corpus, reflecting what attribute values were actually communicated between the agent and the user.
    Given a confusion matrix M, success at achieving the information requirements of the task is measured with the Kappa coefficient (Carletta, 1996; Siegel and Castellan, 1988): by chance.7 When there is no agreement other than that which would
