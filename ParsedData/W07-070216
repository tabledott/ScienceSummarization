.
			The baseline model (sw, tw) does not manage to translate ?heeft?.
			The model with the CCG supertag sequence model (sw, twc) translates it correctly as ?has?
			and reorders it correctly 4 placesto the left.
			The second example also shows the se quence model correctly translating the Dutch verb at the end of the sentence ?nodig?.
			One can see that it is still not entirely grammatical.
			The improvements in reordering shown here are reorderings over a relatively short distance, two or three positions.
			This is well within the 5-gram orderof the CCG supertag sequence model and we there fore consider this to be local reordering.
			4.4 Order of the Sequence Model.
			The CCG supertags describe the syntactic context of the word they are attached to.
			Therefore theyhave an influence that is greater in scope than sur face words or POS tags.
			Increasing the order ofthe CCG supertag sequence model should also increase the ability to perform longer distance reorder ing.
			However, at some point the r
