    If the erroneous parts were replaced with the corrected forms indicated in the error tags one-by-one, illformed sentences could be converted into corrected equivalents.
    We did this with the 50 items of training data to extract the correct sentences and then added them to the training data.

    We then determined how we could improve the results by adding the artificially made errors to the training data.
    We did this only for article errors.
    We first examined what kind of errors had been made with articles an
