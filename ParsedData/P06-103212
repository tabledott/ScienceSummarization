velopment and test sets from the same data.
    In order to create a test set, we had a third party collect 150 examples of the 14 words from English websites in China.
    After minor cleanup to eliminate sentences irrelevant to the task,4 we ended up with 123 example sentences to use as test set.

    Thirteen examples were determined to contain no errors relevant to our experiment, but were retained in the data.5
  
  
    Table 1 shows per-sentence results of translating the test set on systems built with training data sets of various sizes (given in thousands of sentence pairs).
    Numbers for the proofing tools in Word 2003 are presented by way of comparison, with the caveat that these tools have been intentionally implemented conservatively so as not to potentially irritate native users with false flags.
    For our purposes, a replacement string is viewed as correct if, in the view of a native speak
