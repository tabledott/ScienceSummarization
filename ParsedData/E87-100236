se pairs with some number of x's on one tape, and that same number of y's followed by the same number of z's on the other tape.
    The set of second tapes therefore contains a context-free language which it is clearly not within the power of any finite-state device to generate.
    Koskenniemi overcame this objection in his original work by adopting the view that all the transducers in the parallel configuration should share the same pair or read-write heads.
    The effect of this is to insist that they not only accept the same pairs of tapes, but that they agree on the particular sequence of symbol pairs that must be rehearsed in the course of accepting each of them.
    Kaplan has been able to put a more formal construction on this in the following way Let the empty symbols appearing in the pairs labeling any transition in the transducers be replaced by some ordinary symbol not otherwise part of the alphabet.
    The new set of transducers derived in this way clearly do not accept the same pairs of tapes
