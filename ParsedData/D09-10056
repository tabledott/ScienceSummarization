ol in the rule. set of incoming hyperedges of node v (i.e., hyperedges of which v is the consequent), which represent different ways of deriving v. Figure 1 shows a simple Hiero-style hypergraph.
    The hypergraph encodes four different derivation trees that share some of the same items.
    By exploiting this sharing, a hypergraph can compactly represent exponentially many trees.
    We observe that any finite-state automaton can also be encoded as a hypergraph (in which every hyperedge is an ordinary edge that connects a single antecedent to a consequent).
    Thus, the methods of this paper apply directly to the simpler case of hypothesis lattices as well.
    We assume a hypergraph HG, which compactly encodes many derivation trees d E D. Given HG, we wish to extract the best derivations&#8212;or other aggregate properties of the forest of derivations.
    Semiring parsing (Goodman, 1999) is a general framework to describe such algorithms.
    To define a particular algorithm, we choose a semiring K and s
