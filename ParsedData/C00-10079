  The input to the system is a dependency tree as shown in Figme 4.
  Note that the nodes are labeled only with lexemes, not with supertags.
  2 The Tree Chooser then uses a stochastic tree model to choose TAG trees fbr the nodes in the input structure.
  This step can be seen as analogous to "supertag- ging" (Bangalore and Joshi, 1999), except that now supertags (i.e., names of trees) must be fbund tbr words in a tree rather than tbr words in a linear sequence.
  The Unraveler then uses the XTAG grammar to produce a lattice of all possible linearizations that arc compatible with the supertagged tree and the XTAG.
  The LP Chooser then chooses the most likely traversal of this latti
