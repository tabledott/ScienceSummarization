eered work in the hierarchical clustering of word senses.
    In his disambiguation experiments, Schiitze used post-hoc alignment of clusters to word senses.
    Because the toplevel cluster partitions based purely on distributional information do not necessarily align with standard sense distinctions, he generated up to 10 sense clusters and manually assigned each to a fixed sense label (based on the hand-inspection of 10-20 sentences per cluster).
    In contrast, our algorithm uses automatically acquired seeds to tie the sense partitions to the desired standard at the beginning, where it can be most useful as an anchor and guide.
    In addition, Schiitze performs his classifications by treating documents as a large unordered bag of words.
    By doing so he loses many important distinctions, such as collocational distance, word sequence and the existence of predicate-argument relationships between words.
    In contrast, our algorithm models these properties carefully, adding considerable discriminating p
