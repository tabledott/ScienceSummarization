cide which of the two texts contains more information.
    As a result, each ENG/ENG1 pair is annotated as an example of uni-/bidirectional entailment, and stored in the monolingual English corpus.
    Since the original ENG texts are aligned with the ITA and GER texts, the entailment annotations of ENG/ENG1 pairs can be projected to the other language pairs and the ITA/ENG1 and GER/ENG1 pairs are stored in the CLTE corpus.
    The possibility of projecting TE annotations is based on the assumption that the semantic information is mostly preserved during the translation process.
    This particularly holds at the denotative level (i.e. regarding the truth values of the sentence) which is crucial to semantic inference.
    At other levels (e.g. lexical) there might be slight semantic variations which, however, are very unlikely to play a crucial role in determining entailment relations.
    Step3: Translation.
    The modified sentences (ENG1) are translated into Italian (ITA1) through (multilingual) generatio
