ed by the generator is that the original translations are considered in principle to be word synchronous in the sense that selecting a word from one original translation normally implies &#8220;marking&#8221; a corresponding word in each of the other original translations as &#8220;used&#8221;.
    The way this is determined is explained below.
    Two partial hypotheses that have the same partial translation, but have a different set of words that have been accounted for are considered different.
    A hypothesis is considered &#8220;complete&#8221; if the next word chosen to extend the hypothesis is the explicit end-of-sentence marker from one of the original translation strings.
    At the start of hypothesis generation, there is a single hypothesis, which has the empty string as its partial translation and where none of the words in any of the original translations are marked as used.
    In each iteration, the decoder extends a hypothesis by choosing the next unused word from one of the original translat
