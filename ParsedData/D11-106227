pairs featuring wrong entailment annotations were encountered.
    These errors can be classified as follows: a) 13 pairs, where the added/removed information changes the meaning of the sentence.
    In these cases, the modified sentence was judged more/less specific than the original one, leading to unidirectional entailment annotation.
    On the contrary, in terms of the standard entailment definition, the correct annotation is &#8220;no entailment&#8221; (as in Example 4, which was annotated as ENG&#8594;ENG1): These pairs were labelled as unidirectional entailments (in the example above ENG&#8594;ENG1), under the assumption that a proper name is more specific and informative than a pronoun.
    However, adhering to the TE definition, co-referring expressions are equivalent, and their realization does not play any role in the entailment decision.
    This implies that the correct entailment annotation is &#8220;bidirectional&#8221;. c) 9 pairs where the sentences are semantically equivalent, but contain a
