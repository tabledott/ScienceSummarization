ause their indices are 0, 4, and 8.
    To see why a decision tree could not perform this classification, regardless of order of classification, note that, for the two characters before both A3 and A4, both the characters and their classifications are the same, although these two characters should be classified differently.
    Below is a transformation list for performing this classification.
    Once again, we assume transformations are applied left to right and that the result of a transformation is written out immediately, so that the result of applying transformation x to character a, will always be known when applying transformation x to ai+i.
    The extra power of transformation lists comes from the fact that intermediate results from the classification of one object are reflected in the current label of that object, thereby making this intermediate information available for use in classifying other objects.
    This is not the case for decision trees, where the outcome of questions asked is saved imp
