l of these ambiguities must be dealt with if proper names are to be identified correctly.
    In the rest of the paper we describe the resources and heuristics we have designed and implemented in Nominator and the extent to which they resolve these ambiguities.
  
  
    In general, two types of resources are available for disambiguation: context and world knowledge.
    Each of these can be exploited along a continuum, from 'cheaper' to computationally and manually more expensive usage.
    'Cheaper' models, which include no context or world knowledge, do very little disambiguation.
    More 'expensive' models, which use full syntactic parsing, discourse models, inference and reasoning, require computational and human resources that may not always be available, as when massive amounts of text have to be rapidly processed on a regular basis.
    In addition, given the current state of the art, full parsing and extensive world knowledge would still not yield complete automatic ambiguity resolution.
