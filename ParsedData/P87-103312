 of the disjuncts of DES C.INDEFINITE is checked for compatibility with DESC.DEFINITE, using the function CHECK-INDEF.
    In this case, all disjuncts are compatible with the definite information, except for one; the disjunct of the third disjunction which contains the feature Number : Sing.
    This disjunct is eliminated, and the only remaining disjunct in the disjunction (i.e., the disjunct containing Number : PO is unified with DESC.DEFINITE.
    The result after this step is shown in Figure 9.
    The four disjuncts that remain are numbered for convenience.
    In step 3, NWISE-CONSISTENCY is used with 1 as the value of the parameter n. A new description is hypothesized by unifying disjunct (1) with the definite component of the description (i.e., NEW-DESC.DEFINITE).
    Then disjuncts (3) and (4) are checked for compatibility with this hypothesized structure: (3) is not compatible, because the values of the Transitivity features do not unify.
    Disjunct (4) is also incompatible, because it has Goal :
