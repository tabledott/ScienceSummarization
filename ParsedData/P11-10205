arallel sentences, this data tend to be noisy, and reliably identifying good paraphrases among all possible sentence pairs remains an open problem.
    On the other hand, multiple translations on the sentence level such as the MTC Corpus provide good, natural paraphrases, but relatively little data of this type exists.
    Finally, some approaches avoid the need for monolingual paraphrase data altogether by using a second language as the pivot language (Bannard and Callison-Burch, 2005; Callison-Burch, 2008; Kok and Brockett, 2010).
    Phrases that are aligned to the same phrase in the pivot language are treated as potential paraphrases.
    One limitation of this approach is that only words and phrases are identified, not whole sentences.
    While most work on evaluating paraphrase systems has relied on human judges (Barzilay and McKeown, 2001; Ibrahim et al., 2003; Bannard and Callison-Burch, 2005) or indirect, task-based methods (Lin and Pantel, 2001; Callison-Burch et al., 2006), there have also been a
