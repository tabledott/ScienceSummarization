ld need to collect a text corpus, in which each ambiguous word occurrence is first tagged with its correct sense to serve as training data.
    The reliance of supervised WSD systems on annotated corpus raises the important issue of domain dependence.
    To investigate this, Escudero et al. (2000) and Martinez and Agirre (2000) conducted experiments using the DSO corpus, which 49 contains sentences from two different corpora, namely Brown Corpus (BC) and Wall Street Journal (WSJ).
    They found that training a WSD system on one part (BC or WSJ) of the DSO corpus, and applying it to the other, can result in an accuracy drop of more than 10%, highlighting the need to perform domain adaptation of WSD systems to new domains.
    Escudero et al. (2000) pointed out that one of the reasons for the drop in accuracy is the difference in sense priors (i.e., the proportions of the different senses of a word) between BC and WSJ.
    When the authors assumed they knew the sense priors of each word in BC and WSJ, and adj
