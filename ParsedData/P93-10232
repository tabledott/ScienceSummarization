e of lexical knowledge which is useful for many natural language (NL) tasks is the semantic relatedness between words of the same or different syntactic categories.
    Semantic relatedness subsumes hyponymy, synonymy, and antonymyincompatibility.
    Special forms of relatedness are represented in the lexical entries of the WordNet lexical database (Miller et al., 1990).
    Paradigmatic semantic relations in WordNet have been used for diverse NL problems, including disambiguation of syntactic structure (Resnik, 1993) and semiautomatic construction of a large-scale ontology for machine translation (Knight, 1993).
    In this paper, we focus on a particular case of semantic relatedness: relatedness between adjectives which describe the same property.
    We describe a technique for automatically grouping adjectives according to their meaning based on a given text corpus, so that all adjectives placed in one group describe different values of the same property.
    Our method is based on statistical techniques
