e target language sentences, we will choose the sentence with the highest probability: The decomposition into two knowledge sources in Equation 2 is known as the source-channel approach to statistical machine translation (Brown et al., 1990).
    It allows an independent modeling of target language model Pr(eI1) and translation model Pr(fJ1 |eI1)1.
    The target language model describes the well-formedness of the target language sentence.
    The translation model links the source language sentence to the target language sentence.
    It can be further decomposed into alignment and lexicon model.
    The argmax operation denotes the search problem, i.e. the generation of the output sentence in the target language.
    We have to maximize over all possible target language sentences.
    An alternative to the classical source-channel approach is the direct modeling of the posterior probability Pr(eI1|fJ1 ).
    Using a log-linear model (Och and Ney, 2002), we obtain: Here, Z(fJ1 ) denotes the appropriate norma
