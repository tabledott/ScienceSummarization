    Because the word pair feature is the most specific in the model, it is likely to be the most corpusspecific.
    The vocabularies used in corpora vary, as do the word frequencies.
    It is reasonable to expect word co-occurrences to vary as well.
    In order to test this hypothesis, we removed the distribution &#65533;P(ChwlP, H, Hht, Hhw, C, Cht) from the parsing model entirely, relying on the interpolation of the two less specific distributions in the parser: We performed cross-corpus experiments as before to determine whether the simpler parsing model might be more robust to corpus effects.
    Results are shown in Table 3.
    Perhaps the most striking result is just how little the elimination of lexical bigrams affects the baseline system: performance on the WSJ corpus decreases by less than 0.5% absolute.
    Moreover, the performance of a WSJ-trained system without lexical bigrams on Brown test data is identical to the WSJtrained system with lexical bigrams.
