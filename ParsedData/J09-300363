together with the results from using all of the polarity features for step two.10 For SVM, this is the combination of results from the word+priorpol baseline from step one, together with results for using all the polarity features for step two.
    Recall that the word+priorpol classifier was the best neutral&#8211;polar classifier for SVM (see Table 11).
    The second rows for BoosTexter, TiMBL, and Ripper show the results of a single classifier trained to recognize contextual polarity using all the neutral&#8211;polar and polarity features together.
    For SVM, the second row shows the results of classifying the contextual polarity using just the word token feature.
    This classifier outperformed all others for SVM.
    In the table, the best result for each metric for each algorithm is highlighted in bold.
    When comparing the two-step and one-step approaches, contrary to our expectations, we see that the one-step approach performs about as well or better than the two-step approach for recognizing co
