 observations to be the co-occurrences of the substrings in the training bitexts.
    However, in order that these costs can be comparable to the costs for simple pairings, they are multiplied by the number of words in the source substring of the pairing.
    The use of compounds in pairings does not require any fundamental changes to the hierarchical alignment dynamic programming algorithm, which simply produces dependency trees with nodes that may be compounds.
    In the transducer construction phase of the training method, one of the words of a compound is taken to be the primary or &amp;quot;real&amp;quot; headword.
    (In fact, we take the least common word of a compound to be its head.)
    An extra chain of transitions is constructed to transduce the other words of compounds, if necessary using transitions with epsilon strings.
    This compilation means that the transduction algorithm is unaffected by the use of compounds when aligning training data, and there is no need for a separate compound iden
