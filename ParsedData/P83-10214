fines the relations denoted by the predicates appearing in the heads of clauses.
    When using a definiteclause proof procedure, such as Prolog (Roussel.
    1975), a goal statement x-ai.&amp;quot;an can be translated into a definite clause x(So,Sn) 1(S0,S1) &amp; The variables Si are the string arguments, representing positions in the input string.
    For example, the context-free rule &amp;quot;S NP VP&amp;quot; is translated into &amp;quot;s(S0,S2) np(SO.S1) vp(S1,S2),&amp;quot; which can be paraphrased as -there is an S from SO to S2 in the input string if there is an NP from SO to Si and a VP from SI to S2.&amp;quot; Given the translation of a context-free grammar G with start symbol S into a set of definite clauses G' with corresponding predicate s, to say that a string w is in the grammar's language is equivalent to saying that the start goal s(po,p) is a consequence of G U W, where 1)0 and p represent the left. and right endpoints of w, and W is a set of unit clauses that represents w. It is easy to
