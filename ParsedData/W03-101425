that contain at least one pattern instance.
    We evaluated 18 different subsets of the patterns, by selecting the patterns that pass certain thresholds in the training data.
    We tried all combinations of 01 = {2,10} and 02 = {.60,.65,.70,.75,.80,.85,.90,.95,1.0}.
    The data points corresponding to 01=2 are shown on the upper line in Figure 4, and those corresponding to 01=10 are shown on the lower line.
    For example, the data point corresponding to 01=10 and 02=.90 evaluates only the extraction patterns that occur at least 10 times in the training data and with a probability &gt; .90 (i.e., at least 90% of its occurrences are in subjective training sentences).
    Overall, the extraction patterns perform quite well.
    The precision ranges from 71% to 85%, with the expected tradeoff between precision and recall.
    This experiment confirms that the extraction patterns are effective at recognizing subjective expressions.
    In our second experiment, we used the learned extraction patterns to class
