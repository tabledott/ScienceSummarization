ns between the model?s entities.
			Therefore, we also introduce the notion ofmodel size.
			The model size is defined here by count ing the number of all instances of two-place relations (and three-place relations, if there are any) in the model, and multiplying this with the domain size.
			For instance, the following model D = {d1,d2,d3} F(cat) = {d1,d2} F(john) = {d3} F(of) = {(d1,d3)} F(like) = {(d3,d1),(d3,d2)} has a domain size of 3 and 3 instantiated two-place relations, yielding a model size of 3 ? 3 = 9.
			3.6 Deep Semantic Features.
			Given our approach to deep semantic analysis,we identified eight features relevant for recognising textual entailment.
			The theorem prover provides us with two features: entailed determin ing whether T implies H, and inconsistentdetermining whether T together with H is incon sistent.
			The model builder gives us six features: domainsize and modelsize for T+H as well as the absolute and relative difference between the sizes of T and T+H, both for the size of the d
