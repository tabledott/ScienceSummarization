    It is clear that the valleys of the LCP correspond mostly to the dominant segment boundaries.
    For example, the clear valley at i = 110 exactly corresponds to the dominant segment boundary (and also to the paragraph boundary shown as a dotted line).
    Note that LCP can detect segment changing of a text regardless of its paragraph structure.
    For example, i = 156 is a paragraph boundary, but neither a valley of the LCP nor a segment boundary; i = 236 is both a segment boundary and approximately a valley of the LCP, but not a paragraph boundary.
    However, some valleys of the LCP do not exactly correspond to segment boundaries.
    For example, the valley near i = 450 disagree with the segment boundary at i = 465.
    The reason is that lexical cohesion can not cover all aspect of coherence of a segment; all incoherent piece of text can be lexically cohesive.
  
  
    This paper proposed LCP, all indicator of segment changing, which c
