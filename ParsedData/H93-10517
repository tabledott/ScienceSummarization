tolzenlsense)/Pr(token ).
  The weight of a token for a given sense is the log of its salience.
  To select the sense of the target word in a (test) con- text, the classifier computes the sum of the tokcns weights over all tokens in the context for each sense, and selects the sense with the largest sum.
  In the case of author identification, Mosteller and Wallace built their models using high frequency function words.
  With sense resolution, the salient tokens include content words, which have much lower frequencies of occurrence.
  devised a method for estimating the required probabilities using sparse training data, since the max- imum likelihood estimate (MLE) of a probability - the number of times a token appears in a set of contexts divided by the total number of tokens in the set of con- texts - is a poor estimate of the true probability.
  In par- ticular, many tokens in the test contexts do not appear in any training context, or appear only once or twice.
  In the former case, the MLE is zero, obvio
