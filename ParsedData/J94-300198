ombination regimes are encompassed by the regular relations.
    There may be grammars specifying even more complex rule interactions, and, depending on the formal details, it may be possible to establish their regularity by other techniques; for example, by carefully managing a set of distinguished auxiliary symbols that code inter-rule constraints.
    We know, of course, that certain methods for combining regular rules give rise to nonregular mappings.
    This is true, for example, of unrestricted cyclic application of the rules in a finite ordered sequence.
    According to a cyclic grammar specification, a given input string is mapped through all the rules in the sequence to produce an output string, and that output string then becomes a new input for a reapplication of all the rules, and the process can be repeated without bound.
    We can demonstrate that such a grammar is nonregular by considering again the simple optional rule e &#8212;&gt; ab/a b We showed before that this rule does not denote a r
