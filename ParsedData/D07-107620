sub-trees involved in the tree kernel computation are context-free (That is, they do not consider the information outside the sub-trees).
			This is contrast to 2 That is, each node n encodes the identity of a sub-.
			tree rooted at n and, if there are two nodes in the tree with the same label, the summation will go over both of them.
			the tree kernel proposed in Culota and Sorensen (2004) which is context-sensitive, that is, it considers the path from the tree root node to the sub-tree root node.
			In order to integrate the advantages of both tree kernels and resolve the problem in Collins and Duffy?s convolution tree kernel, this paper proposes a context-sensitive convolution tree kernel.
			It works by taking ancestral information (i.e. the root node path) of sub-trees into consideration: ? ?
