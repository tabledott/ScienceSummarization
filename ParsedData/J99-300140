    Hence, the extended Cf ranking, depicted in Figure 3, will prefer OLD discourse entities over MEDiated ones, and MEDiated ones will be preferred over NEW ones.
    We assume that the difference between containing inferables and anchored brandnew discourse entities is negligible.
    (It was not well defined in Prince [1981] and in Information status and familiarity (refined version).
    Prince [1992] she abandoned the second term.)
    Therefore, we conflate them into the category of anchored brand-new discourse entities.
    These discourse entities require that the anchor modifies a brand-new head and that the anchor is either an evoked or an unused discourse entity.
    In the following, we give examples of inferrables and anchored brand-new discourse entities.
    In example 6 the relation between the definite NP the family and the context has to be inferred, therefore the family belongs to the category inferable (I).
    It is marked by definiteness but it is not anaphoric since there is no anaphor
