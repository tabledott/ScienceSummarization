y with small perturbations of these values.
    However, the relation between the probabilities is very important for good performance.
    No improvement can be achieved with a uniform probability distribution &#8211; it is necessary to penalize translations of low quality.
    The improvements in translation quality are also significant on the TC-STAR EPPS SpanishEnglish task.
    Here, we combined four different systems which performed best in the TC-STAR 2005 evaluation, see Table 3.
    Compared to the best performing single system, the consensus hypothesis reduces the WER from 41.0 to 39.1%.
    This result is further improved by rescoring the N-best lists derived from the confusion networks (N=1000).
    For rescoring, a word penalty feature, the IBM Model 1, and a 4-gram target language model were included.
    The linear interpolation weights of these models and the score from the confusion network were optimized on a separate development set with respect to word error rate.
