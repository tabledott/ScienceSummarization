ng other things, to model associations between several instances of that variable, e.g., between adjacent DAs.)
    A total of 1,155 Switchboard conversations were labeled, comprising 205,000 utterances and 1.4 million words.
    The data was partitioned into a training set of 1,115 conversations (1.4M words, 198K utterances), used for estimating the various components of our model, and a test set of 19 conversations (29K words, 4K utterances).
    Remaining conversations were set aside for future use (e.g., as a test set uncompromised of tuning effects).
    The more frequent DA types are briefly characterized below.
    As discussed above, the focus of this paper is not on the nature of DAs, but on the computational framework for their recognition; full details of the DA tag set and numerous motivating examples can be found in a separate report (Jurafsky, Shriberg, and Biasca 1997).
    Statements and Opinions.
    The most common types of utterances were STATEMENTS and OPINIONS.
