, and the extent of the chains correspond to the extent of a segment.
    The algorithm also incorporates the notion of &amp;quot;chain returns&amp;quot; &#8212; repetition of terms after a long hiatus &#8212; to close off an intention that spans over a digression.
    Since the Morris St Hirst (1991) algorithm attempts to discover attentional/intentional structure, their goals are different than those of TextTiling.
    Specifically, the discourse structure they attempt to discover is hierarchical and more fine-grained than that discussed here.
    Thus their model is not set up to take advantage of the fact that multiple simultaneous chains might occur over the same intention.
    Furthermore, chains tend to overlap one another extensively in long texts.
    Figure 2 shows the distribution, by sentence number, of selected terms from the Stargazers text.
    The first two terms have fairly uniform distribution and so should not be expected to provide much information about the divisions of the discussion.
