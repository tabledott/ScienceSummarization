2004) reduce the depth of the linguistic data used but still requires POS tagging.
    Many papers directly target specific applications, and build lexical resources as a side effect.
    Named Entity Recognition can be viewed as an instance of our problem where the desired categories contain words that are names of entities of a particular kind, as done in (Freitag, 2004) using coclustering.
    Many Information Extraction papers discover relationships between words using syntactic patterns (Riloff and Jones, 1999).
    (Widdows and Dorow, 2002; Dorow et al, 2005) discover categories using two hard-coded symmetric patterns, and are thus the closest to us.
    They also introduce an elegant graph representation that we adopted.
    They report good results.
    However, they require POS tagging of the corpus, use only two hard-coded patterns (&#8216;x and y&#8217;, &#8216;x or y&#8217;), deal only with nouns, and require non-trivial computations on the graph.
