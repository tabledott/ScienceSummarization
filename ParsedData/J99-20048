ions, which implies that porting to a new domain would involve rewriting the domain-dependent expressions.
    This approach has proved to be quite successful as a preprocessor in information extraction systems (Hobbs et al. 1995; Grishman 1995).
    Pioneered by the IBM natural language group (Fujisaki et al. 1989) and later pursued by, for example, Schabes, Roth, and Osborne (1993), Jelinek et al.
    (1994), Magerman (1995), Collins (1996), and Charniak (1997), this approach decouples the issue of wellformedness of an input string from the problem of assigning a structure to it.
    These systems attempt to assign some structure to every input string.
    The rules to assign a structure to an input are extracted automatically from hand-annotated parses of large corpora, which are then subjected to smoothing to obtain reasonable coverage of the language.
    The resultant set of rules are not linguistically transparent and are not easily modifiable.
    Lexical and structural ambiguity is resolved using pro
