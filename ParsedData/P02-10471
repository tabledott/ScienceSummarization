 Consider, for example, the sentence/clause pairs below. from the sale of expensive, high-technology systems like laser-designated missiles, aircraft electronic warfare systems, tactical radios, anti-radiation bombs and battlefield mobility systems.
    In these examples, the discourse markers But and because help us figure out that a CONTRAST relation holds between the text spans in (1) and an EXPLANATION-EVIDENCE relation holds between the spans in (2).
    Unfortunately, cue phrases do not signal all relations in a text.
    In the corpus of Rhetorical Structure trees (www.isi.edu/&#9986; marcu/discourse/) built by Carlson et al. (2001), for example, we have observed that only 61 of 238 CONTRAST relations and 79 out of 307 EXPLANATION-EVIDENCE relations that hold between two adjacent clauses were marked by a cue phrase.
    So what shall we do when no discourse markers are used?
    If we had access to robust semantic interpreters, we could, for example, infer from sentence 1.a that &#8220;cannot buy arms
