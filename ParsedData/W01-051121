#8221;, drainage which is in the training set only as &#8220;Location&#8221; (gallbladder drainage and tract drainage) and &#8220;Activity&#8221; (bile drainage).
    Other test set words such as immunisation and carcinogen do not appear in the training set at all.
    In other words, it seems that the MeSHk-based categorization does better when generalization is required.
    Additionally, this data set is &#8220;dense&#8221; in the sense that very few testing words are not present in the training data.
    This is of course an unrealistic situation and we wanted to test the robustness of the method in a more realistic setting.
    The results reported in Table 4 and in Figure 1 were obtained splitting the data into 50% training and 50% testing for each relation and we had a total of 855 training points and 805 test points.
    Of these, only 75 examples in the testing set consisted of NCs in which both words were not present in the training set.
    We decided to test the robustness of the MeSHbased model v
