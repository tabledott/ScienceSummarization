 reasonable to expect a user to provide a rating for each aspect, it is unlikely that a user will annotate every sentence and phrase in a review as being relevant to some aspect.
    Thus, it can be argued that the most pressing challenge in an aspect-based summarization system is to extract all relevant mentions for each aspect, as illustrated in figure 2.
    When labeled data exists, this problem can be solved effectively using a wide variety of methods available for text classification and information extraction (Manning and Schutze, 1999).
    However, labeled data is often hard to come by, especially when one considers all possible domains of products and services.
    Instead, we propose an unsupervised model that leverages aspect ratings that frequently accompany an online review.
    In order to construct such model, we make two assumptions.
    First, ratable aspects normally represent coherent topics which can be potentially discovered from co-occurrence information in the text.
    Second, we hypo
