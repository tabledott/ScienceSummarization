 Sutton 2003; Sutton, Rohanimanesh, and McCallum 2004) provide us with an interesting inspiration for extending feature forest models.
    The purpose of dynamic CRFs is to incorporate feature functions that are not represented locally, and the solution is to apply a variational method, which is an algorithm of numerical computation, to obtain approximate solutions.
    A similar method may be developed to overcome a bottleneck of feature forest models, that is, the fact that feature functions are localized to conjunctive nodes.
    The structure of feature forests is common in natural language processing and computational linguistics.
    As is easily seen, lattices, Markov chains, and CFG parse trees are represented by feature forests.
    Furthermore, because conjunctive nodes do not necessarily represent CFG nodes or rules and terminals of feature forests need not be words, feature forests can express any forest structures in which ambiguities are packed in local structures.
    Examples include the deriv
