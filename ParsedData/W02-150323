anese grammar has attained coverage of 99% for 500 sentences of a copier manual and 95% for 10,000 sentences of an eCRM (Voice-of-Customer) corpus.
    Next consider the Norwegian grammar which joined the ParGram group in 1999 and also emphasized slightly different goals from the other groups.
    Rather than prioritizing large textual coverage from the outset, the Norwegian group gave priority to the development of a core grammar covering all major construction types in a principled way based on the proposals in (Bresnan, 2001) and the inclusion of a semantic projection in addition to the f-structure.
    In addition, time was spent on improving existing lexical resources ( 80,000 lemmas) and adapting them to the XLE format.
    Roughly two man-years has been spent on the grammar itself.
    The ParGram cooperation on parallelism has ensured that the derived fstructures are interesting in a multilingual context, and the grammar will now serve as a basis for grammar development in other closely related Scandi
