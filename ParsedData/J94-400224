for the various factors and with the size of the parallelism reward and cataphora penalty, again attempting to optimize RAP's overall success rate.
    A value of 35 was chosen for the parallelism reward; this is just large enough to offset the preference for subjects over accusative objects.
    A much larger value (175) was found to be necessary for the cataphora penalty.
    The final results that we obtained for the training corpus are given in Table 2.
    Interestingly, the syntactic&#8212;morphological filter reduces the set of possible antecedents to a single NP, or identifies the pronoun as pleonastic in 163 of the 475 cases (34%) that the algorithm resolves correctly.'
    It significantly restricts the size of the candidate list in most of the other cases, in which the antecedent is selected on the basis of salience ranking and proximity.
    This indicates the importance of a powerful syntactic&#8212;morphological filtering component in an anaphora resolution system.
    We then performed a blind
