			To reduce the memory re quirements of our algorithms we discard any word pairs whose LLR score is less than 1.0.
			1We will use the term ?alignment?
			to mean an overall word alignment of a sentence pair, and the term ?link?
			to mean the alignment of a particular pair of words or small group of words.
			82In our first model, the value of the word associa tion feature for an alignment is simply the sum of all the individual LLR scores for the word pairs linkedby the alignment.
			The LLR-based model also in cludes the following features: nonmonotonicity features It may be observed that in closely related languages, word alignments of sentences that are mutual translations tend to be approximately monotonic (i.e., corresponding wordstend to be in nearly corresponding sentence posi tions).
			Even for distantly related languages, the number of crossing links is far less than chance, since phrases tend to be translated as contiguous chunks.
			To model these tende
