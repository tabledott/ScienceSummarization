s to heuristically determine the head, as is standard practice for the Penn Treebank.
    The lexicalized model proposed by Collins (1997) (henceforth Collins model) was re-implemented by one of the authors.
    For training, empty categories were removed from the training data, as the model cannot handle them.
    The same head finding strategy was applied as for the C&amp;R model.
    In this experiment, only head-head statistics were used (see (5)).
    The original Collins model uses sister-head statistics for non-recursive NPs.
    This will be discussed in detail in Section 5.
    Training and Testing For all three models, the model parameters were estimated using maximum likelihood estimation.
    Both Lopar and the Collins model use various backoff distributions to smooth the estimates.
    The reader is referred to Schmid (2000) and Collins (1997) for details.
    For the C&amp;R model, we used a cutoff of one for rule frequencies Prule and lexical choice frequencies Pchoice (the cutoff value was opt
