ng all of x.
    Formally, a flip state is one that allows entry on a &#8212;&gt; transition and that either allows exit on a transition or is a final state.
    We are concerned here with head automaton grammars H such that every Ha is split.
    These correspond to bilexical CFGs in which any derivation A[a] = xay has the form A[a] = xB[a] xay.
    That is, a word's left dependents are more oblique than its right dependents and c-command them.
    Such grammars are broadly applicable.
    Even if Ha is not split, there usually exists a split head automaton H&amp;quot;, recognizing the same language.
    H la exists if {x#y : (x, y) E L(Ha)} is regular (where # VT).
    In particular, lei', must exist unless Ha has a cycle that includes both &#247;- and -4 transitions.
    Such cycles would be necessary for Ha itself to accept a formal language such as {(bn, cn) : n &gt; 0}, where word a takes 2n dependents, but we know of no natural-language motivation for ever using them in a HAG.
