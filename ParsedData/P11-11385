ct disambiguations will form a &#8220;coherent&#8221; set of related concepts.
    Global approaches define a coherence function 0, and attempt to solve the following disambiguation problem: The global optimization problem in Eq.
    2 is NPhard, and approximations are required (Cucerzan, 2007).
    The common approach is to utilize the Wikipedia link graph to obtain an estimate pairwise relatedness between titles 0(ti, tj) and to efficiently generate a disambiguation context &#915;&#8242;, a rough approximation to the optimal &#915;*.
    We then solve the easier problem: ence of unambiguous mentions in the input document, and the second approach inevitably adds irrelevant titles to the disambiguation context.
    As we demonstrate in our experiments, by utilizing a more accurate disambiguation context, GLOW is able to achieve better performance.
    Eq.
    3 can be solved by finding each ti and then mapping mi independently as in a local approach, but still enforces some degree of coherence among the disam
