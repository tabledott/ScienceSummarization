rule set with additional rules discovered by machine learning.
    As noted earlier, distinguishing between specific use of a time expression and a generic use (e.g., &#8220;today&#8221;, &#8220;now&#8221;, etc.) was and is a significant source of error.
    Some of the other problems that these methods could be applied to distinguishing a calendar year reference from a fiscal year one (as in &#8220;this year&#8221;), and distinguishing seasonal from specific day references.
    For example, &#8220;Christmas&#8221; has a seasonal use (e.g., &#8220;I spent Christmas visiting European capitals&#8221;) distinct from its reference to a specific day use as &#8220;December 25th&#8221; (e.g., &#8220;We went to a great party on Christmas&#8221;).
    Here we discuss machine learning results in distinguishing specific use of &#8220;today&#8221; (meaning the day of the utterance) from its generic use meaning &#8220;nowadays&#8221;.
    In addition to features based on words cooccurring with &#8220;today&#8221; (Said, W
