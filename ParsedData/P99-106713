    Our method is based on the assumption that there is a correlation between the patterns of word co-occurrences in texts of different languages.
    However, as Rapp (1995) proposed, this correlation may be strengthened by not using the co-occurrence counts directly, but association strengths between words instead.
    The idea is to eliminate word-frequency effects and to emphasize significant word pairs by comparing their observed co-occurrence counts with their expected co-occurrence counts.
    In the past, for this purpose a number of measures have been proposed.
    They were based on mutual information (Church &amp; Hanks, 1989), conditional probabilities (Rapp, 1996), or on some standard statistical tests, such as the chi-square test or the loglikelihood ratio (Dunning, 1993).
    For the purpose of this paper, we decided to use the loglikelihood ratio, which is theoretically well justified and more appropriate for sparse data than chi-square.
    In preliminary experiments it also led to sligh
