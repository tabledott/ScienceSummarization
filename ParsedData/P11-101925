earliest systems, uses a number of manuallyidentified mostly shallow textual features, which are considered to be proxies for intrinsic qualities of writing competence.
    Linear regression is used to assign optimal feature weights that maximise the correlation with the examiner&#8217;s scores.
    The main issue with this system is that features such as word length and script length are easy to manipulate independently of genuine writing ability, potentially undermining the validity of the system.
    In e-Rater (Attali and Burstein, 2006), texts are represented using vectors of weighted features.
    Each feature corresponds to a different property of texts, such as an aspect of grammar, style, discourse and topic similarity.
    Additional features, representing stereotypical grammatical errors for example, are extracted using manually-coded task-specific detectors based, in part, on typical marking criteria.
    An unmarked text is scored based on the cosine similarity between its weighted vector and the
