he information present in the context for the disambiguation of a particular focus symbol (see Schiitze et al., 1994, and Pereira et al., 1995 If a word is not present in the lexicon, its ambiguous category cannot be retrieved.
    In that case, a category can be guessed only on the basis of the form or the context of the word.
    Again, we take advantage of the data fusion capabilities of a memory-based approach by combining these two sources of information in the case representation, and having the information gain feature relevance weighting technique figure out their relative relevance (see Schmid, 1994; Samuelsson, 1994 for similar solutions).
    In most taggers, some form of morphological analysis is performed on unknown words, in an attempt to relate the unknown word to a known combination of known morphemes, thereby allowing its association with one or more possible categories.
    After determining this ambiguous category, the word is disambiguated using context knowledge, the same way as known wor
