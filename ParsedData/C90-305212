ormed sub- strings using the CF skeleton: noun_phrase --~ determiner, noun; 2. a specification of well-formed (partial) syntac- tic structures: the structure np(Det, Noun) is well-formed if Det and Noun are a well-formed structure and if its agreement value (variable Num) is the same for the Det, the Noun, and the noun_phrase; 3. a specification of a relation between well- formed (partial) syntactic structures and well- formed substrings by augmenting the CF skele- ton with annotations representing those struc- tures.
  4.2 A TFS  spec i f i ca t ion All this information mixed together can be separated out and specified in a more modular way.
  The set of well-formed strings of words is de- fined as in Sect.2.1, where WORD = allVmen... 2.
  The set of well-formed partial syntactic struc- tures, i.e.
  every syntactic onstraint like agree- [Rent or subcategorisation, should be expressed in this part of the specification.
