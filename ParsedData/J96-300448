the probability of finding a transliterated name of any kind (pTN).
    Finally, we model the probability of a new transliterated name as the product of prN and pTN(hanzi,) for each hanzi, in the putative name.'
    The foreign name model is implemented as an WFST, which is then summed with the WFST implementing the dictionary, morpho13 The current model is too simplistic in several respects.
    For instance, the common &amp;quot;suffixes,&amp;quot; -nia (e.g., Virginia) and -sia are normally transliterated as itg2 ni2-ya3 and ffigi2, xil-ya3, respectively.
    The interdependence between JEI or ffi, and 0 is not captured by our model, but this could easily be remedied. logical rules, and personal names; the transitive closure of the resulting machine is then computed.
  
  
    In this section we present a partial evaluation of the current system, in three parts.
    The first is an evaluation of the system's ability to mimic humans at the task of segmenting text into word-sized units; the second evaluates
