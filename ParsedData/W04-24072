			2.1 Dependency Graphs.
			The linguistic tradition of dependency grammar comprises a large and fairly diverse family of theories and formalisms that share certain basic assumptions about syn tactic structure, in particular the assumption that syntacticstructure consists of lexical nodes linked by binary re lations called dependencies (see, e.g., Tesnie`re (1959), Sgall (1986), Mel?c?uk (1988), Hudson (1990)).
			Thus, the common formal property of dependency structures, as compared to the representations based on constituency (or phrase structure), is the lack of nonterminal nodes.In a dependency structure, every word token is depen dent on at most one other word token, usually called its head or regent, which means
