e prim- itives of a grammar, the elementary trees.
			This is most dramatically evident in the case of long-distance depen- dencies, such as that between a wh-phrase and its as- sociated gap.
			Similarly, using TAGs to construct logi- cal forms allows the localization of semantic dependen- cies in the logical forms of natural language xpressions, dependencies such as the signature requirements (argu- ment type and arity) of function and relation symbols, and even the long-distance dependencies between a wh- quantifier and its associated bound variable.
			With other methods of semantics, these dependencies cannot be lo- calized; the semantic aspects of filler-gap dependencies must be passed among the features of various nodes in a parse tree or otherwise distributed over the entire deriva- tion.
			Second, the use of the synchronous TAG augmenta- tion allows ,an even more radical reduction in the role of features in a TAG grammar.
			Because of the extended domain of locality that TAGs possess, the role of f
