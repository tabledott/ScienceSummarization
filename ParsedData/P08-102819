r each reference verb, the subjects&#8217; responses were entered into a contingency table, whose rows corresponded to nouns and columns to each possible answer (i.e., one of the two landmarks).
    Each cell recorded the number of times our subjects selected the landmark as compatible with the noun or not.
    We used Fisher&#8217;s exact test to determine which verbs and nouns showed the greatest variation in landmark preference and items with p-values greater than 0.001 were discarded.
    This yielded a reduced set of experimental items (120 in total) consisting of 15 reference verbs, each with 4 nouns, and 2 landmarks.
    Procedure and Subjects Participants first saw a set of instructions that explained the sentence similarity task and provided several examples.
    Then the experimental items were presented; each contained two sentences, one with the reference verb and one with its landmark.
    Examples of our items are given in Table 1.
    Here, burn is a high similarity landmark (High) for the refe
