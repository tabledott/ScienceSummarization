 for the task.
    There is also a large body of work on the nature of abstracting from a library science point of view (Borko 1975).
    This work distinguishes between different types of abstracts, most notably, indicative abstracts that tell what an article is about, and informative abstracts, that include major results from the article and can be read in place of it.
    SUMMONS generates summaries that are informative in nature.
    Research in psychology and education also focuses on how to teach people to write summaries (e.g., Endres-Niggemeyer 1993; Rothkegel 1993).
    This type of work can aid the development of summarization systems by providing insights into the human process of summarization that could be simulated in systems.
    To allow summarization in arbitrary domains, researchers have traditionally applied statistical techniques (Luhn 1958; Paice 1990; Preston and Williams 1994; Rau, Brandow, and Mitze 1994).
    This approach can be better termed extraction rather than summarization, sin
