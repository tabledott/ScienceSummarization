he noun on the Greek side.
    This subtracts 1.
    Finally, there are two dependencies that do not align: the subject on the English side and a determiner to a proper noun on the Greek side.
    These do not effect the result.
    The learning algorithm in Figure 2 is an instance of augmented-loss training (Hall et al., 2011) which is closely related to the constraint driven learning algorithms of Chang et al. (2007).
    In that work, external constraints on output structures are used to help guide the learner to good parameter regions.
    In our model, we use constraints drawn from parallel data exactly in the same manner.
    Since posterior regularization is closely related to constraint driven learning, this makes our algorithm also similar to the parser projection approach of Ganchev et al. (2009).
    There are a couple of differences.
    First, we bias our model towards the direct transfer model, which is already quite powerful.
    Second, our alignment constraints are used to select parses from
