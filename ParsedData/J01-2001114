inted to by exactly one stem pointer, located in some particular signature.
    All stem pointers in a signature that point to stems on the suffix list are directly described a &amp;quot;simple&amp;quot; word, a notion we have already encountered: a word whose stem is not further analyzable.
    But other words may be complex, that is, may contain a stem whose pointer is to an analyzable word, and hence the stem's representation consists of a pointer triple: a pointer to a signature, a stem within the signature, and a suffix within the signature.
    And each stem pointer is preceded by a flag indicating which type of stem it is.
    We thus have three things whose difference in the two states, S1 and S2, we wish to compute.
    The difference of the lengths of the flag is given in (10c.i).
    In (10c.ii), we need change in the total length of the pointers to the stems, and this has actually already been computed, during the computation of (9).37 Finally in (10c.iii), the set of pointers from certain stem po
