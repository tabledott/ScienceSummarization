04).
    The data for these tasks come from the Basic Travel Expression corpus (BTEC), consisting of tourism-related sentences.
    We combined the outputs of several MT systems that had officially been submitted to the IWSLT 2004 evaluation.
    Each system had used 20K sentence pairs (180K running words) from the BTEC corpus for training.
    Experiments with translations of automatically recognized speech were performed on the BTEC Italian-English task (Federico, 2003).
    Here, the involved MT systems had used about 60K sentence pairs (420K running words) for training.
    Finally, we also computed consensus translation from some of the submissions to the TC-STAR 2005 evaluation campaign (TC-STAR, 2005).
    The TC-STAR participants had submitted translations of manually transcribed speeches from the European Parliament Plenary Sessions (EPPS).
    In our experiments, we used the translations from Spanish to English.
    The MT engines for this task had been trained on 1.2M sentence pairs (32M running wo
