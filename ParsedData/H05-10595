osition are widely usedin various tagging problems in natural language pro cessing.
			The issue with such decompositions is that you have only the information about the preceding(or following) tags when performing local classifi cation.
			From the viewpoint of local classification, we want to give the classifier as much information as possible because the information about neighboring tags is useful in general.
			As an example, consider the situation where we are going to annotate a three-word sentence withpart-of-speech tags.
			Figure 1 shows the four possi ble ways of decomposition.
			They correspond to the following equations: (a) P (t1...t3|o) = P (t1|o)P (t2|t1o)P (t3|t2o) (5) (b) P (t1...t3|o) = P (t3|o)P (t2|t3o)P (t1|t2o) (6) (c) P (t1...t3|o) = P (t1|o)P (t3|o)P (t2|t3t1o) (7) (d) P (t1...t3|o) = P (t2|o)P (t1|t2o)P (t3|t2o) (8)(a) and (b) are the standard left-to-right and rightto-left decompositions.
			Notice that in decomposi tion (c), the local classifier can use the information about the t
