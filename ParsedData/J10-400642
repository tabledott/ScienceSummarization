    How the tuple structure was built (corpus extraction methods, association measures, etc.) is not part of the DM formalization.
    At the other end, DM provides sets of vectors in different vector spaces, but it is agnostic about how they are used (measuring similarity via cosines or other measures, reducing the matrices with SVD, etc.).
    Of course, much of the interesting progress in distributional semantics will occur at the two ends of our tensor, with better tuple extraction and weighting techniques on one side, and better matrix manipulation and similarity measurement on the other.
    As long as the former operations result in data that can be arranged into a weighted tuple structure, and the latter procedures act on vectors, such innovations fit into the DM framework and can be used to improve performance on tasks defined on any space derivable from the DM tensor.
    Whereas the model proposed by Pad&#180;o and Lapata (2007) is designed only to address tasks involving the measurement of the att
