actual 50 dimensions involved, but one can already begin to see clusterings of a syntactic and semantic nature.
    In one corner, for example, we encounter a grouping of possessive pronouns together with the possessive clitic &#8217;s.
    The singular ones my, her and his are closely positioned, as are the plural ones our, your and their.
    Also, there is a clustering of sociopolitical terms, such as international, country, national, government, and council.
    Distributional Memory Tensor Baroni and Lenci (2010) present Distributional Memory, a generalized framework for distributional semantics from which several special-purpose models can be derived.
    In their framework distributional information is extracted from the corpus once, in the form of a set of weighted word-link-word tuples arranged into a third-order tensor.
    Different matrices are then generated from the tensor, and their rows and columns give rise to different semantic spaces appropriate for capturing different semantic problems.
