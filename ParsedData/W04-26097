t is well understood and agreed in linguistics that concepts can be represented in many ways using various constructions at different syntactic levels.
    This is in part why we decided to take the syntactico-semantic approach that analyzes semantic relations at different syntactic levels of representation.
    In this paper we focus only on the behavior of semantic relations at NP level.
    A thorough understanding of the syntactic and semantic characteristics of NPs provides valuable insights into defining the most representative feature vectors that ultimately drive the discriminating learning models.
    Levi (Levi 1979) defines complex nominals (CNs) as expressions that have a head noun preceded by one or more modifying nouns, or by adjectives derived from nouns (usually called denominal adjectives).
    Most importantly for us, each sequence of nouns, or possibly adjectives and nouns, has a particular meaning as a whole carrying an implicit semantic relation; for example, &#8220;spoon handle&#8221; (P
