efinition of the criteria used to determine that a given segmentation is correct is crucial before one can interpret such measures.
    In a few cases, the criteria for correctness are made more explicit.
    For example Chen and Liu (1992) report precision and recall rates of over 99%, but this counts only the words that occur in the test corpus that also occur in their dictionary.
    Besides the lack of a clear definition of what constitutes a correct segmentation for a given Chinese sentence, there is the more general issue that the test corpora used in these evaluations differ from system to system, so meaningful comparison between systems is rendered even more difficult.
    The major problem for all segmentation systems remains the coverage afforded by the dictionary and the lexical rules used to augment the dictionary to deal with unseen words.
    The dictionary sizes reported in the literature range from 17,000 to 125,000 entries, and it seems reasonable to assume that the coverage of the base dicti
