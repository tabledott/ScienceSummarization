 alignment models that are able to deal with this general representation, however, is hard.
    Typically, the alignment models presented in the literature impose additional constraints on the alignment representation.
    Typically, the alignment representation is restricted in a way such that each source word is assigned to exactly one target word.
    Alignment models restricted in this way are similar to the concept of hidden Markov models (HMMs) in speech recognition.
    The alignment mapping in such models consists of associations j &#8594; i = aj from source position j to target position i = aj.
    The alignment aJ1 = a1, ... , aj, ... , aJ may contain alignments aj = 0 with the &#8220;empty&#8221; word e0 to account for source words that are not aligned with any target word.
    Constructed in such a way, the alignment is not a relation between source and target language positions, but only a mapping from source to target language positions.
    In Melamed (2000), a further simplification is perform
