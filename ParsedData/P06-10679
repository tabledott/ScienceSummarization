r more words).
    This models phrasal movement better since words tend to move in blocks and not independently.
    The distortion is conditioned on classes of the aligned source and target words.
    The entire source and target vocabularies are reduced to a small number of classes (e.g., 50) for the purpose of estimating those parameters.
    Similarly, (Koehn et al., 2003) propose a relative distortion model to be used with a phrase decoder.
    The model is defined in terms of the difference between the position of the current phrase and the position of the previous phrase in the source sentence.
    It does not conillustrate word positions in the sentence.
    The indices in the reordered English denote word position in the original English order. sider the words in those positions.
    The distortion model we propose assigns a probability distribution over possible relative jumps conditioned on source words.
    Conditioning on the source words allows for a much more fine-grained model.
