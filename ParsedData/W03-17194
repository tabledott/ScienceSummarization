be at a disadvantage during the comparison compared to systems trained exclusively on the training data.
    Competitions also may fail to predict the performance of the segmenter on new texts outside the training and testing sets.
    The handling of out-ofvocabulary words becomes a much larger issue in these situations than is accounted for within the test environment: A system that performs admirably in the competition may perform poorly on texts from different registers.
    Another issue that is not accounted for in the current collection of evaluations is the handling of short strings with minimal context, such as queries submitted to a search engine.
    This has been studied indirectly through the cross-language information retrieval work performed for the TREC 5 and TREC 6 competitions (Smeaton and Wilkinson, 1997; Wilkinson, 1998).
