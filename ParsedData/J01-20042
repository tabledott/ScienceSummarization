to the improvement observed by other models, demonstrating the degree to which the information captured by our parsing model is orthogonal to that captured by a trigram model.
    A small recognition experiment also demonstrates the utility of the model.
  
  
    With certain exceptions, computational linguists have in the past generally formed a separate research community from speech recognition researchers, despite some obvious overlap of interest.
    Perhaps one reason for this is that, until relatively recently, few methods have come out of the natural language processing community that were shown to improve upon the very simple language models still standardly in use in speech recognition systems.
    In the past few years, however, some improvements have been made over these language models through the use of statistical methods of natural language processing, and the development of innovative, linguistically well-motivated techniques for improving language models for speech recognition is generating
