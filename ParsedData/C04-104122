			For all of the figures re ported on section 23, unless stated otherwise, the parser is able to provide an analysis for 98.5% of the sentences.
			The parse times and speeds include the failed sentences, but do not include the time takenby the supertagger; however, the supertagger is ex tremely efficient, and takes less than 6 seconds to supertag section 23, most of which consists of load time for the Maximum Entropy model.
			The first three rows correspond to our strategy ofearlier work by starting with the least restrictive set ting of the supertagger.
			The first value of ? is 0.01; if the parser cannot find a spanning analysis,
