nstituent in the Charniak parse tree, if there was a dependency between the head word of the constituent and the predicate, then the corresponding CCG features for those words were added to the features for that constituent.
    Table 3 shows the performance of the system when these features were added.
    The corresponding baseline performances are mentioned in parentheses.
    We added several other features to the system.
    Position of the clause node (S, SBAR) seems to be an important feature in argument identification (Hacioglu et al., 2004) therefore we experimented with four clause-based path feature variations.
    We added the predicate context to capture predicate sense variations.
    For some adjunctive arguments, punctuation plays an important role, so we added some punctuation features.
    All the new features are shown in
  
  
    In the baseline system, we used the same set of features for all the n binary ONE VS ALL classifiers.
    Error analysis showed that some features specifically s
