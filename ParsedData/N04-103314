he nonmonotone search cannot generate a sentence pair.
    This happens if a sentence pair contains a word that occurs only once in the training corpus.
    All phrases that might produce this singleton are excluded because of the leaving-one-out principle.
    Note that all these monotonicity consideration are done at the phrase level.
    Within the phrases arbitrary reorderings are allowed.
    The only restriction is that they occur in the training corpus.
    Table 4 shows the percentage of the training corpus that can be generated with monotone and nonmonotone phrase-based search.
    The number of sentence pairs that can be produced with the nonmonotone search gives an estimate of the upper bound for the sentence error rate of the phrase-based system that is trained on the given data.
    The same considerations hold for the monotone search.
    The maximum source phrase length for the Verbmobil task and the Xerox task is 12, whereas for the Canadian Hansards task we use a maximum of 4, because of the
