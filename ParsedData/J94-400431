ional and demotional divergences involve a repositioning of the head itself] 2 We will see in Section 5.1 that these three divergences account for the entire range of repositioning possibilities.
  4.2 Promotional Divergence Promotional divergence is characterized by the promotion (placement "higher up") of a logical modifier into a main verb position (or vice versa), as shown in Figure 9b.
  In such a situation, the logical modifier is associated with the syntactic head position, and the logical head is then associated with an internal argument position.
  Thus, promotional divergence overrides the G?T4, invoking the following sets of relations in place of steps 1 and 4 of (10): (15) 1.

  11 The parameters associated with the RLCS are assumed to be correctly specified for the purposes of this formal description.
  However, in practice, there might be errors in the lexical entries, since they are constructed by hand in the current implementation.
