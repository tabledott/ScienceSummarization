s results when using gold standard POS tags and, in the final two columns, when using POS tags automatically assigned by the POS tagger described in Curran and Clark (2003).
    The drop in accuracy is expected, given the importance of POS tags as features.
    The table demonstrates the significant reduction in the average number of categories that can be achieved through the use of a supertagger.
    To give one example, the number of categories in the tag dictionary&#8217;s entry for the word is is 45.
    However, in the sentence Mr. Vinken is chairman of Elsevier N.V., the Dutch publishing group., the supertagger correctly assigns one category to is for all values of &#946;.
    In our earlier work (Clark and Curran 2004a) the forward&#8211;backward algorithm was not used to estimate the probability in Equation (32).
    Curran, Clark, and Vadas (2006) investigate the improvement obtained from using the forward&#8211;backward algorithm, and also address the drop in supertagger accuracy when using automat
