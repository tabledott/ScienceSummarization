.
    We implement this constraint by introducing a %k variable into the GR template which denotes the argument of the category in the constraint column (which, as before, is the lexical category of the word filling the argument slot).
    In the example, the current category is (S[dcl]\NP1)/(S[to]\NP)2, which is associated with wants; this combines with (S[to]\NP)/(S[b]\NP), associated with to; and the argument of (S[to]\NP)/(S[b]\NP) is wean.
    The %k variable allows us to look beyond the arguments of the current category when creating the GRs.
    A further difficulty is that the head passing conventions differ between DepBank and CCGbank.
    By head passing we mean the mechanism which determines the heads of constituents and the mechanism by which words become arguments of longrange dependencies.
    For example, in the sentence The group said it would consider withholding royalty payments, the DepBank and CCGbank annotations create a dependency between said and the following clause.
    However, in De
