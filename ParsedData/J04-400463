y the PL and PR parameters&#8212;often provide the right information for disambiguating competing analyses, but that these structural preferences may be &#8220;overridden&#8221; by semantic preferences.
    Bilexical statistics (Eisner 1996), as represented by the maximal context of the PLw and PRw parameters, serve as a proxy for such semantic preferences, where the actual modifier word (as opposed to, say, merely its part of speech) indicates the particular semantics of its head.
    Indeed, such bilexical statistics were widely assumed for some time to be a source of great discriminative power for several different parsing models, including that of Collins.
    However, Gildea (2001) reimplemented Collins&#8217; Model 1 (essentially Model 2 but without subcats) and altered the PLw and PRw parameters so that they no longer had the top level of context that included the headword (he removed back-off level 0, as depicted in Table 1).
    In other words, Gildea removed all bilexical statistics from the overall
