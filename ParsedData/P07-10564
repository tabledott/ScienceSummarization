utual information method for selecting pivot features.
    Section 5 shows how to correct feature misalignments using a small amount of labeled target domain data.
    Section 6 motivates the A-distance and shows that it correlates well with adaptability.
    We discuss related work in Section 7 and conclude in Section 8.
  
  
    Before reviewing SCL, we give a brief illustrative example.
    Suppose that we are adapting from reviews of computers to reviews of cell phones.
    While many of the features of a good cell phone review are the same as a computer review &#8211; the words &#8220;excellent&#8221; and &#8220;awful&#8221; for example &#8211; many words are totally new, like &#8220;reception&#8221;.
    At the same time, many features which were useful for computers, such as &#8220;dual-core&#8221; are no longer useful for cell phones.
    Our key intuition is that even when &#8220;good-quality reception&#8221; and &#8220;fast dual-core&#8221; are completely distinct for each domain, if they both have
