nitive science, typically addressed by distinct DSMs so far.
    We have also aimed at maximizing the variety of aspects of meaning covered by the experiments, ranging from synonymy detection to argument structure and concept properties, and encompassing all the major lexical classes.
    Both these facts support the view of DM as a generalized model that is able to overtake state-of-the-art DSMs in the number and types of semantic issues addressed, while being competitive in each specific task.
    The choice of the DM semantic space to tackle a particular task is essentially based on the &#8220;naturalness&#8221; with which the task can be modeled in that space.
    However, alternatives are conceivable, both with respect to space selection, and to the operations performed on the space.
    For instance, Turney (2008) models synonymy detection with a DSM that closely resembles our W1W2&#215;L space, whereas we tackle this task under the more standard W1&#215;LW2 view.
    It is an open question whether ther
