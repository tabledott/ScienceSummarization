			In traditional categorial grammars, all information about possible syntactic ombinations of constituents is encoded in their categories.
			Those grammars allow only binary combinations.
			One of the two combined constituents, the functor, encodes the combination funtion, the other constituent serves as the argument to this function.
			Instead ot7 phrase structure rules, the grammar contains one or, in some formalisms, two combination rules that combine a functor and an argument by applying the function encoded in the functor to the argument constituent.
			Most categorial grammars only combine constituents whose terminal strings concatenate in the input string, but this need not be so.
			In most categorial grammar formalisms, it is assumed that the syntactic functor-argument structure in the corresponding compositional semantics.
			187 There are usually two types of grammatical categories in a categorial grammar, basic and derived ones.
			Basic categories are just category symbols, derived ca
