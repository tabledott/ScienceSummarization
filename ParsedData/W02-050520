    Table 9 shows some examples of the transliteration errors made by our transliteration algorithm.
    Some of the errors occurred were in fact not errors but rather acceptable alternative transliterations.
    However, many were true errors.
    The human-subjective evaluation described in Section 8.3 helps distinguish between these two cases.
    The evaluation results presented so far consider a transliteration correct only if it matches the goldstandard.
    In some cases where more than one possible transliteration is acceptable, this criterion is too rigid.
    To address such cases, we must ask a human subject to determine the correctness of transliterations.
    We asked a native speaker of English with good knowledge of Arabic to decide whether any given transliteration is correct or not.
    This humanbased evaluation is done for both the transliterations provided by the human translators and by our transliteration system.
    The human subject was presented with the names
