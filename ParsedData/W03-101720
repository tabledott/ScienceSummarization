    We measured the pairwise agreement among the 100 sentences that were judged by two evaluators, as the ratio of sentences that receive a label from both evaluators divided by the total number of sentences receiving label from any evaluator.
    The agreement across the 100 sentences for all seven choices was 55%; if we group together the five subtypes of opinion sentences, the overall agreement rises to 82%.
    The low agreement for some labels was not surprising because there is much ambiguity between facts and opinions.
    An example of an arguable sentence is &#8220;A lethal guerrilla war between poachers and wardens now rages in central and eastern Africa&#8221;, which one rater classified as &#8220;fact&#8221; and another rater classified as &#8220;opinion&#8221;.
    Finally, for evaluating the quality of extracted words with semantic orientation labels, we used two distinct manually labeled collections as gold standards.
    One set consists of the previously described 657 positive and 679 neg
