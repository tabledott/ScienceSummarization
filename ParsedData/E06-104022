s in different texts, whereas the other statistical generators will stick to those with the highest frequency.
    This behaviour is penalised by the automatic evaluation metrics, but the human evaluators do not seem to mind it.
    One of the classic rules of writing is to vary lexical and syntactic choices, in order to keep text interesting.
    However, this behaviour (variation for variation&#8217;s sake) will always reduce a system&#8217;s score under corpus-similarity metrics, even if it enhances text quality from the perspective of readers.
    Foster and Oberlander (2006), in their study of facial gestures, have also noted that humans do not mind and indeed in some cases prefer variation, whereas corpus-based evaluations give higher ratings to systems which follow corpus frequency.
    Using more reference texts does counteract this tendency, but only up to a point: no matter how many reference texts are used, there will still be one, or a small number of, most frequent variants, and using anything el
