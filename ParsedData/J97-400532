gin with the ERF distribution and construct a random field to take account of context dependencies that the ERF distribution fails to capture, incrementally improving the fit to the empirical distribution.
    In this framework, a model consists of: (1) An AV grammar G whose purpose is to define a set of dags L(G).
    (2) A set of initial weights 0 attached to the rules of G. The weight of a dag is the product of weights of rules used in generating it.
    Discarding failed derivations and renormalizing yields the initial distribution po (x).
    At each iteration, we select a new feature f by considering all atomic features, and all complex features that can be constructed from features already in the field.
    Holding the weights constant for all old features in the field, we choose the best weight 0 for f ) (how 13 is chosen will be discussed shortly), yielding a new distribution q1.
    The score for feature f is the reduction it permits in D(11 gold ), where gold is the old field.
    That is, the scor
