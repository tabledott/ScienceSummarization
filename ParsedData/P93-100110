vely large magnitudes, e.g., 10% of the length of the file, compared with the 2% magnitudes in Figure 3.
    Moreover, the residuals in Figure 4 have two very sharp discontinuities.
    The location of these sharp discontinuities is an important diagnostic clue for identifying the location of the problem.
    In this case, the discontinuities were caused by the two troublesome footnotes discussed in section 2. judge's alignments that it is hard to see the differences between the two.
    Char_align's errors may be easier to see in Figure 6, which shows a histogram of char_align's errors.
    (Errors with an absolute value greater than 200 have been omitted; less than 1% of the data fall into this category.)
    The errors (2&#177;46 bytes) are much smaller than the length of a sentence (129&#177;84 bytes).
    Half of the errors are less than 18 characters.
    In general, performance is slightly better on shorter files than on longer files because char_align doesn't use paragraph boundaries to break up long
