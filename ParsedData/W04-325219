contrary, the larger the window, the lower the precision, probably explained by the fact that a relation between words that are further apart is not strong enough to define a connection in the text graph.
    Experiments were performed with various syntactic filters, including: all open class words, nouns and adjectives, and nouns only, and the best performance was achieved with the filter that selects nouns and adjectives only.
    We have also experimented with a setting where no part of speech information was added to the text, and all words - except a predefined list of stopwords - were added to the graph.
    The results with this setting were significantly lower than the systems that consider part of speech information, which corroborates with previous observations that linguistic information helps the process of keyword extraction (Hulth, 2003).
    Experiments were also performed with directed graphs, where a direction was set following the natural flow of the text, e.g. one candidate keyword &#8220;r
