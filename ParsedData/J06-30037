m the SAT college entrance exam.1 An example of a typical SAT question appears in Table 1.
    In the educational testing literature, the first pair (mason:stone) is called the stem of the analogy.
    The correct choice is called the solution and the incorrect choices are distractors.
    We evaluate LRA by testing its ability to select the solution and avoid the distractors.
    The average performance of collegebound senior high school students on verbal SAT questions corresponds to an accuracy of about 57%.
    LRA achieves an accuracy of about 56%.
    On these same questions, the VSM attained 47%.
    One application for relational similarity is classifying semantic relations in nounmodifier pairs (Turney and Littman 2005).
    In Section 7, we evaluate the performance of LRA with a set of 600 noun-modifier pairs from Nastase and Szpakowicz (2003).
