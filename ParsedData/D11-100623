However, some are unexpected, e.g., Greek being the best source language for Dutch, as well as German being one of the worst.
    This is almost certainly due to different annotation schemes across treebanks.
    Overall, Table 2 does indicate that there are possible gains in accuracy through the inclusion of additional languages.
    In order to take advantage of treebanks in multiple languages, our multi-source system simply concatenates the training data from all non-target languages.
    In other words, the multi-source direct transfer parser for Danish will be trained by first concatenating the training corpora of the remaining eight languages, training a delexicalized parser on this data and then directly using this parser to analyze the Danish test data.
    For the multi-source projected parser, the procedure is identical to that in Section 3.2 except that we use the multi-source direct transfer model to seed the algorithm instead of the English-only direct transfer model.
    For these experiments we
