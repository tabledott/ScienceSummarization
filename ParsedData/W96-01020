  MBT: A Memory-Based Part Of Speech Tagger-Generator
  
    We introduce a memory-based approach to part of speech tagging.
    Memory-based learning is a form of supervised learning based on similarity-based reasoning.
    The part of speech tag of a word in a particular context is extrapolated from the most similar cases held in memory.
    Supervised learning approaches are useful when a tagged corpus is available as an example of the desired output of the tagger.
    Based on such a corpus, the tagger-generator automatically builds a tagger which is able to tag new text the same way, diminishing development time for the construction of a tagger considerably.
    Memory-based tagging shares this advantage with other statistical or machine learning approaches.
    Additional advantages specific to a memory-based approach include (i) the relatively small tagged corpus size sufficient for training, (ii) incremental learning, (iii) explanation capabilities, (iv) flexible integration of information in case re
