gory is s(finite)/can_up(john,friends).
    For this category, the pivot (which will turn out to be node [f]) will be defined by the nonchain rule (If there were other forms of the verb, these would be potential candidates, but would be eliminated by the chained_nodes check, as the semantic head relation requires identity of the verb form of a sentence and its VP head.)
    Again, we recursively generate for all the nonterminal elements of the righthand side of this rule, of which there are none.
    We must therefore connect the pivot [f] to the root [b].
    A chain rule whose semantic head matches the pivot must be chosen.
    The only choice rule is the rule Unifying in the pivot, we find that we must recursively generate the remaining RHS element np(_)/fr iends, and then connect the left-hand side node [e] with category vp(finite, [lex/up, np(3-sing)/john]) /call_up(john,friends) to the same root [b].
    The recursive generation yields a node covering the string &amp;quot;friends&amp;quot; following the
