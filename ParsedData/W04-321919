nce of these synonymbased techniques indicates that they have little value except as a baseline.
    The PR model generates plausible paraphrases for the overwhelming majority of test sentences, indicating that even the relatively high AER for non-identical words is not an obstacle to successful generation.
    Moreover, PR was able to generate a paraphrase for all 200 sentences (including the 59 MSA examples).
    The correlation between acceptability and PR sentence rank validates both the ranking algorithm and the evaluation methodology.
    In Table 2, the PR model scores significantly better than MSA in terms of the percentage of paraphrase candidates accepted by raters.
    Moreover, PR generates at least five (and often hundreds more) distinct paraphrases for each test sentence.
    Such perfect coverage on this dataset is perhaps fortuitous, but is nonetheless indicative of scalability.
    By contrast Barzilay &amp; Lee (2003) report being able to generate paraphrases for only 59 out of 484 sentences
