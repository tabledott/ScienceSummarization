to choose syntactic properties (expressed as trees in a Tree Adjoining Grammar) for the nodes in the input structure.
    This step can be seen as analogous to &amp;quot;supertagging&amp;quot; -(Bangalore and Joshi, 1-999), except that now supertags (i.e., names of trees which encode the syntactic properties of a lexical head) must be found for words in a tree rather than for words in a linear sequence.
    The Tree Chooser makes the simplifying assumptions that the choice of a tree for a node depends only on its daughter nodes, thus allowing for a top-down algorithm.
    The Tree Chooser draws on a tree model, which is a analysis in terms of syntactic dependency for 1,000,000 words of the Wall Street Journal (WSJ).3 The supertagged tree which is output from the Tree Chooser still does not fully determine the surface string, because there typically are different ways to attach a daughter node to her mother (for example, an adverb can be placed in different positions with respect to its verbal head).
