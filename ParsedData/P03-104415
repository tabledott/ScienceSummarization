xt-filtering power of the set as a quantitative measure of the goodness of the patterns.
    To conduct the text-filtering evaluation we need a binary relevance judgement for each document.
    This is obtained as follows.
    We introduce a cutoff threshold on document relevance; if the system has internal confidence of more than that a document is relevant, it labels as relevant externally for the purpose of scoring recall and precision.
    Otherwise it labels as non-relevant.4 The results of the pattern learner for the &#8220;Management Succession&#8221; scenario, with and without counter-training, are shown in Figure 1.
    The test sub-corpus consists of the 100 MUC-6 documents.
    The initial seed yields about 15% recall at 86% precision.
    The curve labeled Mono shows the performance of the baseline algorithm up to 150 iterations.
    It stops learning good patterns after 60 iterations, at 73% recall, from which point precision drops.
    The reason the recall appears to continue improving is that,
