cularly well represented in WordNet are compound nouns (47,000 entries) and multiword verbs (2,600 entries).
    Of these, we chose to specifically target two types of MWE: noun-noun (NN) compounds (e.g. computer network, workforce) and verb-particles (e.g. look on, eat up) due to their frequent occurrence in both decomposable and non-decomposable configurations, and also their disparate syntactic behaviours.
    We extracted the NN compounds from the 1996 Wall Street Journal data (WSJ, 31m words), and the verb-particles from the British National Corpus (BNC, 90m words: Burnard (2000)).
    The WSJ data is more tightly domain-constrained, and thus a more suitable source for NN compounds if we are to expect sentential context to reliably predict the semantics of the compound.
    The BNC data, on the other hand, contains more colloquial and prosaic texts and is thus a richer source of verb-particles.
    Our goal was to compare the distribution of different compound terms with their constituent words, to see i
