t clusters non-pronouns by their heads, and attaches a pronoun to the cluster which has no known conflicting type, number, or gender, and contains the closest antecedent for the pronoun.
    This system can be encoded in an MLN with just four rules.
    Three of them are the ones for enforcing agreement in type, number, and gender between a cluster and its members, as defined in the base MLN.
    The fourth rule is With a large but not infinite weight (e.g., 100), this rule has the effect of clustering non-pronouns by their heads, except when it violates the hard rules.
    The MLN can also include the apposition and predicate-nominal rules.
    As in the base MLN, we impose the same exponential prior on the number of non-empty clusters and that on the distance between a pronoun and its antecedent.
    This simple MLN is remarkably competitive, as we will see in the experiment section.
  
  
    Unsupervised learning in Markov logic maximizes the conditional log-likelihood where Z are unknown predicates.
