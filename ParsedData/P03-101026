of translation was opposite to the one described in Section 3.1.
    Therefore this comparison is not as objective as it could be.
    However, it gives us some idea into a comparison of MT and DTL.
    12http://www.crl.go.jp/jt/a132/members/mutiyama/jea/index.html experimental results indicate that DTL is more appropriate than MT in article alignment.
    Matsumoto and Tanaka (2002) attempted to align Japanese and English news articles in the Nikkei Industrial Daily.
    Their method achieved a 97% precision in aligning articles, which is quite high.
    They also applied their method to NHK broadcast news.
    However, they obtained a lower precision of 69.8% for the NHK corpus.
    Thus, the precision of their method depends on the corpora.
    Therefore, it is not clear whether their method would have achieved a high accuracy in the Yomiuri corpus treated in this paper.
    There are two significant differences between our work and previous works.
    (1) We have proposed AVSIM, which uses similarities in
