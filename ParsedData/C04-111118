um of 350 is-a relationships to manually evaluate (50 random words with top 3 system, top 3 WordNet, and human generated relationship)..
			We presented each of the 11 random samples to two human judges.
			The 50 randomly selected words, together with the system, human, and WordNet generated is-a relationships, were ran domly ordered.
			That way, there was no way for a judge to know the source of a relationship nor each system?s ranking of the relationships.
			For each relationship, we asked the judges to assign a score of correct, partially correct, or incorrect.
			We then computed the average precision of the system, human, and WordNet on each dataset.
			We also computed the percentage of times a correct rela tionship was found in the top 3 is-a relationships of a word and the mean reciprocal rank (MRR).
			For each word, a system receives an MRR score of 1 / M, where M is the rank of the first name judged correct.
			Table 5 shows the results comparing the two automatic systems.
