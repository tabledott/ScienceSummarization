 x up to m, while Equations (121)&#8212;(122) involve all powers of x.
    This is because the zk are not algebraically independent.
    In fact, for &gt; m, the coefficient of x0 on the right-hand side of Equation (122) must be zero.
    It follows that we can express z&#8216;k as a polynomial in zk, k =- 1,2, &#8226; &#8226; &#8226; , m&#8226; Using Equation (118) we can identify the coefficient of x4' in Equation (117).
    We obtain Equation (108) by combining Equations (117), (118), and the definitions (109)&#8212; (111) and (119).
