at there exists a small set of semantic relationships that NCs may imply.
    Downing (1977) argues that the semantics of NCs cannot be exhausted by any finite listing of relationships.
    Between these two extremes lies Warren&#8217;s (1978) taxonomy of six major semantic relations organized into a hierarchical structure.
    We have identified the 38 relations shown in Table 1.
    We tried to produce relations that correspond to the linguistic theories such as those of Levi and Warren, but in many cases these are inappropriate.
    Levi&#8217;s classes are too general for our purposes; for example, she collapses the &#8220;location&#8221; and &#8220;time&#8221; relationships into one single class &#8220;In&#8221; and therefore field mouse and autumnal rain belong to the same class.
    Warren&#8217;s classification schema is much more detailed, and there is some overlap between the top levels of Warren&#8217;s hierarchy and our set of relations.
    For example, our &#8220;Cause (2-1)&#8221; for flu virus
