ld use an algorithm which maximizes the Labelled Recall criterion, rather than the Labelled Tree criterion.
    The Labelled Recall Algorithm finds that tree TG which has the highest expected value for the Labelled Recall Rate, LINc (where L is the number of correct labelled constituents, and Nc is the number of nodes in the correct parse).
    This can be written as follows: It is not immediately obvious that the maximization of expression (2) is in fact different from the maximization of expression (1), but a simple example illustrates the difference.
    The following grammar generates four trees with equal probability: For the first tree, the probabilities of being correct are S: 100%; A:50%; and C: 25%.
    Similar counting holds for the other three.
    Thus, the expected value of L for any of these trees is 1.75.
    On the other hand, the optimal Labelled Recall parse is This tree has 0 probability according to the grammar, and thus is non-optimal according to the Labelled Tree Rate criterion.
