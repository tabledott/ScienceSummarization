tegorization information against existing lexical resources, we have also evaluated the information in the context of an actual parsing system.
    In particular we wanted to establish whether the subcategorization frequency information for individual verbs could be used to improve the accuracy of a parser that uses statistical techniques to rank analyses.
    The experiment used the same probabilistic parser and tag sequence grammar as are present in the acquisition system (see references above)&#8212;although the experiment does not in any way rely on the parsers or grammars being the same.
    We randomly selected a test set of 250 in-coverage sentences (of lengths 3-56 tokens, mean 18.2) from the Susanne treebank, retagged with possibly multiple tags per word, and measured the 'baseline' accuracy of the unlexicalized parser on the sentences using the now standard PARSEVAL/GEIG evaluation metrics of mean crossing brackets per sentence and (unlabelled) bracket recall and precision (e.g.
