familiarity throughout the paper with previous work on TAGs.

			semantics, or syntax.directed translation relies on such a methodology to some extent.
			However, in the case of TAGs, the compositional structure of the tree is not miro rored by its derivational structure, so that a method for constructing semantics based on the compositional syn- tactic structure will be inherently nonderivational, that is, construction of the semantics will be independent of the derivation of the tree, and therefore subsequent.
			On the other hand, a method mirroring the deriva- tional structure will not necessarily be compositional with respect to tile derived structures of expressions.
			AI+ tl~ough such a method would be quite different from ttle primarily compositional methods previously postulated, it may have advantages, given that certain aspects of language seem to be noncompositional.
