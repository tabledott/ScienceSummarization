ng 33 possible values.
    The grammar is designed to enumerate possible valencies for predicates by including separate rules for each pattern of possible complementation in English.
    The distinction between arguments and adjuncts is expressed by adjunction of adjuncts to maximal projections (XP &#8212;* XP Adjunct) as opposed to government of arguments (i.e. arguments are sisters within X] projections; X] &#8212;* X0 Arg]... ArgN).
    Each phrase structure schema is associated with one or more GR specifications which can be conditioned on feature values instantiated at parse time and which yield a rule-to-rule mapping from local trees to GRs.
    The set of GRs associated with a given derivation define a connected, directed graph with individual nodes representing lemmaaffix-tags and arcs representing named grammatical relations.
    The encoding of this mapping within the grammar is similar to that of F-structure mapping in LFG.
    However, the connected graph is not constructed and completeness and co
