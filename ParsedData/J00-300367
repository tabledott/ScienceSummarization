dition a recognizer LM on left-to-right DA predictions and are able to show reductions in word error rate of 1% on task-oriented corpora.
    Most similar to our own work, but still in a task-oriented domain, the work by Taylor et al. (1998) combines DA likelihoods from prosodic models with those from 1-best recognition output to condition the recognizer LM, again achieving an absolute reduction in word error rate of 1%, as disappointing as the 0.3% improvement in our experiments.
    Related computational tasks beyond DA classification and speech recognition have received even less attention to date.
    We already mentioned Warnke et al. (1997) and Finke et al.
    (1998), who both showed that utterance segmentation and classification can be integrated into a single search process.
    Fukada et al. (1998) investigate augmenting DA tagging with more detailed semantic &amp;quot;concept&amp;quot; tags, as a preliminary step toward an interlingua-based dialogue translation system.
