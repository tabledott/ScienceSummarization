Net.
    When the threshold is set to maximize precision, the results are highly reliable and can be used to support an interactive application, such as machine-assisted translation, with the goal of reducing the amount of interaction.
    Although we have looked at only a few examples, it is clear that, given WordNet and a large enough corpus, the methods outlined for training on monosemous relatives can be generalized to build training materials for thousands of polysemous words.
  
  
    We are indebted to the other members of the WordNet group who have provided advice and technical support: Christiane Fellbaum, Shari Landes, and Randee Tengi.
    We are also grateful to Paul Bagyenda, Ben Johnson-Laird and Joshua Schecter.
    We thank Scott Wayland, Tim Allison and Jill Hollifield for tagging the serve and hard corpora.
    Finally we are grateful to the three anonymous CL reviewers for their comments and advice.
