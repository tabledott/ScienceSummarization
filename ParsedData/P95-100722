 these is that even quite crude corpus statistics can provide information about the syntax of compound nouns.
    At the very least, this information can be applied in broad coverage parsing to assist in the control of search.
    I have also shown that with a corpus of moderate size it is possible to get reasonable results without using a tagger or parser by employing a customised training pattern.
    While using windowed co-occurrence did not help here, it is possible that under more data sparse conditions better performance could be achieved by this method.
    The significance of the use of conceptual association deserves some mention.
    I have argued that without it a broad coverage system would be impossible.
    This is in contrast to previous work on conceptual association where it resulted in little improvement on a task which could already be performed.
    In this study, not only has the technique proved its worth by supporting generality, but through generalisation of training information it ou
