ing a frequency cutoff of 10 results in a set of 425 lexical categories.
    This set has excellent coverage on unseen data (Clark and Curran 2004a) and is a manageable size for adding the head and dependency information, and also mapping to grammatical relations for evaluation purposes (Section 11).
    Second, for the normal-form model, and also the hybrid dependency model described in Section 10.2.1, two types of contraints on the grammar rules are used.
    Section 3 described the Eisner constraints, in which any constituent which is the result of a forward composition cannot serve as the primary (left) functor in another forward composition or forward application; an analogous constraint applies for backward composition.
    The second type of constraint only allows two categories to combine if they have been seen to combine in the training data.
    Although this constraint only permits category combinations seen in Sections 02&#8211;21 of CCGbank, we have found that it is detrimental to neither parser
