, and WordNet synonym matching modules were used.
    TER was also used in case insensitive mode.
    We show the Pearson and Spearman correlation numbers of TERp and the other automatic metrics on the optimization set and the test set in Tables 2 and 3.
    Correlation numbers that are statistically indistinguishable from the highest correlation, using a 95% confidence interval, are shown in bold and numbers that are actually not statistically significant correlations are marked with a &#8224;.
    TERp has the highest Pearson correlation in all conditions, although not all differences are statistically significant.
    When examining the Spearman correlation, TERp has the highest correlation on the segment and system levels, but performs worse than METEOR on the document level Spearman correlatons.
    TERp was one of 39 automatic metrics evaluated in the 2008 NIST Metrics MATR Challenge.
    In order to evaluate the state of automatic MT evaluation, NIST tested metrics across a number of conditions across
