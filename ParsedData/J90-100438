ified values in the LFG semantic projection) at the description level.
    Under such conditions, completeness and coherence become important.
    For example, suppose a grammar associated the following strings and logical forms.
    'John ate a nice yellow banana' The generator of Section 3.1 would generate any of these sentences for the logical form eat(john, X) (because of its incoherence) and would generate &amp;quot;John ate&amp;quot; for the logical form eat(john, banana) (because of its incompleteness).
    Coherence can be achieved by removing the confusion between object-level and metalevel variables mentioned above; that is, by treating logical-form variables as constants at the description level.
    In practice, this can be achieved by replacing each variable in the semantics from which we are generating by a new distinct constant (for instance with the numbervars predicate built into some implementations of Prolog).
    These new constants will not unify with any augmentations to the semantics.
