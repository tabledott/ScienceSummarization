ist of personal names.&amp;quot; Note that in Chang et al. 's model the p(rule 9) is estimated as the product of the probability of finding G1 in the first position of a two-hanzi given name and the probability of finding G2 in the second position of a two-hanzi given name, and we use essentially the same estimate here, with some modifications as described later on.
    This model is easily incorporated into the segmenter by building a WFST restricting the names to the four licit types, with costs on the arcs for any particular name summing to an estimate of the cost of that name.
    This WFST is then summed with the WFST implementing the dictionary and morphological rules, and the transitive closure of the resulting transducer is computed; see Pereira, Riley, and Sproat (1994) for an explanation of the notion of summing WFSTs.12 Conceptual Improvements over Chang et al. 's Model.
    There are two weaknesses in Chang et al. 's model, which we improve upon.
    First, the model assumes independence between t
