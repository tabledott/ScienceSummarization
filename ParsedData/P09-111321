t useful for parameter setting.
    At most recall levels, the combination of syntactic and lexical features offers a substantial improvement in precision over either of these feature sets on its own.
    Human evaluation was performed by evaluators on Amazon&#8217;s Mechanical Turk service, shown to be effective for natural language annotation in Snow et al. (2008).
    We ran three experiments: one using only syntactic features; one using only lexical features; and one using both syntactic and lexical features.
    For each of the 10 relations that appeared most frequently in our test data (according to our classifier), we took samples from the first 100 and 1000 instances of this relation generated in each experiment, and sent these to Mechanical Turk for results per relation, using stratified samples.
    &#8216;Average&#8217; gives the mean precision of the 10 relations.
    Key: Syn = syntactic features only.
    Lex = lexical features only.
    We use stratified samples because of the overabundance of
