ically similar.
    Figure 2 shows an example list of NEs and their possible Russian transliterations.
    Approaches that attempt to use these two characteristics separately to identify NEs across languages would have significant shortcomings.
    Transliteration based approaches require a good model, typically handcrafted or trained on a clean set of transliteration pairs.
    On the other hand, time sequence similarity based approaches would incorrectly match words which happen to have similar time signatures (e.g.
    Taliban and Afghanistan in recent news).
    We introduce an algorithm we call co-ranking which exploits these observations simultaneously to match NEs on one side of the bilingual corpus to their counterparts on the other.
    We use a Discrete Fourier Transform (Arfken, 1985) based metric for computing similarity of time distributions, and we score NEs similarity with a linear transliteration model.
    For a given NE in one language, the transliteration model chooses a top ranked list of
