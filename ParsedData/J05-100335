hm we use is related to the generalization of boosting methods to ranking problems in Freund et al. (1998); we also introduce an approach related to the conditional log-linear models of Ratnaparkhi, Roukos, and Ward (1994), Papineni, Roukos, and Ward (1997, 1998), Johnson et al.
    (1999), Riezler et al. (2002), and Och and Ney (2002).
    Section 4.1 gives a formal definition of the reranking problem.
    Section 4.2 introduces loss functions for reranking that are analogous to the LogLoss and ExpLoss functions in section 3.2.
    Section 4.3 describes a general approach to feature selection methods with these loss functions.
    Section 4.4 describes a first algorithm for the exponential loss (ExpLoss) function; section 4.5 introduces a more efficient algorithm for the case of ExpLoss.
    Finally, section 4.6 describes issues in feature selection algorithms for the LogLoss function.
    We use the following notation in the rest of this article: tree and the underlying sentence (i.e., each xi,j is a pair b
