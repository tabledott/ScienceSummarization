 thresholds described in Section 3.8.)
    After the extension of all partial hypotheses in S, a pruning step is carried out for the hypotheses in the newly generated set Snew.
    The pruning is based on two simple sorting steps on the list of partial hypotheses Snew.
    (Instead of sorting the partial hypotheses, we might have used hashing.)
    First, the partial hypotheses are sorted according to their translation scores (within the implementation, all probabilities are converted into translation scores by taking the negative logarithm &#8722; log()).
    Cardinality pruning can then be carried out simply by running down the list of hypotheses, starting with the maximum-probability hypothesis, and applying the cardinality thresholds.
    Then, the partial hypotheses are sorted a second time according to their coverage set C and their translation score.
    After this sorting step, all partial hypotheses that cover the same subset of source sentence positions are located in consecutive fragments in the ov
