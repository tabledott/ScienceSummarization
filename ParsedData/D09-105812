  These features are combined with conventional features based on words and part-of-speech tags.
    The new feature set is then used within a conventional discriminative, supervised approach, such as the averaged perceptron algorithm.
    The important point is that their approach uses unlabeled data only for the construction of a new feature set, and never affects to learning algorithms.
    It is straightforward to incorporate clusterbased features within the SS-SCM approach described in this paper.
    We simply use the clusterbased feature-vector representation f(x, y) introduced by (Koo et al., 2008) as the basis of our approach.
    Previous work (McDonald and Pereira, 2006; Carreras, 2007) has shown that second-order parsing models, which include information from &#8220;sibling&#8221; or &#8220;grandparent&#8221; relationships between dependencies, can give significant improvements in accuracy over first-order parsing models.
    In principle it would be straightforward to extend the SS-SCM approach t
