st of the acquisition curves displayed positive slopes even at the end of the 200 words.
    This implies that more category words would likely have been found if the users had reviewed more than 200 words.
    The one exception, again, was the Energy category, which we will discuss in the next section.
    The size of the ranked lists ranged from 442 for the financial category to 919 for the military category, so it would be interesting to know how many category members would have been found if we had given the entire lists to our judges.
  
  
    When we first began this work, we were unsure about what types of categories would be amenable to this approach.
    So we experimented with a number of different categories.
    Fortunately, most of them worked fairly well, but some of them did not.
    We do not claim to understand exactly what types of categories will work well and which ones will not, but our early experiences did shed some light on the strengths and weaknesses of this approach.
