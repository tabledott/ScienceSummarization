    We will concentrate on four types of named entities: persons, locations, organizations and names of miscellaneous entities that do not belong to the previous three groups.
    The shared task of CoNLL-2002 dealt with named entity recognition for Spanish and Dutch (Tjong Kim Sang, 2002).
    The participants of the 2003 shared task have been offered training and test data for two other European languages: English and German.
    They have used the data for developing a named-entity recognition system that includes a machine learning component.
    The shared task organizers were especially interested in approaches that made use of resources other than the supplied training data, for example gazetteers and unannotated data.
  
  
    In this section we discuss the sources of the data that were used in this shared task, the preprocessing steps we have performed on the data, the format of the data and the method that was used for evaluating the participating systems.
