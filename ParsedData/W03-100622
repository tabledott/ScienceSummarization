one depends on the kind of grammar that is used.
    The LDA output using SEM-TAG is already annotated with semantic role information because it is encoded in the grammar itself.
    On the other hand, the LDA output using SYNT-TAG contains strictly syntactic information.
    In this case, we use the highest performing model from Section 6 in order to label arguments with semantic roles.
    Evaluation of prediction of semantic roles takes the following form.
    Each argument labeled by a semantic role in the test corpus is treated as one trial.
    Certain aspects of this trial are always checked for correctness.
    These include checking that the semantic role and the dependency-link are correct.
    There are other aspects which may or may not be checked, depending on the type of evaluation.
    One aspect, &#8220;bnd,&#8221; is whether or not the argument&#8217;s bracketing as specified in the dependency tree is correct.
    Another aspect, &#8220;arg,&#8221; is whether or not the headword of the argume
