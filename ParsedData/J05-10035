ne an initial ranking of these parses.
    A second model then attempts to improve upon this initial ranking, using additional features of the tree as evidence.
    The strength of our approach is that it allows a tree to be represented as an arbitrary set of features, without concerns about how these features interact or overlap and without the need to define a derivation which takes these features into account.
    We introduce a new method for the reranking task, based on the boosting approach to ranking problems described in Freund et al. (1998).
    The algorithm can be viewed as a feature selection method, optimizing a particular loss function (the exponential loss function) that has been studied in the boosting literature.
    We applied the boosting method to parsing the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) treebank (Marcus, Santorini, and Marcinkiewicz 1993).
    The method combines the log-likelihood under a baseline model (that of Collins [1999]) with evidence from an additional 500,000 features over parse tr
