ses in the literature.
    Then we propose and evaluate methods for combining them.
    We use measures from information retrieval to quantify and evaluate our results.
  
  
    Here we present the results of a study investigating the ability of naive subjects to identify the same segments in a corpus of spoken narrative discourse.
    Our first goal is purely exploratory.
    Despite the wide agreement that discourse structure and linguistic form are mutually constraining, there is little agreement on how to determine the structure of any particular discourse.
    Thus we do not assume that there are &amp;quot;correct&amp;quot; segmentations against which to judge subjects' responses.
    Also, as discussed in our previous work (Passormeau and Litman 1996), the subjects' performance suggests that segmentation is a fuzzy phenomenon.
    Because our study is exploratory, we took the conservative approach of defining a very open-ended segmentation task that allowed subjects great freedom in the number and size
