ments to evaluate them, and &#8226; we provide our annotated corpus and trained POS tagger to the research community.
    Beyond these specific contributions, we see this work as a case study in how to rapidly engineer a core NLP system for a new and idiosyncratic dataset.
    This project was accomplished in 200 person-hours spread across 17 people and two months.
    This was made possible by two things: (1) an annotation scheme that fits the unique characteristics of our data and provides an appropriate level of linguistic detail, and (2) a feature set that captures Twitter-specific properties and exploits existing resources such as tag dictionaries and phonetic normalization.
    The success of this approach demonstrates that with careful design, supervised machine learning can be applied to rapidly produce effective language technology in new domains.
  
  
    Annotation proceeded in three stages.
    For Stage 0, we developed a set of 20 coarse-grained tags based on several treebanks but with some addi
