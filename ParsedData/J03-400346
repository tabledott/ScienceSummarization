pendency accuracies are given for section 0 of the treebank in table 4.
    Table 5 gives a breakdown of the accuracies by dependency type.
    Table 6 shows the dependency accuracies for eight subtypes of dependency that together account for 94% of all dependencies: complement, or ( VP TAG ** ), where ** is any complement except VP-C (i.e., auxiliary-verb&#8212;verb dependencies are excluded).
    The most frequent verb complements, subject-verb and object-verb, are recovered with over 95% precision and 92% recall.
    A conclusion to draw from these accuracies is that the parser is doing very well at recovering the core structure of sentences: complements, sentential heads, and base-NP relationships (NP chunks) are all recovered with over 90% accuracy.
    The main sources of errors are adjuncts.
    Coordination is especially difficult for the parser, most likely because it often involves a dependency between two content words, leading to very sparse statistics.
    The distance measure, whose implementati
