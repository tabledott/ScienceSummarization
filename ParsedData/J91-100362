m that replaces the target.
    A new sense-network path is computed between the source and the art form ([5]).
    I will now describe how meta5 recognizes some metonymies and metaphors.
    In (19), between 'Bach' and the twelfth sense of 'play' in meta5's lexicon (meaning &amp;quot;to play music&amp;quot;), there is a chain of metonymies plus a literal relation.
    The chain consists of ARTIST FOR ART FORM and CONTAINER FOR CONTENTS metonymies.
    Both metonymic concepts are target-driven.
    In ARTIST FOR ART FORM the inference is from the ARTIST (the target) to the ART FORM (the source), so the substitute metonym replaces the target (the ARTIST) if the inference is successful.
    The sense-frames of the verb sense play12 and the noun senses musicl and johann_sebastian_bach are shown in Figure 5.
    The semantic relation results from matching the object preference of play12, which is for music, against the surface object, which is 'Bach,' short for 'Johann Sebastian Bach.'
    The preference is the s
