    [h : expect(ee, x0e, h0e)][h0e =q hc]{} Although these uses require different lexical entries, the semantic predicate expect used in the two examples is the same, in contrast to Montagovian approaches, which either relate two distinct predicates via meaning postulates, or require an additional semantic combinator.
    The HPSG account does not involve such additional machinery, but its formal underpinnings have been unclear: in this algebra, it can be seen that the desired result arises as a consequence of the restrictions on variable assignments imposed by the equalities.
    This completes our sketch of the algebra necessary to encode semantic composition in the ERG.
    We have constrained accessibility by enumerating the possible labels for holes and by stipulating the contents of the hooks.
    We believe that the handle, index, external argument triple constitutes all the semantic information that a sign should make accessible to a functor.
