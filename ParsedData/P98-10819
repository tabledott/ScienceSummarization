task can be judged by the two baseline measurements in Table 2 below, representing a completely random choice from the potential tags for each token (Random) and selection of the lexically most likely tag (LexProb).
    For our experiment, we divide the corpus into three parts.
    The first part, called Train, consists of 80% of the data (931062 tokens), constructed 3Ditto tags are used for the components of multitoken units, e.g. if &amp;quot;as well as&amp;quot; is taken to be a coordination conjunction, it is tagged &amp;quot;as_CC-1 well_CC-2 as_CC-3&amp;quot;, using three related but different ditto tags. by taking the first eight utterances of every ten.
    This part is used to train the individual taggers.
    The second part, Tune, consists of 10% of the data (every ninth utterance, 114479 tokens) and is used to select the best tagger parameters where applicable and to develop the combination methods.
    The third and final part, Test, consists of the remaining 10% (115101 tokens) and is used for t
