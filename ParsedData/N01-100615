nsure fairness in the comparisons.
    To minimize implementation differences, all the code was written in C++ and classes were shared among the systems whenever possible.
    For each task, the same training set was provided to each system, and the set of possible rule templates was kept the same.
    Furthermore, extra care was taken to run all comparable experiments on the same machine and under the same memory and processor load conditions.
    To provide a broad comparison between the systems, three NLP tasks with different properties were chosen as the experimental domains.
    The first task, part-of-speech tagging, is one where the commitment assumption seems intuitively valid and the samples are not independent.
    The second task, prepositional phrase attachment, has examples which are independent from each other.
    The last task is text chunking, where both independence and commitment assumptions do not seem to be valid.
