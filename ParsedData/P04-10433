of the above two with the polynomial kernel of standard flat features.
    Experiments on Support Vector Machines using the above kernels show an improvement of the state-of-the-art for PropBank argument classification.
    On the contrary, FrameNet semantic parsing seems to not take advantage of the structural information provided by our kernels.
    The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 defines the Predicate Argument Extraction problem and the standard solution to solve it.
    In Section 3 we present our kernels whereas in Section 4 we show comparative results among SVMs using standard features and the proposed kernels.
    Finally, Section 5 summarizes the conclusions.
  
  
    Given a sentence in natural language and the target predicates, all arguments have to be recognized.
    This problem can be divided into two subtasks: (a) the detection of the argument boundaries, i.e. all its compounding words and (b) the classification of the argument type, e.g.
    Arg0 or ArgM in Prop
