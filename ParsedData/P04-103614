cision in the region of 60%.
    We test this below on the SENSEVAL-2 English all-words data.
  
  
    In order to see how well the automatically acquired predominant sense performs on a WSD task from which the WordNet sense ordering has not been taken, we use the SENSEVAL-2 all-words data (Palmer et al., 2001).
    7 This is a hand-tagged test suite of 5,000 words of running text from three articles from the Penn Treebank II.
    We use an allwords task because the predominant senses will reflect the sense distributions of all nouns within the documents, rather than a lexical sample task, where the target words are manually determined and the results will depend on the skew of the words in the sample.
    We do not assume that the predominant sense is a method of WSD in itself.
    To disambiguate senses a system should take context into account.
    However, it is important to know the performance of this heuristic for any systems that use it.
    We generated a thesaurus entry for all polysemous nouns in
