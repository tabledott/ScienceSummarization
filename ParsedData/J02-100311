    A GRE algorithm is successful with respect to a given situation (i.e., with respect to a KB and a target) if it produces a distinguishing description of r in that situation.
    We will call an algorithm complete if it is successful in every situation in which a distinguishing description exists.
    Success is not always possible: the properties in the KB may not be sufficient for individuating a given object.
    Such no-win situations will not be held against an algorithm.
    The Incremental Algorithm generates descriptions that contain set intersection as their only Boolean operation.
    We define a GRE algorithm to be intersectively complete if it has the following property: whenever an object can be characterized by intersecting a finite number of properties, the algorithm will find such an intersection.
    We would like to prove the Incremental Algorithm to be intersectively complete, but we will meet a few obstacles before we get there.
    One assumption without which the Incre
