as the estimate for generating the remainder of the sentence by the pruned parses.
    With this estimate we can calculate the sum of the probabilities for all the pruned parses which originate from that decision.
    This approach gives us a slight overestimate of the total sum, but because this total sum acts simply as a weighting factor, it has little effect on learning.
    What is important is that this estimate minimizes the effect of the pruned parses&#8217; probabilities on the part of the training process which occurs after the probabilities of the best parses have been calculated.
    After estimating P(d1,..., dm|w1,..., wn), training requires that we estimate the first derivative of (the negative log of) this probability with respect to each of the network&#8217;s parameters.
    The contribution to this derivative of the numerator in the above equation is the same as in the generative case, just scaled by the denominator.
    The difference between the two learning methods is that we also need to
