rameter values are equally likely; when Q &gt; 1, multinomials that are closer to uniform are prior is conjugate to a distribution if the posterior has the same form as the pri d B as a function of B. mation.
    For a sequence of draws x = ... , xn) from a multinomial distribution B with observed counts ... , nK, a symmetric prior over B yields the MAP estimate Bk = When Q 1, standard MLE techniques such as EM can be used to find the MAP estimate simply by adding of size Q 1 to each of the expected counts nk at each iteration.
    However, when Q &lt; 1, the values of B that set one or more of the Bk equal to 0 can have infinitely high posterior probability, meaning that MAP estimation can yield degenerate solutions.
    If, instead of estimating B, we integrate over all possible values, we no longer encounter such difficulties.
    Instead, the probability that outcome xi value of a latent variable, t, from observed data, w, chooses a value of t robust to uncertainty in B.
