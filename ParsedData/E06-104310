e reflecting the degree of lexical fixedness for the target pair.
    We assume that the target pair is lexically fixed to the extent that its deviates from the average of its variants.
    Our measure calculates this deviation, normalized using the sample&#8217;s standard deviation: Compared to compositional verb+noun combinations, VNICs are expected to appear in more restricted syntactic forms.
    To quantify the syntactic fixedness of a target verb&#8211;noun pair, we thus need to: (i) identify relevant syntactic patterns, i.e., those that help distinguish VNICs from literal verb+noun combinations; (ii) translate the frequency distribution of the target pair in the identified patterns into a measure of syntactic fixedness.
    Determining a unique set of syntactic patterns appropriate for the recognition of all idiomatic combinations is difficult indeed: exactly which forms an idiomatic combination can occur in is not entirely predictable (Sag et al., 2002).
    Nonetheless, there are hypotheses about the
