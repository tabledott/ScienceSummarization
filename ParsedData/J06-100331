ymy relation.
  We implemented each measure, and used the Brown Corpus as the basis for the frequency counts needed in the information-based approaches.6 4.
  Comparison with Human Ratings of Semantic Relatedness In this section we compare the five chosen measures by how well they reflect human judgments of semantic relatedness.
  In addition, we will use the data that we obtain in this section to set closeness thresholds for the application-based evaluation of each measure in Section 5.
  4.1 Data As part of an investigation into ?the relationship between similarity of context and similarity of meaning (synonymy)?, Rubenstein and Goodenough (1965) obtained ?synonymy judgements?
  from 51 human subjects on 65 pairs of words.
  The pairs ranged from ?highly synonymous?
  to ?semantically unrelated?, and the subjects were asked to rate them, on the scale of 0.0 to 4.0, according to their ?similarity of mean- ing?
  (see Table 1, columns 2 and 3).
  For a similar study, Miller and Charles (1991) chose 30 pairs f
