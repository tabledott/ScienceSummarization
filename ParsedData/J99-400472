 framework, but with the added benefit that they apply to all commutative w-continuous semirings.
    The most accessible introduction to this literature we have found is by Kuich (1997).
    There are also books by Salomaa and Soittola (1978) and Kuich and Salomaa (1986).
    One piece of work deserves special mention.
    Teitelbaum (1973) showed that any semiring could be used in the CKY algorithm, laying the foundation for much of the work that followed.
    In summary, this paper synthesizes work from several different related fields, including deductive parsing, statistical parsing, and formal language theory; we emulate and expand on the earlier synthesis of Teitelbaum.
    The synthesis here is powerful: by generalizing and integrating many results, we make the computation of a much wider variety of values possible.
    There has also been recent similar work by Tendeau (1997b, 1997a).
    Tendeau (1997b) gives an Earley-like algorithm that can be adapted to work with complete semirings satisfying cer
