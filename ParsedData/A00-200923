Finally, further experimentation with the size of the windows of context seems warranted.
    The current formulation is based on a combination of intuition and empirical study.
    An algorithm to determine optimal windows sizes is currently under development.
  
  
    This paper shows that word sense disambiguation accuracy can be improved by combining a number of simple classifiers into an ensemble.
    A methodology for formulating an ensemble of Naive Bayesian classifiers is presented, where each member classifier is based on co&#8212;occurrence features extracted from a different sized window of context.
    This approach was evaluated using the widely studied nouns line and interest, which are disambiguated with accuracy of 88% and 89%, which rivals the best previously published results.
  
  
    This work extends ideas that began in collaboration with Rebecca Bruce and Janyce Wiebe.
    Claudia Leacock and Raymond Mooney provided valuable assistance with the line data.
