ndard word alignments for small samples of the training data, which we use as the alignment discriminative training set and alignment test set.
    Translation quality is evaluated by translating a held-out translation test set.
    An additional translation set called the Maximum BLEU set is employed by the SMT system to train the weights associated with the components of its log-linear model (Och, 2003).
    The training corpora are publicly available: both the Arabic/English data and the French/English Hansards were released by LDC.
    We created the manual word alignments ourselves, following the Blinker guidelines (Melamed, 1998).
    To train our baseline systems we follow a standard procedure.
    The models were trained two times, first using French or Arabic as the source language and then using English as the source language.
    For each training direction, we run GIZA++ (Och and Ney, 2003), specifying 5 iterations of Model 1, 4 iterations of the HMM model (Vogel et al., 1996), and 4 iterations of
