urther by 3.2% when POS tags were taken into account.
    The results for this tuned model are also given in Table 9.
    Finally, Lauer conducted an experiment with human judges to assess the upper bound for the bracketing task.
    An average accuracy of 81.50% was obtained.
    We replicated Lauer&#8217;s (1995) results for compound noun bracketing using the same test set.
    We compared the performance of the adjacency and dependency models (see (4) and (5)), but instead of relying on a corpus and a thesaurus, we estimated the relevant probabilities using web counts.
    The latter were obtained using inflected queries (see Section 2) and Altavista&#8217;s NEAR operator.
    Ties were resolved by defaulting to the most frequent analysis (i.e., left-branching).
    To gauge the performance of the web-based models we compared them against their BNC-based alternatives; the performance of the best Altavista model was significantly higher than that of the best BNC model (see Table 8).
    A comparison with th
