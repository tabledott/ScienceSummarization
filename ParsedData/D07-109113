am) is straight-forward.
			5.2 Combination of Components.
			As in phrase-based models, factored translation models can be seen as the combination of several components (language model, reordering model,translation steps, generation steps).
			These compo nents define one or more feature functions that are combined in a log-linear model: p(e|f) = 1 Z exp n?
			i=1 ?ihi(e, f) (1) Z is a normalization constant that is ignored in practice.
			To compute the probability of a translation e given an input sentence f, we have to evaluate eachfeature function hi.
			For instance, the feature func tion for a bigram language model component is (m is the number of words ei in the sentence e): hLM(e, f) = pLM(e) = p(e1) p(e2|e1)..p(em|em?1) (2)Let us now consider the feature functions introduced by the translation and generation steps of fac tored translation models.
			The translation of the input sentence f into the output sentence e breaks down to a set of phrase translations {(f?j , e?j)}.
			For a translation step
