be chosen for the particular corpus at hand.
    Note further that when these conditions are met, the exact probability distribution for the lexical Si parameters does not have much influence on the preferred alignment.
    The bilingual correspondence lexicons we have employed are shown in figure 5.
    These lexical items are quite common in the LegCo domain.
    Items like &amp;quot;C.B.E.&amp;quot; stand for honorific titles such as &amp;quot;Commander of the British Empire&amp;quot;; the other cues are self-explanatory.
    The cues nearly always appear 1-to-1 and the differences Oi therefore have a mean of zero.
    Given the relative unimportance of the exact distributions, all were simply assumed to be normally distributed with a variance of 0.07 instead of sampling each parameter individually.
    This variance is fairly sharp, but nonetheless, conservatively reflects a lower reliability than most of the cues actually possess.
    Using the lexical cue extensions, the Type I results on the same test
