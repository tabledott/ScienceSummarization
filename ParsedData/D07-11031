nd feature weights, and much discussion has been made of how to make the estimates of probabilites, how to smooth these estimates, and what features are most useful for discriminating among the translations.However, a cursory glance at phrasetables pro duced often suggests that many of the translations are wrong or will never be used in any translation.
			On the other hand, most obvious ways of reducing the bulk usually lead to a reduction in translation quality as measured by BLEU score.
			This has led toan impression that these pairs must contribute some thing in the grand scheme of things and, certainly, more data is better than less.Nonetheless, this bulk comes at a cost.
			Large ta bles lead to large data structures that require moreresources and more time to process and, more im portantly, effort directed in handling large tablescould likely be more usefully employed in more fea tures or more sophisticated search.
			In this paper, we show that it is possible to prune phrasetables using a straightfor
