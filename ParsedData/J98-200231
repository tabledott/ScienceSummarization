ins an oversimplified assumption, and the problem is especially pressing when rare words are involved.
    Rare words may not be observed at a slot of interest in the data simply because they are rare, and not because they are unfit for that particular slot.9 To see how rare is too rare for our method, consider the following example.
    Suppose that the class BIRD contains 10 words, bird, swallow, crow, eagle, parrot, waxwing, etc.
    Consider co-occurrence data having 8 occurrences of bird, 2 occurrences of swallow, 1 occurrence of crow, 1 occurrence of eagle, and 0 occurrence of all other words, as part of, say, 100 data obtained for the subject slot of verb fly.
    For this data set, our method would select the model that generalizes bird, swallow, etc. to the class BIRD, since the sum of the data and parameter description lengths for the BIRD subtree is 76.57 + 3.32 = 79.89 if generalized, and 53.73 + 33.22 = 86.95 if not generalized.
    For comparison, consider the data with 10 occurrences of bird, 3
