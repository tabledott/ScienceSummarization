ly, substantial linguistic processing may be required for a system to make these inferences, and world knowledge is hard to make available to a domain-independent program.
    An important strategy in this area is of course the development of annotated corpora than can facilitate the machine learning of such ordering inferences.
    This paper 1 investigates a machine learning approach for temporally ordering events in natural language texts.
    In Section 2, we describe the annotation scheme and annotated corpora, and the challenges posed by them.
    A basic learning approach is described in Section 3.
    To address data sparseness, we used temporal reasoning as an over-sampling method to dramatically expand the amount of training data.
    As we will discuss in Section 5, there are no standard algorithms for making these inferences that we can compare against.
    We believe strongly that in such situations, it&#8217;s worthwhile for computational linguists to devote considerable effort to developing ins
