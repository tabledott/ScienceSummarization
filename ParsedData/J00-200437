iest to predict correctly.
    Winner-take-all link assignment methods, such as the competitive linking algorithm, can prevent links based on indirect associations (see Section 4.2), thereby leveraging their accuracy on the more confident links to raise the accuracy of the less confident links.
    For example, suppose that u1 and u2 co-occur with v1 and v2 in the training data, and the model estimates score(ui,vi) = .05, score (u1, v2) = .02, and score(u2, v2) = .01.
    According to the one-to-one assumption, (ui, v2) is an indirect association and the correct translation of 02 is u2.
    To the extent that the one-to-one assumption is valid, it reduces the probability of spurious links for the rarer words.
    The more incorrect candidate translations can be eliminated for a given rare word, the more likely the correct translation is to be found.
    So, the probability of a correct match for a rare word is proportional to the fraction of words around it that can be linked with higher confidence.
