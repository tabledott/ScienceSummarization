d, with performance being reasonably good on models with low-order marginals (e.g., 63% of the test set was tagged correctly with Model 1 using parameters estimated in this manner) but poorer on models with higher-order marginals, such as Model 4.
    Work is needed to identify and constrain the parameters that cannot be estimated from the available data and to determine the amount of data needed for this procedure.
    We also hope to integrate probabilistic disambiguation models, of the type described in this paper, with a constraint-based knowledge base such as WordNet.
    In the past, there have been two types of approaches to word sense disambiguation: 1) a probabilistic approach such as that described here which bases the choice of sense tag on the observed joint distribution of the tags and contextual features, and 2) a symbolic knowledge based approach that postulates some kind of relational or constraint structure among the words to be tagged.
    We hope to combine these methodologies and thereby d
