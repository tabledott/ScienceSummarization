ntually occur with a cue for an NP argument, if enough text is considered.
    A learner that considers a single occurrence of verb followed by a cue to be conclusive evidence will eventually come to the false conclusion that arrive is transitive.
    In other words, the information provided by the cues will eventually be washed out by the noise.
    This problem is inherent in learning from naturally occurring language, since infallible parsing is not possible.
    The only way to prevent it is to consider the frequency with which each verb occurs with cues for each frame.
    In other words, to consider each occurrence of V without a cue for S as a small bit of evidence against V being able to occur in frame S. This section describes a statistical technique for weighing such evidence.
    Given a syntactic frame S, the statistical model treats each verb V as analogous to a biased coin and each occurrence of V as analogous to a flip of that coin.
    An occurrence that is followed by a cue for S corresponds
