 for exhaustively learning allrules between any pair of templates in a given corpus is to restrict the structure of templates.
			Typi cally, a template is restricted to be a path in a parse tree between two variable nodes (Lin and Pantel, 2001; Ibrahim et al, 2003).
			Following this approach, we chose the structure of unary templates to be paths as well, where oneend of the path is the template?s variable.
			How ever, paths with one variable have more expressive power than paths between two variables, since the combination of two unary paths may generate a binary template that is not a path.
			For example, the combination of ?X call indictable?
			and ?call Y indictable?
			is the template ?X call Y indictable?, which is not a path between X and Y . For every noun node v in a parsed sentence, we generate templates with v as a variable as follows: 1.
			Traverse the path from v towards the root of.

			Whenever a candidate pred icate is encountered (any noun, adjective or verb) the path f
