mar inference to PCFG parameter estimation by introducing a context-free rule for each possible adapted subtree, but such an attempt would fail because the number of such adapted subtrees, and hence the number of corresponding rules, is unbounded.
    However nonparametric Bayesian inference techniques permit us to sample from this infinite set of adapted subtrees, and only require us to instantiate the finite number of them needed to analyse the finite training data.
    An adaptor grammar is a 7-tuple (N, W, R, 5, 0, A, C) where (N, W, R, 5, 0) is a PCFG with nonterminals N, terminals W, rules R, start symbol 5 E N and rule probabilities 0, where &#952;r is the probability of rule r E R, A C_ N is the set of adapted nonterminals and C is a vector of adaptors indexed by elements of A, so CX is the adaptor for adapted nonterminal X E A.
    Informally, an adaptor CX nondeterministically maps a stream of trees from a base distribution HX whose support is TX (the set of subtrees whose root node is X E N generat
