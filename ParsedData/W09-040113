    Since we wanted to prevent judges from seeing the reference before editing the translations, we split the test set between the sentences used in the ranking task and the editing task (because they were being conducted concurrently).
    Moreover, annotators edited only a single system&#8217;s output for one source sentence to ensure that their understanding of it would not be influenced by another system&#8217;s output.
    Halfway through the manual evaluation period, we stopped collecting edited translations, and instead asked annotators to do the following: Indicate whether the edited translations represent fully fluent and meaningequivalent alternatives to the reference sentence.
    The reference is shown with context, the actual sentence is bold.
    In addition to edited translations, unedited items that were either marked as acceptable or as incomprehensible were also shown.
    Judges gave a simple yes/no indication to each item.
