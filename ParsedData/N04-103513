S, T).
    We define a fragment of a directed, acyclic graph G to be a nontrivial (i.e. not just a single node) subgraph G' of G such that if a node n is in G' then either n is a sink node of G' (i.e. it has no children) or all of its children are in G' (and it is connected to all of them).
    In Figure 6, we show two examples of graph fragments of the alignment graph of Figure 5.
    The span of a node n of the alignment graph is the subset of nodes from S that are reachable from n. Note that this definition is similar to, but not quite the same as, the definition of a span given by Fox (2002).
    We say that a span is contiguous if it contains all elements of a contiguous substring of S. The closure of span(n) is the shortest contiguous span which is a superset of span(n).
    For instance, the closure of 1s2, s3, s5, s71 would be 1s2, s3, s4, s5, s6, s71 The alignment graph in Figure 5 is annotated with the span of each node.
    Take a look at the graph fragments in Figure 6.
    These fragments are spe
