 in representation at the lexical level.
    The repetition of variables in the SEMENT of a lexical sign (corresponding to TFS coindexation) and the choice of type on those variables determines the type of modification.
  
  
    We need to make one further extension to allow for control, which we do by adding an extra slot to the hooks and holes corresponding to the external argument (e.g., the external argument of a verb always corresponds to its subject position).
    We illustrate this by showing two uses of expect; note the third slot in the hooks and holes for the external argument of each entity.
    In both cases, x0e is both the external argument of expect and its subject&#8217;s index, but in the first structure x0e is also the external argument of the complement, thus giving the control effect. expect 1 (as in Kim expected to sleep) [he, ee, x0 e]{[hs, x0 e, x0 s]subj, [hc, ec, x0 e]comp1,..
