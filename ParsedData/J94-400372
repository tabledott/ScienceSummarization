    Bootstrapping, which is a general scheme for reducing the amount of manual tagging, was proposed also for sense disambiguation (Hearst 1991).
    The idea is to tag manually an initial set of occurrences for each sense in the lexicon, acquiring initial training statistics from these instances.
    Then, using these statistics, the system tries to disambiguate additional occurrences of ambiguous words.
    If such an occurrence can be disambiguated automatically with high confidence, the system acquires additional statistics from this occurrence, as if it were tagged by hand.
    Hopefully, the system will incrementally acquire all the relevant statistics, demanding just a small amount of manual tagging.
    The results of Hearst (1991) show that at least 10 occurrences of each sense have to be tagged by hand, and in most cases 20-30 occurrences are required to get high precision.
    These results, which were achieved for a small set of preselected ambiguous words, suggest that the cost of the bootstra
