    whose probability is below this value multiplied with a threshold (lower than one) will not be regarded for further expansion.
    Histogram pruning means that all but the M best hypotheses are pruned for a fixed M. For finding the most likely partial hypotheses, first all hypotheses with the same set of covered source sentence positions are compared.
    After threshold and histogram pruning have been applied, we also compare al
