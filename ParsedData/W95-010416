as k increases.
    The reason is that the method starts picking up spurious correlations in the training corpus.
    Table 4 gives some examples of the context words learned for the confusion set {peace, piece}, with k = 24.
    The context words corps, united, nations, etc., all imply peace, and appear to be plausible (although united and nations are a counterexample to our earlier assumption of independence).
    On the other hand, consider the context word how, which allegedly also implies peace.
    If we look back at the training corpus for the supporting data for this word, we find excerpts such as: But oh, how I do sometimes need just a moment of rest, and peace .
    .
    .
    No matter how earnest is our quest for guaranteed peace .
    .
    .
    How best to destroy your peace ?
    There does not seem to be a necessary connection here between how and peace; the correlation is probably spurious.
    Although we are using a chi-square test expressly to filter out such spurious correlations, we ca
