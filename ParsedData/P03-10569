    Whereas ETB annotation strongly reflects late 1970s mainstream transformational grammar, CTB annotation draws primarily on Government-Binding (GB) theory from the 1980s.
    GB differs from the former in two major respects: first, it rigidly requires phrasal projection of all lexical categories; second, it sharply distinguishes between levels of adjunction and complementation.
    Both these differences are noticeable when comparing treebanks.
    The first difference, projection of phrasal categories, is particularly prominent within NPs: CTB adjective-noun modification, for example, is always at the level of ADJP and NP, whereas in English it can be a direct rewrite of NP to JJ and NN tags (Figure 1).
    The second difference, distinction of adjunction and complementation levels, has been made only for VP (Figure 2), consistent with the headedness issues described in Section 1.1.
    The rigid requirement of phrasal category projection is also manifest elsewhere: all Chinese prenominal relat
