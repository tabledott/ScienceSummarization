only one of the three quantities, log p(lso(c1, c2)), improves only in the third digit.)
  However, with the present paucity of evidence, this connection remains hypothetical.
  10 None of the differences in either column are statistically significant at the .05 level.
  27 Computational Linguistics Volume 32, Number 1 4.4.2 Differences in the Performance and Behavior of the Measures.
  We now examine the results of each of the measures and the differences between them.
  To do this, we will sometimes look at differences in their behavior on individual word pairs.
  Looking at the graphs in Figures 2 and 3, we see that the discrete nature of the Hirst?St-Onge and Leacock?Chodorow measures is much more apparent than that of the others: i.e., the values that they can take on are just a fixed number of levels.
  This is, of course, a result of their being based on the same highly discrete factor: the path length.
  As a matter of fact, a more substantial correspondence between the two measures can be recognized
