 is forward composition, which Steedman denotes Example derivation using forward and backward application.
    Example derivation using type-raising and forward composition. by &gt; B (because B is the symbol used by Curry to denote function composition in combinatory logic; Curry and Feys 1958): Forward composition is often used in conjunction with type-raising (T), as in Figure 2.
    In this case type-raising takes a subject noun phrase and turns it into a functor looking to the right for a verb phrase; the fund is then able to combine with reached using forward composition, giving the fund reached the category S[dcl]/NP (a declarative sentence missing an object).
    It is exactly this type of constituent which the object relative pronoun category is looking for to its right: (NP\NP)/(S[dcl]/NP).
    Note that the fund reached is a perfectly reasonable constituent in CCG, having the type S[dcl]/NP.
    This allows analyses for sentences such as the fund reached but investors disagreed with the agreement,
