sion no. of correct constituents in SPATTER parse no. of constituents in SPATTER parse Recall no. of correct constituents in SPATTER parse no. of constituents in treebank parse Crossing Brackets no. of constituents which violate constituent boundaries with a constituent in the treebank parse.
    The precision and recall measures do not consider constituent labels in their evaluation of a parse, since the treebank label set will not necessarily coincide with the labels used by a given grammar.
    Since SPATTER uses the same syntactic label set as the Penn Treebank, it makes sense to report labelled precision and labelled recall.
    These measures are computed by considering a constituent to be correct if and only if it's label matches the label in the treebank.
    Table 1 shows the results of SPATTER evaluated against the Penn Treebank on the Wall Street Journal section 00.
    Figures 5, 6, and 7 illustrate the performance of SPATTER as a function of sentence length.
