are given a parallel training corpus consisting of S sentence pairs {(fs, es) : s = 1, ... , S}.
    For each sentence pair (fs, es), the alignment variable is denoted by a = aJ1.
    The unknown parameters &#952; are determined by maximizing the likelihood on the parallel training corpus: Typically, for the kinds of models we describe here, the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm (Dempster, Laird, and Rubin 1977) or some approximate EM algorithm is used to perform this maximization.
    To avoid a common misunderstanding, however, note that the use of the EM algorithm is not essential for the statistical approach, but only a useful tool for solving this parameter estimation problem.
    Although for a given sentence pair there is a large number of alignments, we can always find a best alignment: The alignment &#710;aJ1 is also called the Viterbi alignment of the sentence pair(f J 1,eI 1).
    (For the sake of simplicity, we shall drop the index &#952; if it is not explicitly needed.)
