respond to horizontal and vertical edges, respectively.
    Substitutions and identity operations correspond to diagonal edges.
    Edges between arbitrary grid points from the same row correspond to long jump operations.
    It is easy to see that dLJ is symmetrical.
    In the example, the best path contains one deletion edge, one substitution edge, and three long jump edges.
    Therefore, the long jump distance between the sentences is five.
    In contrast, the best Levenshtein path contains one deletion edge, four identity and five consecutive substitution edges; the Levenshtein distance between the two sentences is six.
    The effect of reordering on the BLEU measure is even higher in this example: Whereas 8 of the 10 unigrams from the candidate sentence can be found in the reference sentence, this holds for only 4 bigrams, and 1 trigram.
    Not a single one of the 7 candidate four-grams occurs in the reference sentence.
