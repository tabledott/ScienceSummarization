ion that lacks descriptive information such as gender (e.g., Clinton).
    To address the first weakness, researchers have attempted to train a mention-ranking model for determining which candidate antecedent is most probable given an active mention (e.g., Denis and Baldridge (2008)).
    Ranking is arguably a more natural reformulation of coreference resolution than classification, as a ranker allows all candidate antecedents to be considered simultaneously and therefore directly captures the competition among them.
    Another desirable consequence is that there exists a natural resolution strategy for a ranking approach: a mention is resolved to the candidate antecedent that has the highest rank.
    This contrasts with classification-based approaches, where many clustering algorithms have been employed to co-ordinate the pairwise coreference decisions (because it is unclear which one is the best).
    To address the second weakness, researchers have investigated the acquisition of entity-mention coreferen
