or semantics.
    In this section, we introduce four methods for recognizing both classes of existentials.
    We began by building a set of syntactic heuristics that look for the structural cues of restrictive premodification and restrictive postmodification.
    Restrictive premodification is often found in noun phrases in which a proper noun is used as a modifier for a head noun, for example, &amp;quot;the U.S. president.&amp;quot; &amp;quot;The president&amp;quot; itself is ambiguous, but &amp;quot;the U.S. president&amp;quot; is not.
    Restrictive postmodification is often represented by restrictive relative clauses, prepositional phrases, and appositives.
    For example, &amp;quot;the president of the United States&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;the president who governs the U.S.&amp;quot; are existential due to a prepositional phrase and a relative clause, respectively.
    We also developed syntactic heuristics to recognize referential NPs.
    Most NPs of the form &amp;quot;the &lt;number&gt; &lt;noun&gt
