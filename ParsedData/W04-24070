	Memory-Based Dependency Parsing
		This paper reports the results of experimentsusing memory-based learning to guide a de terministic dependency parser for unrestricted natural language text.
		Using data from a small treebank of Swedish, memory-based classifiers for predicting the next action of the parser are constructed.
		The accuracy of a classifier as such is evaluated on held-out data derived from the treebank, and its performance as a parserguide is evaluated by parsing the held-out por tion of the treebank.
		The evaluation shows thatmemory-based learning gives a signficant im provement over a previous probabilistic modelbased on maximum conditional likelihood esti mation and that the inclusion of lexical features improves the accuracy even further.
	
	
			Deterministic dependency parsing has recently been proposed as a robust and efficient method for syntactic pars ing of unrestricted natural language text (Yamada and Matsumoto, 2003; Nivre, 2003).
			Dependency parsing means that the goal of the p
