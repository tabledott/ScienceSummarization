s converged, or in Step 3c after each iteration.
    At the end of Step 4, this property is used for error correction.
    When a polysemous word such as plant occurs multiple times in a discourse, tokens that were tagged by the algorithm with low confidence using local collocation information may be overridden by the dominant tag for the discourse.
    The probability differentials necessary for such a reclassification were determined empirically in an early pilot study.
    The variables in this decision are the total number of occurrences of plant in the discourse (n), the number of occurrences assigned to the majority and minor senses for the discourse, and the cumulative scores for both (a sum of log-likelihood ratios).
    If cumulative evidence for the majority sense exceeds that of the minority by a threshold (conditional on n), the minority cases are relabeled.
    The case n = 2 does not admit much reclassification because it is unclear which sense is dominant.
    But for n &gt; 4, all but the most
