rst discusses how this function is used as part of a document-level coreference decision model and then describes how we learn the pc function.
    Given a document d and a pairwise coreference scoring function pc that maps an ordered pair of mentions to a value indicating the probability that they are coreferential (see Section 2.2), we generate a coreference graph Gd according to the Best-Link decision model (Ng and Cardie, 2002b) as follows: For each mention m in document d, let B,,t be the set of mentions appearing before m in d. Let a be the highest scoring antecedent: in Section 4.4, we add the edge (a, m) to the coreference graph Gd.
    The resulting graph contains connected components, each representing one equivalence class, with all the mentions in the component referring to the same entity.
    This technique permits us to learn to detect some links between mentions while being agnostic about whether other mentions are linked, and yet via the transitive closure of all links we can still determine
