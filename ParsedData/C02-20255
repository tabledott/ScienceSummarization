, presents annotators, one sentence at a time, with the full set of analyses produced by the grammar.
  Using a pre-existing tree comparison tool in the LKB (similar in kind to the SRI Cambridge TreeBanker; Carter, 1997), annotators can quickly navigate through the parse for- est and identify the correct or preferred analysis in the current context (or, in rare cases, reject all analyses pro- posed by the grammar).
  The tree selection tool presents users, who need little expert knowledge of the underly- ing grammar, with a range of basic properties that distin- guish competing analyses and that are relatively easy to judge.
  All disambiguating decisions made by annotators are recorded in the [incr tsdb()] database and thus become available for (i) later dynamic extraction from the anno- tated profile or (ii) dynamic propagation into a more re- cent profile obtained from re-running a newer version of the grammar on the same corpus.
  Important innovative research aspects in this approach to treebanking are (
