 (adding the weights of constituents when they are combined).
    This way, we perform an exhaustive search for the tree that represents the heaviest combination of constituents that spans the entire sentence as a well-formed tree.
    A problem with simply considering all constituents and picking the heaviest tree is that this favors recall over precision.
    Balancing precision and recall is accomplished by discarding every constituent with weight below a threshold t before the search for the final parse tree starts.
    In the simple case where each constituent starts out with weight 1.0 (before any merging), this means that a constituent is only considered for inclusion in the final parse tree if it appears in at least t of the m initial parse trees.
    Intuitively, this should increase precision, since we expect that a constituent that appears in the output of more parsers to be more likely to be correct.
    By changing the threshold t we can control the precision/recall tradeoff.
