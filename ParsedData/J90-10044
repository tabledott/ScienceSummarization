ental machine translation system for translating international news items of Teletext, which uses a Prolog version of PATR-II similar to that of Hirsh (1987).
    According to Martin Kay (personal communication), the STREP machine translation project at the Center for the Study of Language and Information uses a version of our algorithm to generate with respect to grammars based on head-driven phrase structure grammar (HPSG).
    Finally, Calder et al. (1989) report on a generation algorithm for unification categorial grammar that appears to be a special case of ours.
    Despite the general applicability of the algorithm, we will, for the sake of concreteness, describe it and other generation algorithms in terms of their implementation for definiteclause grammars (DCG).
    For ease of exposition, the encoding will be a bit more cumbersome than is typically found in Prolog DCG interpreters.
    The standard DCG encoding in Prolog uses the notation (mid --&gt; (coil), , (coin). where the (cat,) are terms repr
