tactic?Semantic Analysis Intuitively, semantic interpretation should help syntactic disambiguation, and joint syntactic?
  semantic analysis has a long tradition in linguis- tic theory.
  This motivates a statistical modeling of the problem of finding a syntactic tree y?
  syn and a semantic graph y?
  sem for a sentence x as maximiz- ing a function F that scores the joint syntactic?
  semantic structure: ?y?
  = arg max y syn ,y sem F (x, y syn , y sem ) The dependencies in the feature representation used to compute F determine the tractability of the search procedure needed to perform the maximiza- tion.

  such as paths when predicting semantic structures, exact search is clearly intractable.
  This is true even with simpler feature representations ?
  the problem is a special case of
