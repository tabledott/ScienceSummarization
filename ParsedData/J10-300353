mvent the above limitations by using a bilingual parallel corpus instead of a monolingual parallel corpus.
    Whereas it is clearly to our advantage to have monolingual parallel corpora, such corpora are usually not very readily available.
    The corpora usually found in the real world are comparable instead of being truly parallel: Parallelism between sentences is replaced by just partial semantic and topical overlap at the level of documents.
    Therefore, for monolingual comparable corpora, the task of finding phrasal correspondences becomes harder because the two corpora may only be related by way of describing events under the same topic.
    In such a scenario, possible paraphrasing methods either (a) forgo any attempts at directly finding such correspondences and fall back to the distributional similarity workhorse or, (b) attempt to directly induce a form of coarsegrained alignment between the two corpora and leverage this alignment.
    In this section, we describe three methods that generate para
