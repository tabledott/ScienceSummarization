    We discuss our cluster-ranking approach in Section 4, evaluate it in Section 5, and conclude in Section 6.
  
  
    Heuristic-based cluster ranking.
    As mentioned previously, the work most related to ours is Lappin and Leass (1994), whose goal is to perform pronoun resolution by assigning an anaphoric pronoun to the highest-scored preceding cluster.
    Nevertheless, Lappin and Leass&#8217;s work differs from ours in several respects.
    First, they only tackle pronoun resolution rather than the full coreference task.
    Second, their algorithm is heuristic-based; in particular, the score assigned to a preceding cluster is computed by summing over the weights associated with the factors applicable to the cluster, where the weights are determined heuristically, rather than learned, unlike ours.
    Like many heuristic-based pronoun resolvers (e.g., Mitkov (1998)), they first apply a set of constraints to filter grammatically incompatible candidate
