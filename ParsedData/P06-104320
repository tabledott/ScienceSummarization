 the same test sentence should not affect the corpus f-scores.
    By estimating the proportion of permutations that result in an absolute difference in corpus f-scores at least as great as that observed in the actual output, we obtain a distributionfree estimate of significance that is robust against parser and evaluator failures.
    The results of this test are shown in Table 8.
    The table shows that the BROWN reranker is not significantly different from the WSJ reranker.
    In order to better understand the difference between the reranking parser trained on Brown and the WSJ+NANC/WSJ reranking parser (a reranking parser with the first-stage trained on WSJ+NANC and the second-stage trained on WSJ) on Brown data, we constructed a logistic regression model of the difference between the two parsers&#8217; fscores on the development data using the R statistical package5.
    Of the 2,078 sentences in the development data, 29 sentences were discarded because evalb failed to evaluate at least one of the pars
