g the partition) and the space required for representing the observed data with that tree cut.
    For CorMet&#8217;s purposes, the problem with this approach is that it is difficult to find clusters of (possibly hypernymically related) nodes representing a selectional preference using its results (because the tree cut includes exactly one node on each path from each leaf node to the root).
    There are similar objections to similar approaches such as that of Carroll and McCarthy (2000).
    Polarity is a measure of the directionality and magnitude of structure transfer between two concepts or two domains.
    Nonzero polarity exists when language characteristic of a concept from one domain is used in a different domain of a different concept.
    The kind of characteristic language CorMet can detect is limited to verbal selectional preferences.
    Say CorMet is searching for a mapping between the concepts liquids (characteristic of the LAB domain) and assets (characteristic of the FINANCE domain), as illus
