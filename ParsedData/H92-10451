  In addition, it could also be used to help evaluate disambiguation algorithms that did not make use of the discourse constraint.
  OUR PREVIOUS WORK ON WORD-SENSE D ISAMBIGUATION 2.1.
  Data  Deprivation Although there has been a long history of work on word-sense disambiguation, much of the work has been stymied by difficulties in acquiring appropriate testing and training materials.
  AI approaches have tended to focus on "toy" domains because of the difficulty in ac- quiring large lexicons.
  So too, statistical approaches, e.g., Kelly and Stone (1975), Black (1988), have tended to focus on a relatively small set of polysemous words because they have depended on extremely scarce hand- tagged materials for use in testing and training.
  We have achieved considerable progress recently by using a new source of testing and training materials and the application of Bayesian discrimination methods.
  Rather than depending on small amounts of hand-tagged text, we have be
