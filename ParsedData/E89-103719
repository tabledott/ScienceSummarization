    Other examples of this kind are pairs like like and plaire and help and helfen.
    We can achieve the desired correspondence between the source and the target by augmenting the first rule with the following transfer equations: The effect of this rule is that the I value of the relativized phrase (REL-TOPIC) in the source language is identified with the relativized phrase in the target language.
    However, the source REL-TOPIC is also identified with a within-clause function, say 0I3J, by the uncertainty equation in (12).
    Lexical transfer rules such as the one given in (8) independently establish the correspondence between source and target within-clause functions.
    Thus, the target within-clause function will be identified with the target relativized phrase.
    This necessary relation is accomplished by lexically and structurally based transfer rules that do not make reference to each other.
    Differences in control.
    A slightly more complex but similar case arises when the infiniti
