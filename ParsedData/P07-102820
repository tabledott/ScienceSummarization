tation of the similarity-based model we have chosen, using frames and roles as predicates and arguments in the primary corpus, should enable the model to compute preferences specific to word senses.
    The sample in Table 6 shows that this is indeed the case: The preferences differ considerably for the two senses (frames) of &#8220;take&#8221;, at least for the Jaccard metric, which shows a clear preference for vehicles for the Vehicle role.
    The Substance role of Ingest substance is harder to characterize, with very diverse seen headwords such as &#8220;crack&#8221;, &#8220;lines&#8221;, &#8220;fluid&amp;quot;, &#8220;speed&#8221;.
    While the highest-ranked induced words for Jaccard do include three food items, there is no word, with the possible exception of &#8220;ice cream&#8221;, that could be construed as a controlled substance.
    The induced headwords for the Cosine metric are considerably less pertinent for both roles and show the above-mentioned tendency to repeat some high-frequency words.
