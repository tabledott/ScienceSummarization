 the (putative) mechanism which recovers from garden paths.
    The D-theoretic solution to the problem of misleading leading edges&amp;quot; hinges on one formal property of this problem: The initial analysis of this class of examples is incorrect only in that some constituent is attached in the parse tree at a higher point in the surrounding structure than is correct.
    Crucially, the parser neither creates structures of the wrong kind nor does it attach the structure that it builds to some structure which does not dominate it.
    In the misanalysis of (2), the parser initially errs only in attaching the NP &amp;quot;my aunt&amp;quot;, which is indeed dominated by the VP whose head is &amp;quot;drove&amp;quot;, too high in the structure.
    This class of examples is handled by D-theory without difficulty exactly because syntactic analyses are expressed in terms of domination rather than direct domination.
    The developing description of the structure of (2) in a D-theory parser at the point at which t
