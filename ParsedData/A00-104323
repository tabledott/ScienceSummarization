wn in Figure 3.
    The symbol &amp;quot;y&amp;quot; along an edge means the node it points to will be kept, and &amp;quot;n&amp;quot; means the node will be removed.
    Suppose the program reduces the sentence to (BCD), which can be translated similarly to the annotated tree shown in Figure 4.
    We can see that along five edges (they are D&#8212;)T, D&#8212;*G, B-4A, B&#8212;&gt;C), both the human and the program made decisions.
    Two out of the five decisions agree (they are D--&#247;B and D&#8212;&gt;E), so the success rate is 2/5 (40%).
    The success rate is defined as: # of edges along which the human and the program have made the same decision success rate = the total # of edges along which both the human and the progam have made decisions Note that the edges along which only the human or the program has made a decision (e.g., G--F and G&#8212;.&gt;F in Figure 3 and Figure 4) are not considered in the computation of success rate, since there is no agreement issue in such cases.
