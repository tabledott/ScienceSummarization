 s ? S, each one operating at the subsymbol level.
			While these HDP-PCFGs are independent in the prior, they are coupled through their interactions inthe parse trees.
			For completeness, we have also in cluded unary productions, which are essentially the PCFG counterpart of transitions in HMMs.
			Finally,since each node i in the parse tree involves a symbol subsymbol pair (si, zi), each subsymbol needs to specify a distribution over both child symbols and subsymbols.
			The former can be handled through a finite Dirichlet distribution since all symbols are known and observed, but the latter must be handledwith the Dirichlet process machinery, since the num ber of subsymbols is unknown.
