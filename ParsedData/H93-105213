nation of multi- ple evidence types which are clearly not independent (such as those found in this study) as probabilities are never com- bined.
  Therefore this method offers advantages over Bayesian classifier techniques which assume independence of the fea- tures used.
  It also offers advantages over decision tree based techniques because the training pools are not split at each question.
  The interesting problems are how one should re- estimate probabilities conditional on questions asked earlier in the list, or how one should prune lower evidence which is categorically subsumed by higher evidence or is entirely conditional on higher evidence.
  1989] have dis- cussed some of these issues at length, and there is not space to consider them here.
  For simplicity, in this experiment no secondary smoothing or pruning is done.
  This does not ap- pear to be problematic when small numbers of independent evidence types are used, but performance should increase if this extra step is taken.
