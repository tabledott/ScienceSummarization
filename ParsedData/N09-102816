de multiple source sentence reordering options through word lattices (Zhang et.al., 2007; Li et.al., 2007; Elming, 2008).
    A key difference between 1We could have improved the rules by using a weight of -3 for the label &#8220;mark&#8221;, but it was not in our original set of rules. their approaches and ours is that they do not perform reordering during training.
    Therefore, they would need to rely on reorder units that are likely not violating &#8220;phrase&#8221; boundaries.
    However, since we reorder both training and test data, our system operates in a matched condition.
    They also focus on either Chinese to English (Zhang et.al., 2007; Li et.al., 2007) or English to Danish (Elming, 2008), which arguably have less long distance reordering than between English and SOV languages.
    Studies most similar to ours are those preprocessing reordering approaches (Xia and McCord, 2004; Collins et.al., 2005; Wang et.al., 2007; Habash, 2007).
    They all perform reordering during preprocessing based o
