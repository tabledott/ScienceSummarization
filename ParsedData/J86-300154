hat serves as the discourse segment purpose and its relationship to other discourse-level intentions.
    In particular, the OCP must be able to recognize which other DSPs that specific intention dominates and is dominated by, and, where relevant, with which other DSPs it has satisfaction-precedence relationships.
    Two issues that are central to the recognition problem are what information the OCP can utilize in effecting the recognition and at what point in the discourse that information becomes available.
    An adequate computational model of the recognition process depends critically on an adequate theory of intention and action; this, of course, is a large research problem in itself and one not restricted to matters of discourse.
    The need to use such a model for discourse, however, adds certain constraints on the adequacy of any theory or model.
    Pollack (1986) describes several properties such theories and models must possess if they are to be adequate for supporting recognition of intention i
