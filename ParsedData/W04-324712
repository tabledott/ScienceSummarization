    Although the frequency of the words are taken into account while computing the Centroid score, a sentence that contains many rare words with high IDF values may get a high Centroid score even if the words do not occur elsewhere in the cluster.
  
  
    We used DUC 2004 data in our experiments.
    There are 2 generic summarization tasks (Tasks 2, 4a, and 4b) in DUC 2004 which are appropriate for the purpose of testing our new feature, LexPageRank.
    Task 2 involves summarization of 50 TDT English clusters.
    The goal of Task 4 is to produce summaries of machine translation output (in English) of 24 Arabic TDT documents.
    For evaluation, we used the new automatic summary evaluation metric, ROUGE1, which was used for the first time in DUC 2004.
    ROUGE is a recallbased metric for fixed-length summaries which is based on n-gram co-occurence.
    It reports separate scores for 1, 2, 3, and 4-gram, and also for longest common subsequence co-occurences.
    Among these different scores, unig
