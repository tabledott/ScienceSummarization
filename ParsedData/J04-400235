e the search problem simpler but introduce fundamental search errors.
    In the following, we describe our search algorithm based on the concept of beam search, which allows a trade-off between efficiency and quality by adjusting the size of the beam.
    The search algorithm can be easily adapted to other phrase-based translation models.
    For single-word-based search in MT, a similar algorithm has been described in Tillmann and Ney (2003).
    Putting everything together and performing search in maximum approximation, we obtain the following decision rule: Using the four feature functions AT, AL, WRD, and LM, we obtain the following decision rule:3 Here, we have grouped the contributions of the various feature functions into those for each word (from LM and WRD, expression (24)), those for every alignment template (from AT and AL, expression (25)), and those for the end of sentence (expression (26)), which includes a term logp(EOS  |eI&#8722;1,eI) for the end-of-sentence language model probability.
