s together with questions that call them.
    Complex nominals and coordinated conjunctions A question may refer to a subject/object by its full proper name, and the answer will refer to the subject/object in an abbreviated form.
    For example in the correct candidate answer for the question, &#8220;Which company created the Internet browser Mosaic?&#8221;, Internet browser Mosaic is referred to as Mosaic.
    Using abduction, an axiom is built such that the head noun of the complex nominal in the question implies the remaining nouns in the complex nominal: all x1 (mosaic nn(x1) internet nn(x1) &amp; browser nn(x1)) An additional axiom is built such that all the nouns in the complex nominal imply a complex nominal: all x1 (internet nn(x1) &amp; browser nn(x1) &amp; mosaic nn(x1) nn nnc(x1,x1,x1,x1)) So as not to restrict the ordering of the nouns in the noun phrase from which the complex nominal is built, the same argument is used for each of the noun predicates in the complex nominal.
