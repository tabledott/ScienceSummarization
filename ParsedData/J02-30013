nd identifying their semantic role, the system achieved 65% precision and 61% recall.
    Our study also allowed us to compare the usefulness of different features and feature combination methods in the semantic role labeling task.
    We also explore the integration of role labeling with statistical syntactic parsing and attempt to generalize to predicates unseen in the training data.
  
  
    Recent years have been exhilarating ones for natural language understanding.
    The excitement and rapid advances that had characterized other language-processing tasks such as speech recognition, part-of-speech tagging, and parsing have finally begun to appear in tasks in which understanding and semantics play a greater role.
    For example, there has been widespread commercial deployment of simple speech-based natural language understanding systems that answer questions about flight arrival times, give directions, report on bank balances, or perform simple financial transactions.
