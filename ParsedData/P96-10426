tag occurring.2 The values of these parameters are estimated from a tagged corpus which provides a training set of labeled examples (see Section 4.1).
  
  
    A sample selection method needs to evaluate the expected usefulness, or information gain, of learning from a given example.
    The methods we investigate approach this evaluation implicitly, measuring an example's informativeness as the uncertainty in its classification given the current training data (Seung, Opper, and Sompolinsky, 1992; Lewis and Gale, 1994; MacKay, 1992).
    The reasoning is that if an example's classification is uncertain given current training data then the example is likely to contain unknown information useful for classifying similar examples in the future.
    We investigate the committee-based method, where the learning algorithm evaluates an example by giving it to a committee containing several variant models, all 'consistent' with the training data seen so far.
    The more the committee members agree on the classificati
