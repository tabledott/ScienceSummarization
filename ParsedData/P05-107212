ress these errors, we added two additional parse representations: i) Minipar dependency parser, and ii) chunking parser (Hacioglu et al., 2004).
    The hope is that these parsers will produce different errors than the Charniak parser since they represent different syntactic views.
    The Charniak parser is trained on the Penn TreeBank corpus.
    Minipar is a rule based dependency parser.
    The chunking parser is trained on PropBank and produces a flat syntactic representation that is very different from the full parse tree produced by Charniak.
    A combination of the three different parses could produce better results than any single one.
    Minipar (Lin, 1998; Lin and Pantel, 2001) is a rulebased dependency parser.
    It outputs dependencies between a word called head and another called modifier.
    Each word can modify at most one word.
    The dependency relationships form a dependency tree.
    The set of words under each node in Minipar&#8217;s dependency tree form a contiguous segment in the o
