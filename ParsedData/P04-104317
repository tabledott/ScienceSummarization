SCF-based kernel and the polynomial kernel.
    The above kernels were experimented over two corpora: PropBank (www.cis.upenn.edu/&#57738;ace) along with Penn TreeBank5 2 (Marcus et al., 1993) and FrameNet.
    PropBank contains about 53,700 sentences and a fixed split between training and testing which has been used in other researches e.g., (Gildea and Palmer, 2002; Surdeanu et al., 2003; Hacioglu et al., 2003).
    In this split, Sections from 02 to 21 are used for training, section 23 for testing and sections 1 and 22 as developing set.
    We considered all PropBank arguments6 from Arg0 to Arg9, ArgA and ArgM for a total of 122,774 and 7,359 arguments in training and testing respectively.
    It is worth noting that in the experiments we used the gold standard parsing from Penn TreeBank, thus our kernel structures are derived with high precision.
    For the FrameNet corpus (www.icsi.berkeley .edu/&#57738;framenet) we extracted all 24,558 sentences from the 40 frames of Senseval 3 task (www.senseval.org)
