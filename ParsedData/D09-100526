y INSIDE(HG, ER,Rm)&#8212; or, more efficiently, by INSIDE-OUTSIDE(HG, R, Rm).
    Case 2: To differentiate a second time, &#8220;lift&#8221; the above weights again to obtain ((pe, Vpe), V(pe, Vpe)) ((pe,Vpe), (Vpe, V2pe)), where V2pe E Rmxm is the Hessian matrix of second-order mixed partial derivatives.
    These weights are in a second-order expectation semiring.10 Now 9Figure 4 was already proved generally correct in Section 4.2.
    To understand more specifically how (s, t) gets computed, observe in analogy to the end of Section 4.2 that 10Modulo the trivial isomorphism from ((p, r), (s, t)) to (p, r, s, t) (see Section 4.3), the intended semiring both here and in Case 3 is the one that was defined at the start of Section 4.1, in which r, s are vectors and their product is defined = (Z, VZ, VZ, V2Z) will be returned by INSIDE(HG, ER,R&#8212;,R&#8212;,R&#8212;x&#8212;), or more efficiently by INSIDE-OUTSIDE(HG, ER,R&#8212;, Rm x Rm&#215;m).
    Case 3: Our experiments will need to find expectations and
