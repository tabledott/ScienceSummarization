p probabilities, they must be determined solely by the relevant measure of object-to-cluster similarity, which in the present work is the relative entropy between object and cluster centroid distributions.
    Since no other information is available, the membership is determined by maximizing the configuration entropy for a fixed average distortion.
    With the maximum entropy (ME) membership distribution, ML estimation is equivalent to the minimization of the average distortion of the data.
    The combined entropy maximization entropy and distortion minimization is carried out by a two-stage iterative process similar to the EM method (Dempster et al., 1977).
    The first stage of an iteration is a maximum likelihood, or minimum distortion, estimation of the cluster centroids given fixed membership probabilities.
    In the second stage of each iteration, the entropy of the membership distribution is maximized for a fixed average distortion.
