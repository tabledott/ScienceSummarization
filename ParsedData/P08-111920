   We discarded all instances that produced zero productivity links, meaning that they did not generate any other candidates when used in web queries.
  
  
    We evaluated our algorithms on four semantic categories: U.S. states, countries, singers, and fish.
    The states and countries categories are relatively small, closed sets: our gold standards consist of 50 U.S. states and 194 countries (based on a list found on Wikipedia).
    The singers and fish categories are much larger, open classes.
    As our gold standard for fish, we used a list of common fish names found on Wikipedia.2 All the singer names generated by our algorithms were manually reviewed for correctness.
    We evaluated performance in terms of accuracy (the percentage of instances that were correct).3 Table 2 shows the accuracy results of the two algorithms that use hyponym pattern linkage graphs.
    We display results for the top-ranked N candidates, for all instances that have a productivity value &gt; zero.4 The Popularity columns s
