12; C(y)2.
    Each triple &#9001;c(x), p, c(y)&#9002; is a candidate selectional preference for p. Candidates can be incorrect when: a) they were generated from the incorrect sense of a polysemous word; or b) p does not hold for the other words in the semantic class.
    Intuitively, we have more confidence in a particular candidate if its semantic classes are closely associated given the relation p. Pointwise mutual information (Cover and Thomas 1991) is a commonly used metric for measuring this association strength between two events e1 and e2: 2 In this paper, the semantic classes C(x) and C(y) are extracted from WordNet and CBC (described in Section 4.2).
    We define our ranking function as the strength of association between two semantic classes, cx and cy3, given the relation p: Let |cx, p, cy |denote the frequency of observing the instance &#9001;c(x), p, c(y)&#9002;.
    We estimate the probabilities of Equation 3.2 using maximum likelihood estimates over our corpus: Similarly to (Resnik 1996), we
