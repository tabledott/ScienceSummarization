phrase probability we sum over different target language phrases.
    Therefore the English phrases that are aligned with the different German phrases (which themselves maybe indicative of different word senses) are mingled.
    Performance may be degraded since paraphrases that reflect different senses of the original phrase, and which therefore have a different meaning, are included in the same candidate set.
    We therefore performed an experiment to see whether improvement could be had by limiting the candidate paraphrases to be the same sense as the original phrase in each test sentence.
    To do this, we used the fact that our test sentences were drawn from a parallel corpus.
    We limited phrases to the same word sense by constraining the candidate paraphrases to those that aligned with the same target language phrase.
    Our basic paraphrase calculation was therefore: Using the foreign language phrase to identify the word sense is obviously not applicable in monolingual settings, but acts as a con
