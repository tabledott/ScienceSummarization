Section 2.1 from Weaver's memorandum that the notion of examining a context of a few words around the target to disambiguate has been fundamental to WSD work since its beginnings: it has been the basis of WSD work in MT, content analysis, AI-based disambiguation, and dictionary-based WSD, as well as the more recent statistical, neural network, and symbolic machine learning, approaches.
    However, following Kaplan's early experiments (Kaplan 1950), there have been few systematic attempts to answer Weaver's question concerning the optimal value of N. A notable exception is the study of Choueka and Lusignan (1985), who verified Kaplan's finding that 2-contexts are highly reliable for disambiguation, and even 1-contexts are reliable in 8 out of 10 cases.
    However, despite these findings, the value of N has continued to vary over the course of WSD work more or less arbitrarily.
    Yarowsky (1993, 1994a, 1994b) examines different windows of microcontext, including 1-contexts, k-contexts, and words pairs at of
