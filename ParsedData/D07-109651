ionally, the highest PNW can be found in Hungarian and Turkish, which reach higherscores than Arabic, Basque, and Greek.
			These con siderations suggest that highly inflected languages with (relatively) free word order need more training data, a hypothesis that will have to be investigated further.
			There are four languages which were included inthe shared tasks on multilingual dependency parsing both at CoNLL 2006 and at CoNLL 2007: Arabic, Chinese, Czech, and Turkish.
			For all four lan guages, the same treebanks were used, which allows a comparison of the results.

			Table 5 shows the top scores for LAS.
			Since the official scores excluded punctuation in 2006 but includes it in 2007, we give results both with and without punctuation for both years.For Arabic and Turkish, we see a great improve ment of approximately 9 and 6 percentage points.
