ccuracy due to the lack of context.
    For example, in Figure 1(c), (triggered ( C-DATE ADV)) is needed to extract the date entity.
    However, the same pattern is likely to be applied to texts in other domains as well, such as &#8220;The Mexican peso was devalued and triggered a national financial crisis last week.&#8221; Subtree model The Subtree model is a generalization of previous models, such that any subtree of a dependency tree in the source sentence can be regarded as an extraction pattern candidate.
    As shown in Figure 1(d), the Subtree model, by its definition, contains all the patterns permitted by either the Predicate-Argument model or the Chain model.
    It is also capable of providing more relevant context, such as (triggered (explosion-OBJ)( C-DATE -ADV)).
    The obvious advantage of the Subtree model is the flexibility it affords in creating suitable patterns, spanning multiple levels and multiple branches.
    Pattern coverage is further improved by relaxing the constraint that the ro
