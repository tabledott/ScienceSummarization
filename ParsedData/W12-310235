n-best lists and stack information from the search graph as a word graph (parameter -outputword-graph) as produced by the Moses engine were provided.
    The rationale behind releasing this engineinternal data was to make it possible for this sharedtask to address quality estimation using a glass-box approach, that is, making use of information from the internal workings of the MT engine.
    The test data was a subset of the WMT12 EnglishSpanish test set, consisting of 442 sentences.
    The test data consists of the following files: The first two files were the input for the qualityestimation shared-task participating systems.

    The effort scores were released after the participants submitted their shared-task submission, and were solely used to evaluate the submissions according to t
