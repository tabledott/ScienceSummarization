ages.
    In the first one, the source sentence s is transformed into its semantic representation r by undertaking a series of NLP processing, including morphology analyzing, syntactic parsing, semantic role labeling, etc.
    In the second stage, a NLG system is employed to generate a sentence t from r. s and t are paraphrases as they are both derived from r. The NLG-based methods simulate human paraphrasing behavior, i.e., understanding a sentence and presenting the meaning in another way.
    However, deep analysis of sentences is a big challenge.
    Moreover, developing a NLG system is also not trivial.
    SMT-based methods: SMT-based methods viewed PG as monolingual MT, i.e., translating s into t that are in the same language.
    Researchers employ the existing SMT models for PG (Quirk et al., 2004).
    Similar to typical SMT, a large parallel corpus is needed as training data in the SMT-based PG.
    However, such data are difficult to acquire compared with the SMT data.
    Therefore, data shortage
