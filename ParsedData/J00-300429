st discuss measures that are used to evaluate the accuracy of automatic segmentation.
    We then examine the application of the new segmentation method to English text, and show how it achieves results that significantly outperform the state of the art.
    Next we describe application to a manually segmented corpus of Chinese text; again, excellent results are achieved.
    In a further experiment where we apply a model generated from the corpus to a new, independent, test file, performance deteriorates considerably&#8212;as one might expect.
    We then apply the method to a different corpus, and investigate how well the model transfers from one corpus to another.
    We end with a discussion of how the results vary with the order of the compression model used to drive the segmenter.
    We use three measures to evaluate the accuracy of automatic segmentation: recall, precision, and error rate.
    All evaluations use hand-segmentation as the gold standard, which the automatic method strives to attain.
