    In the conative alternation, the transitive form alternates with a prepositional phrase construction involving either at or on.
    An example of the conative alternation is given in (2).
    We refer to alternations where a particular semantic role appears in different grammatical roles in alternate realisations as &amp;quot;role switching alternations&amp;quot; (RsAs).
    It is these alternations that our method applies to.
    Recently, there has been interest in corpus-based methods to identify alternations (McCarthy and Korhonen, 1998; Lapata, 1999), and associated verb classifications (Stevenson and Merlo, 1999).
    These have either relied on a priori knowledge specified for the alternations in advance, or are not suitable for a wide range of alternations.
    The fully automatic method outlined here is applied to the causative and conative alternations, but is applicable to other RSAS.
  
  
    Diathesis alternations have been proposed for a number of NLP tasks.
