of these feature structures.
  One of the possible stipulations that are being considered from the point of view of linguistic relevance is to put a bound on the information content in these feature structures.
  This results in a bound on the size of feature structures and hence on the number of possible feature structures that can be associated with a node.
  An FTAG grammar, which incorporates this stipulation, will be equivalent to a TAG from the point of view of generative capacity but one with an enhanced escriptive capacity.
  Unbounded feature structures have been used to capture the subeat- ~egorization phenomenon by having feature structures that act like stacks (and hence unbounded in size), llowever, in TAGs, the elementary trees give the subeategorization (Iomain.
  As noted earlier, the elements ub- categorized by the main vert~ in an elementary tree are part of the same elementary tree.
  Thus, with the feature structures associated with the elementary trees we can just point to the subcategori
