scription-by-analysis.
    The semantic interpretation mechanisms proposed by Halvorsen (1983) and Reyle (1988) are other examples of this descriptive technique.
    In this method the grammar provides general patterns to compare against a given structure and these are then instantiated if the analysis is satisfactory.
    One consequence of this approach is that the structure in the range of the correspondence, the one whose description is being developed, can only have properties that are derived from information explicitly identified in the domain structure.
    Another description mechanism is possible when three or more structures are related through correspondences.
    Suppose the c-structure and f-structure are related by 4) as in (2a) and that the function a then maps the f-structure units into corresponding units of semantic structure of the sort suggested by Fenstad et al. (1987).
    The formal arrangement is shown in Figure 1 (next page).
    This configuration of cascaded correspondences opens u
