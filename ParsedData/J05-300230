extraneous subtrees.
    Alignment is essential for all the steps.
    The selection of the basis tree is guided by the number of intersection subtrees it includes; in the best case, it contains all such subtrees.
    The basis tree is the centroid of the input sentences&#8212; the sentence which is the most similar to the other sentences in the input.
    Using the alignment-based similarity score described in Section 3.1.2, we identify the centroid by computing for each sentence the average similarity score between the sentence and the rest of the input sentences, then selecting the sentence with the highest score.
    Next, we augment the basis tree with information present in the other input sentences.
    More specifically, we add alternative verbalizations for the nodes in the basis tree and the intersection subtrees which are not part of the basis tree.
    The alternative verbalizations are readily available from the pairwise alignments of the basis tree with other trees in the input computed in the p
