to those referents are internal.
    We conclude that, as a matter of principle, no edge should be constructed if the result of doing so would be to make internal an index occurring in part of the input semantics that the new phrase does not subsume.
    In other words, the semantics of a phrase must contain all predicates from the input specification that refer to any indices internal to it.
    This strategy does not prevent the generation of an exponential number of variants of phrases containing modifiers.
    It limits proliferation of the ill effects, however, by allowing only the maximal one to be incorporated in larger phrases.
    In other words, if the final has phrases with respectively, then of the first and of the second will be created, but only one of each set will be incorporated into larger and no factor of will be introduced into the cost of the process.
    5 Indexing String positions provide a natural way to index the strings input to the parsing process for the simple reason that there ar
