s candidate points of correspondence within the search rectangle that satisfy the supplied matching predicate, as explained in Section 4.2.
    In the recognition phase, SIMR invokes the chain recognition heuristic to select the most likely chain of true points of correspondence (TPCs) among the generated points.
    The most likely chain of TPCs is the set of points whose geometric arrangement most resembles the typical arrangement of TPCs.
    The parameters of the chain recognition heuristic are optimized on a small training bitext.
    If no suitable chains are found, the search rectangle is proportionally expanded by the minimum possible amount and the generation-recognition cycle is repeated.
    The rectangle keeps expanding until at least one acceptable chain is found.
    If more than one acceptable chain is found in the same cycle, SIMR accepts the chain whose points are least dispersed around its least-squares line.
    Each time SIMR accepts a chain, it moves the search rectangle to another region
