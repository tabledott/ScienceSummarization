.
    The last stage performs all possible parser operations (reducing stack entries and shifting the new word).
    When there is no more parser work to be done (or, in their case, when the beam is full), the following word is predicted.
    And so on until the end of the string.
    Each different POS assignment or parser operation is a step in a derivation.
    Each distinct derivation path within the beam has a probability and a stack state associated with it.
    Every stack entry has a nonterminal node label and a designated headword of the constituent.
    When all of the parser operations have finished at a particular point in the string, the next word is predicted as follows: For each derivation in the beam, the headwords of the two topmost stack entries form a trigram with the conditioned word.
    This interpolated trigram probability is then multiplied by the normalized probability of the derivation, to provide that derivation's contribution to the probability of the word.
    More precisely, for
