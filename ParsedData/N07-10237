hope to exploit its large syntactic context to condition deletions more accurately, the sparsity of such productions make them poor candidates for relative frequency estimation, especially in a task with limited quantities of training material.
    Indeed, our base training corpus described in Section 4 contains only 951 SCFG productions, 593 appearing once.
    Secondly, syntactic categories in the PTB are particularly coarse grained, and lead to many incorrect context-free assumptions.
    Some important distinctions, such as between arguments and adjuncts, are beyond the scope of the PTB annotation, and it is often difficult to determine out of context whether a given constituent can safely be deleted from a righthand side.
    One first type of annotation that can effectively be added to each syntactic category is its lexical head and head part-of-speech (POS), following work in syntactic parsing (Collins, 1999).
    This type of annotation is particular beneficial in the case of, e.g., prepositional phra
