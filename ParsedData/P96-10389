ents that may be embedded relative to one another.
    These segments and the embedding relationships between them form the LINGUISTIC STRUCTURE.
    The embedding relationships reflect changes in the ATTENTIONAL STATE, the dynamic record of the entities and attributes that are salient during a particular part of the discourse.
    Changes in linguistic structure, and hence attentional state, depend on the discourse's INTENTIONAL STRUCTURE; this structure comprises the intentions or DISCOURSE SEGMENT PURPOSES (DSPs) underlying the discourse and relations between DSPs.
    Two methods of discourse segmentation were employed by subjects who had expertise in the G&amp;S theory.
    Following Hirschberg and Grosz (1992), three subjects labeled from text alone (group T) and three labeled from text and speech (group S).
    Other than this difference in input modality, all subjects received identical written instructions.
    The text for each task was presented with line breaks corresponding to intermediate phrase
