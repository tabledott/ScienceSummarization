h draw from that changed matrix, and use [incr tsdbo)] to determine which phenomena have been affected by the change.
    It is clear that full automation of this evaluation process will be difficult, but at least some classes of changes to the matrix will permit this kind of quick cross-linguistic feedback to users with only a modest amount of additional infrastructure.
  
  
    This project carries linguistic, computational, and practical interest.
    The linguistic interest lies in the HPSG community&#8217;s general bottom-up approach to language universals, which involves aiming for good coverage of a variety of languages first, and leaving the task of what they have in common for later.
    (Of course, theory building is never purely data-driven, and there are substantive hypotheses within HPSG about language universals.)
    Now that we have implementations with fairly extensive coverage for a somewhat typologically diverse set of languages, it is a good time to take the next step in this program, wor
