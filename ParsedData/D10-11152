ls is to formulate recursive compositional rules that derive the quantificational properties of complex sentences and their antecedent-pronoun dependencies.
    Given its focus on quantification, FS treats the meanings of nouns and verbs as pure extensions: nouns and (intransitive) verbs are properties, and thus denote sets of individuals.
    Adjectives are also often assumed to denote properties: in this view redadj would be the set of &#8216;entities which are red&#8217;, plasticadj, the set of &#8216;objects made of plastic&#8217;, and so forth.
    In the simplest case, the meaning of an attributive adjective-noun (AN) constituent can be obtained as the intersection of the adjective and noun extensions AnN: [ red car ] = {... red objects... } n {... cars... } However, the intersective method of combination is well-known to fail in many cases (Kamp, 1975; Montague, 1970a; Siegel, 1976): for instance, a fake gun is not a gun.
    Even for red, the manner in which the color combines with a noun will be diff
