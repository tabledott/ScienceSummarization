tly-labelled constituents.
    We believe the latter number (`nonull') to be a better performance metric, as it is not overwhelmed by the large number of untagged constituents.
    Both are reported below.
  
  
    There are, it seems, two reasonable baselines for this and future work.
    First of all, most constituents in the corpus have no tags at all, so obviously one baseline is to simply guess no tag for any constituent.
    Even for the most common type of function tag (grammatical), this method performs with 87% accuracy.
    Thus the with-null accuracy of a function tagger needs to be very high to be significant here.
    The second baseline might be useful in examining the no-null accuracy values (particularly the recall): always guess the most common tag in a category.
    This means that every constituent gets labelled with `--SBJ-TMP-TPC-CLR' (meaning that it is a topicalised temporal subject that is 'closely related' to its verb).
    This combination of tags is in fact entirely illegal by the
