t significantly increasing the size of the training corpus should result in a corresponding improvement in the accuracy of HBG and richer HBG-like models.
    To check the value of the above detailed history, we tried the simpler model: This model corresponds to a P-CFG with NTs that are the crude syntax and semantic categories annotated with the lexical heads.
    The Viterbi rate in this case was 66%, a small improvement over the P-CFG model indicating the value of using more context from the derivation tree.
  
  
    The success of the HBG model encourages future development of general history-based grammars as a more promising approach than the usual P-CFG.
    More experimentation is needed with a larger Treebank than was used in this study and with different aspects of the derivation history.
    In addition, this paper illustrates a new approach to grammar development where the parsing problem is divided (and hopefully conquered) into two subproblems: one of grammar coverage for the grammarian to addr
