			Major transformations in the field have come from creative new ap proaches.
			Consider the Penn Treebank, an ambitious and difficult project of unknown potential.
			Such large changes can be uncommon since they are often associated with high cost, as was the Penn Treebank.However, MTurk greatly reduces these costs, en couraging researchers to try creative new tasks.
