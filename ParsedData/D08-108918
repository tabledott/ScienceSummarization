or, this is an O(n) operation).
			Hence, the incorporation of the hierarchical models described in the paper into a phrase-based decoder preserves the O(n2) running time.
			In practice, we observe based on a set of experiments for Chinese-English and Arabic-English translation that our phrase-based decoder is on average only 1.35 times slower when it is running using hierarchical reordering features and the shift-reduce parser.We finally note that the decoding algorithm presented in this section can only be applied left-to right if the decoder itself is operating left-to-right.In order to predict orientations relative to the rightto-left hierarchical reordering model, we must resort to approximations at decoding time.
			We experi mented with different approximations, and the one that worked best (in the experiments discussed in Section 6) is described as follows.
			First, we note that an analysis of the alignment grid often reveals that certain orientations are impossible.
			For instance, the block issue
