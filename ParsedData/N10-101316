    Participants on Amazon&#8217;s Mechanical Turk5 (Snow et al., 2008) were asked to choose between two possible alternatives (one from a prototype model and one from a multi-prototype model) as being most similar to a given target word.
    The target words were presented either in isolation or in a sentential context randomly selected from the corpus.
    Table 2 lists the ambiguous words used for this task.
    They are grouped into homonyms (words with very distinct senses) and polysemes (words with related senses).
    All words were chosen such that their usages occur within the same part of speech.
    In the non-contextual task, 79 unique raters completed 7,620 comparisons of which 72 were discarded due to poor performance on a known test set.6 In the contextual task, 127 raters completed 9,930 compar
