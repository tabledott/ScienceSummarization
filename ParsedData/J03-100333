rtices.
    The test was performed on a Windows 2000 PC with a 900 mHz AMD Athlon Processor and 128 Mb RAM.
    The results are given in Table 1.
    We measured the system time right before and right after the call of the main function makeReferringExpression.
    We computed the differences between these two times for a number of target objects from the scene graphs (4 and 8 objects for the first two graphs, 16 for the remaining ones).
    Note that this measurement does not include the time Java requires for initialization or background activities such as garbage collection.
    Table 1 shows that even for the larger graphs, the program is able to find minimal distinguishing graphs relatively quickly.
    The current implementation is a straightforward one (see also Section 6), so optimization, possibly in combination with heuristics, is likely to show further improvements in performance.
