parameters, we obtained the same qualitative result, but the improvement for (c) and (d) appears even less significant in our results.
    Possible explanations for this difference are the fact that we derived our PSP measurements using an SVM classifier instead of an NB classifier, and that we did not use the same range of parameters for tuning.
    The optimal shared parameters produced almost the same results as the optimal author-specific parameters, and were used in subsequent experiments.
    We used the same PSP-based similarity measure and the same shared parameters c = 0.2, &#945; = 1.5 from our metric labeling experiments to perform graph-based semi-supervised learning.
    The results are reported as &#8216;SSL+PSP.&#8217; SSL has three additional parameters k', Q, and M. Again we tuned k', Q with cross validation.
    Tuning ranges are k' E 12, 3, 5,10, 20} and Q E 10.001, 0.01, 0.1,1.0,10.01.
    The optimal parameters are k' = 5 and Q = 1.0.
    These were used for all authors and for all labele
