i) how do we maintain high quality, i.e. annotation accuracy and inter-annotator consistency during the annotation process, and (iii) for what purposes is the corpus applicable, and (iv) what are our future plans?
			Although we will touch upon linguistic problems that are specific to Chinese, we believe these issues are general enough for the development of any single language corpus.
			1 Annotation Speed.
			There are three main factors that affect the annotation speed : annotators?
			background, guideline design and more importantly, the availability of preprocessing tools.
			We will discuss how each of these three factors affects annotation speed.
			1.1 Annotator Background.
			Even with the best sets of guidelines, it is important that annotators have received considerable training in linguistics, particularly in syntax.
			In both the segmentation/POS tagging phase and the syntactic bracketing phase, understanding the structure of the sentences is essential for correct annotation with reasonable spe
