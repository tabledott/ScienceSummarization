pproach that integrates part of speech information into the learning process, and shows that the accuracy of the system is almost doubled by adding linguistic knowledge to the term representation.
    In this section, we report on our experiments in keyword extraction using TextRank, and show that the graph-based ranking model outperforms the best published results in this problem.
    Similar to (Hulth, 2003), we are evaluating our algorithm on keyword extraction from abstracts, mainly for the purpose of allowing for a direct comparison with the results she reports with her keyphrase extraction system.
    Notice that the size of the text is not a limitation imposed by our system, and similar results are expected with TextRank applied on full-texts.
    The expected end result for this application is a set of words or phrases that are representative for a given natural language text.
    The units to be ranked are therefore sequences of one or more lexical units extracted from text, and these represent the v
