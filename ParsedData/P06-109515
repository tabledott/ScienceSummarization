or the single most-confident rule to apply to it, if any, to produce a labeled TLINK between those items.
    Each (if-then) rule has a left-hand side which consists of a conjunction of tests based on TimeML-related feature combinations (TimeML features along with part-ofspeech and chunk-related features), and a righthand side which is an assignment to one of the TimeML TLINK classes.
    The rule patterns are grouped into several different classes: (i) the event is anchored with or without a signal to a time expression within the same clause, e.g., (3c), (ii) the event is anchored without a signal to the document date (as is often the case for reporting verbs in news), (iii) an event is linked to another event in the same sentence, e.g., (3c), and (iv) the event in a main clause of one sentence is anchored with a signal or tense/aspect cue to an event in the main clause of the previous sentence, e.g., (1-2), (3a-b).
    The performance of this baseline is shown in Table 4 (line GTag).
