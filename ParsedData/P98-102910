ed as the choice of the largest number of classifiers is picked as the answer, with some method being specified for breaking ties.
    We tried simple voting, using the Maximum Entropy, Transformation-Based and Trigram taggers.
    In case of ties (all taggers disagree), the Maximum Entropy tagger output is chosen, since this tagger had the highest overall accuracy (this was determined by using a subset of the training set, not by using the test set).
    The results are shown in Figure 5.
    Simple voting gives a net reduction in error of 6.9% over the best of the three taggers.
    This difference is significant at a &gt;99% confidence level.
    Next, we try to exploit the idiosyncracies of the different taggers.
    Although the Maximum Entropy, Transformation-based and Trigram taggers use essentially the same types of contextual information for disambiguation, this information is exploited differently in each case.
    Our hope is that there is some regularity to these differences, which would then allo
