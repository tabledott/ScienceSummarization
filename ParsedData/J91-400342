    The purpose of a dictionary is an activity of referencing, which has an event structure of a process.
    I will now demonstrate that such structured information is not only useful for nouns, but necessary to account for their semantic behavior.
    I suggested earlier, that for cases such as 33, repeated below, there was no need to posit a separate lexical entry for each verb, where the syntactic and semantic types had to be represented explicitly.
    Example 42 Rather, the verb was analyzed as coercing its complement to the semantic type it expected.
    To illustrate this, consider 42(c).
    The type for begin within a standard typed intensional logic is &lt;VP , &lt;NP , S&gt;&gt;, and its lexical semantics is similar to that of other subject control verbs (cf.
    Klein and Sag [1985] for discussion).
    Assuming an event structure such as that of Krifka (1987) or Pustejovsky (1991), we can convert this lexical entry into a representation consistent with a logic making use of event-ty
