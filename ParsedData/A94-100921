ch as perplexity and the average probability of hypotheses show that, while they do give an indication of convergence during re-estimation, neither shows a strong correlation with the accuracy.
    Perhaps what is needed is a &amp;quot;similarity measure&amp;quot; between two models M and M', such that if a corpus were tagged with model M, M' is the model obtained by training from the output corpus from the tagger as if it were a hand-tagged corpus.
    However, preliminary experiments using such measures as the Kullback-Liebler distance between the initial and new models have again showed that it does not give good predictions of accuracy.
    In the end it may turn out there is simply no way of making the prediction without a source of information extrinsic to both model and corpus.
