al transducers.
    We recall classical theorems and give new ones characterizing sequential string-tostring transducers.
    Transducers that output weights also play an important role in language and speech processing.
    We give a specific study of string-to-weight transducers, including algorithms for determinizing and minimizing these transducers very efficiently, and characterizations of the transducers admitting determinization and the corresponding algorithms.
    Some applications of these algorithms in speech recognition are described and illustrated.
  
  
    Finite-state machines have been used in many areas of computational linguistics.
    Their use can be justified by both linguistic and computational arguments.
    Linguistically, finite automata are convenient since they allow one to describe easily most of the relevant local phenomena encountered in the empirical study of language.
    They often lead to a compact representation of lexical rules, or idioms and clich&#233;s, that appears na
