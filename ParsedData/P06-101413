 (i.e.
    WordNet covered 78.69% of the ODE senses).
    The WordNet clustering induced by the manual mapping was 49.85% of the original size and the average degree of polysemy decreased from 6.65 to 3.32.
    The reliability of our data set is substantiated by a quantitative assessment: 548 WordNet senses of 60 words were mapped to ODE entries by both annotators, with a pairwise mapping agreement of 92.7%.
    The average Cohen&#8217;s &#954; agreement between the two annotators was 0.874.
    In Table 2 we report the precision and recall of the lexical and semantic functions in providing the appropriate association for the set of senses having a corresponding entry in ODE (i.e. excluding the cases where a sense 2 was assigned by the manual annotators, cf.
    Section 2.3).
    We also report in the Table the accuracy of the two functions when we view the problem as a classification task: an automatic association is correct if it corresponds to the manual association provided by the annotators or if both as
