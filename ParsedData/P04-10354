rated sentence-level subjectivity detection with document-level sentiment polarity.
    Yu and Hatzivassiloglou (2003) provide methods for sentencelevel analysis and for determining whether a document is subjective or not, but do not combine these two types of algorithms or consider document polarity classification.
    The motivation behind the singlesentence selection method of Beineke et al. (2004) is to reveal a document&#8217;s sentiment polarity, but they do not evaluate the polarity-classification accuracy that results.
    As with document-level polarity classification, we could perform subjectivity detection on individual sentences by applying a standard classification algorithm on each sentence in isolation.
    However, modeling proximity relationships between sentences would enable us to leverage coherence: text spans occurring near each other (within discourse boundaries) may share the same subjectivity status, other things being equal (Wiebe, 1994).
    We would therefore like to supply our algo
