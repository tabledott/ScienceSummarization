ects, P(NP-C(Dreyf us) I S , VP , was) * P(NP-C(fund) I S ,VP , was) is unreasonably high.
    (2) is similar: P(NP-C (bill) , VP-C (funding) I VP , VB , was) = P(NP-C (bill) I VP , VB , was) *'P(VP-C (funding) I VP , VB , was) is a bad independence assumption.

    Each subcat frame is a multiset6 specifying the complements which the head requires in its left or right modifiers. spectively.
    Thus the subcat requirements are added to the conditioning context.
    As complements are generated they are removed from the appropriate subcat multiset.
    Most importantly, the probability of generating the STOP symbol will be 0 when the subcat frame is non-empty, and the probability of generating a complement will be 0 when it is not in the subcat frame; thus all and only the required complements will be generated.
    The probability of the phrase S (bought) -&gt; NP (week) NP-C(Marks) VP (bought) is now: Here the head initially decides to take a single NP-C (subject) to its left, and no com
