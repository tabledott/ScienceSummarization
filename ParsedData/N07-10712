    However, given the sentence: Fraud was suspected when accounts were charged by CCM telemarketers without obtaining consumer authorization. the plausible inference rule (1) would incorrectly infer that &#8220;CCM telemarketers announced the arrest of accounts&#8221;.
    This example depicts a major obstacle to the effective use of automatically learned inference rules.
    What is missing is knowledge about the admissible argument values for which an inference rule holds, which we call Inferential Selectional Preferences.
    For example, inference rule (1) should only be applied if X is a Person and Y is a Law Enforcement Agent or a Law Enforcement Agency.
    This knowledge does not guarantee that the inference rule will h
