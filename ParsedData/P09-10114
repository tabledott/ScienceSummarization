rio to refer to such a (w, s) pair.
    The text is simply a sequence of words w = (wi, ... , w|w|).
    We represent the world state s as a set of records, where each record r E s is described by a record type r.t E T and a tuple of field values r.v = (r.vi, ... , r.vm).1 For example, temperature is a record type in the weather domain, and it has four fields: time, min, mean, and max.
    The record type r.t E T specifies the field type r.tf E {INT, STR, CAT} of each field value r.vf, f = 1, ... , m. There are three possible field types&#8212;integer (INT), string (STR), and categorical (CAT)&#8212;which are assumed to be known and fixed.
    Integer fields represent numeric properties of the world such as temperature, string fields represent surface-level identifiers such as names of people, and categorical fields represent discrete concepts such as score types in football (touchdown, field goal, and safety).
    The field type determines the way we expect the field value to be rendered in words: integer fi
