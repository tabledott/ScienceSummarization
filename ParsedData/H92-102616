 tree than the immediate parent in conditioning the probability of expanding a constituent.
  We have approximated the above probability by the fol- lowing five factors: 1. p(Syn IRp, Ipc, Hip, Synp, Semp) ~The pr imary  lexical head H1 corresponds (roughly) to the lin- guistic not ion of a lexical head.
  The secondary lexicM head H2 has  no l inguistic parallel.
  It merely represents a word in the con- s t i tuent  besides the head which conta ins predict ive in format ion about  the const i tuent .

  Parameter  Es t imat ion We only have built a decision tree to the rule probabil- ity component (3) of the model.
  For the moment, we are using n-gram models with the usual deleted interpo- lation for smoothing for the other
