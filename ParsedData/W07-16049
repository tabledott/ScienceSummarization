 probabilities.
    Lemma forms of words were used as feature values to further reduce the total number and to allow the model to generalize across inflectional variants.
    Even after incorporating these reductions, the number of values was still very large.
    As Table 1 indicates, TGR, the word sequence including the preposition and the two words to its right, had 54,906 different values.
    Summing across all features, the model contained a total of about 388,000 feature#value pairs.
    Table 2 shows an example of where some of the features are derived from.
  
  
    The model was tested on 18,157 preposition contexts extracted from 12 files randomly selected from a portion of 1100 Lexile text (11th grade) that had not been used for training.
    For each context, the model predicted the probability of each preposition given the contextual representation.
    The highest probability preposition was then compared to the preposition that had actually been used by the writer.
    Because the test corpus
