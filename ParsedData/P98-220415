    According to the preference for inter-sentential candidates in the centering model, I define the following anaphora resolution strategy for the BEPalgorithm: (1) Test elements of Uj_1.
    (2) Test elements of Ui left-to-right.
    (3) Test elements of Cf (U2_2), Cf (U_3), ...
    In my algorithm steps (1) and (2) fall together.
    (3) is performed using previous states of the system.

    The test set consisted of the beginnings of three short stories by Hemingway (2785 words, 153 sentences) and three articles from the New York Times (4546 words, 233 sentences).
    The results of my experiments are given in Table 6.
    The first row gives the number of personal and possessive pronouns.
    The remainder of the Table shows the results for the BFP-algorithm, for the BFPalgorithm extended by Kameyama's intra-sentential specifications, and for my algorithm.
    The overall error rate of each approach is given in the rows marked with wrong.
