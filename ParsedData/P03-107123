lexical cohesion and that performs as well as state-ofthe-art text-based segmentation techniques.
    It works both with written and spoken texts.
    The text-based segmentation approach alone, when applied to meetings, outperforms all other segmenters, although the difference is not statistically significant.
    In future work, we would like to investigate the effects of adding prosodic features, such as pitch ranges, to our segmenter, as well as the effect of using errorful speech recognition transcripts as opposed to manually transcribed utterances.
    An implementation of our lexical cohesion segmenter is freely available for educational or research purposes.11
