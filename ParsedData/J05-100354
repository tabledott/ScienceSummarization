 the beam.
    The number of such parses varies sentence by sentence.
    In order to gain a representative set of training data, the 36,000 training sentences were parsed in 2,000 sentence chunks, each chunk being parsed with a model trained on the remaining 34,000 sentences (this prevented the initial model from being unrealistically &#8220;good&#8221;on the training sentences).
    The 4,000 development sentences were parsed with a model trained on the 36,000 training sentences.
    Section 23 was parsed with a model trained on all 40,000 sentences.
    In the experiments we used the following definition for the Score of the parse: where F-measure(xi,j) is the F1 score14 of the parse when compared to the goldstandard parse (a value between 0 and 100), and Size(xi,j) is the number of constituents in the gold-standard parse for the ith sentence.
    Hence the Score function is sensitive to both the accuracy of the parse, and also the number of constituents in the goldstandard parse.
    The following types o
