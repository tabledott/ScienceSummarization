is then classified by running down the list and matching each feature against the target context.
    The first feature that Training phase matches is used to classify the target word.
    Yarowsky [1994] describes further refinements, such as detecting and pruning features that make a zero or negative contribution to overall performance.
    The method of decision lists, as just described, is almost the same as the method for collocations in Figure 2, where we take &amp;quot;features&amp;quot; in that figure to include both context words and collocations.
    The main difference is that during evidence gathering (step (2) at run time), decision lists terminate after matching the first feature.
    This obviates the need for resolving conflicts between features.
    Given that decision lists base their answer for a problem on the single strongest feature, their performance rests heavily on how the strength of a feature is defined.
    Yarowsky [1994] used the following metric to calculate the strength of a fe
