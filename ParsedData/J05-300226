    The similarity function Sim is computed using bottom-up dynamic programming, in which the shortest subtrees are processed first.
    The alignment algorithm returns the similarity score of the trees as well as the optimal mapping between the subtrees of input trees.
    The pseudocode of this function is presented in the Appendix.
    In the resulting tree mapping, the pairs of nodes whose NodeSimilarity positively contributed to the alignment are considered parallel.
    Figure 5 shows two dependency trees and their alignment.
    As is evident from the Sim definition, we are considering only one-to-one node &#8220;matchings&#8221;: Every node in one tree is mapped to at most one node in another tree.
    This restriction is necessary because the problem of optimizing many-to-many alignments is NP-hard.7 The subtree flattening performed during the preprocessing stage aims to minimize the negative effect of the restriction on alignment granular
