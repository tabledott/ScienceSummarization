oking for a noun phrase to its right in order to be fully realized, VP(VBG(coming) PP(IN(from) NP:x0)); and that the Chinese particle p-DE, when occurring between a Chinese string that was translated into a verb phrase to its left and another Chinese string that was translated into a noun phrase to its right, VP:x1 p-DE NP:x0, should be translated to nothing, while forcing the reordering of the two constituents, NP(NP:x0, VP:x1).
    If all these translation rules (labeled r1 to r4 in Figure 1) were available to a decoder that derives English parse trees starting from Chinese input strings, this decoder could produce derivations such as that shown in Figure 2.
    Because our approach uses translation rules with Syntactified target language Phrases (see Figure 1), we call it SPMT.
    We are interested to model a generative process that explains how English parse trees 7r and their associated English string yields E, foreign sentences, F, and word-level alignments, A, are produced.
    We assume that observed
