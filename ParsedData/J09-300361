ity features perform under the more natural but less-than-perfect condition of automatic recognition of polar instances.
    To investigate this, the polarity classifiers (including the baselines) for each algorithm in these experiments start with the polar instances identified by the best performing neutral&#8211;polar classifier for that algorithm (from Section 8.1.1).
    The results for these experiments are given in Table 19.
    As before, statistically significant improvements over both baselines are given in bold.
    How well do the polarity features perform in the presence of noise from misclassified neutral instances?
    Our first observation comes from comparing Table 15 with Table 19: Polarity classification results are much lower for all classifiers with the noise of neutral instances.
    Yet in spite of this, the polarity features still produce classifiers that outperform the baselines.
    For three of the four algorithms, the classifier using all the polarity features has the highest accura
