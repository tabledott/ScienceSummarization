at the item x occurs in; if an item x occurs more than once in a derivation tree D, then the value of D is counted more than once.
    To formally define the reverse value of an item x, we must first define the outer trees outer(x).
    Consider an item derivation tree of the goal item, containing one or more instances of item x.
    Remove one of these instances of x, and its children too, leaving a gap in its place.
    This tree is an outer tree of x.
    Figure 8 shows an item derivation tree of the goal item, including a subderivation of an item b, derived from terms a1,.
    , ak.
    It also shows an outer tree of b, with b and its children removed; the spot b was removed from is labeled (b). parse regular grammars, and tend to be less useful.
    Thus, in most parsers of interest, k &gt; 1, and the complexity of (at least some) outside equations, when the sum is written out, is at least doubled.
    For an outer tree D E outer(x), we define its value, Z(D), to be the product of the values of all rules
