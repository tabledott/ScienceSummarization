e transition label &amp;quot;other&amp;quot; abbreviates the set of labels a:a,b:b, ...z:z, the identity pairs formed from all symbols that belong to the alphabet but are not mentioned explicitly in this particular rule.
    This diagram shows no transition over the pair N:N and the transducer therefore blocks if it sees N on both tapes.
    This is another abbreviatory convention that is typically used in implementations to reduce transducer storage requirements, and we use it here to simplify the state diagrams we draw.
    In formal treatments such as the one we present below, the transition function is total and provides for transitions from every state over every pair of symbols.
    Any transition we do not show in these diagrams in fact terminates at a single nonfinal state, the &amp;quot;failure&amp;quot; state, which we also do not show.
    Figure 3 is the more complicated transducer that models the obligatory behavior of Rule 1 (N &#8212;&gt; m/ +[labial]).
    This machine blocks in state 1 if it
