  The systems are trained and evaluated on corpora annotated for semantic relations pertaining to, for example, corporate acquisitions or terrorist events.
  The Proposition Bank (PropBank) takes a similar approach in that we annotate predicates?
  semantic roles, while steering clear of the issues involved in quantification and discourse-level structure.
  By annotating semantic roles for every verb in our corpus, we provide a more domain-independent resource, which we hope will lead to more robust and broad-coverage natural language understanding systems.
  The Proposition Bank focuses on the argument structure of verbs and provides a complete corpus annotated with semantic roles, including roles traditionally viewed as arguments and as adjuncts.
  It allows us for the first time to determine the frequency of syntactic variations in practice, the problems they pose for natural language understanding, and the strategies to which they may be susceptible.
  We begin the article by giving examples of the var
