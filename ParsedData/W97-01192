ut from our algorithm allows translators to increase their accuracy by 50.9%.
    In the following sections, we first describe a pair of non-parallel corpora we use for experiments, and then we introduce the Word Relation Matrix (WoRM), a statistical word feature representation for technical term translation from non-parallel corpora.
    We evaluate the effectiveness of this feature with two sets of experiments, using English/English, and English/Japanese non-parallel corpora.
  
  
    Few attempts have been made to explore non-parallel corpora of monolingual texts in the same domain.
    Early work uses a pair of non-parallel texts for the task of lexical disambiguation between several senses of a word (Dagan 1990).
    This basic idea extends to choosing a translation among multiple candidates (Dagan &amp; Itai 1994) given collocation information.
    A similar idea is later applied by (Rapp 1995) to show the plausibility of correlations between words in non-parallel text.
