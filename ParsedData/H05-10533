			Producing them would be ex tremely costly, since a substantial corpus would have to be annotated by hand for every domain of interest.
			In response to this problem, McCarthy et al (2004) proposed a method for automatically inducing the1This figure is the mean of two different estimates (Sny der and Palmer, 2004), the difference being due to multiword handling.

			They carried out a limited test of their method on text in two domains using subject field codes (Magnini andCavaglia`, 2000) to assess whether the acquired pre dominant sense information was broadly consistent with the domain of the text it was acquired from.But they did not evaluate their method on hand tagged domain-specific corpora since there was no such data publicly available.
			In this paper, we evaluate the method on domainspecific text by creating a sense-annotated gold standard2 for a sample of words.
			We used a lexical sam ple because the cost of hand tagging several corp
