 are frequently incompletely specified.
    All of the cited performance figures above also appear to derive from manual checks by the investigators of the system's predicted output, and it is hard to estimate the impact of the system's suggested chunking on the judge's determination.
    We believe that the work reported here is the first study which has attempted to find NP chunks subject only to the limitation that the structures recognized do not include recursively embedded NPs, and which has measured performance by automatic comparison with a preparsed corpus.
    We performed experiments using two different chunk structure targets, one that tried to bracket non-recursive &amp;quot;baseNPs&amp;quot; and one that partitioned sentences into non-overlapping N-type and V-type chunks, loosely following Abney's model.
    Training and test materials with chunk tags encoding each of these kinds of structure were derived automatically from the parsed Wall Street Journal text in the Penn Treebank (Marcus et al.,
