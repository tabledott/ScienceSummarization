uccessful refer- ring expression.
  It allows human preferences and capabilities to be taken into consideration.
  The *preferred- attributes* list, the preference for basic-level val- ues, and the user~knows function are all ways of biasing the algorithm towards generating referring expressions that use attributes and values that hu- taan hearers, with all their perceptual limitations, lind easy to process.
  Almost all referring expressions generated by IDAS contain a head noun and zero, one, or perhaps at most two modifiers; longer referring expressions are rare.
  The most important task of the algorithm is therefore to quickly generate asy-to-understand re- ferring expre~mions in such simple cases; optimal han- dling of more complex referring expressions i lees important, although the algorithm should be robuat enough to generate something plausible if a long re- ferring expression is needed.
