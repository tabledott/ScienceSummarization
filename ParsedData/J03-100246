gnment probabilities and a minor improvement when we smooth the fertility probabilities.
    An analysis of the alignments shows that smoothing the fertility probabilities significantly reduces the frequently occurring problem of rare words forming &#8220;garbage collectors&#8221; in that they tend to align with too many words in the other language (Brown, Della Pietra, Della Pietra, Goldsmith, et al. 1993).
    Without smoothing, we observe early overfitting: The alignment error rate increases after the second iteration of HMM, as shown in Figure 4.
    On the Verbmobil task, the best alignment error rate is obtained in the second iteration.
    On the Hansards task, the best alignment error rate is obtained in the sixth iteration.
    In iterations subsequent to the second on the Verbmobil task and the sixth on the Hansards task, the alignment error rate increases significantly.
