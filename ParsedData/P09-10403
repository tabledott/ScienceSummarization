unded distances, which often has a negative impact on parsing accuracy.
    On the other hand, it is hardly possible to ignore non-projective structures completely, given that 25% or more of the sentences in some languages cannot be given a linguistically adequate analysis without invoking non-projective structures (Nivre, 2006; Kuhlmann and Nivre, 2006; Havelka, 2007).
    Current approaches to data-driven dependency parsing typically use one of two strategies to deal with non-projective trees (unless they ignore them completely).
    Either they employ a non-standard parsing algorithm that can combine non-adjacent substructures (McDonald et al., 2005b; Attardi, 2006; Nivre, 2007), or they try to recover nonprojective dependencies by post-processing the output of a strictly projective parser (Nivre and Nilsson, 2005; Hall and Nov&#180;ak, 2005; McDonald and Pereira, 2006).
    In this paper, we will adopt a different strategy, suggested in recent work by Nivre (2008b) and Titov et al. (2009), and propose an
