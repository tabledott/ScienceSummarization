lgorithm.
    Yet we build upon this algorithm in several ways in that we: [1] consider circumfixes, [2] automatically identify capitalizations by treating them similar to prefixes [3] incorporate frequency information, [4] use distributional information to help identify syntactic properties, and [5] use transitive closure to help find variants that may not have been found to be semantically related but which are related to mutual variants.
    We then apply these strategies to English, German, and Dutch.
    We evaluate our algorithm Figure 2).
    Yet using this approach, there may be against the human-labeled CELEX lexicon in all circumfixes whose endings will be overlooked in three languages and compare our results to those the search for suffixes unless we first remove all that the Goldsmith and Schone/Jurafsky algorithms candidate prefixes.
    Therefore, we build a lexicon would have obtained on our same data.
    We show consisting of all words in our corpus and identify all how each of our additions
