Ps and a test set of 22699 instances (3.9% positive) from 3558 NPs.
    Results are shown in Table 2 (Duplicated Soon Baseline) where performance is reported in terms of recall, precision, and F-measure using the modeltheoretic MUC scoring program (Vilain et al., 1995). features.
    Non-relational features test some property P of one of the NPs under consideration and take on a value of YES or NO depending on whether P holds.
    Relational features test whether some property P holds for the NP pair under consideration and indicate whether the NPs are COMPATIBLE or INCOMPATIBLE w.r.t.
    P; a value of NOT APPLICABLE is used when property P does not apply.
    *&#8217;d features are in the hand-selected feature set (see Section 4) for at least one classifier/data set combination.
    The system achieves an F-measure of 66.3 and 61.2 on the MUC-6 and MUC-7 data sets, respectively.
    Similar, but slightly worse performance was obtained using RIPPER (Cohen, 1995), an information-gain-based rule learning syste
