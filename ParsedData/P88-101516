    For interruptions, 90% occur within topic, i.e. they do not result in topic shifts.
    The pattern is not as obvious for prompts and repetitions/summaries, with 57% of prompts occurring within topic and 67% of repetitions/summaries occurring within topic.

    We investigated the number of utterances for wh
