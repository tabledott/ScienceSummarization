st approach is to assume that the two types of acoustic observations (recognizer acoustics and prosodic features) are approximately conditionally independent once LI, is given: Since the recognizer acoustics are modeled by way of their dependence on words, it is particularly important to avoid using prosodic features that are directly correlated with word identities, or features that are also modeled by the discourse grammars, such as utterance position relative to turn changes.
    Figure 4 depicts the Bayes network incorporating evidence from both word recognition and prosodic features.
    One important respect in which the independence assumption is violated is in the modeling of utterance length.
    While utterance length itself is not a prosodic feature, it is an important feature to condition on when examining prosodic characteristics of utterances, and is thus best included in the decision tree.
    Utterance length is captured directly by the tree using various duration measures, while the DA-specif
