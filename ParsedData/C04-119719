			c=1 zic = 1 ?zic ? z, which means that each argument can take only one type.
			Note that this new constraint comes from thevariable transformation, and is not one of the con straints used in the filter function F .Constraints 1 through 3 can be evaluated on a per argument basis ? the sake of efficiency, arguments that violate these constraints are eliminated even before given the second-phase classifier.
			Next, we show how to transform the constraints in the filter function into the form of linear (in)equalities over z, and use them in this ILP setting.
			Constraint 4: No overlapping or embedding If arguments Sj1 , . . .
			, Sjk occupy the same word in asentence, then this constraint restricts only one ar guments to be assigned to an argument type.
			In other words, k ? 1 arguments will be the special class null, which means the argument candidate is not a legitimate argument.
			If the special class null is represented by the symbol ?, then for every set ofsuch arguments, the following linear equal
