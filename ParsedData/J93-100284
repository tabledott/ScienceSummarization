a lexeme and carrying these forward in the computation of the likelihood of each parse.
    However, the acquisition of the statistical information from which these probabilities can be derived is more problematic.
    Existing lexical taggers are unable to assign tags that reliably encode subcategorization information.
    It seems likely that automatic acquisition of such information must await successful techniques for robust parsing of, at least, phrases in corpora (though Brent [1991] claims to be able to recognize some subcategorization patterns using large quantities of untagged text).
    The task of selecting the correct analysis from the set licensed by the grammar is also partially solved by the system.
    It is clear from the results of the preliminary experiment reported in the previous section that it is possible to make the semantically and pragmatically correct analysis highly ranked, and even most highly ranked in many cases, just by exploiting the frequency of occurrence of the syntactic ru
