ch like those of CLAWS.
    However, it embodies several substantive changes.
    Those features that can be algorithmically defined have been used to the fullest extent.
    Other add-ons have been minimized.
    The major differences are outlined below.
    First, the optimal path is defined to be the one whose component collocations multiply out to the highest probability.
    The more complex definition applied by using the sum of all paths at of the network, is not used.
    Second, VOLSUNGA overcomes the Non-Polynomial complexity of CLAWS.
    Because of this change, it is never necessary to resort to a fallback algorithm, and the program is far smaller.
    Furthermore, testing the algorithm on extensive texts is not prohibitively costly.
    Third, VOLSUNGA implements Relative Tag Probabilities (RTPs) in a more quantitative manner, based upon counts from the Brown Corpus.
    Where CLAWS scales probabilities by 1/2 for RTP &lt; 0.1 (i.e., where less than 10% of the tokens for an ambiguous word are in
