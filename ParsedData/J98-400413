level adjunction structures is due to an independence assumption implicit in the PCFG model; specifically, that the upper and lower NPs in the two-level structure have the same expansions, and that these expansions have the same distributions.
    This assumption is clearly incorrect for the two-level tree representations.
    If we systematically relabel one of these NPs with a fresh label, then a PCFG induced from the resulting transformed treebank no longer has this property.
    The &amp;quot;parent annotation&amp;quot; transform discussed below, which appends the category of a parent node onto the label of all of its nonterminal children as sketched in Figure 2, has just this effect.
    Charniak and Carroll (1994) describe this transformation as adding &amp;quot;pseudo context-sensitivity&amp;quot; to the language model because the distribution of expansions of a node depends on nonlocal context, viz,, the category of its parent.3 This nonlocal information is sufficient to distinguish the upper and lowe
