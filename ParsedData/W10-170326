    The largest cell is the 1/1 ranking cell (top left).
    We included the reference translation as a system in this analysis, which is likely to lead to a lot of agreement on the highest rank between humans and automatic metrics.
    No allowances for ties were made in this analysis.
    That is, if a human ranked two system translations the same, this analysis expects the metrics to provide the same score in order to get them both correct.
    Future analysis could relax this constraint.
    As not all human rankings start with the highest possible rank of &#8220;1&#8221; (due to ties and withholding judgment on a particular system output being allowed), we set the highest automatic metric rank to the highest human rank and shifted the lower metric ranks down accordingly.
    Table 9 shows the summed diagonal percentages of the total count of all datapoints for all metrics that WMT10 scores were available for, both combined for all languages to English (X-English) and separately for each langu
