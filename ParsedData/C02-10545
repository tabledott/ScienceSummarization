prepared for IREX (Information Retrieval and Extrac tion Exercise1, Sekine and Eriguchi (2000)).
			It has about 19,000 NEs in 1,174 articles.
			We also use additional data by Isozaki (2001).
			Both datasets are based on Mainichi Newspaper?s 1994 and 1995 CD-ROMs.
			We use IREX?s formal test data calledGENERAL that has 1,510 named entities in 71 ar ticles from Mainichi Newspaper of 1999.
			Systems are compared in terms of GENERAL?s F-measure 1http://cs.nyu.edu/cs/projects/proteus/irexwhich is the harmonic mean of ?recall?
			and ?preci sion?
			and is defined as follows.
			Recall = M/(the number of correct NEs), Precision = M/(the number of NEs extracted by a system), where M is the number of NEs correctly extracted and classified by the system.We developed an SVM-based NE system by following our NE system based on maximum entropy (ME) modeling (Isozaki, 2001).
			We sim ply replaced the ME model with SVM classifiers.The above datasets are processed by a morphological analyzer ChaSen 2.2.12.
