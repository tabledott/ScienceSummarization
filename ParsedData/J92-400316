of which involves a logarithm.
    Since altogether we must make V &#8212; C merges, this straightforward approach to the computation is of order V5.
    We cannot seriously contemplate such a calculation except for very small values of V. A more frugal organization of the computation must take advantage of the redundancy in this straightforward calculation.
    As we shall see, we can make the computation of the average mutual information remaining after a merge in constant time, independent of V. Suppose that we have already made V &#8212;k merges, resulting in classes Ck(1), Ck (2), , Ck (k) and that we now wish to investigate the merge of Ck (i) with Ck (j for 1 &lt; i &lt;j &lt; k. Let pk(1, m) -= Pr (Ck (0, Ck(m)), i.e., the probability that a word in class Ck (m) follows a word in class Ck(1).
    Let and let The average mutual information remaining after V &#8212; k merges is We use the notation i+ j to represent the cluster obtained by merging Ck(i) and Ck(i)&#8226; If we know Ik.
