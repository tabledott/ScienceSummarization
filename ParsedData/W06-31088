ng the probability p(cj,j&#8242;|fJ1 , eI1, i, j) is maximum entropy (Berger et al., 1996).
    In this framework, we have a set of N feature functions hn(fJ1 , eI1, i, j, cj,j&#8242;), n = 1, ... , N. Each feature function hn is weighted with a factor &#955;n.
    The resulting model is: The functional form is identical to Equation 2, but here we will use a large number of binary features, whereas in Equation 2 usually only a very small number of real-valued features is used.
    More precisely, the resulting reordering model p&#955;N1 (cj,j&#8242;|fJ1 , eI1, i, j) is used as an additional component in the log-linear combination of Equation 2.
    The feature functions of the reordering model depend on the last alignment link (j, i) of a phrase.
    Note that the source position j is not necessarily the end position of the source phrase.
    We use the source position j which is aligned to the last word of the target phrase in target position i.
    The illustration in Figure 1 contains such an example.
