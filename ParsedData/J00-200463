 are considered incorrect.
    On the former metric, the method can generate translation lexicons with accuracy and coverage both exceeding 90%, as well as dictionary-size translation lexicons that are over 99% correct.
  
  
    There are many ways to model translational equivalence and many ways to estimate translation models.
    &amp;quot;The mathematics of statistical machine translation&amp;quot; proposed by Brown et al. (1993b) are just one kind of mathematics for one kind of statistical translation.
    In this article, I have proposed and evaluated new kinds of translation model biases, alternative parameter estimation strategies, and techniques for exploiting preexisting knowledge that may be available about particular languages and language pairs.
    On a variety of evaluation metrics, each infusion of knowledge about the problem domain resulted in better translation models.
    Each innovation presented here opens the way for more research.
    Model biases can be mixed and matched with each othe
