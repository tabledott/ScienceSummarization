    A trigram language model on the GIF vocabulary is estimated with the CMU toolkit, using Good-Turing smoothing and Katz back-off.
    Note that due to the smoothing, this language model does not necessarily assign zero probability to an illegal GIF sequence, e.g., one containing two consecutive initials.
    This causes the first translation system to sometimes, though very rarely, produce GIF sequences which do not correspond to any pin-yin sequence.
    We make an ad hoc correction of such sequences when mapping a GIF sequence to pin-yin, which is otherwise trivial for all legal sequences of initials and finals.
    Specifically, a final e or i or a is tried, in that order, between consecutive initials until a legitimate sequence of pin-yin symbols obtains.
    The language model required for translating pinyin sequences to Chinese characters is relatively straightforward.
    A character trigram model with Good-Turing discounting and Katz back-off is estimated from the list of transliterated nam
