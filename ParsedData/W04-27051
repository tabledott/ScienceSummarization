notation projects taken together should lead to the creation of better tools for the automatic analysis of text.
    These annotation projects may be viewed as part of what we think of as an a la carte strategy for corpus-based natural language processing.
    The fragile and inaccurate multistage parsers of a few decades were replaced by treebank-based parsers, which had better performance, but typically provided more shallow analyses.1 As the same set of data is annotated with more and more levels of annotation, a new type of multistage processing becomes possible that could reintroduce this information, 1A treebank-based parser output is defined by the treebank on which it is based.
    As these treebanks tend to be of a fairly shallow syntactic nature, the resulting parsers tend to be so also. but in a more robust fashion.
    Each stage of processing is defined by a body of annotated data which provides a symbolic framework for that level of representation.
