ittle as 1), and recombine the results.
    The overhead of partitioning and recombining is essentially only O(m).
    &#8226; For speeding up the O(n3) problem on subgraphs, one can use an approximate relaxation technique (Mohri, 2002).
    Efficient hardware implementation is also possible via chip-level parallelism (Rote, 1985).
    &#8226; In many cases of interest, Ti is an acyclic graph.20 Then Tar an&#8217;s method computes w0j for each j in topologically sorted order, thereby finding ti in a linear number of &#8853; and &#8855; operations.
    For HMMs (footnote 11), Ti is the familiar trellis, and we would like this computation of ti to reduce to the forwardbackward algorithm (Baum, 1972).
    But notice that it has no backward pass.
    In place of pushing cumulative probabilities backward to the arcs, it pushes cumulative arcs (more generally, values in V ) forward to the probabilities.
    This is slower because our &#8853; and &#8855; are vector operations, and the vectors rapidly lose sparsity a
