crete objects to color dimensions of the output vector (green chair), as well as large positive weights from features characterizing certain classes of abstract concepts to political/social dimensions in the output (green initiative).
    Somewhat optimistically, we hope that chair will have near-0 values on the relevant abstract dimensions, like initiative on the concrete features, and thus the weights will not interfere.
    We do not evaluate this claim specifically, but our quantitative evaluation in Section 6 shows that our approach does best with high frequency, highly ambiguous adjectives.
    Fourth, the approach is naturally syntax-sensitive, since we train it on observed data for a specific syntactic position: we would train separate linear models for, say, the same adjective in attributive (AN) and predicative (N is A) position.
    As a matter of fact, the current model is too syntax-sensitive and does not capture similarities across different constructions.
    Finally, although adjective represe
