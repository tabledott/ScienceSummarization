7000 and K is equal to 50, so the time complexity is about O(106).
    For efficiency, we may filter the entities in NESet before clustering them, which will be further discussed in Section 3.
    When selecting a machine-annotated named entity, we compare it with all previously selected named entities in the current batch.
    If the similarity between them is above a threshold 8, this example cannot be allowed to add into the batch.
    The order of selecting examples is based on some measure, such as informativeness measure, representativeness measure or their combination.
    This local selection method is shown in Figure 2.
    In this way, we avoid selecting too similar examples (similarity value &#8805; 8) in a batch.
    The threshold 8 may be the average similarity between the examples in NESet.
    This consideration only requires O(NK+K2) computational time.
    In one of our experiments (N &#732; 17000 and K = 50), the time complexity is about O(105).
    It is more efficient than clustering algor
