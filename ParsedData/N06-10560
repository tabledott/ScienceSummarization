  Learning For Semantic Parsing With Statistical Machine Translation
  
    We present a novel statistical approach to parsing, for constructing a complete, formal meaning representation of a sentence.
    A semantic parser is learned given a set of sentences annotated with their correct meaning represen- The main innovation of is its use of state-of-the-art statistical machine translation techniques.
    A word alignment model is used for lexical acquisition, and the parsing model itself can be seen as a syntax-based translation model. show that favorably in terms of both accuracy and coverage compared to existing learning methods requiring similar amount of supervision, and shows better robustness to variations in task complexity and word order.
  
  
    Recent work on natural language understanding has mainly focused on shallow semantic analysis, such as semantic role labeling and word-sense disambiguation.
    This paper considers a more ambitious task of semantic parsing, which is the construction of a
