here R2 refers to the output of the linear regression test and HSO refers to Hirst and St-Onge similarity measure.
    In the case of NN compounds, the correlation with LSA is very low for all tests, that is LSA is unable to reproduce the relative similarity values derived from WordNet with any reliability.
    With verb-particles, correlation is notably higher than for NN compounds,3 but still at a low level.
    Based on these results, LSA would appear to correlate poorly with WordNet-based similarities.
    However, our main interest is not in similarity per se, but how reflective LSA similarities are of the decomposability of the MWE in question.
    While taking note of the low correlation with WordNet similarities, therefore, we move straight on to look at the hyponymy test.
    We next turn to analysis of correlation between LSA similarities and hyponymy values.
    Our expectation is that for constituent word&#8211;MWE pairs with higher LSA similarities, there is a greater likelihood of the MWE being
