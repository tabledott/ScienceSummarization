s subsection, 152(A2) &lt;f and P2(B2) &lt; (1 &#8212;f) because the PCFG assigns nonzero probability to trees not in the training corpus.
    Again, we calculate the estimated relative frequencies of (A2) and (B2) under P2.
    The relationship betweenf and1.2 is also plotted in Figure 4.
    The value of.12 can diverge from f, although not as widely asfi.
    For example, at f = 0.4812 = 0.36.
    Thus the precise tree structure representations used to train a PCFG can have a marked effect on the probability distribution that it generates.
    The previous subsection showed that inserting additional nodes into the tree structure can result in a PCFG language model that better models the distribution of trees in the training corpus.
    This subsection investigates the effect of removing the lower NP node in the WSJ NP modification structure, again resulting in a pair of more symmetric tree The training corpus i'3.
    The NP modification tree representation used in the Penn II WSJ corpus is &amp;quot;flatte
