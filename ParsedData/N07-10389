ot product w[i]&#183;x, or it can take into account the weight vectors for other aspects weighted by a measure of interaspect similarity.
    We adopt the definition given in equation 1, replacing the user-specific weight vectors with our aspect-specific weight vectors.
    3More precisely (taking into account the possibility of ties): y[i] = min1E{1,..,k}{r : scorei(x) &#8722; b[i],.
    &lt; 01 The agreement model is a vector of weights a E Rn.
    A value of a &#183; x &gt; 0 predicts that the ranks of all m aspects are equal, and a value of a &#183; x &lt; 0 indicates disagreement.
    The absolute value Ja &#183; xJ indicates the confidence in the agreement prediction.
    The goal of the decoding procedure is to predict a joint rank for the m aspects which satisfies the individual ranking models as well as the agreement model.
    For a given input x, the individual model for aspect i predicts a default rank y[i] based on its feature weight and boundary vectors (w[i], b[i]).
    In addition, the agreeme
