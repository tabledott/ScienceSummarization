    The first clause for 'terminal' says that, provided the current extraposition list allows a gap to appear in the derivation, terminal symbol T may be taken from the position SO in the source string, where T connects SO to some new position S. The second clause for 'terminal' says that if the next symbol in the current extraposition list is a terminal T, then this symbol can be taken as if it occurred at S in the source string.
    The clause for 'virtual' allows a non-terminal to be &amp;quot;read off from&amp;quot; the extraposition list.
