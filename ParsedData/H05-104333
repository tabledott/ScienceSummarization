 ability to identify a word?s SO label in the context of a given feature and sentence allows the system to correctly extract opinionsexpressed by words such as ?big?
			or ?small?, whose se mantic orientation varies based on context.

			OPINE?s precision is higher than that of PMI++ and of Hu++.
			All results are reported with respect to PMI++.
	
	
			The key components of OPINE described in this paper are the PMI feature assessment which leads to high-precisionfeature extraction and the use of relaxation-labeling in or der to find the semantic orientation of potential opinionwords.
			The review-mining work most relevant to our re search is that of (Hu and Liu, 2004) and (Kobayashi et al., 2004).
