 scene given in Figure 2, for example, can now be represented by the graph in Figure 3.
    This graph models the respective spatial relations between the two chihuahuas, between the two doghouses, and between each dog and the nearest doghouse.
    For the sake of transparency we have not modeled the relations between the dogs and the distant doghouses (i.e., between d1 and d4 and between d2 and d3).
    (It is worth stressing that adding these edges would not result in different outcomes in the discussion below).
    Note that properties (such as dog) are always modeled as loops, Some graphs for referring expressions, with circles around the intended referent. that is, as edges that start and end in the same vertex.
    Relations may have different start and end vertices, but they do not have to (consider potentially reflexive relations such as shave).
    Finally, note that the graph sometimes contains properties of various levels of specificity (e.g., chihuahua and dog).
    This aspect of scene graphs wil
