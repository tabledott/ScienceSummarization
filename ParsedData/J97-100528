 7th, while the 7th segment corresponds to the end of the 7th episode.
    The large proportion of white space to black space in the left bar chart of Figure 3 illustrates graphically that subjects assign boundaries relatively infrequently.
    The large regions of white space separated by very wide bars shows a striking consensus on certain segments (white space) and segment boundaries (wide black bars).
    To illustrate graphically the improbability of the occurrence of wide bars (high-consensus boundaries), we also show a typical random distribution for a parallel data set in the right-hand bar chart of Figure 3.
    To create this data, we repeatedly performed the following experiment, and randomly selected one result.
    First we created seven hypothetical subjects, each of whom assigns the same number of boundaries as one of the Frequency that N subjects identify any boundary slot as a boundary. real subjects from the same number of potential boundary slots.
    The hypothetical subjects assign bounda
