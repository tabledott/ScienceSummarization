).
    However, this approach did not include sentence specific prior estimates, word posterior estimates, and did not allow joint optimization of the system and feature weights.
  
  
    The optimization of the system and feature weights may be carried out using -best lists as in (Ostendorf et al., 1991).
    A confusion network may be represented by a word lattice and standard tools may be used to generate -best hypothesis lists including word confidence scores, language model scores and other features.
    The -best list may be re-ordered using the sentence-level posteriors from Equation 6 for the th source sentence and the corresponding th hypothesis .
    The current -best hypothesis given a set of weights may be represented as follows The objective is to optimize the-best score on a development set given a set of reference translations.
    For example, estimating weights which minimize TER between a set of-best hypothesis and reference translations can be written as This objective function is very com
