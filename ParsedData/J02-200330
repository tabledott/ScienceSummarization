sults show clearly that the extent of generalization decreases with an increase in the value of &#945;, supporting the trend observed in Table 3.
    The results also show that the extent of generalization increases with a decrease in sample size.
    Again, this is to be expected, since any difference in probability estimates is less likely to be significant for tables with low counts.
  
  
    The approaches used for comparison are that of Resnik (1993, 1998), subsequently developed by Ribas (1995), and that of Li and Abe (1998), which has been adopted by McCarthy (2000).
    These have been chosen because they directly address the question of how to find a suitable level of generalization in WordNet.
    The first alternative uses the &#8220;association score,&#8221; which is a measure of how well a set of concepts, C, satisfies the selectional preferences of a verb, v, for an argument position, r:9 An estimate of the association score, &#710;A(C, v, r), can be obtained using relative frequency estimates
