e we do not as yet assign different classes to the instances of a verb, we can assign a single predominant class to new verbs that have never been encountered.
    To preview our results, we demonstrate that combining just five numerical indicators, automatically extracted from large text corpora, is sufficient to reduce the error rate in this classification task by more than 50% over chance.
    Specifically, we achieve almost 70% accuracy in a task whose baseline (chance) performance is 34%, and whose expert-based upper bound is calculated at 86.5%.
    Beyond the interest for the particular classification task at hand, this work addresses more general issues concerning verb class distinctions based in argument structure.
    We evaluate our hypothesis that such distinctions are reflected in statistics over corpora through a computational experimental methodology in which we investigate as indicated each of the subhypotheses below, in the context of the three verb classes under study: In the following secti
