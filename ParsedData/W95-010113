 the tagger, a single tag is randomly chosen from the possible tags, and this tag is then compared to the gold standard.
    Initial state tagging accuracy on the training set is 90.7%.
    After learning 1,151 transformations, training set accuracy increases to 95.0%.
    Initial state tagging accuracy on the test set is also 90.7%.
    Accuracy increases to 95.1% after applying the learned transformations.
    Figure 2 shows test set tagging accuracy as a function of transformation number.
    In figure 3, we plot the difference between training and test set accuracies after the application of each transformation, including a smoothed curve.10 Notice that there is no overtraining: the difference in accuracies on training and test set remain within a very narrow range throughout, with test set accuracy exceeding training set accuracy by a small margin.
    Overtraining did not occur when using the original Brown Corpus either.
    When training a stochastic tagger using the Baum-Welch algorithm, overtraining
