 (I) (called a restrictor) of what the allowable domain at each node of a dag is, we can define a functional, that yields the dag restricted by the given restrictor.
    Formally, we define restriction as follows.
    Given a relation 41 between paths and labels, and a dag D, we define Dt4) to be the most specific dag D' D such that for every path p either De(p) is undefined, or LY(p) is atomic, or for every 1 E dom(Ds(p)), p(111.
    That is, every path in the restricted dag is either undefined, atomic, or specifically allowed by the restrictor.
    The restriction process can be viewed as putting dags into equivalence classes, each equivalence class being the largest set of dags that all are restricted to the same dag (which we will call its canonical member).
    It follows from the definition that in general DM) C D. Finally, if we disallow infinite relations as restrictors (i.e., restrictors must not allow values for an infinite number of distinct paths) as we will do for the remainder of the discussion,
