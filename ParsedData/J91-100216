his simple indicator of coherence is useful, since as stated above, there does not exist a computationally feasible method of identifying coherence in non&#8212;domain-specific text.
    Cohesion is a useful indicator of coherence regardless of whether it is used intentionally by writers to create coherence, or is a result of the coherence of text.
    Hobbs (1978) sees the resolution of coreference (which is a form of cohesion) as being subsumed by the identification of coherence.
    He uses a formal definition of coherence relations, an extensive knowledge base of assertions and properties of objects and actions, and a mechanism that searches this knowledge source and makes simple inferences.
    Also, certain elements must be assumed to be coreferential.
    He shows how, in example (7), an assumption of coherence allows the combination to be identified as the combination of Bill's safe and John and he to be found to be coreferential.
    But lexical cohesion would also indicate that safe and combination
