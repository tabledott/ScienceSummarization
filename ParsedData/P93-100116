 array with a width of w=Ni+Ny and a height of h=B +B.
    (The array is stored in rotated coordinates.)
    Unfortunately, this is generally not possible.
    Therefore, we compute a &amp;quot;resolution&amp;quot; factor, r, which indicates how much we have to compromise from this ideal.
    The resolution factor, r, which depends on the available.amount of memory M, indicates the resolution of the dotplot array in units of bytes per cell. r = -\/ (N, + Ny) (Bmax + Brnin ) The dotplot array is then allocated to have a width of The dots are then computed, followed by the path, which is used to compute tighter bounds, if possible.
    As can be seen in Figure 13, this iteration has a tendency to start with a fairly square dotplot and generate ever wider and wider dotplots, until the signal extends to both the top and bottom of the dotplot.
    In practice, the resolution places a lower bound on the error rate.
    For example, the alignments of the &amp;quot;easy&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;hard&amp;quot; datasets
