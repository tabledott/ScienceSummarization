ne is produced by a simplification of our algorithm, where paraphrase information is omitted during the alignment process.
    This baseline is included to capture the contribution of paraphrase information to the performance of the fusion algorithm.
    The third baseline consists of the basis sentence.
    The comparison with this baseline reveals the contribution of the insertion and deletion stages in the fusion algorithm.
    The comparison against an RFA2 sentence provides an upper bound on the performance of the system and baselines.
    In addition, this comparison sheds light on the human agreement on this task.

    The shares have fallen 60% this year.
    They said Qwest was forcing them to exchange their bonds at a fraction of face value&#8212;between 52.5% and 82.5%, depending on the bond&#8212;or else fall lower in the pecking order for repayment in case Qwest went broke.
    Qwest had offered to exchange up to $12.9 billion of the old bonds, which carri
