tem performance.
			Results The baseline system (described in(Chodorow et al, 2007)) performed at 79.8% precision and 11.7% recall.
			Next we tested the differ ent combination models: word, tag, word+tag, andall three.
			Surprisingly, three of the four combina tion models: tag, word+tag, all, did not improve performance of the system when added to the model, but using just the +Combo:word features improved recall by 1%.
			We use the +Combo:word model to test our sampling approach in section 4.
			As a final test, we tuned our training corpus of 7 million events by removing any contexts with unknown or misspelled words, and then retrained the model.
			This ?purge?
			resulted in a removal of nearly 200,000 training events.
			With this new training corpus, the +Combo:tag feature showed the biggest improvement over the baseline, withan improvement in both precision (+2.3%) and re call (+2.4%) to 82.1% and 14.1% respectively (last line of Table 2.
			While this improvement may seemsmall, it is in part due to
