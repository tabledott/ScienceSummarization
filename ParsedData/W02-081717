build large sense tagged corpora for some of the most frequent ambiguous words in English.
    The tagging will be collected over the Web from volunteer contributors.
    We propose to organize a task in SENSEVAL-3 where systems will disambiguate words using the corpus created with this system.
    We will initially select a set of 100 nouns, and collect for each of them tagged samples (Edmonds, 2000), where is the number of senses of the noun.
    It is worth mentioning that, unlike previous SENSEVAL evaluations, where multi-word expressions were considered as possible senses for an constituent ambiguous word, we filter these expressions apriori with an automatic tool for collocation extraction.
    Therefore, the examples we collect refer only to single ambiguous words, and hence we expect a lower inter-tagger agreement rate and lower WSD tagging precision when only single words are used, since usually multi-word expressions are not ambiguous and they constitute some of the &#8221;easy cases&#8221; when doi
