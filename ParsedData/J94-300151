rmines which of the two tapes the left and right contexts must appear on.
    In a left-to-right rule, the left context of the rule is to be verified against the portion of the string that results from previous applications of that rule, whereas the right context is to be verified against the portion of the string that has not yet been changed but may eventually be modified by applications further to the right.
    In a right-to-left rule, the situation is reversed.
    Consider again the left-to-right rule schema which applies to the string abecido to give (Thatch).
    The portions of the tapes that support the two applications of the rule are boxed in the diagram on the left below.
    The diagram on the right shows how it comes about that there are three applications when the rule is taken as moving from right to left.
    It is often convenient in phonological rules to introduce a special symbol to mark the beginning and end of the string.
    This allows edge-conditioned string transformations to be enc
