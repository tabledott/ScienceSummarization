usions that the Portuguese system is better, and one wrong conclusion that the Danish system is better.
    That we draw one wrong conclusion, is unfortunate, but should not come as a surprise, when we talk about 95% statistical singificance levels.
    At this level, 1 conclusion in 20 is expected to be wrong.
  
  
    We introduced two methods using bootstrap resampling.
    One method estimates bounds for the true performance level of a system.
    The other method, paired bootstrap resampling, estimates how confidently we can draw the conclusion from a test result that one system outperforms another.
    We would now like to provide experimental evidence that these estimates are indeed correct at the specified level of statistical significance.
    We carried out a large number of experiments to estimate statistical significance for system comparisons.
    We compared 9 different pairs of systems, with different test set sizes.
    Detailed results can be found in Table 3.
    The test set sizes vary fro
