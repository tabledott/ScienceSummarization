 oracle lexical entries in the training.
    This means that we must incorporate the preference of filtering into the final parse selection.
    As shown in Table 9, the models combined with a preliminary model achieved sufficient accuracy.
    The reference distribution method achieved higher accuracy and lower cost.
    The feature function method achieved lower accuracy in our experiments.
    A possible reason for this is that a hyper-parameter of the prior was set to the same value for all the features including the feature of the log-probability given by the preliminary distribution.
    Tables 10 and 11 show the results of changing the filtering threshold.
    We can determine the correlation between the estimation/parsing cost and accuracy.
    In our experiment, n &gt; 10 and c &gt; 0.90 seem necessary to preserve the F-score over 86.0.
    Table 12 shows the accuracy with different feature sets.
    Accuracy was measured for 15 models with some atomic features removed from the final model.
