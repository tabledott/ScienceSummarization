and MT decoding is the lack of reliable heuristics in MT.
    A heuristic is used in A* search to estimate the cost of completing a partial hypothesis.
    A good heuristic makes it possible to accurately compare the value of different partial hypotheses, and thus to focus the search in the most promising direction.
    The left-to-right restriction in SR makes it possible to use a simple yet reliable class of heuristics which estimate cost based on the amount of input left to decode.
    Partly because of the absence of left-to-right correspondence, MT heuristics are significantly more difficult to develop (Wang and Waibel, 1997).
    Without a heuristic, a classic stack decoder is ineffective because shorter hypotheses will almost always look more attractive than longer ones, since as we add words to a hypothesis, we end up multiplying more and more terms to find the probability.
    Because of this, longer hypotheses will be pushed off the end of the stack by shorter ones even if they are in reality better
