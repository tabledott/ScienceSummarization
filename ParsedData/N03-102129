optimizations of monolingual parsers generalize to the synchronous case, but others do not; (2) discontinuous constituents are essential for parsing bitexts even in similar Western languages; (3) different binarization schemes lead to different time and space complexity.
    There are many aspects of translational equivalence that MTG cannot express, such as some of those described by Dorr (1994).
    In future work, we hope to extend the formalism to cover some of the aspects that would not raise the computational complexity of its recognition, such as discontinuous and/or phrasal terminals.
    Concurrently, we shall explore the empirical properties of MTG, by inducing stochastic MTGs from real multitexts.

    The idea of treating binarization as an optimization problem is due to Wei Wang.
