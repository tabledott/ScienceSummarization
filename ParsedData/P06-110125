compute coarse-grained precision as (c1 + c3)/total.
    Inferring the correct coarse-grained supersense of a novel hyponym can be viewed as a fine-grained (26-category) Named Entity Recognition task; our algorithm for taxonomy induction can thus be viewed as performing high-accuracy fine-grained NER.
    Here we compare against both the baseline non-joint algorithm as well as an &#8220;oracle&#8221; algorithm for Named Entity Recognition, which perfectly classifies the supersense of all nouns that fall under the four supersenses {person, group, location, quantity}, but works only for those supersenses.
    Table 3 shows the results of this coarse-grained evaluation.
    We see that the baseline non-joint algorithm has higher precision than the NER oracle as 10,000 and 20,000 links; however, both are significantly outperformed by our joint algorithm, which maintains high coarse-grained precision (92%) even at 20,000 links.
    For our final evaluation we compare our learned taxonomies directly against the cur
