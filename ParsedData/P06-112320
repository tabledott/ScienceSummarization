lty word alignments.
    10 were due to valid word reordering.
    In the following example, a co-referring pronoun causes the word alignment to fail with a constraining tree on the second sentence: meeting with Bush in Washington last Thursday.
    3b But after Chretien talked to Bush last Thursday in Washington, he seemed to change his original stance.
    25 of the 30 sentence pairs in category 3 failed to align due to parser error.
    5 examples failed because of valid word reordering.
    1 of the 5 reorderings was due to a difference between active voice and passive voice, as in Figure 3.
    The last row of Table 6 takes the various reasons for alignment failure into account.
    It estimates what the failure rates would be if the monolingual parses and word alignments were perfect, with 95% confidence intervals.
    These revised rates emphasize the importance of reliable word alignments for this kind of study.
