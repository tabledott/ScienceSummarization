	Estimation of Conditional Probabilities With Decision Trees and an Application to Fine-Grained POS Tagging
		We present a HMM part-of-speech tag ging method which is particularly suited for POS tagsets with a large number of fine-grained tags.
		It is based on three ideas: (1) splitting of the POS tags into attributevectors and decomposition of the contex tual POS probabilities of the HMM into aproduct of attribute probabilities, (2) esti mation of the contextual probabilities with decision trees, and (3) use of high-order HMMs.
		In experiments on German andCzech data, our tagger outperformed state of-the-art POS taggers.
	
	
			A Hidden-Markov-Model part-of-speech tagger (Brants, 2000, e.g.) computes the most probable POS tag sequence ? t N 1 = ? t 1 , ..., ? t N for a given word sequence w N 1 . ? t N 1 = argmax t N 1 p(t N 1 , w N 1 )The joint probability of the two sequences is de fined as the product of context probabilities and lexical probabilities over all POS tags: p(t N 1 , w N 1 ) = N ? i=1 p(t
