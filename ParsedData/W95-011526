a filters for inducing translation lexicons crucially depends on the particular pair of languages under consideration.
    Cognates are more common, and therefore more useful, in languages which are more closely related.
    For example, one would expect to find more cognates between Russian and Ukrainian than between French and English.
    The implementation of a part of speech filter for a given pair of languages depends on the availability of part of speech taggers for both languages, where the two taggers have a small common tag set.
    The effectiveness of oracle filters based on MRBDs will depend on the extent to which the vocabulary of the MRBD intersects with the vocabulary of the training text.
    This, in turn, depends partly on the size of the MRBD.
    Filters based on word alignment patterns will only be as good as the model of typical word alignments between the pair of languages in question.
    For languages with very similar syntax, a linear model will suffice.
    Higher order models will
