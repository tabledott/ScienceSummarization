te of the polarity, weighted by its frequency in the corpus.
    This metric emulates the precision of the detection of polar clauses with newly acquired poler atoms, in the runtime SA system.
    Relative Recall.
    The estimated ratio of the number of detected polar clauses with the expanded lexicon to the number of detected polar clauses with the initial lexicon.
    Relative recall will be 1 when no new polar atom is acquired.
    Since the precision was high enough, this metric can be used for approximation of the recall, which is hard to evaluate in extraction tasks such as clause-/phrase-level SA.
  
  
    For each of the four domain corpora, the annotators evaluated 100 randomly selected polar atoms which were newly acquired by our method, to measure the precisions.
    Relative recall is estimated by comparing the numbers of detected polar clauses from randomly selected 2,000 sentences, with and without the acquired polar atoms.
    Table 8 shows the results.
    The token precision is higher than
