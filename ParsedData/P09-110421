competitive thresholding heuristic of DeNero and Klein (2007).
    On this data set, our block ITG models make substantial performance improvements over the HMM, and moreover these results do translate into downstream improvements in BLEU score for the Chinese-English language pair.
    Because of this, we will briefly describe the features used for these models in detail.
    For features on one-by-one cells, we consider Dice, the distance features from (Taskar et al., 2005), dictionary features, and features for the 50 most frequent lexical pairs.
    We also trained an HMM aligner as described in DeNero and Klein (2007) and used the posteriors of this model as features.
    The first two columns of Table 2 illustrate these features for ITG and one-to-one matchings.
    For our block ITG models, we include all of these features, along with variants designed for many-to-one blocks.
    For example, we include the average Dice of all the cells in a block.
    In addition, we also created three new block-speci
