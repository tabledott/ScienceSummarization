ir arguments.
    For example, letter has 3 senses in WordNet,2 and belongs to 19 classes in all.
    In order to approximate its plausibility as the object of write, the selectional association with write was computed for all 19 classes, and the highest value returned &#8212; in this case, (writing) (&amp;quot;anything expressed in letters; reading matter&amp;quot;).
    Since only one sense of letter has this class as an ancestor, this method of determining argument plausibility has, in essence, performed sense disambiguation as a side effect.
    This observation suggests the following simple algorithm for disambiguation by selectional preference.
    Let n be a noun that stands in relationship R to predicate p, and let {81, sk} be its possible senses.
    For i from 1 to k, compute: C1 = fele is an ancestor of s} ai = max AR(p, c) cEc, and assign ai as the score for sense si.
    The simplest way to use the resulting scores, following Miller et al. (1994), is as follows: if n has only one sense, select it
