oundaries are assigned), C corresponds to the number of correctly placed boundaries, P the precision, R the recall, and the asterisk shows the precision/recall break-even point.
    The higher-scoring boundaries are almost always exact hits, but those farther down are more likely to be off by one to three sentences.
    Only one transition is missed entirely, and it occurs after a sequence of five isolated sentences and a byline (a weak boundary is marked preceding these isolated sentences).
    The high-scoring boundaries that do not correspond to shifts between articles almost always correspond to strong subtopic shifts.
    One exception occurs in the article consisting only of interest rate listings.
    Another occurs in an article associating numerical information with names.
    Overall the scores are much stronger than those reported in Reynar (1994), and are comparable to those of Nomoto and Nitta (1994) whose best precision/recall trade-off on a collection of approximately 80 articles is approximate
