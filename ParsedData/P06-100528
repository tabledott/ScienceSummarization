 along the lines of (Barbu and Mitkov, 2001) remains the best way to isolate areas for system improvement.
    Our pronoun resolution system is part of a larger information retrieval project where resolution accuracy is not necessarily the most pertinent measure of classifier performance.
    More than one candidate can be useful in ambiguous cases, and not every resolution need be used.
    Since the SVM ranks antecedent candidates, we can test this ranking by selecting more than the top candidate (Topn) and evaluating coverage of the true antecedents.
    We can also resolve only those instances where the most likely candidate is above a certain distance from the SVM threshold.
    Varying this distance varies the precision-recall (PR) of the overall resolution.
    A representative PR curve for the Top-n classifiers is provided (Figure 2).
    The corresponding information retrieval performance can now be evaluated along the Top-n / PR configurations.
