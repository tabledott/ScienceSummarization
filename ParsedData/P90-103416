  Rather, we expect that nouns could be ranked, on the basis of their distribution, according to how empty they are; this is a matter for further exploration.
    Sample size.
    The current sample is too small; many words occur too infrequently to be adequately sampled, and it is easy to think of usages that are not represented in the sample.
    For example, it is quite expected to talk about brewing beer, but the pair of brew and beer does not appear in this sample.
    Part of the reason for missing selectional pairs is surely the restricted nature of the AP news sublangu age.
    Further analysis.
    The similarity metric proposed here, based on subject-verb-object relations, represents a considerable reduction in the information available in the subjec-verbobject table.
    This reduction is useful in that it permits, for example, a clustering analysis of the nouns in the sample, and for some purposes (such as demonstrating the plausibility of the distribution-based metric) such clustering is useful.
