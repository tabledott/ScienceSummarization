 These trees received trivial modifications to allow them to be read, e.g., adding the missing extra set of parentheses around the complete tree.
    We trained our classifier on the parsed data files in the training and development sections, and evaluated the classifer on the test section.
    Section 3 evaluates the parser&#8217;s output in conjunction with this classifier; this section focuses on the classifier&#8217;s performance at the individual word token level.
    In our complete application, the classifier uses a bitag tagger to assign each word a POS tag.
    Like all such taggers, our tagger has a nonnegligible error rate, and these tagging could conceivably affect the performance of the classifier.
    To determine if this is the case, we report classifier performance when trained both on &#8220;Gold Tags&#8221; (the tags assigned by the human annotators of the Switchboard corpus) and on &#8220;Machine Tags&#8221; (the tags assigned by our bitag tagger).
    We compare these results to a baseline
