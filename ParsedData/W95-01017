mation in each iteration of learning.
    In order to derive an unsupervised version of the learner, an objective function must be found for training that does not need a manually tagged corpus.
    We begin our exploration providing the training algorithm with a minimal amount of initial knowledge, namely knowing the allowable tags for each word, and nothing else.7 The relative likelihoods of tags for words is not known, nor is any information about which tags are likely to appear in which contexts.
    This would correspond to the knowledge that could be extracted from an on-line dictionary or through morphological and distributional analysis.
    The unsupervised rule learning algorithm is based on the following simple idea.
    Given the sentence: The can will be crushed. with no information beyond the dictionary entry for the word can, the best we can do is randomly guess between the possible tags for can in this context.
    However, using an unannotated corpus and a dictionary, it could be discovered t
