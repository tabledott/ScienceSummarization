languages; but we feel that because our algorithms have minimal linguistic content they would work well on other pairs of languages.
    We also feel, again because of the minimal linguistic content of our algorithms, that it is reasonable to argue that word-by-word alignments are inherent in any sufficiently large bilingual corpus.
  
  
    The growing availability of bilingual, machine-readable texts has stimulated interest in methods for extracting linguistically valuable information from such texts.
    For example, a number of recent papers deal with the problem of automatically obtaining pairs of aligned sentences from parallel corpora (Warwick and Russell 1990; Brown, Lai, and Mercer 1991; Gale and Church 1991b; Kay 1991).
    Brown et al. (1990) assert, and Brown, Lai, and Mercer (1991) and Gale and Church (1991b) both show, that it is possible to obtain such aligned pairs of sentences without inspecting the words that the sentences contain.
    Brown, Lai, and Mercer base their algorithm on the numb
