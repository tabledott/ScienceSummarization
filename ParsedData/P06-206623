we have discussed above, places severe restrictions on permitted forms of non-projectivity in the remaining sentence, as every discontinuity that includes the main verb must also include the dependent punctuation marks.
    On the other hand, in PDT, a sentencefinal punctuation mark is annotated as a separate root node with no dependents.
    This scheme does not restrict the remaining discontinuities at all.
    In contrast to planarity, the well-nestedness constraint appears to constitute a very attractive extension of projectivity.
    For one thing, the almost perfect coverage of well-nestedness on DDT and PDT (99.89%) could by no means be expected on purely combinatorial grounds&#8212;only 7% of all possible dependency structures for sentences of length 17 (the average sentence length in PDT), and only slightly more than 5% of all possible dependency structures for sentences of length 18 (the average sentence length in DDT) are well-nested.5 Moreover, a cursory inspection of the few problematic cases in
