uestion classification, for example by (Li and Roth, 2002).
			In addition, we are working on refining and improving the feature set, and given more data, tuning can be improved on a sufficiently large development set.
			The three subcorpora in the annotation project can reveal how authorship affects emotion perception and classification.
			Moreover, arousal appears to be an important dimension for emotional prosody (Scherer, 2003), especially in storytelling (Alm and Sproat, 2005).Thus, we are planning on exploring degrees of emotional intensity in a learning scenario, i.e. a prob lem similar to measuring strength of opinion clauses (Wilson, Wiebe and Hwa, 2004).
			Finally, emotions are not discrete objects; rather they have transitional nature, and blend and overlap along the temporal dimension.
			For example, (Liu,Lieberman and Selker, 2003) include parallel estimations of emotional activity, and include smooth 585 ing techniques such as interpolation and decay to capture sequential and interactive emo
