act pre-specified data from open-ended text such as a newswire, it is clear that full semantic interpretation of such texts is not on the horizon.
    However, our hypothesis is that it need not be for automatic data base update.
    The type of information to be extracted permits some partial understanding.
    For semantic processing, minimally, for each noun phrase (NP), one would like to identify the class in the domain model that is the smallest pre-defined class containing the NP's denotation.
    Since we have assumed that the lexicon has a pointer to the most specific class in the domain model, the issue reduces to whether we can algorithmically predict the word, if any, in a noun phrase that denotes the NP's semantic class.
    For each clause, one would like to identify the corresponding event class or state of affairs denoted.
    Our pilot experiment focused on the reliability of identifying the minimal class for each noun phrase.
    Assigning a semantic class to a core noun phrase can be handled
