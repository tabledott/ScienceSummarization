a modular fashion.
    As we showed earlier, it is sometimes useful first to recognize a relation at one level, and to use this relation in recognizing the discourse relation at the other level.
    In addition, the multi-relation definition approach faces an even more severe challenge.
    In some discourses, the intentional structure is not merely a relabeling of the informational structure.
    A simple extension of our previous example illustrates the point: S: (a) Come home by 5:00.
    (b) Then we can go to the hardware store before it closes.
