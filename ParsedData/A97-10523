ue of the classifier as a filter of spurious analyses, as well as providing both translation between extracted patterns and two existing subcategorization dictionaries and a definition of the target subcategorization dictionary.
    The evaluator builds entries by taking the patterns for a given predicate built from successful parses and records the number of observations of each subcategorization class.
    Patterns provide several types of information which can be used to rank or select between patterns in the patternset for a given sentence exemplifying an instance of a predicate, such as the ranking of the parse from which it was extracted or the proportion of subanalyses supporting a specific pattern.
    Currently, we simply select the pattern supported by the highest ranked parse.
    However, we are experimenting with alternative approaches.
    The resulting set of putative classes for a predicate are filtered, following Brent (1993), 358 by hypothesis testing on binomial frequency data.
