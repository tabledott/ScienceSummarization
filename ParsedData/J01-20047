 context, and if some of the underspecified information is used in the conditional probability model, it will have to become specified.
    Of course, this can be done, but at the expense of search efficiency; the more that this is done, the less benefit there is from the underspecification.
    A top-down parser will, in contrast, derive an efficiency benefit from precisely the information that is underspecified in these other approaches.
    Thus, our top-down parser makes it very easy to condition the probabilistic grammar on an arbitrary number of values extracted from the rooted, fully specified derivation.
    This has lead us to a formulation of the conditional probability model in terms of values returned from tree-walking functions that themselves are contextually sensitive.
    The top-down guidance that is provided makes this approach quite efficient in practice.
