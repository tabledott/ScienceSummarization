    The second measures if the left and right-most dropped words are themselves both brackets.
    These features come in handy for examples like, The Associated Press ( AP ) reported the story, where the compressed version is The Associated Press reported the story.
    Information within brackets is often redundant.
    The previous set of features are meant to encode common POS contexts that are commonly retained or dropped from the original sentence during compression.

    However, dropping the main verb in the sentence is uncommon, since that verb and its arguments typically encode most of the information being conveyed.
