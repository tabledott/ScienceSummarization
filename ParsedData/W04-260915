ions inter-annotator agreement on both training and test corpora for each NP construction.
    For each construction, the corpus was splint into 80/20 training/testing ratio after agreement.
    We computed the K coefficient only for those instances tagged with one of the 35 semantic relations.
    For each pattern, we also computed the number of pairs that were tagged with OTHERS by both annotators, over the number of examples classified in this category by at least one of the judges, averaged by the number of patterns considered.
    The K coefficient shows a fair to good level of agreement for the training and testing data on the set of 35 relations, taking into consideration the task difficulty.
    This can be explained by the instructions the annotators received prior to annotation and by their expertise in lexical semantics.
    There were many heated discussions as well.
    Even noun phrase constructions are very productive allowing for a large number of possible interpretations, Table 4 shows that a
