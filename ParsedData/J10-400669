ed; they are mostly limited to the models for which we have full access to the results.
    Note that we are interested in whether DM performance is overall within state-of-the-art range, and not on making precise claims about the models it outperforms.
    In this respect, we think that our general results are clear even where they are not supported by statistical inference, or interpretation of the latter is problematic.
    The vectors of this space are labeled with words w1 (rows of matrix Amode-1 in Table 3), and their dimensions are labeled with binary tuples of type (l, w2) (columns of the same matrix).
    The dimensions represent the attributes of words in terms of lexico-syntactic relations with lexical collocates, such as (sbj intr, read), or (use, gun).
    Consistently, all the semantic tasks that we address with this space involve the measurement of the attributional similarity between words.
    The W1xLW2 matrix is a structured semantic space similar to those used by Curran and Moens (2002), G
