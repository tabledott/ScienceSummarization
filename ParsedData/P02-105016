Direct Projection Algorithm with the gold standard.
    As we have already seen previously, the quality of these trees is not very good.
    The second row of the table shows that after applying the single transformation based ort the head-initial assumption, precision and recall both improve significantly: using the F-measure to combine precision and recall into a single figure of merit (Van Rijsbergen, 1979), the increase from 38.1% to 59.4% represents a 55.9% relative improvement.
    The third row of the table shows that by applying the small set of tree modification rules after direct projection (one of which is default assignment of the head-initial analysis to multi-word phrases when no other rule applies), we obtain art evert larger improvement, the 67.3% F-measure representing a 76.6% relative gain over baseline performance.
  
  
    To what extent is the DCA a valid assumption?
    Our experiments confirm the linguistic intuition, indicating that one cannot safely assume a direct mapping between th
