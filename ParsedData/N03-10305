he parameters of the statistical models.
    Our Test section consists of a set of 946 triples of a similar form, which are used to evaluate the performance of our discourse parser.
    The (RST-DT, 2002) corpus uses 110 different rhetorical relations.
    We found it useful to also compact these relations into classes, as described by Carlson et al. (2003), and operate with the resulting 18 labels as well (seen as coarser granularity rhetorical relations).
    Operating with different levels of granularity allows one to get deeper insight into the difficulties of assigning the appropriate rhetorical relation, if any, to two adjacent text spans.
  
  
    We break down the problem of building sentence-level discourse trees into two sub-problems: discourse segmentation and discourse parsing.
    Discourse segmentation is covered by this section, while discourse parsing is covered by Section 4.
    Discourse segmentation is the process in which a given text is broken into non-overlapping segments called element
