nctuation.
    In this paper, we attempt to address these problems by exploring a variety of new features for scoring candidate translations.
    A high-quality statistical translation system is our baseline, and we add new features to the existing set, which are then combined in a log-linear model.
    To allow an easy integration of new features, the baseline system provides an n-best list of candidate translations which is then reranked using the new features.
    This framework allows us to incorporate different types of features, including features based on syntactic analyses of the source and target sentences, which we hope will address the grammaticality of the translations, as well as lower-level features.
    As we work on n-best lists, we can easily use global sentence-level features.
    We begin by describing our baseline system and the n-best rescoring framework within which we conducted our experiments.
    We then present a selection of new features, progressing from word-level features to thos
