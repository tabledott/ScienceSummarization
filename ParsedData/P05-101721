 number of errors and concluded that there were mainly three types of errors.
    One is the ambiguity of word senses.
    For example, one of the glosses of &#8220;costly&#8221;is &#8220;entailing great loss or sacrifice&#8221;.
    The word &#8220;great&#8221; here means &#8220;large&#8221;, although it usually means &#8220;outstanding&#8221; and is positively oriented.
    Another is lack of structural information.
    For example, &#8220;arrogance&#8221; means &#8220;overbearing pride evidenced by a superior manner toward the weak&#8221;.
    Although &#8220;arrogance&#8221; is mistakingly predicted as positive due to the word &#8220;superior&#8221;, what is superior here is &#8220;manner&#8221;.
    The last one is idiomatic expressions.
    For example, although &#8220;brag&#8221; means &#8220;show off&#8221;, neither of &#8220;show&#8221; and &#8220;off&#8221; has the negative orientation.
    Idiomatic expressions often does not inherit the semantic orientation from or to the words in the gloss.
