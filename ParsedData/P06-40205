tally improved to deal with a greater variety of text types, and handle quotation appropriately.
    Users are able to modify the rules used and recompile the modules.
    All RASP modules now accept XML mark up (with certain hard-coded assumptions) so that data can be pre-annotated&#8212;for example to identify named entities&#8212;before being passed to the tokeniser, allowing for more domain-dependent, potentially multiword tokenisation and classification prior to tence boundari The morphological analyser is also implemented in Flex, with about 1400 finite-state rules incorporating agreat deal of lexically exceptional data.
    These rules are compiled into an efficient C program encoding a deterministic finite state transducer.
    The analyser takes a word form and CLAWS tag and returns a lemma plus any inflectional affixes.
    The type and token error rate of the current system is less than 0.07% (Minnen, Carroll and Pearce, 2001).
    The primary systeminternal value of morphological analysis is to en
