    NLTK runs on all platforms supported by Python, including Windows, OS X, Linux, and Unix.
  
  
    The most basic step in setting up a practical component is choosing a suitable programming language.
    A number of considerations influenced our choice.
    First, the language must have a shallow learning curve, so that novice programmers get immediate rewards for their efforts.
    Second, the language must support rapid prototyping and a short develop/test cycle; an obligatory compilation step is a serious detraction.
    Third, the code should be self-documenting, with a transparent syntax and semantics.
    Fourth, it should be easy to write structured programs, ideally object-oriented but without the burden associated with languages like C++.
    Finally, the language must have an easy-to-use graphics library to support the development of graphical user interfaces.
