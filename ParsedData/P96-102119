 assume the explicit sentence-start and sentenceend tokens co = &lt;s&gt; and cT+1 = &lt;Is&gt;, which makes the algorithm description more parsimonious.
    Finally, the argmax operator is generalized to vector notation to accomodate multiple indices.
    = 0 if etyz &gt; Olslyz and 4yz &gt; 451)tyz where of the parse tree to qo =_- (-1,T&#8212; 1, &lt;s&gt;, &lt;/ s&gt;).
    The remaining descendants in the optimal parse tree are then given recursively for any q = (s,t,y, z) by: a probabilistic optimization problem.
    But perhaps most importantly, our goal is to constrain as tightly as possible the space of possible transduction relationships between two languages with fixed wordorder, making no other language-specific assumptions; we are thus driven to seek a kind of languageuniversal property.
    In contrast, the ID/LP work was directed at parsing a single language with free word-order.
    As a consequence, it would be necessary to enumerate a specific set of linear-precedence (LP) relations for the
