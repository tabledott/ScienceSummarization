 score.
    This removes the inherent bias for shorter hypotheses that is present in multiplicative cumulative scores.
    The basic algorithm works well as long the original translations are reasonably word synchronous.
    This rarely occurs, so several additional constraints are applied during hypothesis generation.
    First, the decoder discards unused words in original systems that &#8220;linger&#8221; around too long.
    Second, the decoder limits how far ahead it looks for an artificial alignment, to prevent incorrect long-range artificial alignments.
    Finally, the decoder does not allow an artificial match between words that do not share the same part-of-speech.
  
  
    We combined outputs of three Arabic-to-English machine translation systems on the 2003 TIDES Arabic test set.
    The systems were AppTek&#8217;s rule based system, CMU&#8217;s EBMT system, and Systran&#8217;s web-based translation system.
    We compare the results of MEMT to the individual online machine translation systems.
