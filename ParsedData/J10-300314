    Therefore, paraphrasing allows the translation system to properly handle phrases that it does not otherwise know how to translate.
    Another important issue for statistical machine translation systems is that of reference sparsity.
    The fundamental problem that translation systems have to face is that there is no such thing as the correct translation for any sentence.
    In fact, any given source sentence can often be translated into the target language in many valid ways.
    Because there can be many &#8220;correct answers,&#8221; almost all models employed by SMT systems require, in addition to a large bitext, a held-out development set comprising multiple high-quality, human-author
