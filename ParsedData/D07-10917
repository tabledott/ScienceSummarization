ranslate input factors into output factors, or generate additional output factors from existing output factors.
			Recall the example of a factored model motivated by morphological analysis and generation.
			In this model the translation process is broken up into the following three mapping steps: 1.
			Translate input lemmas into output lemmas.
			2.
			Translate morphological and POS factors.
			3.
			Generate surface forms given the lemma and.
			linguistic factorsFactored translation models build on the phrase based approach (Koehn et al, 2003) that breaks up the translation of a sentence into the translation of small text chunks (so-called phrases).
			This approach implicitly defines a segmentation of the input and output sentences into phrases.
			See an example in Figure 3.Our current implementation of factored translation models follows strictly the phrase-based ap proach, with the additional decomposition of phrasetranslation into a sequence of mapping steps.
