g a at 71; Pa(O I n) is the probability of adjoining 13 at 77; finally, Pa(NONE j 7) is the probability of nothing adjoining at n. Our variant adds another set of parameters: This is the probability of sister-adjoining -y between the ith and i + 1 th children of 77 (allowing for two imaginary children beyond the leftmost and rightmost children).
    Since multiple modifier trees can adjoin at the same location, P.,a(-y) is also conditioned on a flag f which indicates whether -y is the first modifier tree (i.e., the one closest to the head) to adjoin at that location.
    For our model we break down these probabilities further: first the elementary tree is generated without its anchor, and then its anchor is generated.
    See (Chiang, 2000) for more details.
    During training each example is broken into elementary trees using head rules and argument/adjunct rules similar to those of (Collins, 1997).
    The rules are interpreted as follows: a head is kept in the same elementary tree in its parent, an argume
