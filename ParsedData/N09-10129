    It factors Q(t, &#952;) = Q(t)Q( &#175;&#952;) = Qn i=1 Qi(ti)Q&#175;N&#8712;N&#175;Q( &#952; &#175;N).
    The goal is to recover &#952;), the estimate of the posterior distribution over parameters and Q(t), the estimate of the posterior distribution over trees.
    Finding a local maximum of F is done via an alternating maximization of Q(&#175;&#952;) and Q(t).
    Kurihara and Sato (2004) show that each &#952; &#175;N) is a Dirichlet distribution with parameters &#710;&#945;r = &#945;r + EQ(t)f(t, r).
    In the sections that follow, we frame various dependency models as a particular variety of CFGs known as split-head bilexical CFGs (Eisner and Satta, 1999).
    These allow us to use the fast Eisner and Satta (1999) parsing algorithm to compute the expectations required by VB in O(m3) time (Eisner and Blatz, 2007; Johnson, 2007) where m is the length of the sentence.1 In the split-head bilexical CFG framework, each nonterminal in the grammar is annotated with a terminal symbol.
