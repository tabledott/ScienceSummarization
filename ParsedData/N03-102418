e exploited by our algorithm.
    We noted before that apart from being a natural representation of paraphrases, the FSAs that we build have their own merit and deserve to be evaluated directly.
    Since our FSAs contain large numbers of paths, we design automatic evaluation metrics to assess their qualities.
    If we take our claims seriously, each path in our FSAs that connects the start and end nodes should correspond to a well-formed sentence.
    We are interested in both quantity (how many sentences our automata are able to produce) and quality (how good these sentences are).
    To answer the first question, we simply count the number of paths produced by our FSAs.
    Table 3 gives the statistics on the number of paths produced by our FSAs, reported by the average length of sentences in the input sentence groups.
    For example, the sentence groups that have between 10 and 20 words produce, on average, automata that can yield 4468 alternative, semantically equivalent formulations.
    Note that if
