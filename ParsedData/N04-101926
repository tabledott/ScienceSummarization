 believe the approach is built on weak assumptions.
    Also, their approach is not designed to rank individual summaries.
    These qualifications aside, we wanted to test whether it is possible to use their approach for assigning scores not for an entire test suite but on a per set basis.
    We computed the Spearman rank-coefficent rs for rankings assigned by computing unigram overlap and those by pyramid of order 9.
    For computing the scores, Lin&#8217;s original system was used, with stop words ignored.
    Again 5 summaries were chosen at random to be evaluated against models composed of the remaining five summaries.
    Composite models were obtained by concatenating different combinations of the initial five summaries.
    Thus scores can be computed using one, two and so on up to five reference summaries.
    Table 5 shows the average values of rs that were obtained.
    As noted above, in order to consider the two scoring methods as being substitutable, rs should be bigger than 0.85, given our sa
