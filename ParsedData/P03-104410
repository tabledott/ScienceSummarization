of syntactic dependency trees for each document.
    Syntactic Normalization: To reduce variation in the corpus further, we apply a tree-transforming program to the parse trees.
    For every (non-auxiliary) verb heading its own clause, the transformer produces a corresponding active tree, where possible.
    This converts for passive, relative, subordinate clauses, etc. into active clauses.
    Pattern Generalization: A &#8220;primary&#8221; tuple is extracted from each clause: the verb and its main arguments, subject and object.
    The tuple consists of three literals [s,v,o]; if the direct object is missing the tuple contains in its place the subject complement; if the object is a subordinate clause, the tuple contains in its place the head verb of that clause.
    Each primary tuple produces three generalized tuples, with one of the literals replaced by a wildcard.
    A pattern is simply a primary or generalized tuple.
    The pre-processed corpus is thus a many-many mapping between the patterns and the
