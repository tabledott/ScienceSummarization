 previous work; these include pure efficiency measures such as the number of turns or elapsed time to complete the task (Abella, Brown, and Buntschuh, 1996; Hirschman et al., 1990; Smith and Gordon, 1997; Walker, 1996), as well as measures of qualitative phenomena such as inappropriate or repair utterances (Danieli and Gerbino, 1995; Hirschman and Pao, 1993; Simpson and Fraser, 1993).
    PARADISE represents each cost measure as a function ci that can be applied to any (sub)dialogue.
    First, consider the simplest case of calculating efficiency measures over a whole dialogue.
    For example, let cl be the total number of utterances.
    For the whole dialogue D1 in Figure 2, c1(D1) is 23 utterances.
    For the whole dialogue D2 in Figure 3, ci (D2) is 10 utterances.
    To calculate costs over subdialogues and for some of the qualitative measures, it is necessary to be able to specify which information goals each utterance contributes to.
    PARADISE uses its AVM representation to link the information go
