constructs encoded include subcategorization of various complement types (NPs, Ss, etc.
    ), active, passive, &amp;quot;there&amp;quot; insertion, extraposition, raising, and equi-NP constructions, and unbounded dependencies (such as Wh-movement and relative clauses).
    Other theory-dependent devices that have been modeled with PATR-II include head-feature percolation (Gazdar and Pullum, 821, and LFG-like semantic forms [Kaplan and Bresnan, 83).
    Note that none of these constructs and techniques required expansion of the underlying formalism; indeed, the constructions all make use of the techniques described in this section.
    See Shieber et al. [831 for a detailed discussion of the modeling of some of these phenomena.
    The devices now available for molding PAM-II to conform to a particular intended usage or linguistic theory are in their nascent stage.
    However, because of their great importance in making the PATH-Il system a usable one, we will discuss them briefly.
    It is important to kee
