gs, ii) a Lexical Sample task for coarse-grainedword sense disambiguation on a selected set of lex emes, and iii) Semantic Role Labeling, using two different types of arguments, on the same subset of lexemes.
	
	
			2.1 English fine-grained All-Words.
			In this task we measure the ability of systems to identify the correct fine-grained WordNet 2.1 wordsense for all the verbs and head words of their argu ments.
			2.1.1 Data Preparation We began by selecting three articles wsj 0105.mrg (on homelessness), wsj 0186.mrg (about a book on corruption), and wsj 0239.mrg (about hot-air ballooning) from a section of the WSJ corpus that has been Treebanked and PropBanked.
			All instances of verbs were identified using theTreebank part-of-speech tags, and also the head words of their noun arguments (using the PropBank and standard headword rules).
			The locations of the sentences containing them as well as the locations of the verbs and the nouns within these sentences were recorded for subsequent sense-annotation.
