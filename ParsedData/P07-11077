    Our first, overly simplistic, corpus model is the standard finite mixture of multinomials shown in figure 1(a).
    In this model, each document is independent save for some global hyperparameters.
    Inside each document, there is a finite mixture model with a fixed number K of components.
    The distribution Q over components (entities) is a draw from a symmetric Dirichlet distribution with concentration &#945;.
    For each mention in the document, we choose a component (an entity index) z
