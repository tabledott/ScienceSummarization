    The formalism's uniform integration of various types of bracketing and alignment constraints is one of its chief strengths.
    The paper is divided into two main parts.
    We begin in the first part below by laying out the basic formalism, then show that reduction to a normal form is possible.
    We then raise several desiderata for the expressiveness of any bilingual languagemodeling formalism in terms of its constituent-matching flexibility and discuss how the characteristics of the inversion transduction formalism are particularly suited to address these criteria.
    Afterwards we introduce a stochastic version and give an algorithm for finding the optimal bilingual parse of a sentence-pair.
    The formalism is independent of the languages; we give examples and applications using Chinese and English because languages from different families provide a more rigorous testing ground.
    In the second part, we survey a number of sample applications and extensions of bilingual parsing for segmen
