be useful for the WordNet senses to have access to the detailed syntactic information that the Levin classes contain, and it would be equally useful to have more guidance as to when membership in a Levin class does in fact indicate shared semantic components.
    Of course, some Levin classes, such as braid (bob, braid, brush, clip, coldcream, comb, condition, crimp, crop, curl, etc.) are clearly not intended to be synonymous, which at least partly explains the lack of overlap between Levin and WordNet.
    The association of sets of syntactic frames with individual verbs in each class is not as straightforward as one might suppose.
    For instance, carry verbs are described as not taking the conative, *The mother carried at the baby, and yet many of the verbs in the carry class (push, pull, tug, shove, kick) are also listed in the push/pull class, which does take the conative.
    This listing of a verb in more than one class (many verbs are in three or even four classes) is left open to interpretation in L
