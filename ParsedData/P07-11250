  Weakly Supervised Learning for Hedge Classification in Scientific Literature
  
    We investigate automatic classification of speculative language (&#8216;hedging&#8217;), in biomedical text using weakly supervised machine learning.
    Our contributions include a precise description of the task with annotation guidelines, analysis and discussion, a probabilistic weakly supervised learning model, and experimental evaluation of the methods presented.
    We show that hedge classification is feasible using weakly supervised ML, and point toward avenues for future research.
  
  
    The automatic processing of scientific papers using NLP and machine learning (ML) techniques is an increasingly important aspect of technical informatics.
    In the quest for a deeper machine-driven &#8216;understanding&#8217; of the mass of scientific literature, a frequently occuring linguistic phenomenon that must be accounted for is the use of hedging to denote propositions of a speculative nature.
    Consider the followin
