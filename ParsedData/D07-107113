 ?f.?x.f(x) S/NP : ?x.x, S/N : ?f.?x.f(x) Figure 2: Rules used in GENLEX.
			Each row represents a rule.
			The first column lists the triggers that identify some sub-structure within a logical form.
			The second column lists the category that is created.
			The third column lists categories that are created when the rule is applied to the logical form at the top of this column.
			We use the 10 rules described in ZC05 and add two new rules, listed in the last two rows above.
			This first new rule is instantiated for greater than (&gt;) and less than (&lt;) comparisions.
			The second new rule has no trigger; it is always applied.
			It generates categories that are used to learn lexical entries for semantically vacuous sentence prefixes such as the phrase show me information on in the example in figure 1(b).
			put from GENLEX(x, z) is a large set of potentiallexical entries, with the vast majority of those en tries being spurious.
			The algorithm in ZC05 embeds GENLEX within an overall learning approach
