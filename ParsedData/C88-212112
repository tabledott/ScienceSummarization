  :(G), is defined to be the set of all terminal strings of the trees in T(G).
  Grammar ules defined by the linguistic theory are not the same as the rules used by the parser--let us refer to them as parser  rules.
  A parser rule is defined to be a structure encoding a rule of the grammar (or a set of rules) instantiated bythe parser when it comes to alex- 580 / Figure 3: Mechanism of substitution ical item (considered to yield the rule(s)).
  It is thus a unique object.
  It is individualized by the lexical item, which is itself individualized by its position in the input string.
  The lexical item is directly inserted into the struc- ture corresponding to the parser ule, and such a rule can only occur once.
  Lexleal i tems are differentiated by their realization in the input sentence and also their position in the sentence.
  Therefore a given rule corresponds to ex- actly one lexical item in the input sentence.
  The structures are produced by lexical i
