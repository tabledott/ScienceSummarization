    For example, Lexicon entry and guesser's categorization for [developed (1.1 VBD VBN)].
    The score of the resulting rule will be higher than the scores of the individual rules since the number of positive observations increases and the number of the trials remains the same.
    After a successful application of the ED operator, the resulting general rule is substituted for the two merged ones.
    To perform such rule merging over a rule set the rules that have not been included into the working rule set are first sorted by their score and the rules with the best scores are merged first.
    After each successful merging, the resultin
