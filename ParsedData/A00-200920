mber classifiers with similar sized windows of context often result in little or no overall improvement in disambiguation accuracy.
    This was expected since slight differences in window sizes lead to roughly equivalent representations of context and classifiers that have little opportunity for collective improvement.
    For example, an ensemble was created for interest using the nine classifiers in the range category (medium, medium).
    The accuracy of this ensemble was 84%, slightly less than the most accurate individual classifiers in that range which achieved accuracy of 86%.
    Early experiments also revealed that an ensemble based on a majority vote of all 81 classifiers performed rather poorly.
    The accuracy for interest was approximately 81% and line was disambiguated with slightly less than 80% accuracy.
    The lesson taken from these results was that an ensemble should consist of classifiers that represent as differently sized windows of context as possible; this reduces the impact of redu
