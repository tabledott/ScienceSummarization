 for the prepositional phrase &amp;quot;with a list.&amp;quot; In this example, the immediate parent of the Ni node is the NBAR4 node and the functional parent of Ni is the PP1 node.
  
  
    We compared the performance of HBG to the &amp;quot;broad-coverage&amp;quot; probabilistic context-free grammar, P-CFG.
    The any-consistent rate of the grammar is 90% on test sentences of 7 to 17 words.
    The Viterbi rate of P-CFG is 60% on the same test corpus of 760 sentences used in our experiments.
    On the same test sentences, the HBG model has a Viterbi rate of 75%.
    This is a reduction of 37% in error rate.
    In developing HBG, we experimented with similar models of varying complexity.
    One discovery made during this experimentation is that models which incorporated more context than HBG performed slightly worse than HBG.
    This suggests that the current training corpus may not contain enough sentences to estimate richer models.
    Based on the results of these experiments, it appears likely tha
