y aligning a small number of sentences.
    This information could be used to filter a training corpus to remove sentences which would cause problems in training the translation model, or for identifying areas to focus on when working to improve the model itself.
    We are interested in examining different language pairs as the opportunity arises.
    We have also examined the differences in cohesion between Treebank-style parse trees, trees with flattened verb phrases, and dependency structures.
    Our results indicate that the highest degree of cohesion is present in dependency structures.
    Therefore, in an SMT system which is using some type of phrasal movement during reordering, dependency structures should produce better results than raw parse trees.
    In the future, we plan to explore this hypothesis in an actual translation system.
