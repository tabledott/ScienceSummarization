develop a method for gathering parallel corpora from the web.
    Oard et al. (2003) describe various methods employed for quickly gathering resources to create a machine translation system for a language with no initial resources.
  
  
    In this paper we have shown that significant gains in coverage and translation quality can be had by integrating paraphrases into statistical machine translation.
    In effect, paraphrases introduce some amount ofgeneralization into statistical machine translation.
    Whereas before we relied on having observed a particular word or phrase in the training set in order to produce a translation of it, we are no longer tied to having seen every word in advance.
    We can exploit knowledge that is external to the translation model about what words have similar meanings and use that in the process of translation.
    This method is particularly pertinent to small data conditions, which are plagued by sparse data problems.
    In future work, we plan to determine how much dat
