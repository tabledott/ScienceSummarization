 splitting long sentences at appropriate points.
    A subsequent lexical simplification stage (Devlin and Tait, 1998) replaces difficult or rare content words with simpler synonyms.
    The analysis component contains a morphological analyser, and it is the base forms of is likely that a modest increase in speed could he obtained by specifying optimisation levels in Flex and gcc that are higher than the defaults. words that are passed through the system; this eases the task of the lexical simplification module.
    The final processing stage in the system is therefore morphological generation, using the generator described in the previous section.
    We are currently testing the components of the simplification system on a corpus of 1000 news stories downloaded from the :Sund,erland Echo (a local newspaper in North-East England).
    In our testing we have found that newly encountered vocabulary only rarely necessitates any modification to the generator (or rather the analyser) source; if the word has regul
