of this effort is remarkable, this paper will focus on a solution to the problem which requires considerably less effort to implement.
    The scope of work in lexical ambiguity resolution is very large.
    Thus in the interest of space, discussion will focus on the direct historic precursors and sources of inspiration for the approach presented here.
    The central tradition from which it emerges is that of the Bayesian classifier (Mosteller and Wallace, 1964).
    This was expanded upon by (Gale et al., 1992), and in a class-based variant by (Yarowsky, 1992).
    Decision trees (Brown, 1991) have been usefully applied to word-sense ambiguities, and HMM part-of-speech taggers (Jelinek 1985, Church 1988, Merialdo 1990) have addressed the syntactic ambiguities presented here.
    Hearst (1991) presented an effective approach to modeling local contextual evidence, while Resnik (1993) gave a classic treatment of the use of word classes in selectional constraints.
