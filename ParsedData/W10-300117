oaded from the publicly available PubMedCentral database, including 5 random articles taken from the BMC Bioinformatics journal in October 2009, 5 random articles to which the drosophila MeSH term was assigned and 5 random articles having the MeSH terms human, blood cells and transcription factor (the same terms which were used to create the Genia corpus).
    These latter ten articles were also published in 2009.
    The aim of this article selection procedure was to have a theme that was close to the training corpus.
    The evaluation set contained 5003 sentences, out of which 790 were uncertain.
    These texts were manually annotated for hedge cues and their scope.
    To annotate the training and the evaluation datasets, the same annotation principles were applied.
    For both Task1 and Task2, the same dataset was provided, the difference being that for Task1, only hedge cues and sentence-level uncertainty were given, however, for Task2, hedge cues and their scope were marked in the text.
