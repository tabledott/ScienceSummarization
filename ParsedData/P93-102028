004).
    Our algorithm thus performs with recall higher than human performance.
    However, precision is low,
  
  
    In order to evaluate the performance measures for the algorithms, it is important to understand how individual humans perform on all 4 measures.
    Row 4 of Table 3 reports the average individual performance for the 70 subjects on the 10 narratives.
    The average recall for humans is .74 (o-=.038),7 and the average precision is .55 (o-=.027), much lower than the ideal scores of 1.
    The fallout and error rates of .09 (o-=.004) and .11 (o-=.003) more closely approximate the ideal scores of 0.
    The low recall and precision reflect the considerable variation in the number of boundaries subjects assign, as well as the imperfect percent agreement (Table 1).
    To compare algorithms, we must take into account the dimensions along which they differ apart from the different cues.
    For example, the referring expression algorithm (RA) differs markedly from the pause and cue algorithms (P
