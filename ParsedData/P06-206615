mponent not dominated by 2 (marked by the squares).
    In contrast, Graph 4b has gap degree 1 but edge degree 2: the subtree rooted at node 2 has one gap, but this gap contains two components not dominated by 2.
    Nivre (2006) shows experimentally that limiting the permissible edge degree to 1 or 2 can reduce the average parsing time for a deterministic algorithm from quadratic to linear, while omitting less than 1% of the structures found in DDT and PDT.
    It can be expected that constraints on the gap degree would have very similar effects.
    Binary constraints For the two binary constraints, we find that well-nestedness subsumes planarity: a graph that contains interleaving subtrees cannot be drawn without crossing edges, so every planar graph must also be well-nested.
    To see that the converse does not hold, consider Graph 3b, which is well-nested, but not planar.
    Since both planarity and well-nestedness are proper extensions of projectivity, we get the following hierarchy for sets of depend
