oring punctuation, i.e. all tokens tagged as commas, colons or quotes) and have the same labell&#176; as a constituent in the treebank the model.
    The results are for all sentences of &lt; 100 words in section 23 using model (3).
    For 'no lexical information' all estimates are based on POS tags alone.
    For 'no distance measure' the distance measure is Question 1 alone (i.e. whether tb-3 precedes Or follows ti)h,)&#8226; parse.
    Four configurations of the parser were tested: (1) The basic model; (2) The basic model with the punctuation rule described in section 2.7; (3) Model (2) with tags ignored when lexical information is present, as described in 2.7; and (4) Model (3) also using the full probability distributions for POS tags.
    We should emphasise that test data outside of section 23 was used for all development of the model, avoiding the danger of implicit training on section 23.
    Table 3 shows the results of the tests.
