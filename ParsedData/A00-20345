specific slot in a specific SCF of a verb.
    We use the SCF acquisition system of Briscoe and Carroll (1997), with a probabilistic LR parser (Inui et al., 1997) for syntactic processing.
    The corpus data is POS tagged and lemmatised before the LR parser is applied.
    Subcategorization patterns are extracted from the parses, these include both the syntactic categories and the argument heads of the constituents.
    These subcategorization patterns are then classified according to a set of 161 SCF classes.
    The SCF entries for each verb are then subjected to a statistical filter which removes scFs that have occurred with a frequency less than would be expected by chance.
    The resulting SCF lexicon lists each verb with the scFs it takes.
    Each SCF entry includes a frequency count and lists the argument heads at all slots.
    Selectional preferences are automatically acquired for the slots involved in the role switching.
    We refer to these as the target slots.
