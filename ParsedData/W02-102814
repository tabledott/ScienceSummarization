), and of these meta-bootstrapping achieved the best results.
    So we implemented the meta-bootstrapping algorithm ourselves to directly compare its performance with that of Basilisk.
    A difference between the original implementation and ours is that our version learns individual nouns (as does Basilisk) instead of noun phrases.
    We believe that learning individual nouns is a more conservative approach because noun phrases often overlap (e.g., &#8220;high-power bombs&#8221; and &#8220;incendiary bombs&#8221; would count as two different lexicon entries in the original meta-bootstrapping algorithm).
    Consequently, our meta-bootstrapping results differ from those reported in (Riloff and Jones, 1999).
    Figure 3 shows the results for Basilisk (ba-1) and meta-bootstrapping (mb-1).
    We ran both algorithms for 200 iterations, so that 1000 words were added to the lexicon (5 words per iteration).
    The X axis shows the number of words learned, and the Y axis shows how many were correct.
