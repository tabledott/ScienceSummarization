 this to our results for a completely Brown trained system (i.e. one in which the first-phase parser is trained on just Brown training data, and the second-phase reranker is trained on Brown 50-best lists).
    This system performs at a 88.4% level &#8212; only slightly higher than that achieved by our system with only WSJ data.
  
  
    Work in parser adaptation is premised on the assumption that one wants a single parser that can handle a wide variety of domains.
    While this is the goal of the majority of parsing researchers, it is not quite universal.
    Sekine (1997) observes that for parsing a specific domain, data from that domain is most beneficial, followed by data from the same class, data from a different class, and data from a different domain.
    He also notes that different domains have very different structures by looking at frequent grammar productions.
    For these reasons he takes the position that we should, instead, simply create treebanks for a large number of domains.
