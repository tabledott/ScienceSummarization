manually collected paraphrases tailored to a specific application, or utilize existing lexical resources such as WordNet (Miller et al., 1990) to identify paraphrases.
    However, the process of manually collecting paraphrases is time consuming, and moreover, the collection is not reusable in other applications.
    Existing resources only include lexical paraphrases; they do not include phrasal or syntactically based paraphrases.
    From a linguistic point of view, questions concern the operative definition of paraphrases: what types of lexical relations and syntactic mechanisms can produce paraphrases?
    Many linguists (Halliday, 1985; de Beaugrande and Dressler, 1981) agree that paraphrases retain &#8220;approximate conceptual equivalence&#8221;, and are not limited only to synonymy relations.
    But the extent of interchangeability between phrases which form paraphrases is an open question (Dras, 1999).
    A corpus-based approach can provide insights on this question by revealing paraphrases that pe
