e first coreferent NP, we hypothesized that a right-to-left search for a highly likely antecedent might offer more precise, if not generally better coreference chains.
    As a result, we modify the coreference clustering algorithm to select as the antecedent of NP&#9988; the NP with the highest coreference likelihood value from among preceding NPs with coreference class values above 0.5.
    Training set creation.
    For the proposed best-first clustering to be successful, however, a different method for training instance selection would be needed: rather than generate a positive training example for each anaphoric NP and its closest antecedent, we instead generate a positive training examples for its most confident antecedent.
    More specifically, for a non-pronominal NP, we assume that the most confident antecedent is the closest nonpronominal preceding antecedent.
    For pronouns, we assume that the most confident antecedent is simply its closest preceding antecedent.
