    This training loop necessitates approximation because summing over all possible segmentations and alignments for each sentence is intractable, requiring time exponential in the length of the sentences.
    Additionally, the set of possible phrase pairs grows too large to fit in memory.
    Using word alignments, we can address both problems.4 In particular, we can determine for any aligned segmentation ( 1I1, eI1, a) whether it is compatible with the word-level alignment for the sentence pair.
    We define a phrase pair to be compatible with a word-alignment if no word in either phrase is aligned with a word outside the other phrase (Zens et al., 2002).
    Then, ( 1I1, eI1, a) is compatible with the word-alignment if each of its aligned phrases is a compatible phrase pair.
    The training process is then constrained such that, when evaluating the above sum, only compatible aligned segmentations are considered.
    That is, we allow P(e, &#65533;fI1 , eI1, aIf) &gt; 0 only for aligned segmentations
