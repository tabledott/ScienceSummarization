te large (up to 100 nodes) they contain many fragments.
    Finally, to study the combined kernels, we applied the K1 + &#947;K2 formula, where K1 is either the Linear or the Poly kernel and K2 is the ST or the SST kernel.
    Table 4 shows the results of four kernel combinations.
    We note that, (a) STs and SSTs improve Poly (about 0.5 and 2 percent points on PropBank and FrameNet, respectively) and (b) the linear kernel, which uses fewer features than Poly, is more enhanced by the SSTs than STs (for example on PropBank we have 89.4% and 88.6% vs. 87.6%), i.e.
    Linear takes advantage by the richer feature set of the SSTs.
    It should be noted that our results of kernel combinations on FrameNet are in contrast with (Moschitti, 2004), where no improvement was obtained.
    Our explanation is that, thanks to the fast evaluation of FTK, we could carry out an adequate parameterization.
  
  
    Recently, several tree kernels have been designed.
    In the following, we highlight their differences and prop
