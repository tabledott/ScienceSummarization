ilities for all of the words in To is 1/00!.
    We expect q50 to depend on the length of the French string because longer strings should have more extraneous words.
    Therefore, we assume that for some pair of auxiliary parameters po and pi.
    The expression on the left-hand side of this equation depends on 01 only through the sum 01 + &#8226; &#8226; &#8226; + 0/ and defines a probability distribution over o whenever po and pi are nonnegative and sum to 1.
    We can interpret Pr(00101, e) as follows.
    We imagine that each of the words from TI requires an extraneous word with probability pi and that this extraneous word must be connected to the empty cept.
    The probability that exactly cbo of the words from TI will require an extraneous word is just the expression given in Equation (31).
    As with Models 1 and 2, an alignment of (fle) is determined by specifying al for each position in the French string.
    The fertilities, 00 through 0/, are functions of the ais: 0, is equal to the number of j
