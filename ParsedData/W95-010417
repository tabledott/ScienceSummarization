n only expect the test to catch 95% of them (given that the significance level was set to 0.05).
    As mentioned above, most of the legitimate context words show up for small k; thus as k gets large, the limited number of legitimate context words gets overwhelmed by the 5% of the spurious correlations that make it through our filter.
    The method of context words is good at capturing generalities that depend on the presence of nearby words, but not their order.
    When order matters, other more syntax-based methods, such as collocations and trigrams, are appropriate.
    In the work reported here, the method of collocations was used to capture order dependencies.
    A collocation expresses a pattern of syntactic elements around the target word.
    We allow two types of syntactic elements: words, and part-of-speech tags.
    Going back to the {desert, dessert} example, a collocation that would imply desert might be: PREP the This collocation would match the sentences: Travelers entering from the desert w
