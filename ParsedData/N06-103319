n-binarizable rules and did not observe any difference in BLEU scores.
    So we safely move a step further, focusing on the binarizable rules only.
    The decoder now works on the binary translation rules supplied by an external synchronous binarizer.
    As shown in Section 1, this results in a simplified decoder with a polynomial time complexity, allowing less aggressive and more effective pruning based on both translation model and language model scores.
    We compare the two binarization schemes in terms of translation quality with various pruning thresholds.
    The rule set is that of the previous section.
    The test set has 116 Chinese sentences of no longer than 15 words.
    Both systems use trigram as the integrated language model.
    Figure 7 demonstrates that decoding accuracy is significantly improved after synchronous binarization.
    The number of edges proposed during decoding is used as a measure of the size of search space, or time efficiency.
    Our system is consistently faster and
