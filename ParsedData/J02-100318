rty has been found that cuts down the set of distractors to a manageable size.
    To be on the safe side when we prove completeness, we will assume that the set of properties is at most denumerably infinite, while the set of distractors is finite.
    These assumptions are harmless in connection with present NLG systems, all of which work with relatively small sets.
    It is unclear how human speakers cope with large sets of properties and/or distractors, but this question goes beyond our present concerns.
    Based on these considerations, we prove intersective completeness under some assumptions concerning infinity and overlapping Values.
    We deal first with D&amp;R, then with the more complex D&amp;RAtt.
    Theorem 1: Completeness of D&amp;R Suppose there are at most denumerably many properties, and finitely many (one or more) distractors.
    Then if an object can be individuated by intersecting a finite number of properties, D&amp;R will find such an intersection.
