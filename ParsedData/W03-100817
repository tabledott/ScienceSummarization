ly important for core arguments, shown by the fact that removing trace information from the Treebank parses results in a bigger drop for core arguments (83.5 to 76.3 F-score) than for all roles (74.1 to 70.2).
    The ability of the CCG parser to recover these long-range dependencies accounts for its higher performance, and in particular its higher recall, on core arguments.
    The CCG gold standard performance is below that of the Penn Treebank gold standard with traces.
    We believe this performance gap to be caused by the mismatches between the CCG analyses and the PropBank annotations described in Section 5.2.
    For the reasons described, the head words of the constituents that have PropBank roles are not necessarily the head words that stand in a predicate-argument relation in CCGbank.
    If two words do not stand in a predicate-argument relation, the CCG system takes recourse to the path feature.
    This feature is much sparser in CCG: since CCG categories encode subcategorization information, th
