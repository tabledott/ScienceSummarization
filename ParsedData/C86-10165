  Here attribute is an atom, path is a list, and value is e i ther  an atomic symbol, a l ist of specifications, or an abbreviat ion tbr such a list.
  The last case is d ist inguished from the first by pref ixing the value symbol with (,~) when it has an abbreviatory role.
  Ignoring the (?L&gt;cases, this gives four dif ferent k inds of specifications: (attribute vahte), (path value), (attribute path), and (path path).
  The same feature set can often be specified in several  different ways; in choosing one, we general ly try to minimize the number  of parentheses.
  Below is a simple example of a phrase structure rule augmented  with specifications.
