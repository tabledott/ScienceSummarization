us ones; and (5) pruning need not force the words to be unambiguous.
    Instead, we can apply the rules iteratively, and usually some of the rules apply when the ambiguity is reduced.
    Pruning is then applied again, and so on.
    Furthermore, the pruning mechanism does not contain any language specific statistics, but works on a topological basis only.
    Some of the most heuristic rules may be applied only after pruning.
    This has two advantages: very heuristic links would confuse the pruning mechanism, and words that would not otherwise have a head, may still get one.
  
  
    In this section, we present a set of rules, and show how those rules can parse the sentence &amp;quot;Joan said whatever John likes to decide suits her&amp;quot;.
    The toy grammar containing 8 rules is presented in Figure 3.
    The rules are extracted from the real grammar, and they are then simplified; some tests are omitted and some tests are made simpler.
    The grammar is applied to the input sentence in Figure 4, w
