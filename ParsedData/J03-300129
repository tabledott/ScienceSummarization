&#180;ia, Julio Gonzalo, and Felisa Verdejo describe how to build sense-tagged corpora from the Web by associating word meanings with Web page directory nodes.
    The Open Directory Project (at (dmoz.org)) is a collaborative, volunteer project for classifying Web pages into a taxonomic hierarchy.
    Santamar&#180;ia et al. present an algorithm for attaching WordNet word senses to nodes in this same taxonomy, thus providing automatically created links between word senses and Web pages.
    They also show how this method can be used for automatic acquisition of sense-tagged corpora, from which one could, among other things, produce language models tied to certain senses of words, or for a certain domain.
    Unseen words, or word sequences&#8212;that is, words or sequences not occurring in training data&#8212;are a problem for language models.
    If the corpus from which a particular model is extracted is too small, there are many such sequences.
