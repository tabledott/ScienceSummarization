 closely related work is a recent extension to Bannard and Callison-Burch&#8217;s paraphrasing method.
    Zhao et al. (2008b) extended the method so that it is capable of generating richer paraphrase patterns that include part-of-speech slots, rather than simple lexical and phrasal paraphrases.
    For example, they extracted patterns such as consider NN &#8594; take NN into consideration.
    To accomplish this, Zhao el al. used dependency parses on the English side of the parallel corpus.
    Their work differs from the work presented in this paper because their syntactic constraints applied to slots within paraphrase patters, and our constraints apply to the paraphrases themselves.
  
  
    Bannard and Callison-Burch (2005) extract paraphrases from bilingual parallel corpora.
    They give a probabilistic formation of paraphrasing which naturally falls out of the fact that they use techniques from phrase-based statistical machine translation: Phrase translation probabilities p(f|e1) and p(e2|f) are commo
