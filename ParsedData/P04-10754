rategies which effectively incorporate informativeness, representativeness and diversity criteria.
    To our knowledge, it is the first work on considering the three criteria all together for active learning.
    Furthermore, such measures and strategies can be easily adapted to other active learning tasks as well.
  
  
    Support Vector Machines (SVM) is a powerful machine learning method, which has been applied successfully in NER tasks, such as (Kazama et al. 2002; Lee et al.
    2003).
    In this paper, we apply active learning methods to a simple and effective SVM model to recognize one class of names at a time, such as protein names, person names, etc.
    In NER, SVM is to classify a word into positive class &#8220;1&#8221; indicating that the word is a part of an entity, or negative class &#8220;-1&#8221; indicating that the word is not a part of an entity.
    Each word in SVM is represented as a high-dimensional feature vector including surface word information, orthographic features, POS featur
