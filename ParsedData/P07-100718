rs in the WSJ data, we have removed too many BC training examples, from an average of 310 examples per noun as shown in Table 1, to an average of 195 examples.
    Research by McCarthy et al. (2004) and Koeling et al.
    (2005) pointed out that a change of predominant sense is often indicative of a change in domain.
    For example, the predominant sense of the noun interest in the BC part of the DSO corpus has the meaning &#8220;a sense of concern with and curiosity about someone or something&#8221;.
    In the WSJ part of the DSO corpus, the noun interest has a different predominant sense with the meaning &#8220;a fixed charge for borrowing money&#8221;, which is reflective of the business and finance focus of the WSJ corpus.
    Instead of restricting the BC training data to adhere strictly to the sense priors in WSJ, another alternative is just to ensure that the predominant sense in BC is the same as that of WSJ.
    Out of the 21 nouns, 12 nouns have the same predominant sense in both BC and WSJ.
