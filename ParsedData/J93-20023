e general framework for the problems addressed in this paper can be thought of as follows.
    Imagine a language that is completely unfamiliar; the only means of studying it are an ordinary grammar book and a very large corpus of text (or transcribed speech).
    No dictionary is available.
    How can easily recognized, surface grammatical facts be used to extract from a corpus as much syntactic information as possible about individual words?
    The scenario outlined above is adopted in this paper as a framework for basic research in computational language acquisition.
    However, it is also an abstraction of the situation faced by engineers building natural language processing (NLP) systems for more familiar languages.
    The lexicon is a central component of NLP systems and it is widely agreed that current lexical resources are inadequate.
    Language engineers have access to some but not all of the grammar, and some but not all of the lexicon.
    The most easily formalized and most reliable grammati
