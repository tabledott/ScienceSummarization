    Anaphora resolution helps in cases in which the agent is syntactically ambiguous between own and other approaches (e.g., this system).
    To test whether and how much performance would improve, we manually simulated anaphora resolution on the 632 occurrences of REF AGENT in the development corpus.
    (In the experiments in section 5 these occurrences had been excluded from the Agent feature by giving them the value None; we include them now in their disambiguated state).
    Of the 632 REF AGENTs, 436 (69%) were classified as US AGENT, 175 (28%) as THEM AGENT, and 20 (3%) as GENERAL AGENT.
    As a result of this manual disambiguation, the performance of the Agent feature increased dramatically from K = .08 to K = .14 and that of SegAgent from K = .19 to K = .22.
    This is a clear indication of the potential added value of anaphora resolution for our task.
    As far as the statistical classification is concerned, our results are still far from perfect.
