present its segmentation and POS.
    For example, the tag &#8220;b NN&#8221; indicates a character at the beginning of a noun.
    Using this method, POS features are allowed to interact with segmentation.
    Since tagging is restricted to characters, the search space is reduced to O((4T)'), and beam search decoding is effective with a small beam size.
    However, the disadvantage of this model is the difficulty in incorporating whole word information into POS tagging.
    For example, the standard &#8220;word + POS tag&#8221; feature is not explicitly applicable.
    Shi and Wang (2007) introduced POS information to segmentation by reranking.
    N-best segmentation outputs are passed to a separately-trained POS tagger, and the best output is selected using the overall POSsegmentation probability score.
    In this system, the decoding for word segmentation and POS tagging are still performed separately, and exact inference for both is possible.
    However, the interaction between POS and segmentation is
