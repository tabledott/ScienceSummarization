ense NPB is a bar 1 structure and NP is a bar 2 structure).
    As long as there is a one-to-one mapping between the treebank and the new representation, nothing is lost in making such a transformation.
    Goodman (1997) and Johnson (1997) both suggest this strategy.
    Goodman (1997) converts the treebank into binary-branching trees.
    Johnson (1997) considers conversion to a number of different representations and discusses how this influences accuracy for nonlexicalized PCFGs.
    The models developed in this article have tacitly assumed the Penn Treebank style of annotation and will perform badly given other representations (for example, binary-branching trees).
    This section makes this point more explicit, describing exactly what annotation style is suitable for the models and showing how other annotation styles will cause problems.
    This dependence on Penn Treebank&#8211;style annotations does not imply that the models are inappropriate for a treebank annotated in a different style: In this ca
