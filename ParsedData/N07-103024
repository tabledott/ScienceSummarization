 combinations over three different learners (C4.5, Ripper, and Maxent), three sampling methods, two feature sets (Soon et al., 2001; Ng and Cardie, 2002b), and three clustering algorithms (Best-First, Closest-First, and aggressivemerge).
    The features used by the reranker are of two types: (i) partition-based features which are here simple functions of the local features, and (ii) method-based features which simply identify the coreference system used for generating the given partition.
    Although this approach leads to significant gains on the both the MUC and the ACE datasets, it has some weaknesses.
    Most importantly, the different systems employed for generating the different partitions are all instances of the local classification approach, and they all use very similar features.
    This renders them likely to make the same types of errors.
    The ILP approach could in fact be integrated with these other approaches, potentially realizing the advantages of multiple global systems, with ILP condu
