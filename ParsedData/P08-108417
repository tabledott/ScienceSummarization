ilar models have been successfully applied to the task of word boundary detection (Goldwater et al., 2006).
    Abstract Morpheme Distribution To model the connections between morphemes across languages, we further define a model for bilingual morpheme pairs, or abstract morphemes.
    This model assigns probabilities to all pairs of morphemes is, all pairs of finite strings from the respective alphabets (e, f).
    Intuitively, we wish to assign high probability to pairs of morphemes that play similar syntactic or semantic roles (e.g.
    (fy, b-) for in Arabic and Hebrew).
    These morpheme pairs can thus be viewed as representing abstract morphemes.
    As with the stray morpheme models, we wish to define a distribution which concentrates probability mass on a small number of highly co-occurring morpheme pairs while still holding out some probability for all other pairs.
    We define this abstract morpheme model A as a draw from an that compose the parallel phrase, giving the number of stray morphemes in
