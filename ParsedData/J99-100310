high, length-based algorithms can fumble in bitext regions that contain many segments of similar length, like the vote record in Table 1.
    The only way to ensure a correct alignment in such cases is to look at the words.
    For this reason, Chen (1996) added a statistical translation model to the Brown, Lai, and Mercer alignment algorithm, and Wu (1994) added a translation lexicon to the Gale and Church alignment algorithm.
    A translation lexicon T can be represented as a sequence of t entries, where each entry is a pair of words: T ((xi,y1), &#8226; &#8226; &#8226; , (x, y)).
    Roughly speaking, Wu (1994) extended Gale and Church's (1991a) method with a matching function m(u, v,j), which was equal to one whenever xj E u and yl E V for lexicon entry (xj, yl), and zero otherwise.
    The information in the matching function was then used along with the information in d(u&#8222; v,) to condition the probability of alignments in Equation 3: From this point, Wu proceeded along the lines of Equations 4 an
