t more directly, and may influence their choice to purchase a specific product, as an example.
    This paper addresses the Japanese version of Domain-oriented Sentiment Analysis, which identifies polar clauses conveying goodness and badness in a specific domain, including rather objective expressions.
    Building domain-dependent lexicons for many domains is much harder work than preparing domainindependent lexicons and syntactic patterns, because the possible lexical entries are too numerous, and they may differ in each domain.
    To solve this problem, we have devised an unsupervised method to acquire domaindependent lexical knowledge where a user has only to collect unannotated domain corpora.
    The knowledge to be acquired is a domaindependent set of polar atoms.
    A polar atom is a minimum syntactic structure specifying polarity in a predicative expression.
    For example, to detect polar clauses in the sentences (3) and (4)i, the following polar atoms (5) and (6) should appear in the lexicon: Th
