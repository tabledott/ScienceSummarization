}, the algorithm considers each pair of words (e,, ei)(j and identifies which senses of the two words are most similar semantically.
    Those senses are then reinforced by an amount corresponding to that degree of similarity.3 After comparison across all pairs, each word sense s,j, of word e, ends up having associated with it a confidence c(s,j,) E [0, 1] that reflects how much reinforcement sense s,j, received based on the other words in the set.
    In our example, the KIND-OF-DRAMA sense of tragedy would have received little support from the senses of the other two words in the set; on the other hand, the CALAMITY sense would have been reinforced and therefore would receive higher confidence.
    At the end of the third step, we highlight the significance of variability in translation: since the method relies on semantic similarities between multiple items in a target set, the target set must contain at least two members.
    If throughout the parallel corpus the translator always chose to translate the F
