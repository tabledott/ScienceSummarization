med entity, or does not belong to any entity.
    RRM, MaxEnt, and fnTBL treat the problem entirely as a tagging task, while the HMM algorithm used here is constraining the transitions between the various phases, similar to the method described in (Bikel et al., 1999).
    Feature design and integration is of utmost importance in the overall classifier design &#8211; a rich feature space is the key to good performance.
    Often, high performing classifiers operating in an impoverished space are surpassed by a lower performing classifier when the latter has access to enhanced feature spaces (Zhang et al., 2002; Florian, 2002a).
    In accordance with this observation, the classifiers used in this research can access a diverse set of features when examining a word in context, including: In addition, a ngram-based capitalization restoration algorithm has been applied on the sentences that appear in all caps2, for the English task.
