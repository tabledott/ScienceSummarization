ween Spanish and Danish, Dutch, Finnish, French, German, Italian, Portuguese, and Swedish to generate our Spanish paraphrases, and did similarly for the French paraphrases.
    We manage the parallel corpora with a suffix array -based data structure (Callison-Burch et al., 2005).
    We calculated paraphrase probabilities using the Bannard and CallisonBurch (2005) method, summarized in Equation 3.
    Source language phrases that included names and numbers were not paraphrased.
    For each paraphrase that had translations in the phrase table, we added additional entries in the phrase table containing the original phrase and the paraphrase&#8217;s translations.
    We augmented the baseline model by incorporating the paraphrase probability into an additional feature function which assigns values as follows: p(f2|f1) If phrase table entry (e, f1) is generated from (e, f2)
  
  
    Just as we did in the baseline system, we performed minimum error rate training to set the weights of the nine feature functions i
