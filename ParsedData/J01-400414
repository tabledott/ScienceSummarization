    Our system determines whether j is a possible appositive construct by first checking for the existence of verbs and proper punctuation.
    Like the above example, most appositives do not have any verb; and an appositive is separated by a comma from the most immediate antecedent, i, to which it refers.
    Further, at least one of i and j must be a proper name.
    The MUC-6 and MUC-7 coreference task definitions are slightly different.
    In MUC-6, j needs to be a definite noun phrase to be an appositive, while both indefinite and definite noun phrases are acceptable in MUC-7.
    As an example, Table 1 shows the feature vector associated with the antecedent i, Frank Newman, and the anaphor j, vice chairman, in the following sentence: Feature vector of the markable pair (i = Frank Newman, j = vice chairman).
    Because of capitalization, markables in the headlines of MUC-6 and MUC-7 documents are always considered proper names even though some are not.
