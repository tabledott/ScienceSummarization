ng from partial trees, when not all target words are attached, and (2) learning in the presence of the still considerable noise in the projected one-to-one dependencies&#8212;e.g., at least 28% error for Spanish non-punctuation dependencies.
    What does this noise consist of?
    Some errors reflect fairly arbitrary annotation conventions in treebanks, e.g. should the auxiliary verb govern the main verb or vice versa.
    (Examples like this suggest that the projection problem contains the adaptation problem above.)
    Other errors arise from divergences in the complements required of certain head words.
    In the German-English translation pair, with co-indexed words aligned, [an [den Libanon1]] denken2 H remember2 Lebanon1 we would prefer that the preposition an attach to denken, even though the preposition&#8217;s object Libanon aligns to a direct child of remember.
    In other words, we would like the grandparentparent-child chain of denken &#8594; an &#8594; Libanon to align to the parent-child pair
