lation modeling problem.
    Before we turn to this problem, however, we should address an issue that may be a concern to some readers: Why do we estimate Pr(e) and POI e) rather than estimate Pr(e If) directly?
    We are really interested in this latter probability.
    Wouldn't we reduce our problems from three to two by this direct approach?
    If we can estimate POI e) adequately, why can't we just turn the whole process around to estimate Pr (el f)?
    To understand this, imagine that we divide French and English strings into those that are well-formed and those that are ill-formed.
    This is not a precise notion.
    We have in mind that strings like Il va a la bibliotheque, or I live in a house, or even Colorless green ideas sleep furiously are well-formed, but that strings like a la va Il bibliotheque or a I in live house are not.
    When we translate a French string into English, we can think of ourselves as springing from a well-formed French string into the sea of well-formed English strings
