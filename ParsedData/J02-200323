 distribution of X2.
    However, Agresti (1996, page 34) makes the opposite claim: &#8220;The sampling distributions of X2 and G2 get closer to chi-squared as the sample size n increases....
    The convergence is quicker for X2 than G2.&#8221; In addition, Pedersen (2001) questions whether one statistic should be preferred over the other for the bigram acquisition task and cites Cressie and Read (1984), who argue that there are some cases where the Pearson statistic is more reliable than the log-likelihood statistic.
    Finally, the results of the pseudo-disambiguation experiments presented in Section 7 are at least as good, if not better, when using X2 rather than G2, and so we conclude that the question of which statistic to use should be answered on a per application basis.
  
  
    The procedure for finding a suitable class, c', to generalize concept c in position r of verb v works as follows.
    (We refer to c' as the &#8220;similarity class&#8221; of c with respect to v and r and the hypernym c' as
