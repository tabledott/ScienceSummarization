nnealing on the breakage weight 3.
    Here we show performance with add-10 smoothing, the all-zero initializer, for three languages with three different initial values ,Qo.
    Time progresses from left (large ,Q) to right.
    See Table 3 for performance of models selected across smoothing, initialization, and stopping choices, in all six languages. yield of a second, and (x6, ..., xn) is the yield of a third.
    One extreme hypothesis is that x is n singlenode trees.
    At the other end of the spectrum is the original set of hypotheses&#8212;full trees on x.
    Each has a nonzero probability.
    Segmented analyses are intermediate representations that may be helpful for a learner to use to formulate notions of probable local structure, without committing to full trees.5 We only allow unobserved breaks, never positing a hard segmentation of the training sentences.
    Over time, we increase the bias against broken structures, forcing the learner to commit most of its probability mass to full trees.
