 mechanism is used, the parser is guaranteed to terminate after at most 2n transitions, given an input string of length n (Nivre,2003).
			This means that as long as transitions can be per formed in constant time, the running time of the parser will be linear in the length of the input.
			Moreover, the parser is guaranteed to produce a dependency graph that is acyclic and projective (and satisfies the unique-labeland single-head constraints).
			This means that the depen dency graph given at termination is well-formed if and only if it is connected (Nivre, 2003).
