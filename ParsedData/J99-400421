the last bucket; if the sentence is grammatical, the goal item will be in the last bucket, and if it is not grammatical, it will not be.
    It will be useful to assume that there is a single, variable-free goal item, and that this goal item does not occur as a condition for any rules.
    We could always add a [old-goal] new goal item [goal] and a rule where [old-goal] is[goal] the goal in the original description.
    A semiring parser also requires a grammar as input.
    We will need a list of rules in the grammar, and a function, R(rule), that gives the value for each rule in the grammar.
    This latter function will be semiring-specific.
    For instance, for computing the inside and Viterbi probabilities, the value of a grammar rule is just the conditional probability of that rule, or 0 if it is not in the grammar.
    For the Boolean semiring, the value is TRUE if the rule is in the grammar, FALSE otherwise.
    R(rule) replaces the set of rules R of a conventional grammar description; a rule is in t
