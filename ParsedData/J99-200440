    An alternate method of computing dependency linkages robustly is presented in the next section.
    Supertagging associates each word with a unique supertag.
    To establish the dependency links among the words of the sentence, we exploit the dependency requirements Bangalore and Joshi Supertagging encoded in the supertags.
    Substitution nodes and foot nodes in supertags serve as slots that must be filled by the arguments of the anchor of the supertag.
    A substitution slot of a supertag is filled by the complements of the anchor while the foot node of a supertag is filled by a word that is being modified by the supertag.
    These argument slots have a polarity value reflecting their orientation with respect to the anchor of the supertag.
    Also associated with a supertag is a list of internal nodes (including the root node) that appear in the supertag.
    Using the structural information coupled with the argument requirements of a supertag, a simple heuristic-based, linear time, deterministic a
