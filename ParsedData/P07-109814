.it/ moschitti/ which encodes tree kernel functions in SVM-light (Joachims, 1999).
    As a first experiment, we focus on question classification, for which benchmarks and baseline results are available (Zhang and Lee, 2003; Li and Roth, 2005).
    We design a question multi-classifier by combining n binary SVMs3 according to the ONEvs-ALL scheme, where the final output class is the one associated with the most probable prediction.
    The PASs were automatically derived by our SRL 3We adopted the default regularization parameter (i.e., the average of 1/||x||) and tried a few cost-factor values to adjust the rate between Precision and Recall on the development set. system which achieves a 76% F1-measure (Moschitti et al., 2005).
    As benchmark data, we use the question training and test set available at: l2r.cs.uiuc.edu/ &#8764;cogcomp/Data/QA/QC/, where the test set are the 500 TREC 2001 test questions (Voorhees, 2001).
    We refer to this split as UIUC.
