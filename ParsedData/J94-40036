    Thus, we first prefer 'treaty' to 'contract' because of the noun compound 'peace treaty' and then proceed to prefer 'sign' since it appears most frequently having the object 'treaty.'
    The order of selection is determined by a constraint propagation algorithm.

    Also, by using a model of statistical confidence, the algorithm avoids a decision in cases in which no alternative is significantly better than the others.
    Our approach can be analyzed from two diffe
