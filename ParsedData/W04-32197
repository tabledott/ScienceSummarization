al chunks, we align in the forward direction and again in the backward direction, heuristically recombining each unidirectional word alignment into a single bidirectional alignment (Och &amp; Ney 2000).
    Figure 1 shows an example of a monolingual alignment produced by Giza++.
    Each line represents a uni-directional link; directionality is indicated by a tick mark on the target side of the link.
    We held out a set of news clusters from our training data and extracted a set of 250 sentence pairs for blind evaluation.
    Randomly extracted on the basis of an edit distance of 5 n 20 (to allow a range of reasonably divergent candidate pairs while eliminating the most trivial substitutions), the gold-standard sentence pairs were checked by an independent human evaluator to ensure that they contained paraphrases before they were hand word-aligned.
    To evaluate the alignments, we adhered to the standards established in Melamed (2001) and Och &amp; Ney (2000, 2003).
