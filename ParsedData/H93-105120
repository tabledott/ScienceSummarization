her than being strictly a function of the number of senses.
  The hardest sense to learn, for all three classifiers, was tezt, followed by for- mation~ To test the validity of this conclusion, further tests need to be run.
  SThe Bayesian classifier averaged 76~ correct answers, the con- tent vector classifier averaged 73%, and the neural networks 79%.
  I f  statistical classifiers are to be part of higher-level NLP tasks, characteristics other than overall accuracy are important.
  Collecting training contexts is by far the most time-consuming part of the entire process.
  Until training-context acquisition is fully automated, classi- fiers requiring smaller training sets are preferred.
  Figure 1 shows that the content vector classifier has a flatter learning curve between 50 and 200 training contexts than the neural network and Bayesian classifiers, suggesting that the latter two require more (or larger) training con- texts.
  Ease and efficiency of use is also a factor.
  The three classifiers are roughl
