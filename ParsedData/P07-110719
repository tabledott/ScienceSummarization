d that correctly accounting for the future impact of salience changes to be particularly inefficient.
    However, ignoring those terms entirely made negligible difference in final accuracy.9
  
  
    We present our final experiments using the full model developed in section 3.
    As in section 3, we use true mention boundaries and evaluate using the MUC F1 measure (Vilain et al., 1995).
    All hyperparameters were tuned on the development set only.
    The document concentration parameter &#945; was set by taking a constant proportion of the average number of mentions in a document across the corpus.
    This number was chosen to minimize the squared error between the number of proposed entities and true entities in a document.
    It was not tuned to maximize the F1 measure.
    A coefficient of 0.4 was chosen.
    The global concentration coefficient -y was chosen to be a constant proportion of &#945;M, where M is the number of documents in the corpus.
    We found 0.15 to be a good value using the same
