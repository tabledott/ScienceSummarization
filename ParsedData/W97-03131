 in almost all aspects of natural language understanding, including word sense disambiguation, selectional restrictions, attachment decisions, and discourse processing.
    Semantic knowledge can add a great deal of power and accuracy to natural language processing systems.
    But semantic information is difficult to obtain.
    In most cases, semantic knowledge is encoded manually for each application.
    There have been a few large-scale efforts to create broad semantic knowledge bases, such as WordNet (Miller, 1990) and Cyc (Lenat, Prakash, and Shepherd, 1986).
    While these efforts may be useful for some applications, we believe that they will never fully satisfy the need for semantic knowledge.
    Many domains are characterized by their own sublanguage containing terms and jargon specific to the field.
    Representing all sublanguages in a single knowledge base would be nearly impossible.
    Furthermore, domain-specific semantic lexicons are useful for minimizing ambiguity problems.
