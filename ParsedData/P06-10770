  Tree-To-String Alignment Template For Statistical Machine Translation
  
    We present a novel translation model on alignment template (TAT) which describes the alignment between a source parse tree and a target string.
    A TAT is capable of generating both terminals and non-terminals and performing reordering at both low and high levels.
    The model is linguistically syntaxbased because TATs are extracted automatically from word-aligned, source side parsed parallel texts.
    To translate a source sentence, we first employ a parser to produce a source parse tree and then apply TATs to transform the tree into a target string.
    Our experiments show that the TAT-based model significantly outperforms Pharaoh, a state-of-the-art decoder for phrase-based models.
  
  
    Phrase-based translation models (Marcu and Wong, 2002; Koehn et al., 2003; Och and Ney, 2004), which go beyond the original IBM translation models (Brown et al., 1993) 1 by modeling translations of phrases rather than individual words,
