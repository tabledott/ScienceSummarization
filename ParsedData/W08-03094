ors were fluent or native speakers of both languages, and all translations were proofread by a native speaker of the target language.
    All of the translations were done directly, and not via an intermediate language.
    So for instance, each of the 15 Hungarian articles were translated into Czech, English, French, German and Spanish.
    The total cost of creating the 6 test sets consisting of 2,051 sentences in each language was approximately 17,200 euros (around 26,500 dollars at current exchange rates, at slightly more than 10c/word).
    Having a test set that is balanced in six different source languages and translated across six languages raises some interesting questions.
    For instance, is it easier, when the machine translation system translates in the same direction as the human translator?
    We found no conclusive evidence that shows this.
    What is striking, however, that the parts differ dramatically in difficulty, based on the original source language.
    For instance the Edinburgh Fr
