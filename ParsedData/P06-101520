    However, without the use of generic patterns, the ESP- system shows lower recall in all but the production relation.
    As hypothesized, exploiting generic patterns using the algorithm from Section 3.3 substantially improves recall without much deterioration in precision.
    ESP+ shows one to two orders of magnitude improvement on recall while losing on average below 10% precision.
    The succession relation in Table 6 was the only relation where Espresso found no generic pattern.
    For other relations, Espresso found from one to five generic patterns.
    Table 4 shows the power of generic patterns where system recall increases by 577 times with only a 10% drop in precision.
    In Table 7, we see a case where the combination of filtering with a large increase in retrieved instances resulted in both higher precision and recall.
    In order to better analyze our use of generic patterns, we performed the following experiment.
    For each relation, we randomly sampled 100 instances for each generic
