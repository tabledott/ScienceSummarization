ng to the desired linguistic phenomena.
    In addition to introducing the three parsing models and evaluating their performance on the Penn Wall Street Journal Treebank, we have aimed in our discussion (in sections 7 and 8) to give more insight into the models: their strengths and weaknesses, the effect of various features on parsing accuracy, and the relationship of the models to other work on statistical parsing.
    In conclusion, we would like to highlight the following points: subcategorization parameters performs very poorly (76.5% precision, 75% recall), suggesting that the adjacency feature is capturing some subcategorization information in the model 1 parser.
    The results in Table 7 show that the subcategorization, adjacency, and &#8220;verb-crossing&#8221; features all contribute significantly to model 2&#8217;s (and by implication model 3&#8217;s) performance.
    &#8226; Section 7.3 described how the three models are well-suited to the Penn Treebank style of annotation, and how certain phenome
