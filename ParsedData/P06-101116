 in degree of parallelism, so we group them together and refer to them as the EZZ corpus.
    This corpus exhibits a higher degree of parallelism than the BBC one; in particular, it contains many article pairs which are literal translations of each other.
    Therefore, although our subsentence extraction method should produce useful data from this corpus, we expect the sentence extraction method to be more successful.
    Using this second corpus should help highlight the strengths and weaknesses of our approach.
    Table 1 summarizes the relevant information concerning these corpora.
    On each of our comparable corpora, and using each of our initial parallel corpora, we apply both the fragment extraction and the sentence extraction method of Munteanu and Marcu (2005).
    In order to evaluate the importance of the LLRLex lexicon, we also performed fragment extraction experiments that do not use this lexicon, but only GIZA-Lex.
    Thus, for each initial parallel corpus and each comparable corpus, we extr
