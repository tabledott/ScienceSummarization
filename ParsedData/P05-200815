ay be noisy with respect to sentiment.
    The SVM classifier seems particularly affected by this noise.
    Figure 9 depicts the change in performance of the SVM classifier when varying the training set size and size of context extracted.
    There are significant spikes apparent for the training sizes of 2,000, 3,000 and 6,000 article extracts (as noted in Section 3.2), where the accuracy suddenly increases for the training set size, then quickly decreases for the next set size.
    This implies that the classifier is discovering features that are useful in classifying the heldout set, but the addition of more, noisy, texts soon makes the information redundant.
    Some examples of noise taken from the Emoticons dataset are: mixed sentiment, e.g.
    &#8220;Sorry about venting my frustration here but I just lost it.
    :-( Happy thanks giving everybody :-)&#8221;, sarcasm, e.g.
    &#8220;Thank you so much, that&#8217;s really encouraging :-(&#8221;, and spelling mistakes, e.g.
