these approaches (referred to as licensing by (Groenendijk, 1999) and aboutness by (Lewis, 1988)), p is considered to be an answer to a question ?q iff ?q logically entails the set of worlds in which p is true(i.e.
    ?p).
    While the notion of textual entailment has been defined far less rigorously than logical entailment, we believe that the recognition of textual entailment between a question and a set of candidate answers &#8211; or between a question and questions generated from answers &#8211; can enable Q/A systems to identify correct answers with greater precision than current keyword- or pattern-based techniques.
    As illustrated in Figure 1, most open-domain Q/A systems generally consist of a sequence of three modules: (1) a question processing (QP) module; (2) a passage retrieval (PR) module; and (3) an answer processing (AP) module.
    Questions are first submitted to a QP module, which extracts a set of relevant keywords from the text of the question and identifies the question&#8217;s expe
