), this method obtained a correct correspondence in 90% of the cases at the sense level, and 97% at the level of homographs (Ide and Veronis 1990a).
    Sutcliffe and Slater (1995) replicated this method on full text (samples from Orwell's Animal Farm) and found similar results (72% correct sense assignment, compared with a 33% chance baseline, and 40% using Lesk's method).
    Several authors (for example, Krovetz and Croft [1989], Guthrie et al. [1991], Slator [19921, Cowie, Guthrie, and Guthrie [1992], Janssen [1992], Braden-Harder [1993], Liddy and Paik [19931) have attempted to improve results by using supplementary fields of information in the electronic version of the Longman Dictionary of Contemporary English (LDOCE), in particular, the box codes and subject codes provided for each sense.
    Box codes include primitives such as ABSTRACT, ANIMATE, HUMAN, etc., and encode type restrictions on nouns and adjectives and on the arguments of verbs.
    Subject codes use another set of primitives to classify
