e proceed as follows.
    Let the neighbors of a be ranked so that the first is the neighbor for which Pr(ale, f; 3) is greatest, the second the one for which Pr(ale, f; 3) is next greatest, and so on.
    We define b(a) to be the highest-ranking neighbor of a for which Pr(b-(a) le, f; 4) is at least as large as Pr(ale, f; 4).
    We define -6&#8222;_1(a) analogously.
    Here, Pr(ale, f; 3) means Pr(ale, f) as computed with Model 3, and Pr(ale, f;4) means Pr(ale, f) as computed with Model 4.
    We define S for Model 4 by N-(b&amp;quot; ( V(f le; 2))) U (fie; 2))).
    (47) This equation is identical to Equation (47) except that b has been replaced by b.
    Models 3 and 4 are both deficient.
    In Model 4, not only can several words lie on top of one another, but words can be placed before the first position or beyond the last position in the French string.
    We remove this deficiency in Model 5.
    After we have placed the words for 41-1 and r[i]ik-1 there will remain some vacant positions in the Frenc
