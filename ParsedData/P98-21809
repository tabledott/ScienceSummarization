    Many researchers, both in the dictionary- and corpus-based camps, have worked extensively on developing methods to identify similarity between words, since similarity determination is crucial to many word sense disambiguation and parametersmoothing/inference procedures.
    However, some researchers have failed to distinguish between substitutional similarity and general relatedness.
    The similarity procedure of MindNet focuses on measuring substitutional similarity, but a function is also provided for producing clusters of generally related words.
    Two general strategies have been described in the literature for identifying substitutional similarity.
    One is based on identifying direct, paradigmatic relations between the words, such as Hypernym or Synonym.
    For example, paradigmatic relations in WordNet have been used by many to determine similarity, including Li et al. (1995) and Agirre and Rigau (1996).
    The other strategy is based on identifying syntagmatic relations with other
