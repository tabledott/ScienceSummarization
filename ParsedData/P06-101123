uristics (such as our requirement that the extracted fragments have at least 3 words).
    The fact that the source and target signal are filtered separately is also a weakness; a joint analysis should produce better results.
    Despite the better lexicon, the greatest source of errors is still related to false word correspondences, generally involving punctuation and very common, closed-class words.
    Giving special attention to such cases should help get rid of these errors, and improve the precision of the method.
