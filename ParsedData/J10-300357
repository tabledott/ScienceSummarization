ra may be considered comparable since the articles in each are related to the same topic and were published during the same time frame.
    Algorithm 4 shows some details of how their technique works.
    Steps 3&#8211;18 show how to cluster topically related sentences, construct a word lattice from such a cluster, and convert that into a slotted lattice&#8212;basically a word lattice with certain nodes recast as variables or empty slots.
    The clustering is done so as to bring together sentences pertaining to the same topics and having similar structure.
    The word lattice is the product of an algorithm that computes a multiple-sequence alignment (MSA) for a cluster of sentences (Step 6).
    A very brief outline of such an algorithm, originally developed to compute an alignment for a set of three or more protein or DNA sequences, is as follows:9 The word lattice so generated now needs to be converted into a slotted lattice to allow its use as a paraphrase template.
    Slotting is performed based on the
