 to rank 4 for Basque and Turkish.
			The authors attribute this high performance to their parser?s good performance on small training sets.However, this hypothesis is contradicted by their re sults for Greek and Italian, the other two languages with small training sets.
			For these two languages, the system?s rank is very close to its average rank.
			6.1.3 An Experiment in System Combination Having the outputs of many diverse dependencyparsers for standard data sets opens up the interest ing possibility of parser combination.
			To combine the outputs of each parser we used the method of Sagae and Lavie (2006).
			This technique assigns to each possible labeled dependency a weight that isequal to the number of systems that included the de pendency in their output.
			This can be viewed as an arc-based voting scheme.
			Using these weightsit is possible to search the space of possible depen dency trees using directed maximum spanning tree algorithms (McDonald et al, 2005).
			The maximum spanning tree in th
