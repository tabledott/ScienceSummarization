 has been focused on the weak generative capacity of grammatical formalism.
    Little attention, however, has been paid to the structural descriptions that these formalisms can assign to strings, i.e. their strong generative capacity.
    This aspect of the formalism is both linguistically and computationally important.
    For example, Gazdar (1985) discusses the applicability of Indexed Grammars (IG's) to Natural Language in terms of the structural descriptions assigned; and Berwick (1984) discusses the strong generative capacity of Lexical-Functional Grammar (LFG) and Government and Bindings grammars (GB).
    The work of Thatcher (1973) and Rounds (1969) define formal systems that generate tree sets that are related to CFG's and IG's.
    We consider properties of the tree sets generated by CFG's, Tree Adjoining Grammars (TAG's), Head Grammars (HG's), Categorial Grammars (CG's), and IG's.
    We examine both the complexity of the paths of trees in the tree sets, and the kinds of dependencies that the for
