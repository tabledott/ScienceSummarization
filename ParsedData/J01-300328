    Using these corpora, we develop counting procedures that yield relative frequency distributions for approximations to the five linguistic features we have determined, over a sample of verbs from our three classes.
    We chose a set of 20 verbs from each class based primarily on the classification in Levin (1993).3 The complete list of verbs appears in Table 5; the group 1/group 2 designation is explained below in the section on counting.
    As indicated in the table, unergatives are manner-of-motion verbs (from the &amp;quot;run&amp;quot; class in Levin), unaccusatives are changeof-state verbs (from several of the classes in Levin's change-of-state super-class), while object-drop verbs were taken from a variety of classes in Levin's classification, all of which undergo the unexpressed object alternation.
    The most frequently used classes are verbs of change of possession, image-creation verbs, and verbs of creation and transformation.
    The selection of verbs was based partly on our intuitive ju
