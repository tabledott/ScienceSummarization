 that verb distribution and patterns might also reveal subtle information in text.
    Verb class distribution within the document and within particular sub-sections also carry meaning.
    For example, we have observed that when sentences with movement verbs such as rise or fall are followed by sentences with cause and then a telic aspectual verb such as reach, this indicates that a value rose to a certain point due to the actions of some entity.
    Identification of such sequences will enable us to assign functions to particular sections of contiguous text in an article, in much the same way that text segmentation program seeks identify topics from distributional vocabulary (Hearst, 1994; Kan et al., 1998).
    We can also use specific sequences of verbs to help in determining methods for performing semantic aggregation of individual clauses in text generation for summarization.
    Future Work.
    Our plans are to extend the current research in terms of verb coverage and in terms of article coverage.
