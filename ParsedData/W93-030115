e set of all connections with offset k. Instead of equation 7, we have The last three equations are used in the EM algorithm in an iterative fashion as before to estimate the translation probabilities and the offset probabilities.
    Table 1 and Figure 2 show some values that were estimated in this way.
    The input consisted of a pair of Microsoft Windows manuals in English (125,000 words) and its equivalent in French (143,000 words).
    Table 1 shows four French words and the four most likely translations, sorted by t(el f)1 .
    Note that the correct translation(s) are usually near the front of the list, though there is a tendency for the program to be confused by collocates such as &amp;quot;information about&amp;quot;.
    Figure 2 shows the probability estimates for offsets from the initial alignment I.
    Note that smaller offsets are more likely than larger ones, as we would expect.
    Moreover, the distribution is reasonably close to normal, as indicated by the dotted line, which was generated
