ising that we can avoid these limitations, and create item-based descriptions of parsers for weakly context-sensitive grammars, such as tree adjoining grammars (TAGs).
    We avoid the limitations of previous approaches using two techniques.
    One technique is to compute derivation trees, rather than parse trees, for TAGs.
    Computing derivation trees for TAGs is significantly easier than computing parse trees, since the derivation trees are context-free.
    The other trick we use is to create a set of equations for each grammar and string length rather than creating a set of equations for each grammar, as earlier formulations did.
    Because the number of equations grows with the string length with our technique, we can recognize strings in weakly context-sensitive languages.
    Goodman (1998) gives a further explication of this subject, including an item-based description for a simple TAG parser.
    Our goal in this section has been to show that item-based descriptions can be used to simply describe
