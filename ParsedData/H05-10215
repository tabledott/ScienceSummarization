			Reordering prior to translation was found to be memory intensive and unwieldy (Kumaret al, 2005).
			In contrast, we will show that the cur rent model can be used for both phrase alignment and translation.
			2.1 The Phrase Reordering Model.
			We now describe two WFSTs that allow local reordering within phrase sequences.
			The simplest allows swapping of adjacent phrases.
			The second allows phrase movement within a three phrase win dow.
			Our formulation ensures that the overall modelprovides a proper parameterized probability distribution over reordered phrase sequences; we empha size that the resulting distribution is not degenerate.
			Phrase reordering (Fig 2) takes as its input a French phrase sequence in English phrase order x1, x2, ..., xK . This is then reordered into French phrase order y1, y2, ..., yK . Note that words within phrases are not affected.
			We make the following conditional independence assumption: P (yK1 |x K 1 , u K 1 ,K, e I 1) = P (y K 1 |x K 1 , u K 1 ).
