    I am going to buy a guitar. clearly belongs with the progressives, being distinguished from them by the nature of the processes that it implicates (see Leech 1971; Palmer 1974; Wekker 1976, and references therein).

    I am to be Queen of the May also seems to belong with the progressives, although its modal character has been remarked by Leech and Palmer.
    Finally, where does the modal future fit into this scheme?
    A full analysis of the modals would go beyond the scope of this paper, so the following remarks will be sketchy.
    The modal future clearly has a reference time not coincident with speech time, like the nonmodal future but unlike the futurate progressive.
    Nevertheless, Bennett and Partee are quite right that the modal future says something about the present as well as the past.
