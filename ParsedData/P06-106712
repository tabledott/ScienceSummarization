    The word alignments we use are both annotated manually by human annotators.
    The ArabicEnglish test set is the NIST MT Evaluation 2003 test set.
    It contains 663 segments (i.e., sentences).
    The Arabic side consists of 16,652 tokens and the English consists of 19,908 tokens.
    The Chinese-English test set contains 260 segments.
    The Chinese side is word segmented and consists of 4,319 tokens and the English consists of 5,525 tokens.
    As suggested by the BLEU scores reported in Table 2, Arabic-English has more word order differences than Chinese-English.
    The difference in n-gPrec is bigger for smaller values of n, which suggests that ArabicEnglish has more local word order differences than in Chinese-English.
  
  
    The distortion model we are proposing consists of three components: outbound, inbound, and pair distortion.
    Intuitively our distortion models attempt to capture the order in which source words need to be translated.
