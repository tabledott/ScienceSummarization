ve differently were these assumptions not well-founded.
    In addition, there may be a number of UNDERSPECIFICATIONS in the descriptions of the algorithms.
    These often arise because theories that attempt to categorize naturally occurring data and algorithms based on them will always be prey to previously unencountered examples.
    For example, since the BFP salience hierarchy for discourse entities is based on grammatical relation, an implicit assumption is that an utterance only has one subject.
    However the novel Wheels has many examples of reported dialogue such as She continued, unperturbed, &amp;quot;Mr. Vale quotes the Bible about air pollution.&amp;quot; One might wonder whether the subject is She or Mr. Vale.
    In some cases, the algorithm might need to be further specificied in order to be able to process any of the data, whereas in others they may just highlight where the algorithm needs to be modified (see section 3.2).
    In general we count underspecifications as failures.
    Finally
