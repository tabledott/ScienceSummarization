    Alshawi et al. (2000) and Hwa et al.
    (2005) explore transfer of deeper syntactic structure: dependency grammars.
    Dependency and constituency grammar formalisms have long coexisted and competed in linguistics, especially beyond English (Mel&#8217;&#711;cuk, 1988).
    Recently, dependency parsing has gained popularity as a simpler, computationally more efficient alternative to constituency parsing and has spurred several supervised learning approaches (Eisner, 1996; Yamada and Matsumoto, 2003a; Nivre and Nilsson, 2005; McDonald et al., 2005) as well as unsupervised induction (Klein and Manning, 2004; Smith and Eisner, 2006).
    Dependency representation has been used for language modeling, textual entailment and machine translation (Haghighi et al., 2005; Chelba et al., 1997; Quirk et al., 2005; Shen et al., 2008), to name a few tasks.
    Dependency grammars are arguably more robust to transfer since syntactic relations between aligned words of parallel sentences are b
