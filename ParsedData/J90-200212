ility 2 times Pr(estIbeat)Pr(battuIbeat), and so on.
    The word par is produced from a special English word which is denoted by ( null ).
    The result is Finally, factor in the distortion probabilities.
    Our model for distortions is, at present, very simple.
    We assume that the position of the target word depends only on the length of the target sentence and the position of the source word.
    Therefore, a distortion probability has the form Pr(i I j, /) where i is a target position, j a source position, and I the target length.
    In summary, the parameters of our translation model are a set of fertility probabilities Pr(n I e) for each English word e and for each fertility n from 0 to some moderate limit, in our case 25; a set of translation probabilities Pr (fie), one for each element f of the French vocabulary and each member e of the English vocabulary; and a set of distortion probabilities Pr(i I j, 1) for each target position i, source position j, and target length 1.
    We limit i, j, and
