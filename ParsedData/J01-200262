f input data can be varied is by taking subsets of the set of component taggers.
    The relation between the accuracy of combinations for LOB (using WPDV(Tags+Context)) and that of the individual taggers is shown in Table 11.
    The first three columns show the combination, the accuracy, and the improvement in relation to the best component.
    The other four columns show the further improvement gained when adding yet another component.
    The most important observation is that every combination outperforms the combination of any strict subset of its components.
    The difference is always significant, except in the cases MXP+HMM+MBT+TBL vs. MXP+HMM+MBT and HMM+MBT+TBL vs. HMM+MBT.
    We can also recognize the quality of the best component as a major factor in the quality of the combination results.
    HMM and MXP always add more gain than MBT, which always adds more gain than TBL.
    Another major factor is the difference in language model.
    MXP, although having a lower accuracy by itself than HMM
