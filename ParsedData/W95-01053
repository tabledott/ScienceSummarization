a given domain.
    I assume throughout this paper that finer-grained distinctions than that are necessary.
    It is quite small, by current corpus standards (on the order of hundreds of thousands of words, rather than millions or tens of millions); the direct annotation methodology used to create it is labor intensive (Marcus et al. (1993) found that direct annotation takes twice as long as automatic tagging plus correction, for partof-speech annotation); and the output quality reflects the difficulty of the task (inter-annotator disagreement is on the order of 10%, as contrasted with the approximately 3% error rate reported for part-of-speech annotation by Marcus et al.).
    There have been some attempts to capture the behavior of semantic categories in a distributional setting, despite the unavailability of sense-annotated corpora.
    For example, Hearst and Schtitze (1993) take steps toward a distributional treatment of WordNet-based classes, using Schtitze's (1993) approach to constructing vector repr
