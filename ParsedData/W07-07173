ze to new domains (ones not represented in the sample).
    We do not learn mixture weights directly with this method, because there is little hope that these would be well suited to new domains.
    Instead we attempt to learn how weights should be set as a function of distance.
    To our knowledge, this approach to dynamic adaptation for SMT is novel, and it is one of the main contributions of the paper.
    A second contribution is a fairly broad investigation of the large space of alternatives defined by the mixture-modeling framework, using a simple genrebased corpus decomposition.
    We experimented with the following choices: cross-domain versus dynamic adaptation; linear versus loglinear mixtures; language and translation model adaptation; various text distance metrics; different ways of converting distance metrics into weights; and granularity of the source unit being adapted to.
    The remainder of the paper is structured follows: section 2 briefly describes our phrase-based SMT system; section 3
