s for the kappa statistic of agreement (see (Siegel and Castellan, 1988)) for the gene regulation data (set a) and the crohns data (set c).
    Three values were computed: kappa for three-way agreement (High vs. Low vs. Definite), two-way (Speculative vs. Definite) and two-way (High vs. Low).
    Due to the lack of any sentences marked High in set c, a kappa value for High vs. low (HvsL) is not possible.
    Kappa scores between 0.6 and 0.8 are generally considered encouraging but not outstanding.

    The following two tables are confusion matrices, the first for gene regulation data (set a) and the second for the crohns data (set c).
    If we consider one of the annotators as defining truth (gold standard), then we can compute precision and recall numbers for the other annotator on finding speculative sentences.
    If we choose Leontiev and Srinivasan as defining truth, then Light and Qiu receive the scores below. precision rec
