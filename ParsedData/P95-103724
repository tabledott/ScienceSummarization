    Regardless of what techniques are used for parsing disambiguation, one thing is clear: if a particular piece of information is necessary for solving a disambiguation problem, it must be made available to the disambiguation mechanism.
    The words in the sentence are clearly necessary to make parsing decisions, and in some cases long-distance structural information is also needed.
    Statistical models for parsing need to consider many more features of a sentence than can be managed by n-gram modeling techniques and many more examples than a human can keep track of.
    The SPATTER parser illustrates how large amounts of contextual information can be incorporated into a statistical model for parsing by applying decision-tree learning algorithms
