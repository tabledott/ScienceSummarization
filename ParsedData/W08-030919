thinking that this might be a good indication of how challenging it is for current MT systems to translate from each of the languages into English.
    For this analysis we collapsed all of the entries derived from one source language into an equivalence class, and judged them against the others.
    Therefore, all French systems were judged against all German systems, and so on.
    We found that French systems were judged to be better than or equal to other systems 69% of the time, Spanish systems 64% of the time, German systems 47% of the time, Czech systems 39% of the time, and Hungarian systems 29% of the time.
    We performed a similar analysis by collapsing the RBMT systems into one equivalence class, and the other systems into another.
    We evaluated how well these two classes did on the sentence ranking task for each language pair and test set, and found that RBMT was a surprisingly good approach in many of the conditions.
    RBMT generally did better on the News test set and for translations int
