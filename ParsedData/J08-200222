sent multi-constituent arguments.
    A constituent labeled C-ARGX is assumed to be a continuation of the closest constituent to the left labeled ARGX.
    Our semantic role labeling system produces labelings of this form and the gold standard Propbank annotations are converted to this form as well.4 The evaluation is carried out individually for each predicate and its associated argument frame.
    If a sentence contains several clauses, the several argument frames are evaluated separately.
    Our argument-based measures do not require exact bracketing (if the set of words constituting an argument is correct, there is no need to know how this set is broken into constituents) and do not give partial credit for labeling correctly only some of several constituents in a multi-constituent argument.
    They are illustrated in Figure 2.
    For these measures, a semantic role labeling of a sentence is viewed as a labeling on sets of words.
    These sets can encompass several non-contiguous spans.
