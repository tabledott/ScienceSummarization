information to the path.3 The next item in the tree is the word found and we append its lemma (find) to the path.
    Next is the semantic relation object connecting a verb to a noun and we append that.
    The process continues until we reach the other slot (the word problem) at which point we stop.4 The extracted path is shown below the tree.
    Similarly, we can extract a path for the second dependency tree.
    Let&#8217;s briefly mention the terminology associated with such paths: Intuitively, one can imagine a path to be a complex representation of the pattern X finds answer to Y, where X and Y are variables.
    This representation for a path is a perfect fit for an extended version of the distributional similarity hypothesis: If similar sets of words fill the same variables for two different patterns, then the patterns may be considered to have similar meaning, which is indeed the case for the paths in Figure 2.
