, for example, this yielded 30535 possible rules.
    Table 1 gives a sampling of these potential rules in each of the three languages in terms of frequency-sorted rank.
    Notice that several &#8220;rules&#8221; are quite valid, such as the indication of an English suffix -s. There are also valid circumfixes like the ge-/-t circumfix of German.
    Capitalization also appears (as a &#8216;prefix&#8217;), such as C&lt; c in English, D&lt;d in German, and V&lt;v in Dutch.
    Likewise,there are also some rules that may only be true in certain circumstances, such as -d&lt;-r in English (such as worked/worker, but certainly not for steed/steer.)
    However, there are some rules that are wrong: the potential &#8216;s-&#8217; prefix of English is never valid although word combinations like stick/tick spark/park, and slap/lap happen frequently in English.
    Incorporating semantics can help determine the validity of each rule.
