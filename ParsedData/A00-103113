e, the others as unreliable.
    As we will see below, accuracies for reliable assignments are much higher.
    The tests are performed on partitions of the corpora that use 90% as training set and 10% as test set, so that the test data is guaranteed to be unseen during training.
    Each result is obtained by repeating the experiment 10 times with different partitions and averaging the single outcomes.
    In all experiments, contiguous test sets are used.
    The alternative is a round-robin procedure that puts every 10th sentence into the test set.
    We argue that contiguous test sets yield more realistic results because completely unseen articles are tagged.
    Using the round-robin procedure, parts of an article are already seen, which significantly reduces the percentage of unknown words.
    Therefore, we expect even 'By definition, this quotient is oo if there is only one possible tag for a given word. higher results when testing on every 10th sentence instead of a contiguous set of 10%.
    In the
