ble to  measure  in format ion at extremely large d istances (10,000 words away from the po lysemous word in quest ion),  though obviously most  of the useful in format ion appears  relatively near  the poly- semous word (e.g., within the first 100 words or so).
  Needless to say, our 100-word contexts  are considerably larger than  the smal ler 5-word windows that  one normal ly  f inds in the l i terature.

  Nevertheless, even with these over- simplifications, the model still contains an extremely large number of parameters: 2V ~ 200,000.
  It is a non-trivial task to estimate such a large number of pa- rameters, especially given the sparseness of the training data.
