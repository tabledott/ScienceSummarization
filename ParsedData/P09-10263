ishing factors associated with a preference for a stance.
    Finally, while other opinion analysis systems have considered discourse information, they have not distinguished between concessionary and non-concessionary opinions when determining the overall stance of a document.
    This work proposes an unsupervised opinion analysis method to address the challenges described above.
    First, for each debate side, we mine the web for opinion-target pairs that are associated with a preference for that side.
    This information is employed, in conjunction with discourse information, in an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) framework.
    This framework combines the individual pieces of information to arrive at debate-side classifications of posts in online debates.
    The remainder of this paper is organized as follows.
    We introduce our debate genre in Section 2 and describe our method in Section 3.
    We present the experiments in Section 4 and analyze the results in Section 5.
