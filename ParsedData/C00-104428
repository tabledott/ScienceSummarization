tives automatically labeled for gradability.
  It is also important to note that, in most cases, tile automatically-classified adjectives are comparable or better predictors of subjective sentences than the manually-assigned ones.
  Comparing tile automatically generated classes with the manually identilied ones, the positive polarity set decreases by 1 percentage point (L3 and L8), while the negative polarity set increases by 7 points (L4 and L9), and the gradable sot increases by 5 percentage points (L6 and LI 1).
  Among the intersection sets, in two cases the results are lower for tile computer- generated sets (Ll 3/LI 5 and L 14/L 16), but in tile other 4 eases, the results are higher (LI 7/L20, L 18/L21, L19/L2, L24/L23).
  Finally, the table shows that, in most cases, pro- dictability improves or at worst remains essentially tile same as additional lexical features are considered.
  For tile set of dynamic adjectives, the predictability is 74% (L2), and improves in 4 of the 6 cases in which it is in- t
