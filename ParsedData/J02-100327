vely, however, the KB should enable one to refer to c, for example, since it is the only black dog that is not a poodle: {c} = BLACK n POODLE A similar gap exists where disjunctions might be used.
    For example, the Incremental Algorithm does not make the set of dogs that are either white or poodles referrable, whereas it is referrable in English&#8212;for example, the white dogs and the poodles.
    In the next two sections, we will investigate how negation and disjunction can be taken into account in GRE.
    But first we introduce a trick for determining whether unique identification of an entity is possible, in a given situation.7 The idea is to calculate, for each element d in the domain, the Satellite set of d, that is, the intersection of the extensions of all the properties true of d. Taking all extensions from our dog example, we have Satellite sets show which sets can be uniquely identified and which ones cannot.
    In the case of the dogs, for example, no intersective description of {c} is possi
