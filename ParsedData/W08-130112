    By collapsing the dependencies involving conjuncts, the output produced is closer to the semantics of the sentence, and this facilitates information extraction (DP2).
    This information is not straightforwardly apparent in the GR scheme (see figure 2), nor in the PARC scheme which follows a similar treatment of conjuncts.
    Another choice in the design has been to consistently have binary relations (DP1).
    All the dependencies form a triple: a grammatical relation holding between two words (head and dependent).
    This gives uniformity to the representation and renders it very readable, critical features for a usercentered design.
    Furthermore, all the information can be represented by a directed graph, enabling the creation of both a limpid visual representation for humans and a canonical data structure for software.
    Moreover, it maps straightforwardly on to semantic web representations such as OWL and RDF triples, as exploited in (Zouaq et al., 2006; Zouaq et al., 2007).
