refore checking agreement on unit identification is essential.
    In this section we discuss current CL practice with reliability testing of these types of annotation, before briefly summarizing Krippendorff&#8217;s proposals concerning measuring reliability for unitizing.
    4.3.1 Segmentation and Topic Marking.
    Discourse segments are portions of text that constitute a unit either because they are about the same &#8220;topic&#8221; (Hearst 1997; Reynar 1998) or because they have to do with achieving the same intention (Grosz and Sidner 1986) or performing the same &#8220;dialogue game&#8221; (Carletta et al. 1997).7 The analysis of discourse structure&#8212;and especially the identification of discourse segments&#8212;is the type of annotation that, more than any other, led CL researchers to look for ways of measuring reliability and agreement, as it made them aware of the extent of disagreement on even quite simple judgments (Kowtko, Isard, and Doherty 1992; Passonneau and Litman 1993; Carletta et al.
