 are passed through a common preproccessing step, which relabels preterminal nodes dominating auxiliary verbs and transitive verbs.
    The preprocessing step relabels auxiliary verbs and transitive verbs in all trees seen by the algorithm.
    This relabelling is deterministic and depends only on the terminal (i.e., the word) and its preterminal label.
    Auxiliary verbs such as is and being are relabelled as either a AUX or AUXG respectively.
    The relabelling of auxiliary verbs was performed primarily because Charniak&#8217;s parser (which produced one of the test corpora) produces trees with such labels; experiments (on the development section) show that auxiliary relabelling has little effect on the algorithm&#8217;s performance.
    The transitive verb relabelling suffixes the preterminal labels of transitive verbs with &#8220; t&#8221;.
    For example, in Figure 1 the verb likes is relabelled VBZ t in this step.
    A verb is deemed transitive if its stem is followed by an NP without any grammatica
