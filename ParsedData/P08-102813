try in the case of the simple additive model produces a model which weighs the contribution of the two components differently: This allows additive models to become more syntax aware, since semantically important constituents can participate more actively in the composition.
    As an example if we set &#945; to 0.4 and &#946; to 0.6, then horse= [0 2.4 0.8 4 1.6] and run = [0.6 4.8 2.4 2.4 0], and their sum horse + run = [0.6 5.6 3.2 6.4 1.6].
    An extreme form of this differential in the contribution of constituents is where one of the vectors, say u, contributes nothing at all to the combination: Admittedly the model in (8) is impoverished and rather simplistic, however it can serve as a simple baseline against which to compare more sophisticated models.
    The models considered so far assume that components do not &#8216;interfere&#8217; with each other, i.e., that It is also possible to re-introduce the dependence on K into the model of vector composition.
    For additive models, a natural way to ach
