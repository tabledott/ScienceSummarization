    We use &#946; (mv, wv) to denote the inside probability for mv-wv pair, br[mv, wv, c] to denote the aggregated probabilities for the MR sub-structure mv to generate all possible hybrid sequences based on wv with pattern r that covers its c-th child only.
    In addition, we use w(i,j) to denote a subsequence of w with start index i (inclusive) and end index j (exclusive).
    We also use &#946;r~mv, wv&#8226; to denote the aggregated inside probability for the pair hmv, wvi, if the hybrid pattern is restricted to r only.
    By definition we have: Relations between &#946;r and br can also be established.
    For example, if mv has one child semantic category, we have: &#946;m&#8594;wY~mv, wv&#8226; = bm&#8594;wY[mv, wv, 1] (13) For the case when mv has two child semantic categories as arguments, we have, for example: Note that there also exist relations amongst b terms for more efficient computation, for example: Analogous but more complex formulas are used for computing the outside probabilitie
