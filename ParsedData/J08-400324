s this property.
    We consider each of the relevant conditions in turn, keeping in mind that the only transitions that modify the graph are LEFT-ARCl and RIGHT-ARCsl.
    Nivre Deterministic Incremental Dependency Parsing configuration where i is on the top of the stack).
    Basis: If &#8710;(p) = 0, then i and j are adjacent and &#928;(p, i, j) holds vacuously.
    Inductive step: Assume that &#928;(p, i, j) holds if &#8710;(p) &lt; q (for some q &gt; 0) and that &#8710;(p) = q + 1.
    Now consider the transition tp that results in configuration cp.
    There are three cases: Case 1: If tp = RIGHT-ARCsl (for some l), then there is a node k such that j &lt; k, (j,l, k) E Acp, and cp&#8722;1 = (&#963;|i|j, k|&#946;, Acp&#8722; I(j,l,k)}).
    This entails that there is an earlier configuration cp&#8722;r (2 &lt; r &lt; &#8710;(p)) such that cp&#8722;r = (&#963;|i,j|&#946;,Acp&#8722;r).
    Because &#8710;(p &#8722; r) = &#8710;(p) &#8722; r &lt; q, we can use the inductive hypothesis to infer &#928;(p &#87
