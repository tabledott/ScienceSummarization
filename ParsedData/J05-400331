    Each cell contains four numbers that represent the coverage with respect to unigrams, bigrams, trigrams, and 4-grams.
    The numbers show that unigram coverage depends only on the size of the corpus (and not on the domain), but for longer n-grams, our in-domain extracted data brings significant improvements in coverage.
    The extraction experiments from the previous section are controlled experiments in which we only use limited amounts of parallel data for our extraction system.
    In this section, we describe experiments in which the goal is to assess the applicability of our method to data that we mined from the Web.
    We obtained comparable corpora from the Web by going to bilingual news websites (such as Al-Jazeera) and downloading news articles in each language independently.
    In order to get as many articles as possible, we used the web site&#8217;s search engine to get lists of articles and their URLs, and then crawled those lists.
    We used the AgentBuilder tool (Ticrea and Minton
