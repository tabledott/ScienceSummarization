put sentences, including work exploiting syntactic dependencies by Lin and Pantel (2001) and Snow et al. (2005), and work in the ACE paradigm such as Zhou et al.
    (2005) and Zhou et al. (2007).
    Perhaps most similar to our distant supervision algorithm is the effective method of Wu and Weld (2007) who extract relations from a Wikipedia page by using supervision from the page&#8217;s infobox.
    Unlike their corpus-specific method, which is specific to a (single) Wikipedia page, our algorithm allows us to extract evidence for a relation from many different documents, and from any genre.
  
  
    Following the literature, we use the term &#8216;relation&#8217; to refer to an ordered, binary relation between entities.
    We refer to individual ordered pairs in this relation as &#8216;relation instances&#8217;.
    For example, the person-nationality relation holds between the entities named &#8216;John Steinbeck&#8217; and &#8216;United States&#8217;, so it has (John Steinbeck, United States) as an inst
