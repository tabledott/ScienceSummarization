ng a dictionary.
    It remains to be seen whether weights in the dictionary can be exploited (Smith [2001] suggests that empirically estimated joint translation probabilities for word pairs are not useful).
    We suggest that the incorporation of scores from information retrieval (e.g., inverse document frequency) might be useful in discerning which lexicon entries are the strongest cues of translational equivalence.
    We also have not explored any filtering on the noisy translation lexicon; doing so might improve the quality of the tsim score.
    The competitive linking approximation (which, without weights, is essentially random matching of word pairs) and the use of only the initial portion of each document provide significant computational savings.
    In our experience, neither of these has significantly hurt the performance of tsim-based classifiers (as compared to finding the maximum cardinality bipartite matching and/or using the full documents), and in some cases competitive linking seems to imp
