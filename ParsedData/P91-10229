he partial traceback technique described by Brown, Spohrer, Hochschild, and Baker , [Brown et al., 1982], the time required can be made linear in the length of the sequences, and the space can be made constant.
    Even so, the computational demand is severe since, in places, the two corpora are out of alignment by as many as 90,000 sentences owing to mislabelled or missing files.
    This first pass renders the data as a sequence of sections between aligned major anchors.
    In the second pass, we accept or reject each section in turn according to the population of minor anchors that it contains.
    Specifically, we accept a section provided that, within the section, both corpora contain the same number of minor anchors in the same order.
    Otherwise, we reject the section.
    Altogether, we reject about 10% of the data in each corpus.
    The minor anchors serve to divide the remaining sections into subsections that range in size from one sentence to several thousand sentences and average about ten sen
