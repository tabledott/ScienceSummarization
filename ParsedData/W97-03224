 in a sample where each observation has q features.
    This data is represented in a N xN dissimilarity matrix such that the value in cell (i, j), where i represents the row number and j represents the column, is equal to the number of features in observations i and j that do not match.
    For example, in Figure 1 we have four observations.
    We record the values of three nominal features for each observation.
    This sample can be represented by the 4 x 4 dissimilarity matrix shown in Figure 2.
    In the dissimilarity matrix, cells (1,2) and (2,1) have the value 2, indicating that the first and second observations in Figure 1 have different values for two of the three features.
    A value of 0 indicates that observations i and j are identical.
    When clustering our data, each observation is represented by its corresponding row (or column) in the dissimilarity matrix.
    Using this representation, observations that fall close together in feature space are likely to belong to the same class and are g
