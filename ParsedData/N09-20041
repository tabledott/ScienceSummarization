esult in critical misunderstandings of the essential meaning of the original input language sentences &#8211; who did what to whom, for whom or what, how, where, when, and why.
    Semantic role confusions are errors of adequacy rather than fluency.
    It has often been noted that the dominance of lexically-oriented, precisionbased metrics such as BLEU (Papineni et al. 2002) tend to reward fluency more than adequacy.
    The length penalty in the BLEU metric, in particular, is only an indirect and weak indicator of adequacy.
    As a result, SMT work has been driven to optimize systems such that they often produce translations that contain significant role confusion errors despite reading fluently.
    The present work is inspired by the question of whether we can improve translation utility via a strategy of favoring semantic adequacy slightly more &#8211; possibly at the expense of slight degradations in lexical fluency.
    Shallow semantic parsing models have attained increasing levels of accuracy in rec
