are completely confusable if we are equally as likely to see w2 in a given context as we are to see w1 in that context.
			Jaccard?s coefficient (Salton and McGill,1983) calculates the proportion of features be longing to either word that are shared by both words.
			In the simplest case, the features of a word are defined as the contexts in which it has been seen to occur.
			simja+mi is a variant (Lin, 1998) in which the features of a word are thosecontexts for which the pointwise mutual infor mation (MI) between the word and the context is positive, where MI can be calculated usingI(c, w) = log P (c|w)P (c) . The related Dice Coeffi cient (Frakes and Baeza-Yates, 1992) is omitted here since it has been shown (van Rijsbergen, 1979) that Dice and Jaccard?s Coefficients are monotonic in each other.
			Lin?s Measure (Lin, 1998) is based on his information-theoretic similarity theorem, whichstates, ?the similarity between A and B is measured by the ratio between the amount of in formation needed to state the co
