    For the space A of bijective alignments, problems &#163; and O have long been suspected of being NP-hard, first asserted but not proven in Marcu and Wong (2002).
    We give a novel proof that O is NP-hard, showing that D is NP-complete by reduction from SAT, the boolean satisfiability problem.
    This result holds despite the fact that the related problem of finding an optimal matching in a weighted bipartite graph (the ASSIGNMENT problem) is polynomialtime solvable using the Hungarian algorithm.
    A reduction proof of NP-completeness gives a construction by which a known NP-complete problem can be solved via a newly proposed problem.
    From a SAT instance, we construct a weighted sentence pair for which alignments with positive score correspond exactly to the SAT solutions.
    Since SAT is NPcomplete and our construction requires only po
