ted, it is a dependency tree, that is, a directed tree rooted at the node 0.
    It is worth noting that any dependency forest can be turned into a dependency tree by adding arcs from the node 0 to all other roots.
  
  
    A dependency graph G = (V, A) is projective if and only if, for every arc (i, l,j) E A and node k E V, if i &lt; k &lt; j or j &lt; k &lt; i then there is a subset of arcs {(i, l1, i1), (i1, l2,i2), ... (ik&#8722;1, lk, ik)} E A such that ik = k. In a projective dependency graph, every node has a continuous projection, where the projection of a node i is the set of nodes reachable from i in the reflexive and transitive closure of the arc relation.
    This corresponds to the ban on discontinuous constituents in orthodox phrase structure representations.
    We call this condition PROJECTIVITY.
    When discussing PROJECTIVITY, we will often use the notation i &#8594;* j to mean that j is reachable from i in the reflexive and transitive closure of the arc relation.
