    Pas&#184;ca and Dienes (2005) use as their input corpus a very large collection of Web documents taken from the repository of documents crawled by Google.
    Although using Web documents as input data does require a non-trivial pre-processing phase since such documents tend to be noisier, there are certainly advantages to the use of Web documents as the input corpus: It does not require parallel (or even comparable) documents and can allow leveraging of even larger document collections.
    In addition, the extracted paraphrases are not tied to any specific domain and are suitable for general application.
    Algorithm 1 shows the details of the induction process.
    Steps 3&#8211;6 extract all n-grams of a specific kind from each sentence: Each n-gram has Lc words at the beginning, between M1 to M2 words in the middle, and another Lc words at the end.
    Steps 7&#8211;13 can intuitively be interpreted as constructing a textual anchor A&#8212;by concatenating a fixed number of words from the left and
