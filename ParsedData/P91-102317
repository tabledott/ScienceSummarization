ed with respect to the judge's responses.
    That is, for each of the &amp;quot;matches&amp;quot; that the primary judge found, we report the program as correct if it found the &amp;quot;match&amp;quot; and incorrect if it didn't.
    This convention allows us to compare performance across different algorithms in a straightforward fashion. handled correctly.
    In addition, when the algorithm assigns a sentence to the 1-0 category, it is also always wrong.
    Clearly, more work is needed to deal with the 1-0 category.
    It may be necessary to consider language-specific methods in order to deal adequately with this case.
    We observe that the score is a good predictor of performance, and therefore the score can be used to extract a large subcorpus which has a much smaller error rate.
    By selecting the best scoring 80% of the alignments, the error rate can be reduced from 4% to 0.7%.
    In general, we can trade off the size of the subcorpus and the accuracy by setting a threshold, and rejecting align
