s.
    Finally, those features are combined under the maximum entropy framework, yielding p(a, b).
    Contextual predicates are functions that check for the presence or absence of useful information in a context b and return true or false accordingly.
    The comprehensive guidelines, or templates, for the contextual predicates of each tree building procedure are given in table 3.
    The templates use indices relative to the tree that is currently being modified.
    For example, if the current tree is the 5th tree, cons(-2) looks at the constituent label, head word, and start/join annotation of the 3rd tree in the forest.
    The actual contextual predicates are generated automatically by scanning the derivations of the trees in the manually parsed corpus with the templates.
    For example, an actual contextual predicate based on the template cons(0) might be &amp;quot;Does cons(0) ={ NP, he } ?&amp;quot; Constituent head words are found, when necessary, with the algorithm in (Magerman, 1995).
