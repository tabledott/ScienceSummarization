icle, we evaluate the quality of this Viterbi alignment by comparing it to a manually produced reference alignment.
    The parameters of the statistical alignment models are optimized with respect to a maximum-likelihood criterion, which is not necessarily directly related to alignment quality.
    Such an approach, however, requires training with manually defined alignments, which is not done in the research presented in this article.
    Experimental evidence shows (Section 6) that the statistical alignment models using this parameter estimation technique do indeed obtain a good alignment quality.
    In this paper, we use Models 1 through 5 described in Brown, Della Pietra, Della Pietra, and Mercer (1993), the hidden Markov alignment model described in Vogel, Ney, and Tillmann (1996) and Och and Ney (2000), and a new alignment model, which we call Model 6.
    All these models use a different decomposition of the probability Pr(fJ1,aJ1  |eI1).
