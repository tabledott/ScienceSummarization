sized target word with the smallest distance from a translation in any of the bridge languages.
    We also tested one alternative dist-rank which uses ranks (as described above) to break ties in the distance-based method, with similar performance.
    In Table 6, we present the results obtained by applying different combination algorithms for the pathway from English to Portuguese using one of the other Romance languages (Spanish, Italian, French, and Romanian) as bridges and compare with the single best path (English-Spanish-Portuguese).
    These results are presented for unrestricted matching on the full dictionary lexicon (1097 words in each language)2.
    This is a more difficult task than that used for direct induction (selecting between 100 and 900 potential translation candidates for each sourcelanguage word), so the system's performance is lower than the Section 3 results.
    Since all available dictionaries are incomplete, it is difficult to decide which set of English words to compare against.
