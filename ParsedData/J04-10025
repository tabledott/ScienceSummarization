 domain-specific corpora are obtained from the Internet.
    In this context, a domain is a set of related concepts, and a domain-specific corpus is a set of documents relevant to those concepts.
    CorMet&#8217;s input parameters are two domains between which to search for interconcept mappings and, for each domain, a set of characteristic keywords.
    CorMet is tested on its ability to find a subset of the Master Metaphor List (Lakoff, Espenson, and Schwartz 1991), a manually compiled catalog of metaphor.
    CorMet works on domains that are specific and concrete (e.g., the domain of finance, but not that of actions).
    CorMet&#8217;s discrimination is relatively coarse: It measures trends in selectional preferences across many documents, so common mappings are discernible.
    CorMet considers the selectional preferences only of verbs, on the theory that they are generally more selectively restrictive than nouns or adjectives.
    It is worth noting that WordNet, CorMet&#8217;s primary knowledge source
