 the LCFRS's, discussed in Section 2, we can define the relationship between a structure and the sequence of substrings it spans, and the effect of the composition operations on sequences of substrings.
    A derived structure will be mapped onto a sequence zi of substrings (not necessarily contiguous in the input), and the composition operations will be mapped onto functions that can defined as follows3. f((zi,&#8226; &#8226; &#8226; , zni), (m.,&#8226; &#8226; &#8226; ,Yn3)) = (Z1, &#8226; &#8226; &#8226; , Zn3) where each z, is the concatenation of strings from z,'s and yk's.
    The linear and nonerasing assumptions about the operations discussed in Section 4.1 require that each z, and yk is used exactly once to define the strings zi, ,z1,3.
    Some of the operations will be constant functions, corresponding to elementary structures, and will be written as f () = zi), where each z, is a constant, the string of terminal symbols al an,,,.
    This representation of structures by substrings and the composit
