.
    An example is seen in Figure 2.
    The SMT first pass translation has an ARG0 National Development Bank of Japan in the capital market which is badly mismatched to both the input sentence&#8217;s &#36164;* r J &#22330;.
    The second pass ends up re-ordering the constituent phrase corresponding to the mismatched ARGM-LOC, of Japan in the capital market, to follow the PRED issued, where the new English semantic parse now assigns most of its words the correctly matched ARGM-LOC semantic role label.
    Similarly, samurai bonds 30 billion yen is re-ordered to 30 billion yen samurai bonds.
  
  
    To our knowledge, this is a first result demonstrating that shallow semantic parsing can improve translation accuracy of SMT models.
    We note that accuracy here was measured via BLEU, and it has been widely observed that the negative impacts of semantic predicate-argument errors on the utility of the translation are underestimated by evaluation metrics based on lexical criteria such as BLEU.
