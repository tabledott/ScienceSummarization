n paths.
    Usually, it is not enough to consider the best path of a word lattice.
    It is also necessary to correct the best path approximation by considering the n best paths, where the value of n depends on the task considered.
    Notice that in case n is very large, one would need to consider, for the lattice in Figure 18, all 83 million paths.
    The transducer contains 106 states and 359 transitions.
    Determinization applies to this lattice.
    The resulting transducer W2 (Figure 19) is sparser.
    Recall that it is equivalent to W1, realizing exactly the same function mapping strings to weights.
    For a given sentence s recognized by WI, there are many different paths with different total weights.
    W2 contains a path labeled with s and with a total weight equal to the minimum of the weights of the paths of W1.
    Let us insist on the fact that no pruning, heuristic, or approximation has been used here.
    The lattice W2 only contains 18 paths.
    Obviously, the search stage in speech
