	A Discriminative Framework For Bilingual Word Alignment
		Bilingual word alignment forms the foun dation of most approaches to statisticalmachine translation.
		Current word align ment methods are predominantly based on generative models.
		In this paper, we demonstrate a discriminative approachto training simple word alignment mod els that are comparable in accuracy tothe more complex generative models nor mally used.
		These models have the theadvantages that they are easy to add fea tures to and they allow fast optimization of model parameters using small amounts of annotated data.
	
	
			Bilingual word alignment is the first step of most current approaches to statistical machine translation.Although the best performing systems are ?phrase based?
			(e.g, Och and Ney, 2004), possible phrasetranslations are normally first extracted from wordaligned bilingual text segments.
			The standard approach to word alignment makes use of various com binations of five generative models developed at IBM by Brown et a
