ce substantially, for example allowing the system to detect ALL CAPS regions.
    Table 3 shows an example of a local decision for Grace in the context at Grace Road, using all of the features defined to date.
    Note that the evidence against Grace as a name completely overwhelms the -gram and word preference for PERSON.
    Other features included secondprevious and second-next words (when the previous or next words were very short) and a marker for capitalized words whose lowercase forms had also been seen.
    The final system also contained some simple error-driven postprocessing.
    In particular, repeated sub-elements (usually last names) of multi-word person names were given type PERSON, and a crude heuristic restoration of B- prefixes was performed.
    In total, this final system had an F-score of 92.31% on the English development set.
    Table 4 gives a more detailed breakdown of this score, and also gives the results of this system on the English test set, and both German data sets.
