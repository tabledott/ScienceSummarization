    Training a classifier using this data provides a breadth of features that, while it does not perform to the state-of-the-art, could function independent of domain, topic and time.
  
  
    In this section, we describe experiments we have carried out to determine the influence of domain, topic and time on machine learning based sentiment classification.
    The experiments use our own implementation of a Naive Bayes classifier and Joachim&#8217;s (1999) 5VMlight implementation of a Support Vector Machine classifier.
    The models were trained using unigram features, accounting for the presence of feature types in a document, rather than the frequency, as Pang et al. (2002) found that this is the most effective strategy for sentiment classification.
    When training and testing on the same set, the mean accuracy is determined using three-fold crossvalidation.
    In each case, we use a paired-sample t-test over the set of test documents to determine whethe
