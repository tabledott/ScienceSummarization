ar formalisms based on the encoding of grammatical information in complex-valued feature systems enjoy some currency both in linguistics and natural-languageprocessing research.
    Such formalisms can be thought of by analogy to context-free grammars as generalizing the notion of nonterminal symbol from a finite domain of atomic elements to a possibly infinite domain of directed graph structures of a certain sort.
    Many of the surface-based grammatical formalisms explicitly defined or presupposed in linguistics can be characterized in this way e.g., lexi &#8226;.
