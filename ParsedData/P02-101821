re accurately than the pattern-matcher described here (although the pattern-matching algorithm does quite well on these constructions), but this classifier&#8217;s performance averaged over all empty node types was approximately the same as the pattern-matching algorithm.
    As a comparison of tables 3 and 4 shows, the pattern-matching algorithm&#8217;s biggest weakness is its inability to correctly distinguish co-indexed NP * (i.e., NP PRO) from free (i.e., unindexed) NP *.
    This seems to be a hard problem, and lexical information (especially the class of the governing verb) seems relevant.
    We experimented with specialized classifiers for determining if an NP * is co-indexed, but they did not perform much better than the algorithm presented here.
    (Also, while we did not systematically investigate this, there seems to be a number of errors in the annotation of free vs. co-indexed NP * in the treebank).
    There are modications and variations on this algorithm that are worth exploring in future wo
