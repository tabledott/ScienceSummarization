supervision given to the learning process is the dictionary, which in a realistic scenario, contains only part of the word types observed in the corpus to be tagged.
    Unsupervised POS tagging has been traditionally approached with relative success (Merialdo, 1994; Kupiec, 1992) by HMM-based generative models, employing EM parameters estimation using the Baum-Welch algorithm.
    However, as recently noted 'This work is supported in part by the Lynn and William Frankel Center for Computer Science. by Banko and Moore (2004), these works made use of filtered dictionaries: dictionaries in which only relatively probable analyses of a given word are preserved.
    This kind of filtering requires serious supervision: in theory, an expert is needed to go over the dictionary elements and filter out unlikely analyses.
    In practice, counts from an annotated corpus have been traditionally used to perform the filtering.
    Furthermore, these methods require rather comprehensive dictionaries in order to perform well
