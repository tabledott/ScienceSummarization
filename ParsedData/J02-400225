er: there are fewer sentences from which to choose, making it easier to agree on which ones to select.
    Sentence selection from scientific texts also requires more background knowledge, thus importing an even higher level of subjectivity into sentence selection experiments.
    Recently, researchers have been looking for more objective definitions of relevance.
    Kupiec, Pedersen, and Chen (1995) define relevance by abstract similarity: A sentence in a document is considered relevant if it shows a high level of similarity to a sentence in the abstract.
    This definition of relevance has the advantage that it is fixed (i.e., the researchers have no influence over it).
    It relies, however, on two assumptions: that the writing style is such that there is a high degree of overlap between sentences in the abstract and in the main text and that the abstract is indeed the target output that is most adequate for the final task.
    In our case, neither assumption holds.
    First, the experiments in Teufel
