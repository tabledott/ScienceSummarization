mprovement of 0.60 and a LAS improvement of 0.51.
    For Czech, we get the best TLAS with k = 3 and &#945; = 0.2, where POS improves by 0.06 and LAS by 0.46.
    For English, the best setting is k = 2 and &#945; = 0.1 with a POS improvement of 0.17 and a LAS improvement of 0.62.
    For German, finally, we see the greatest improvement with k = 3 the updated scores later reported due to some improvements of the parser.
    Rows 3&#8211;4: Baseline (k = 1) and best settings for k and &#945; on development set.
    Rows 5&#8211;6: Wider beam (b1 = 80) and added graph features (G) and cluster features (C).
    Second beam parameter b2 fixed at 4 in all cases. and &#945; = 0.3, where POS improves by 0.66 and LAS by 0.86.
    Table 2 shows the results on the CoNLL 2009 test sets.
    For all languages except English, we obtain state-of-the-art results already with bi = 40 (row 4), and for all languages both tagging and parsing accuracy improve compared to the baseline (row 3).
    The improvement in TLAS is statis
