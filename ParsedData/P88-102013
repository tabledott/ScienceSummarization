f text (at the lowest level, between two clauses; at the highest level, between two parts that make up a paragraph)' .
    Therefore, each relation has two parts, a nucleus and a satellite.
    To determine the applicability of the relation, each part has a set of constraints on the entities that can be related.
    Relations may also have requirements on the combination of the two parts.
    In addition, each relation has an effect field, which is intended to denote the conditions which the speaker is attempting to achieve.
    In formalizing these relations and using them generatively to plan paragraphs, rather than analytically to describe paragraph structure, a shift of focus is required.
    Relations must be seen as plans &#8212; the operators that guide the search through the permutation space.
    The nucleus and satellite constraints become requirements that must be met by any piece of text before it can be used in the relation (i.e., before it can be coherently juxtaposed with the preceding text).
