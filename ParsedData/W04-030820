odes are enumerated, but only with respect to the order in which arcs are enumerated; the first algorithm is arc-standard while the second is arc-eager.
    One of the observations made by Abney and Johnson (1991), is that arc-eager strategies for context-free parsing may sometimes require less space than arcstandard strategies, although they may lead to an increase in local ambiguities.
    It seems that the advantage of the arc-eager strategy for dependency parsing with respect to structure (1) in Figure 4 can be explained along the same lines, although the lack of nonterminal nodes in dependency graphs means that there is no corresponding increase in local ambiguities.
    Although a detailed discussion of the relation between context-free parsing and dependency parsing is beyond the scope of this paper, we conjecture that this may be a genuine advantage of dependency representations in parsing.
  
  
    In order to measure the degree of incrementality achieved in practical parsing, we have evaluated a pa
