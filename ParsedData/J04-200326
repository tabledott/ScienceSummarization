nctions hm(x), and the expectation of each feature hm over the model p is required to be equal to the observed expectation.
    The maximum-entropy model can be shown to be unique and to have an exponential form involving a weighted sum over the feature functions hm (Ratnaparkhi 1997).
    In equation (5), the notation tn0 is used again for the lemma-tag representation of an input word (this was denoted by T in equations (2)&#8211;(4) for notational simplicity): where &#923; = {Am} is the set of model parameters with one weight Am for each feature function hm.
    These model parameters can be trained using converging iterative training procedures like the ones described by Darroch and Ratcliff (1972) or Della Pietra, Della Pietra, and Lafferty (1995).
    In the experiments presented in this article, the sum over the word forms f&#732; and the readings &#732;tn0 in the denominator of equation (5) is restricted to the readings of word forms having the same base form and partial reading as a word form f&amp;qu
