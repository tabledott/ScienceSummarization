ter describe how language is actually used in practice: &amp;quot;For the first time, a dictionary has been compiled by the thorough examination of representative group of English texts, spoken and written, running to many millions of words.
    This means that in addition to all the tools of the conventional dictionary makers... the dictionary is based on hard, measureable evidence.&amp;quot; [Cobuild, p. xv] It is likely that there will be more and more research projects collecting larger and larger corpora.
    A reliable parts program might greatly enhance the value of these corpora to many of these researchers.
    The program uses a linear time dynamic programming algorithm to find an assignment of parts of speech to words that optimizes the product of (a) lexical probabilities (probability of observing part of speech i given word j), and (b) contextual probabilities (probability of observing part of speech i given k previous parts of speech).
    Probability estimates were obtained by training on the T
