le (qt,q2,%,q4) where qt,q2,q.l,qi E Q Let (qt,%,q.~,q4) be mare)tinted with a node X in (~.
  Let us assume that a is an auxiliary tree, and that X is an ancestor of the foot node of a. and hence, the ancestor of the foot node of any derived tree "r in D(a).
  Let Y be the label of the root and foot nodes of (~.
  If the frontier of 7 (T in D(o)) is w t w 2 Y w s w 4, and the frontier of the snbtree of rooted at Z, which corresponds to the node X in a is w= Y w~.
  The idea of amso~iating (qt,q~,q3,q~) with X is that it must be the case that 6?
  (qz, w~) =- q~, and ~(q~, w=) =, qs.
  When ~ becomes a part of the seutenti ~I tree ~" whose frontier is given by u w I w 2 v w s w4 w, then it must be the case that 6*(q~, v) == cut.
  Following this remmoing, we must make q= == q~, if Z is not the ancestor of the foot node of % or if "~ is in D(o) for some initial tree (~ in G. We have assumed here, as in the case of the parting algorithm presenf~ed earlier, that =ny node in ~y  elementary tree has ~tmost two chi
