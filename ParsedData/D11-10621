    Cross-lingual Textual Entailment (CLTE) has been recently proposed by (Mehdad et al., 2010; Mehdad et al., 2011) as an extension of Textual Entailment (Dagan and Glickman, 2004).

    the availability of large quantities of annotated data is an enabling factor for systems development and evaluation.
    Until now, however, the scarcity of such data on the one hand, and the costs of creating new datasets of reasonable size on the other, have represented a bottleneck for a steady advancement of the state of the art.
    In the last few years, monolingual TE corpora for English and other European languages have been created and distributed in the framework of severa
