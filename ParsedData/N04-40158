) for a suffix and Pr(tagE|tagA) and Pr(tagE|prefixi_tagik, stemtagA) for a prefix is a positive indicator that the Arabic prefix/suffix has an independent counterpart in English.
    If the overlap is weak or doesn&#8217;t exist, the prefix/suffix is unlikely to have an independent counterpart and is subject to merge/deletion analysis.3 Step 1: For each tagA, select the top 3 most probable tagE from Pr(tagE|tagA).
    Step 2: Partition all prefixi_tagik and suffixj_tagjk into two groups in each stemtagA context.
    Group I: At least one of &#8216;tagE|tagik&#8217; or &#8216;tagE|tagjk&#8217; occurs as one of the top 3 most probable translation pairs in Pr(tagE|tagA).
    Prefixes and suffixes in this group are likely to have their independent counterparts in English.
    Group II: None of &#8216;tagE|tagik&#8217; or &#8216;tagE|tagjk&#8217; occurs as one of the top 3 most probable translation pairs in Pr(tagE|tagA).
    Prefixes and suffixes in this group are unlikely to have their independent counterparts
