rpus, which uses Penn II treebank tree representations in which each preterminal node's parent's category is appended onto its own label, consists of the trees (A4) with relative frequency f and the trees (B4) with relative frequency 1 &#8212;f.
    The PCFG P4 is estimated from this corpus.
    As mentioned in Section 1, another way of relaxing the independence assumptions implicit in a PCFG model is to systematically encode more information in node labels about their context.
    This subsection explores a particularly simple kind of contextual encoding: the label of the parent of each nonroot nonpreterminal node is appended to that node's label.
    The labels of the root node and the terminal and preterminal nodes are left unchanged.
    For example, assuming that the Penn II format trees (A1) and (B1) of Section 4.1 are immediately dominated by a node labeled S, this relabeling applied to those trees produces the trees (A4) and (B4) depicted in Figure 7.
    We can perform the same theoretical analysis o
