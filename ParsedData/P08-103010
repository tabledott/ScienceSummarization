p N (N=25 in this paper3) related documents.
    We construct an INDRI query from the triggers and arguments, each weighted by local confidence and frequency in the test document.
    For each argument we also add other names coreferential with or bearing some ACE relation to the argument.
    For each related document r returned by INDRI, we repeat the within-sentence event extraction and cross-sentence inference procedure, and get an expanded event mention set EMSett +r .
    Then we apply
  
  
    The central idea of inference is to obtain document-wide and cluster-wide statistics about the frequency with which triggers and arguments are associated with particular types of events, and then use this information to correct event and argument identification and classification.
    For a set of event mentions we tabulate the following document-wide and cluster-wide confidence-weighted frequencies: coreferential with or related to the argument, the frequency of the event type and role.
