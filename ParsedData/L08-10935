event summarization phase extracting the collocations related to the seed collocations found in a specific time duration.
			The most important part in the preprocessing phase is collocation extraction.
			We retrieve the collocations from the sentences in blog posts.
			The candidates are two terms within a window size.
			Due to the size of candidates, we have to identify the set of tracking terms for further analysis.
			In this paper, those candidates containing stopwords or with low change of temporal mutual information are removed.
			In the event detection phase, we detect events by using the peak of temporal mutual information in time dimension.
			However, the regular pattern of temporal mutual information may cause problems to our detection.
			Therefore, we remove the regular pattern by seasonal index, and then detect the plausible events by measuring the unusual peak of temporal mutual information.
			If a topic is suddenly discussed, the relationship between the related terms will become higher.
