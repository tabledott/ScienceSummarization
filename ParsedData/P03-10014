    Berland and Charniak (1999) extract &#8220;part-of&#8221; relations between lexical items in text, achieving only 55% accuracy with their method.
    Finally, Mann (2002) describes a method for extracting instances from text that takes advantage of part of speech patterns involving proper nouns.
    Mann reports extracting 200,000 concept-instance pairs from 1GB of Associated Press text, only 60% of which were found to be legitimate descriptions.
    These studies indicate two distinct problems associated with using patterns to extract semantic information from text.
    First, the patterns yield only a small amount of the information that may be present in a text (the Recall problem).
    Second, only a small fraction of the information that the patterns yield is reliable (the Precision problem).
  
  
    Our approach follows closely from Mann (2002).
    However, we extend this work by directly addressing the two problems stated above.
    In order to address the Recall problem, we extend the lis
