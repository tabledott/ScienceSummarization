e of the most important factors determining parsing accuracy.
    Various recent attempts have been made to include non-local features into graph-based dependency parsing (Smith and Eisner, 2008; Martins et al., 2009; Koo and Collins, 2010).
    Transitionbased parsing, by contrast, can easily accommodate arbitrarily complex representations involving nonlocal features.
    Complex non-local features, such as bracket matching and rhythmic patterns, are used in transition-based constituency parsing (Zhang and Clark, 2009; Wang et al., 2006), and most transitionbased dependency parsers incorporate some nonlocal features, but current practice is nevertheless to use a rather restricted set of features, as exemplified by the default feature models in MaltParser (Nivre et al., 2006a).
    We explore considerably richer feature representations and show that they improve parsing accuracy significantly.
    In standard experiments using the Penn Treebank, our parser gets an unlabeled attachment score of 92.9%, which is
