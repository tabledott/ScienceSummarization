following way: To select the correct Universal Grammar out of a set of proposed Universal Grammars {UG}, given corpora for a range of human languages, select that UG for which the sum of the sizes of the grammars for all of the corpora is the smallest.
    It does not follow&#8212;it need not be the case&#8212;that the grammar of English (or German, etc.) selected by the winning UG is the shortest one of all the candidate English grammars, but the winning UG is all-round the supplier of the shortest grammars around the world.m MDL could be formulated in those terms, undoubtedly, but it also can be formulated in a language-particular fashion, which is how it has been used in this paper.
    Generative grammar is inherently universalist; it has no language-particular format, other than to say that the best grammar for a given language is the shortest grammar.
    But we know that such a position is untenable, and it is precisely out of that knowledge that MDL was born.
    The position is untenable because we c
