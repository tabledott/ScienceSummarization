ready present in the dialogue.
    In addition, natural dialogue participants often fail to make clear to their partners what their goals are.
    This makes it very difficult to develop a reliable coding scheme for complete game structure.
    The game coding scheme simply records those aspects of embedded structure that are of the most interest.
    First, the beginning of new games is coded, naming the game's purpose according to the game's initiating move.
    Although all games begin with an initiating move (possibly with a READY move prepended to it), not all initiating moves begin games, since some of the initiating moves serve to continue existing games or remind the partner of the main purpose of the current game again.
    Second, the place where games end or are abandoned is marked.
    Finally, games are marked as either occurring at top level or being embedded (at some unspecified depth) in the game structure, and thus being subservient to some top-level purpose.
