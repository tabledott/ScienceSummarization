s is the preferred parse in the treebank, we compute the accuracy on this sentence as 1/m.
  Since our approach of defining the probability of anal- yses using derivation trees is different from the tradi- tional approach of learning PCFG grammars from phrase structure trees, a comparison of the two is probably in order.
  We tested the model PCFG-GP defined over the corresponding phrase structure trees and its average ac- curacy was 65.65% which is much lower than the accu- racy of the same model over derivation trees (71.73%).
  This result suggests that the information about grammar constructions is very helpful for parse disambiguation.
