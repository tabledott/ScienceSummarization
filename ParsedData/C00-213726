by at least; (64.1%-49.5%).
  N:om (Noreen, 1989, Sec.
  aA.a), the significance level (probability under the null hypothesis) is at most (.,e + 1)/(,~t + 1), where ,,.
  : is the nul~lt/er of trials that meet the criterion alld 1t, t is the number of trials.
  So fbr recall, the significance level is at most (96+1)/(1048576+1) =0.00009.
  952 Similarly, for F-score, the significance level is at most 0.
  ()1 d: and for l)re(:ision, the level is at lllOSt 0.025.
  A secon(l 1048576 trial t)ro(luces imilar results, as does a sign test on recall.
  lhus, we see that all three dit[ere.n(:es are statistically sig- lfiIica.nt.

  Tlmt is, knowing how a method l)(rforms on one test sot sanlple should not give any information on how that method  ] )e l  for l l ls  on  other test set samples.
  This assulnl)tJon is not always true.
