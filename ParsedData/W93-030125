 vertical scales). the quality of bilingual concordances (as in Figure 1).
    Indeed, using bilingual concordances which are based on word_align's output, the translators at AT&amp;T Language Line Services are now producing bilingual terminology lexicons at a rate of 60-100 terms per hour!
    This is compared with the previous rate of about 30 terms per hour using char_al:gn's output, and an extremely lower rate before alignment tools were available.
  
  
    Compared with other word alignment algorithms (Brown et al., 1993; Gale and Church, 1991a), word_align does not require sentence alignment as input, and was shown to produce useful alignments for small and noisy corpora.
    Its robustness was achieved by modifying Brown et al. 's Model 2 to handle an initial &amp;quot;rough&amp;quot; alignment, reducing the number of parameters and introducing a dependency between alignments of adjacent words.
    Taking the output of char_align as input, word_align produces significantly better, wordlevel, alignment
