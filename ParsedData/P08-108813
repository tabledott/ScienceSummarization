section, we explore feature representations of word types in our model.
    Recall that f&#65533;(&#183;) and fT (&#183;) map source and target word types to vectors in RdS and RdT, respectively (see section 2).
    The features used in each representation are defined identically and derived only from the appropriate monolingual corpora.
    For a concrete example of a word type to feature vector mapping, see figure 2.
    For closely related languages, such as English and Spanish, translation pairs often share many orthographic features.
    One direct way to capture orthographic similarity between word pairs is edit distance.
    Running EDITDIST (see section 4.3) on ENES-W yielded 61.1 p0.33, but precision quickly degrades for higher recall levels (see EDITDIST in table 1).
    Nevertheless, when available, orthographic clues are strong indicators of translation pairs.
    We can represent orthographic features of a word type w by assigning a feature to each substring of length G 3.
