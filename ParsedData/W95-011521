one heuristic says that the order of ideas in a sentence is not likely to change during translation.
    So, it aimed to minimize crossing partitions, as shown in Figure 4.
    If word A matches word e, and word D matches words c and g, then D is paired with g, so that when the sentences are written one above the other, the lines connecting the matching words do not cross.
    Between French and English, this heuristic works quite well, except when it comes to the order between nouns and adjectives.
    The baseline lexicon has correct entries only for the most likely translation and for the second most likely translation.
    The POS Filter throws out nouns and pronouns, and makes room for &amp;quot;high&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;vast.&amp;quot; The Word Alignment Filter removes enough noise to capture &amp;quot;high,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;vast,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;giant,&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;extensive&amp;quot; all at once.
