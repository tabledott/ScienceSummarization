 will be nearly the same in the two texts.
    We have found that it can even work on some texts in English and Japanese such as the AWK manual, because many of the technical terms (e.g., awk, BEGIN, END, getline, print, printf) are the same in both texts.
    We have also found that it can work on electronic texts in the same markup language, but different alphabets (e.g., English and Russian versions of 5ESS &#174; telephone switch manuals, formatted in toff).
    Figures 8 and 9 below demonstrate the cognate property using a scatter plot technique which we call dotplots (Church and Helfman, to appear).
    The source text (Nx bytes) is concatenated to the target text (Ny bytes) to form a single input sequence of Nx+Ny bytes.
    A dot is placed in position i,j whenever the input token at position i is the same as the input token at position j.
    (The origin is placed in the upper left corner for reasons that need not concern us here.)
    Various signal processing techniques are used to compress dotplots
