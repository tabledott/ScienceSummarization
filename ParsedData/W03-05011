ble headlines from speech broadcasts.
    In contrast to original newspaper headlines, which are often intended only to catch the eye, our approach produces informative abstracts describing the main theme or event of the newspaper article.
    We claim that the construction of informative abstracts requires access to deeper linguistic knowledge, in order to make substantial improvements over purely statistical approaches.
    In this paper, we present our technique for producing headlines using a parse-and-trim approach based on the BBN Parser.
    As described in Miller et al. (1998), the BBN parser builds augmented parse trees according to a process similar to that described in Collins (1997).
    The BBN parser has been used successfully for the task of information extraction in the SIFT system (Miller et al., 2000).
    The next section presents previous work in the area of automatic generation of abstracts.
    Following this, we present feasibility tests used to establish the validity of an approach tha
