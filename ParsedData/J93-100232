include BAR and CASE?
    It will be difficult for the grammar writer to make such substitutions in a consistent way, and still more difficult to make them in an optimal way for the purposes of LR parsing, since both steps involve consideration and comparison of all the categories mentioned in each rule of the grammar.
    Ted Briscoe and John Carroll Generalized Probabilistic LR Parsing Constructing the LR parse table directly and automatically from a unification grammar would avoid these drawbacks.
    In this case, the LR parse table would be based on complex categories, with unification of complex categories taking the place of equality of atomic ones in the standard LR parse table construction algorithm (Osborne 1990; Nakazawa 1991).
    However, this approach is computationally prohibitively expensive: Osborne (1990:26) reports that his implementation (in HP Common Lisp on a Hewlett Packard 9000/350) takes almost 24 hours to construct the LR(0) states for a unification grammar of just 75 productions.
