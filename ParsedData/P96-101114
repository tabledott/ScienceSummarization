    The trees in (12a&#8212;b) will be considered equivalent because they specify the same &amp;quot;recipe,&amp;quot; shown in (12c).
    No matter what lexical interpretations f,g,h,k are fed into the leaves A/B, B/C/D, D/E, E/F, both the trees end up with the same derived interpretation, namely a model element that can be determined from f,g,h,k by calculating AxAy.f(g(h(k(x)))(y)).
    By contrast, the two readings of &amp;quot;softly knock twice&amp;quot; are considered to be distinct, since the parses -+ specify different recipes.
    That is, given a suitably Q fit NF T NF(a) free choice of meanings for the words, the two parses 131 /32 132 7 can be made to pick out two different VP-type func- This construction resembles a well-known normaltions in the model.
