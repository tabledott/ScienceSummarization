    Table 3 illustrates an example of actual classification.
    For the input sentence &#8220;&#28082;&#26230;&#12364;&#22823;&#12365;&#12367;&#12390;, &#32186;&#40599;, &#35211;&#12420;&#12377;&#12356; (The LCD is large, beautiful, and easy to see.
    )&#8221;, the system outputs the features applied to this classification along with their weights wt.
    This information allows us to analyze how the system classifies the input sentence in a category and what kind of features are used in the classification.
    We cannot perform these analyses with tree kernel, since it defines their feature space implicitly.
    The testing speed of our Boosting algorithm is much higher than that of SVMs with tree kernel.
    In the PHS task, the speeds of Boosting and SVMs are 0.531 sec./5,741 instances and 255.42 sec./5,741 instances respectively 6.
    We can say that Boosting is about 480 times faster than SVMs with tree kernel.
    Even though the potential
