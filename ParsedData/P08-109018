 In this section we extend the model to learn a partial temporal ordering of the events.
    There are a number of algorithms for determining the temporal relationship between two events (Mani et al., 2006; Lapata and Lascarides, 2006; Chambers et al., 2007), many of them trained on the TimeBank Corpus (Pustejovsky et al., 2003) which codes events and their temporal relationships.
    The currently highest performing of these on raw data is the model of temporal labeling described in our previous work (Chambers et al., 2007).
    Other approaches have depended on hand tagged features.
    Chambers et al. (2007) shows 59.4% accuracy on the classification task for six possible relations between pairs of events: before, immediately-before, included-by, simultaneous, begins and ends.
    We focus on the before relation because the others are less relevant to our immediate task.
    We combine immediately-before with before, and merge the other four relations into an other category.
    At the binary task of deter
