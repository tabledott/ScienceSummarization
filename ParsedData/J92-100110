constrain the various combinations of a role, its holder, and the filler.
    For example, the preposition from prefers referring to the SOURCE role; transfers, such as give, prefer to have a DESTINATION role; and instances of colors, such as red, prefer to fill a COLOR role.
    Approaches based on the word disambiguation model tend to apply constraint satisfaction techniques to combine these role preferences (Hirst 1987).
    Preferences based on role-related expectations are often only a weak cue because they are primarily for verbs and not normally very restrictive.
    Although generally a weak cue, role-related preferences are quite valuable for the disambiguation of prepositions.
    In our view, prepositions should be treated essentially the same as other words in the lexicon.
    The meaning of a preposition either names a relation directly, as one of its core senses (Hirst [1987] also allows this), or indirectly, as a specialized sense triggered, for example, by a collocation or concretion.
