.&#8221; This likelihood can be learned by simply counting how often we see a given path in text with an initial Noun and a final pronoun that are from the same/different gender/number classes.
    Cases such as &#8220;John needs her support&#8221; or &#8220;They need his support&#8221; are much more frequent in text than cases where the subject noun and pronoun terminals agree in gender/number.
    When there is agreement, the terminal nouns are likely to be coreferent.
    When they disagree, they refer to different entities.
    After a sufficient number of occurrences of agreement or disagreement, there is a strong statistical indication of whether the path is coreferent (terminal nouns tend to refer to the same entity) or non-coreferent (nouns refer to different entities).
    We show that including path coreference information enables significant performance gains on three third-person pronoun resolution experiments.
    We also show that coreferent paths can provide the seed information for bootstrappi
