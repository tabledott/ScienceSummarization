    In this Hebrew word combination, the correct sense of qatann is necessarily 'small.'
    However, the relation that was observed in the corpus was 'young prospect,' relating to the human sense of 'prospect' that appeared in sports articles (a promising young person).
    This borrowed sense of 'prospect' is necessarily inappropriate, since in Hebrew it is represented by the equivalent of 'hope' (tiqwa) and not by sikkuy.
    The source of this problem is Assumption 3: a target tuple T might be a translation of several source tuples, and while gathering statistics for T, we cannot distinguish between the different sources, since we use only a target language corpus.
    A possible solution is to use an aligned bilingual corpus, as suggested by Sadler (1989), Brown et al. (1991), and Gale et al.
    (1992a).
    In such a corpus the occurrences of the relation 'young prospect' will be aligned to the corresponding occurrences of the Hebrew word tiqwa and will not be used whe
