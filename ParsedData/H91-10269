  Two Possible Problems with the EM Algorithm This paper is primarily concerned with the task of identifying word correspondences.
  There is relatively little discussion of this topic in Brown et al.
  although a brief mention of the EM algorithm is made.
  We decided to look for an alternative estimation algorithm for two reasons.
  First, their procedure appears to require a prohibitive amount of memory.
  We observed that they limited the sizes of the English and French vocabularies, V E and V e, respectively, to just 9000 words each.
  Having constrained the vocabularies in this way, there were a mere 81 million parameters to estimate, all of which could be squeezed into memory at the same time.
  However, if the two vocabularies are increased to a more realistic size of 106 words, then there are 10 TM parameters to estimate, and it is no longer practical to store all of them in memory.
  (Apparently, in some more recent unpublished work (Brown, personal communication), they
