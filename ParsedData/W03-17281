re unknown to our tagger.
    With this problem fixed, the results of the official test data are compatible with the results on However, we have withdrawn our segmentation results on the Beijing University corpus. corpus R P F AS 0.961 0.958 0.959 0.729 0.966 HK 0.917 0.915 0.916 0.670 0.936 Table 3: Official Bakeoff Outcome 4 Conclusions and Future Work Our closed track experiments on the first Sighan Bakeoff data show that the LMR algorithm produces promising results.
    Our system ranks the second when tested on the Academia Sinica corpus and third on the Hong Kong City University corpus.
    In the future, we will try to incorporate a large word list into our tagger to test its performance on open track experiments.
    Its high accuracy on makes it a good candidate as a general purpose segmenter.
