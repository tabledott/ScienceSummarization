ased upon combinatorial statistics.
    This algorithm operates entirely from left to right, and has no inherent limit upon the number of consecutive ambiguities which may be processed.
    Its authors report an accuracy of 96-97%.
    However, CLAWS falls prey to other problems.
    First, the probabilistic system has been augmented in several ways, such as by pre-tagging of categorially troublesome &amp;quot;idioms&amp;quot; (this feature contributes 3% towards the total accuracy).
    Second, it was not based upon the most complete statistics available.
    Third, and perhaps most significant, it requires non-polynomially large time and space.
    The algorithm developed here, called VOLSUNGA, addresses these problems.
    First, the various additions to CLAWS (i.e., beyond the use of two-place probabilities and RTPs) have been deleted.
    Second, the program has been calibrated by reference to 100% instead of 20% of the Brown Corpus, and has been applied to the entire Corpus for testing.
