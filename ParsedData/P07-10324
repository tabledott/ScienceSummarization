for a gold standard (Carroll et al., 1998).
    Also, using the same resource for training and testing may result in the parser learning systematic errors which are present in both the training and testing material.
    An example of this is from CCGbank (Hockenmaier, 2003), where all modifiers in noun-noun compound constructions modify the final noun (because the Penn Treebank, from which CCGbank is derived, does not contain the necessary information to obtain the correct bracketing).
    Thus there are nonnegligible, systematic errors in both the training and testing material, and the CCG parsers are being rewarded for following particular mistakes.
    There are parser evaluation suites which have been designed to be formalism-independent and which have been carefully and manually corrected.
    Carroll et al. (1998) describe such a suite, consisting of sentences taken from the Susanne corpus, annotated with Grammatical Relations (GRs) which specify the syntactic relation between a head and dependent.
