) eliminates from the alignment the English word at position (or ) and links the French words generated by (or ) to (or ).
    In a stepwise fashion, starting from the initial gloss, the greedy decoder iterates exhaustively over all alignments that are one operation away from the alignment under consideration.
    At every step, the decoder chooses the alignment of highest probability, until the probability of the current alignment can no longer be improved.
    When it starts from the gloss of the French sentence &#8220;Bien entendu, il parle de une belle victoire.&#8221;, for example, the greedy decoder alters the initial alignment incrementally as shown in Figure 2, eventually producing the translation &#8220;Quite naturally, he talks about a great victory.&#8221;.
    In the process, the decoder explores a total of 77421 distinct alignments/translations, of which &#8220;Quite naturally, he talks about a great victory.&#8221; has the highest probability.
    We chose the operation types enumerated above fo
