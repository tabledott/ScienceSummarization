    Since we were to combine the filtered MTurk data with the expert data to obtain more significant differences, it was reasonable to use agreement with experts to quantify the MTurk workers&#8217; competency.
    However, we also would like to know whether it is feasible to use the MTurk data alone.
    Our aim here is not to boost the differences we see by examining expert data, but to eliminate our reliance on obtaining expert data in the first place.
    We briefly examined some simple ways of filtering/combining the MTurk data, and measured the Spearman rank correlations obtained from the MTurk data (alone), as compared to the rankings obtained using the expert data (alone), and report them in Table 12.
    (These correlations do not include the references.)
    We first see that even when using the MTurk data untouched, we already obtain relatively high correlation with expert ranking (&#8220;Unfiltered&#8221;).
    This is especially true for the *-to-English language pairs, where we collected much mo
