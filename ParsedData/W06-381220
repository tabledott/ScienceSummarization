of 53% on word type as reported by Sch&#252;tze (1995) on a related task.
    How to use this kind of word clusters to improve the accuracy of POS-taggers is outlined in (Ushioda, 1996).
    The task of word sense induction (WSI) is to find the different senses of a word.
    The number of senses is not known in advance, therefore has to be determined by the method.
    Similar to the approach as presented in (Dorow and Widdows, 2003) we construct a word graph.
    While there, edges between words are drawn iff words co-occur in enumerations, we use the cooccurrence graph.
    Dorow and Widdows construct a graph for a target word w by taking the sub-graph induced by the neighborhood of w (without w) and clustering it with MCL.
    We replace MCL by CW.
    The clusters are interpreted as representations of word senses.
    To judge results, the methodology of (Bordag, 2006) is adopted: To evaluate word sense induction, two sub-graphs induced by the neighborhood of different words are merged.
