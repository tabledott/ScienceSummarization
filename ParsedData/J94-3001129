together represent the desired interpretation of the original, and each of them is properly modeled by exactly one variant of the Coerce relation.
    We have now dealt with the major complexities that surface coercion rules present.
    The compound forms of these rules are quite easy to model.
    A rule of the form is interpreted as coercing to the surface side of 7 if any of the context conditions are met.
    Auxiliary symbols are not needed to model this interpretation, since there is no iteration to introduce overlap difficulties.
    The relation for this rule is given simply by the intersection of the individual relations: nCoerce(r, )k We conclude our discussion of two-level rules with a brief mention of surface prohibitions.
    Recall that a prohibition rule
  
  
    indicates that a paired substring must not belong to r if it comes between instances of A and p and its lexical side is in the domain of T. We can construct a standard surface coercion rule that has exactly this interpretation by usi
