sociated with an inferential mechanism; or (4) use the classical AI definition of entailment and build models of the world in which the two texts are respectively true, and then check whether the models associated with one text are included in the models associated with the other text.
    Although we believe that each of these methods should be investigated fully, we decided to focus only on the first method, which allowed us to build the TE system illustrated in Figure 2.
    Our TE system consists of (1) a Preprocessing Module, which derives linguistic knowledge from the text pair; (2) an Alignment Module, which takes advantage of the notions of lexical alignment and textual paraphrases; and (3) a Classification Module, which uses a machine learning classifier (based on decision trees) to make an entailment judgment for each pair of texts.
    As described in (Hickl et al., 2006), the Preprocessing module is used to syntactically parse texts, identify the semantic dependencies of predicates, label named en
