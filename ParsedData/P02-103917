tions, and the explicit zero-fertility word insertion produced more garbage than expected words.
    To verify that the pruning was effective, we relaxed the pruning threshold and checked the decoding coverage for the first 92 sentences of the test data.
    Table 2 shows the result.
    On the left, the r-table pruning was relaxed from the 95% level to 98% or 100%.
    On the right, the t-table pruning was relaxed from the top-5 (,) pairs to the top-10 or top-20 pairs.
    The system r95 and w5 are identical to syn-nozf in Table 1.
    When r-table pruning was relaxed from 95% to 98%, only about half (47/92) of the test sentences were decoded, others were aborted due to lack of memory.
    When it was further relaxed to 100% (i.e., no pruning was done), only 20 sentences were decoded.
    Similarly, when the t-table pruning threshold was relaxed, fewer sentences could be decoded due to the memory limitations.
    Although our decoder performed better than the if , and LP if , where , , is the system output l
