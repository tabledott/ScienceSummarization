 the effect of the pruning parameter tp with the histogram pruning parameter Np = 50,000.
    Tables 6 and 7 show the effect of the pruning parameter Np with the pruning parameter tp = 10&#8722;12.
    In all four tables, we provide the results for using no heuristic functions and three variants of an increasingly informative heuristic function.
    The first is an estimate of the alignment template and the lexicon probability (AT+WRD), the second adds an estimate of the language model (+LM) probability, and the third also adds the alignment probability (+AL).
    These heuristic functions are described in Section 5.6.
    Without a heuristic function, even more than a hundred seconds per sentence cannot guarantee search-error-free translation.
    We draw the conclusion that a good heuristic function is very important to obtaining an efficient search algorithm.
    In addition, the search errors have a more severe effect on the error rates if we do not use a heuristic function.
    If we compare the error ra
