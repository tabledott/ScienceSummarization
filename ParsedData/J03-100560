e GE reordering is smaller.
    Table 9 shows the effect of the cardinality pruning threshold t, on mWER when no coverage pruning is carried out (a histogram coverage pruning of 1,000 is applied to restrict the overall size of the search space).
    The cardinality threshold t, has a strong effect on mWER, which decreases significantly as the cardinality threshold t, increases.
    For the GE reordering constraint, mWER decreases from 48.5% to 24.9%; for the S3 reordering constraint, mWER decreases from 51.4% to 28.2%.
    For the coverage threshold t = 15.0, the GE constraint works about four times as fast as the S3 constraint, since the overall search space for the S3 constraint is much larger.
    Although the overall search space is much larger for the S3 constraint, for smaller values of the coverage threshold tc &#8804; 5.0, the S3 constraint works as fast as the GE constraint or even faster, because only a very small portion of the overall search space is searched for small values of the cardinality pr
