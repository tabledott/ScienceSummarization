r in Figure 1(a), giving the alignment in Figure 1(b).
			On top of these features, we included other kinds of information, such as word-similarityfeatures designed to capture cognate (and ex act match) information.
			We added a feature forexact match of words, exact match ignoring accents, exact matching ignoring vowels, and frac tion overlap of the longest common subsequence.
			Since these measures were only useful for long words, we also added a feature which indicatesthat both words in a pair are short.
			These or thographic and other features improved AER to14.4.
			The running example now has the align ment in Figure 1(c), where one improvement may be attributable to the short pair feature ? it has stopped proposing the-de, partially because the short pair feature downweights the score of that pair.
			A clearer example of these features making a difference is shown in Figure 2, whereboth the exact-match and character overlap fea 3The learned response was in fact close to a Gaussian, but harsher near
