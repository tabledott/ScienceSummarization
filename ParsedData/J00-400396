 must have the same head, and no new information can be introduced by the definite; but this rule is violated fairly frequently in our corpus.
    This criticism is not new: In 1983, it was already recognized that an anaphoric full noun phrase may include some new and unshared information about a previously mentioned entity (Grosz, Joshi, and Weinstein 1983), and Carter (1987) weakened some of the restrictions proposed by Sidner in his system.
    Carter's Shallow Processing Anaphor Resolver.
    Carter (1987) implemented a modified version of Sidner's algorithm and integrated it with an implemented version of Wilks' theory of commonsense reasoning.
    This work is interesting for two reasons: first of all, because Carter, unlike Sidner, attempted to evaluate the performance of his system; and because, in doing so, he addressed the commonsense reasoning problem in some detail.
    Carter's system, SPAR, is based on the Shallow Processing Hypothesis: that in resolving anaphors, reasoning should be avoided as
