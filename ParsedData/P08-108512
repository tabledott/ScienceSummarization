d RELc &#8838; C is a set of reliable contexts, defined below. allow(t, w) is a binary function indicating whether t is a valid tag for w. p(c|w) and p(w|c) are estimated via raw corpus counts.
    Intuitively, we estimate the probability of a tag given a context as the average probability of a tag given any of the words appearing in that context, and similarly the probability of a tag given a word is the averaged probability of that tag in all the (reliable) contexts in which the word appears.
    At each round, we define RELc, the set of reliable contexts, to be the set of all contexts in which p(t|c) &gt; 0 for at most X different ts.
    The method is general, and can be applied to different languages.
    The parameters to specify for each language are: the initial estimation p(t|w), the estimation of the allow relation for known and OOV words, and the types of contexts to consider.
  
  
    In Hebrew, several words combine into a single token in both agglutinative and fusional ways.
    This results in
