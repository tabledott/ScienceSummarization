    In principle, using Altavista queries for the candidate generation stage should enable STRAND to locate every page pair in the Altavista index that meets the search criteria.
    This likely to be an upper bound on the candidates that can be obtained without building a Web crawler dedicated to the task, since one of Altavista's distinguishing features is the size of its index.
    In practice, however, the user interface for Altavista appears to limit the number of hits returned to about the first 1000.
    It was possible to break this barrier by using a feature of Altavista's &amp;quot;Advanced Search&amp;quot;: including a range of dates in a query's selection criteria.
    Having already redesigned the STRAND generation component to permit multiple queries (in order to allow search for both parent and sibling pages), each query in the query set was transformed into a set of mutually exclusive queries based on a one-day range; for example, one version of a query would restrict the
