ce of alignments a, b(a), b2(a) b(b(a)), .

    ., converges in a finite number of steps to an alignment that we write as bc&#176; (a).
    Similarly, if ij is pegged for a, the sequence of alignments a, Notice that Op is the fertility of the word in position i' for alignment a.
    The fertility of this word in alignment a' is 0,, + 1.
    Similar equations can be easily derived when either i or i' is zero, or when a and a' differ by a swap.
    We leave the details to the reader.
    With these preliminaries, we define S by S = Ar(r)(V(fl e; 2))) U V (fle; 2))).
    (44) In this equation, we use b&#176;&#176;(V(f le; 2)) and lf&#176; j(V,-1 (f le; 2)) as handy approximations to V(f le; 3) and Vi&#8212;j(f le; 3), neither of which we are able to compute efficiently.
    In one iteration of the EM algorithm for Model 3, we compute the counts in Equations (34)&#8212;(38), summing only over elements of S, and then use these counts in Equations (39)&#8212;(42) to obtain a new set of parameters.
