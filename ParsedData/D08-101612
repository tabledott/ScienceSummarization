her variables.
    Loopy BP works not with random samples but their expectations.
    Hence it is approximate but tends to converge much faster than Gibbs sampling will mix.
    It is convenient to visualize an undirected factor graph (Fig.
    1), in which each factor is connected to the variables it depends on.
    Many factors may connect to&#8212;and hence influence&#8212;a given variable such as L34.
    If X is a variable or a factor, N(X) denotes its set of neighbors.
    Given an input sentence W and a parameter vector &#952;, the collection of factors Fm defines a probability distribution (1).
    The parser should determine the values of the individual variables.
    In other words, we would like to marginalize equation (1) to obtain the distribution p(L34) over L34 = true vs. false, the distribution p(T4) over tags, etc.
    If the factor graph is acyclic, then BP computes these marginal distributions exactly.
    Given 8Or, more precisely&#8212;this is the tricky part&#8212;based on versions of th
