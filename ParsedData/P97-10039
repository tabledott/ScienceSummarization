plements to its right.
    NP-C(Marks) is immediately generated as the required subject, and NP-C is removed from LC, leaving it empty when the next modifier, NP (week) is generated.
    The incorrect structures in figure 4 should now have low probability because Pic({NP-C , NP-C} I S , VP ,bought) and P&#8222;({NP-C ,VP-C} I VP , VB , was) are small.
    Another obstacle to extracting predicate-argument structure from parse trees is wh-movement.
    This section describes a probabilistic treatment of extraction from relative clauses.
    Noun phrases are most often extracted from subject position, object position, or from within PPs: It might be possible to write rule-based patterns which identify traces in a parse tree.
    However, we argue again that this task is best integrated into the parser: the task is complex enough to warrant a probabilistic treatment, and integration may help parsing accuracy.
    A couple of complexities are that modification by an SBAR does not always involve extraction (e.g., &
