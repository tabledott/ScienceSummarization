  The derivation tree t br our deriva- tion is shown in Figure 3.
  As can be seen, this structure is a dependency tree and resembles a representation of lexical argument structure.
  aoshi (1987b) claims that TAGs properties make it particularly suited as a syntactic rep- resentation tbr generation.
  Specifically, its ex- tended domain of locality is useflfl in genera- tion tbr localizing syntactic properties (includ- ing word order as well as agreement and other morphological processes), and lexicalization is useful tbr providing an interfime from seman- tics (the deriw~tion tree represent the sentences predicate-argument structure).
  Indeed, LTAG has been used extensively in generation, start- ing with (McDonald and Pustejovsky, 1985).
  1Sentences such as Peter is a doctor can be analyzed with with be as the head, as is more usual, or with doctor as the head, as is done in XTAG 1)eeause the be really behaves like an auxili
