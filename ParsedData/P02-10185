 no label refers to a &#8220;compound&#8221; type of empty structure labelled SBAR consisting of an empty complementizer and an empty (moved) S (thus SBAR is really a nonterminal label rather than a part of speech); a typical example is shown in Figure 3.
    As might be expected the distribution is highly skewed, with most of the empty node tokens belonging to just a few types.
    Because of this, a system can provide good average performance on all empty nodes if it performs well on the most frequent types of empty nodes, and conversely, a system will perform poorly on average if it does not perform at least moderately well on the most common types of empty nodes, irrespective of how well it performs on more esoteric constructions.
    This section describes the pattern-matching algorithm in detail.
    In broad outline the algorithm can 21 of the Penn Treebank (there are approximately 64,000 empty nodes in total).
    The &#8220;label&#8221; column gives the terminal label of the empty node, the &#8220;PO
