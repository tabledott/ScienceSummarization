The model is wholly unmodified from the English version except that the suffix features are removed since, in Chinese, suffixes are not a reliable indicator of part-of-speech as in English (Tseng et al., 2005).
    Since we did not have access to a large auxiliary unlabeled corpus that was segmented, our distributional model was built only from the treebank text, and the distributional similarities are presumably degraded relative to the English.
    On 60K word tokens, BASE gave an accuracy of 34.4, PROTO gave 39.0, and PROTO+SIM gave 57.4, similar in order if not magnitude to the English case.
    We believe the performance for Chinese POS tagging is not as high as English for two reasons: the general difficulty of Chinese POS tagging (Tseng et al., 2005) and the lack of a larger segmented corpus from which to build distributional models.
    Nonetheless, the addition of distributional similarity features does reduce the error rate by 35% from BASE.
    We tested our framework on the CLASSIFIEDS data descri
