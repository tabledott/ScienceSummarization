			Smoothing is per formed only for zero frequency events, in which case the classifier backs off to more general models by omittingfirst the features TOP.LEFT and LOOK and then the fea tures TOP.RIGHT and NEXT.LEFT; if even this does not help, the classifier predicts Reduce if permissible and Shift otherwise.
			This model, which we will refer to as the MCLE model, is described in more detail in Nivre (2004).
			3.2 Data.
			It is standard practice in data-driven approaches to nat ural language parsing to use treebanks both for training and evaluation.
			Thus, the Penn Treebank of American English (Marcus et al, 1993) has been used to train and evaluate the best available parsers of unrestricted English text (Collins, 1999; Charniak, 2000).
			One problem whendeveloping a parser for Swedish is that there is no com parable large-scale treebank available for Swedish.
			For the experiments reported in this paper we have used a manually annotated corpus of written Swedish, create
