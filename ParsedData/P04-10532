    We defined a relation broadly as an affiliation, role, location, part-whole, social relationship and so on between a pair of entities.
    For example, if the sentence, &#8220;George Bush was inaugurated as the president of the United States.&#8221; exists in documents, the relation, &#8220;George Bush&#8221;(PERSON) is the &#8220;President of&#8221; the &#8220;United States&#8221; (GPEI), should be extracted.
    In this paper, we propose an unsupervised method of discovering relations among various entities from large text corpora.
    Our method does not need the richly annotated corpora required for supervised learning &#8212; corpora which take great time and effort to prepare.
    It also does not need any instances of relations as initial seeds for weakly supervised learning.
    This is an advantage of our approach, since we cannot know in advance all the relations embedded in text.
    Instead, we only need a named entity (NE) tagger to focus on the named entities which should be the argume
