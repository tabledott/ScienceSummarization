omparison, we also show the human ratings for these items (UpperBound).
    Here, we are interested in relative differences, since the two types of ratings correspond to different scales.
    Model similarities have been estimated using cosine which ranges from 0 to 1, whereas our subjects rated the sentences on a scale from 1 to 7.
    The simple additive model fails to distinguish between High and Low Similarity items.
    We observe a similar pattern for the non compositional baseline model, the weighted additive model and Kintsch (2001).
    The multiplicative and combined models yield means closer to the human ratings.
    The difference between High and Low similarity values estimated by these models are statistically significant (p &lt; 0.01 using the Wilcoxon rank sum test).
    Figure 3 shows the distribution of estimated similarities under the multiplicative model.
    The results of our correlation analysis are also given in Table 2.
    As can be seen, all models are significantly correlated with
