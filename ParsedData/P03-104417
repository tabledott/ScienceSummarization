 experiment the behaviour of the learner of the &#8220;Legal Action&#8221; scenario is shown in Figure 2.
    The test corpus for this learner consists of 250 documents: the 100 MUC-6 training documents and 150 WSJ documents which we retrieved using a set of keywords and categorized manually.
    The curves labeled Mono, Counter and Baseline are as in the preceding figure.
    We observe that the counter-training termination point is near the mono-trained curve, and has a good recall-precision trade-off.
    However, the improvement from counter-training is less pronounced here than for the Succession scenario.
    This is due to a subtle interplay between the combination of scenarios, their distribution in the corpus, and the choice of seeds.
    We return to this in the next section.
  
  
    Although the results we presented here are encouraging, there remains much research, experimentation and theoretical work to be done.
  
  
    When a learner runs in isolation, it is in a sense undergoing &#8220;mono
