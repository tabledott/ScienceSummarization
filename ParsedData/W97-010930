overing the 51 most common prepositions.
    The induced decision trees are relatively shallow and the classification of unseen sentences is rapid.
    As shown in the following table, our algorithm appears to have surpassed many existing methods and is very close to human performance on the same testing data13.
    The fact that many words in both the training and the testing sets were not found in WordNet caused a reduction in the accuracy.
    This is because training examples with an error or with a word not found in WordNet could not fully participate on the decision tree induction.
    This reduced the original training set of 20801 quadruples to 17577.
    In the case of the testing set, many of the 3097 testing quadruples were also handicapped by having no entry in WordNet.
    Attachment of these had to be based on a partial quadruple and was usually assigned at a higher level of the decision tree, which reduced the overall accuracy.
    In order to conduct a fair comparison, however, we used the sam
