apturing differences in domain- and modelsizes.
			The recallfor the TRUE class indeed jumps to 0.735.
			Al though, unavoidably, the FALSE class suffers, the resulting overall accuracy (0.562, see Column 4 in Table 1) is significantly higher than when using the features provided by the theorem prover alone (as in Experiment 3).
			The confidence weighted score also rises substantially from 0.548 to 0.608.
			The approximation achieved can be seen in the differenttreatment of Example 1049 (see Section 3.5) in Ex periments 3 and 4.
			In Experiment 3, this example 3The inconsistent feature was not used by the decision tree as very few examples were covered by that feature.
