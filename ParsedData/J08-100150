reases by 4.2% on the Earthquakes corpus.
    This variation can be explained by differences in entity realization between the two domains.
    In particular, the two corpora vary in the amount of coreference they employ; texts from the Earthquakes corpus contain many examples of referring expressions that our simple identity-based approach cannot possibly resolve.
    Consider for instance the text in Table 6.
    Here, the expressions the same area, the remote region, and site all refer to Menglian county.
    In comparison, the text from the Accidents corpus contains fewer referring expressions, in fact entities are often repeated verbatim across several sentences, and therefore could be straightforwardly resolved with a shallow approach (see the pilot, the pilot, the pilot in Table 6).
    The omission of syntactic information causes a drop in accuracy for models applied to the Accidents corpus.
    This effect is less noticeable on the Earthquakes corpus (compare the performance of model Coreference+Synt
