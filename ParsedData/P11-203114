omly exchanging sentences between the two systems.
    If there is no significant difference between the systems (i.e., the null hypothesis is true), then this shuffling should not change the computed metric score.
    Crucially, this assumes that the samples being analyzed are representative of all extraneous variables that could affect the outcome of the experiment.
    Therefore, we must include multiple optimizer replications.
    Also, since metric scores (such as BLEU) are in general not comparable across test sets, we stratify, exchanging only hypotheses that correspond to the same sentence.
    Table 2 shows the p-values computed by AR, testing the significance of the differences between the two systems in each pair.
    The first three rows illustrate &#8220;single sample&#8221; testing practice.
    Depending on luck with MERT, the results can vary widely from insignificant (at p &gt; .05) to highly significant.
    The last two lines summarize the results of the test when a small number of replicat
