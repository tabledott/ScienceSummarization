 makes experiments difficult to duplicate and compare.
    In this paper, we describe Joshua, a general-purpose open source toolkit for parsing-based machine translation, serving the same role as Moses (Koehn et al., 2007) does for regular phrase-based machine translation.
    Our toolkit is written in Java and implements all the essential algorithms described in Chiang (2007): chart-parsing, n-gram language model integration, beam- and cube-pruning, and k-best extraction.
    The toolkit also implements suffix-array grammar extraction (Lopez, 2007) and minimum error rate training (Och, 2003).
    Additionally, parallel and distributed computing techniques are exploited to make it scalable (Li and Khudanpur, 2008b).
    We have also made great effort to ensure that our toolkit is easy to use and to extend.
    The toolkit has been used to translate roughly a million sentences in a parallel corpus for largescale discriminative training experiments (Li and Khudanpur, 2008a).
    We hope the release of the toolk
