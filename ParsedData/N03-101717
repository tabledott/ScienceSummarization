cal translation probability distribution .
    We estimated it by relative frequency from the same word alignments as the phrase model. count count A special English NULL token is added to each English sentence and aligned to each unaligned foreign word.
    Given a phrase pair and a word alignment between the foreign word positions and the English word positions , we compute the lexical weight by an alignment and a lexical translation probability distribution See Figure 3 for an example.
    If there are multiple alignments for a phrase pair , we use the one with the highest lexical weight: We use the lexical weight during translation as a additional factor.
    This means that the model is extended to The parameter defines the strength of the lexical weight .
    Good values for this parameter are around 0.25.
    Figure 4 shows the impact of lexical weighting on machine translation performance.
    In our experiments, we achieved improvements of up to 0.01 on the BLEU score scale.
    Again, all phrases co
