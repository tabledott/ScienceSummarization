 value of 345 and message.
    (1.13), which has a salience value of 315.
    In the corpus that we used for testing RAPSTAT, the verb&#8212;object pair send&#8212;display appears only once, whereas send&#8212;message occurs 289 times.
    As a result, message receives a considerably higher statistical score than display.
    The salience difference threshold that we used for the test is 100, and conditions (i) and (ii) hold for these two candidates.
    The difference between the salience value of message and the third element of the candidate list is greater than 100.
    Therefore, RAPSTAT correctly selects message as the antecedent of it.
    Dagan et al. (in press) report a comparative blind test of RAP and RAPSTAT.
    To construct a database of grammatical relation counts for RAPSTAT, we applied the Slot Grammar parser to a corpus of 1.25 million words of text from 48 computer manuals.
    We automatically extracted all lexical tuples and recorded their frequencies in the parsed corpus.
    We then con
