    Rule overlap features While individual rules observed in decoder output are often quite reasonable, two adjacent rules can create problems.
    For example, a rule that has a variable of type IN (preposition) needs another rule rooted with IN to fill the position.
    If the second rule supplies the wrong preposition, a bad translation results.
    The IN node here is an overlap point between rules.
    Considering that certain nonterminal symbols may be more reliable overlap points than others, we create a binary feature for each nonterminal.
    A rule like: will have feature rule-root-IN set to 1 and all other rule-root features set to 0.
    Our rule root features range over the original (non-split) nonterminal set; we have 105 in total.
    Even though the rule root features are locally attached to individual rules&#8212;and therefore cause no additional problems for the decoder search&#8212;they are aimed at problematic rule/rule interactions.
