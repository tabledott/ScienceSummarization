test sets of pseudonames and naturally occurring ambiguities.
    Figures 2/3 and 4 each have two subfigures.
    The left/top figure shows the extracted seed sets.
    The right/bottom figure shows the final clustering of the entire document collection.
    In each figure, there are three columns of information before the dendrogram.
    The first column contains high weighted document content words.
    The second column contains the extracted features from the document.
    The third column indicates the real referent.
    This is either the real name of the conflated pseudoname (e.g.
    Woody Harrelson or Miles Davis), or a number indicating the referent (e.g.
    1 - 20 in the case of Jim Clark).
    This presentation allows a quick scan of the clustering to reveal correlations.
    In general, the visualizations are informative.
    Occasionally, the extractions err.
    One time when the patterns themselves cannot be syntactically faulted comes in the case where Woody Harrelson&#8217;s wife is extract
