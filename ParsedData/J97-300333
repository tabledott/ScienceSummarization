 part-of-speech tagging process.
    Our main interest is in how the advantage of one rule set over another will affect the tagging performance.
    Therefore, we performed an evaluation of the impact of the word guessers on tagging accuracy.
    In this evaluation we used the cascading guesser with two different taggers: a c++ implemented bigram HMM tagger akin to one described in Kupiec (1992) and the rule-based tagger of Brill (1995).
    Because of the similarities in the algorithms with the LISP implemented Xerox tagger, we could directly use the Xerox guessing rule set with the HMM tagger.
    Brill's tagger came pretrained on the Brown Corpus and had a corresponding guessing component.
    This gave us a search-space of four basic combinations: the HMM tagger equipped with the Xerox guesser, the Brill tagger with its original guesser, the HMM tagger with our cascading (Prefix+Suffix&#176;+Suffixl+Ending-c*) guesser and the Brill tagger with the cascading guesser.
    We also tried hybrid tagging using
