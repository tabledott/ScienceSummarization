ntaining consistency with the fairly small (less than 100 page) style book used in the the first phase of the project.
  A NEW ANNOTATION SCHEME We have recently completed a detailed style-book for this new level of analysis, with consensus across annotators about the particulars of the analysis.
  This project has taken about eight months of ten-hour a week effort across a significant subset of all the personnel of the Penn Treebank.
  Such a stylebook, much larger, and much more fully specified than our initial stylebook, is a prerequisite for high levels of inter- annotator agreement.
  It is our hope that such a stylebook will also alleviate much of the need for extensive cross-talk between annotators during the annotation task, thereby in- creasing throughput as well.
  To ensure that the rules of this new stylebook remain in force, we are now giving annotators about 10% overlapped material to evaluate inter-annotator consistency throughout this new project.
  We have now begun to annotate this level of
