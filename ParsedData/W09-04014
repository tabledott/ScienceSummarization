    We focus on a single task since the use of multiple test sets in the past spread our resources too thin, especially in the manual evaluation.
    As in past years we provided parallel corpora to train translation models, monolingual corpora to train language models, and development sets to tune parameters.
    Some statistics about the training materials are given in Figure 1.
