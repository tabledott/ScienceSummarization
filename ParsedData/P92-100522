ssumptions may be discharged in categorial derivation correspond to the choices that the quantifier rules permit for discharging quantified terms.
    Where monotonic interpretation and categorial semantics part company is on the degree of explicitness with which semantic derivations are represented.
    In categorial semantics, derivation is a background process that builds up logical forms, but is not explicitly represented in the semantic formalism.
    By contrast, the annotation of QLFs with scope lists provides an extra level of information about how the derivations proceed.
    In particular, they indicate which evaluation rules should be applied where.
    QLF thus provides a (usually partial) specification of a semantic derivation, showing (a) what the initial 'premises' are (roughly, lexical meanings, although these too may only be partially specified), and (b) the rules by which the 'premises' are combined.
    QLF resolution amounts to further instantiating this specification.
