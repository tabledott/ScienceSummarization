um Description Length principle from classic information theory (Rissanen, 1989), which simultaneously measures the goodness of the representation and the model complexity.
    Including a model complexity term generally improves generalization by inhibiting overlearning, a problem especially severe for sparse data.
    An incremental (online) search algorithm is utilized that applies a hierarchical splitting strategy for words.
    In the second method the cost function is defined as the maximum likelihood of the data given the model.
    Sequential splitting is applied and a batch learning algorithm is utilized.
    In Section 4, we develop a method for evaluating the quality of the morph segmentations produced by the unsupervised segmentation methods.
    Even though the morph segmentations obtained are not intended to correspond exactly to the morphemes of linguistic theory, a basis for comparison is provided by existing, linguistically motivated morphological analyses of the words.
    Both segmentation
