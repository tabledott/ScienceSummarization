 forms were identi- fied and the in-document coreferences hypothe- sized, the system retrieves all possible entity disambiguations of each surface form.
  Their Wikipedia contexts that occur in the document and their category tags are aggregated into a document vector, which is subsequently compared with the Wikipedia entity vector (of categories and con- texts) of each possible entity disambiguation.
  We then choose the assignment of entities to surface forms that maximizes the similarity between the document vector and the entity vectors, as we ex- plain further.
  
  An entity e can then be represented as a vector ?e?
  
  
  {0,1}N, corre- sponding to the context and category information, respectively: 1, if ci is a context for entity e ?ei =    { 0, otherwise 1, if tj is a category tag for e ?eM+j ={ 0, otherwise.
