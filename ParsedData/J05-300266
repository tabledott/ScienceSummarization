 is an essential step of our algorithm&#8212;pairwise comparison of nonparallel trees may not provide enough information regarding their underlying correspondences.
    In fact, previous applications of multisequence alignment have been shown to increase the accuracy of the comparison in other NLP tasks (Barzilay and Lee 2002; Bangalore, Murdock, and Riccardi 2002; Lacatusu, Maiorano, and Harabagiu 2004); unlike our work these approaches operate on strings, not trees, and with the exception of (Lacatusu, Maiorano, and Harabagiu 2004), they apply alignment to parallel data, not comparable texts.
  
  
    In this article, we have presented sentence fusion, a novel method for text-to-text generation which, given a set of similar sentences, produces a new sentence containing the information common to most sentences.
    Unlike traditional generation methods, sentence fusion does not require an elaborate semantic representation of the input but instead relies on the shallow linguistic representation automatically
