or process in terms of a generative procedure that produces x1, x2,... iteratively with G marginalized out.
    This can be achieved by relating x1, x2, ... to a separate sequence of i.i.d. draws y1, y2, ... from the mean distribution G0 as follows.
    The first word x1 is assigned the value of the first draw y1 from G0.
    Let t be the current number of draws from G0 (currently t = 1), ck be the number of words assigned the value of draw yk (currently c1 = 1), and c&#183; = Etk=1 ck be the current number of draws from G. For each subsequent word xc&#183;+1, we either assign it the value of a previous draw yk with probability ck&#8722;d &#952;+c&#183; (increment ck; set xc&#183;+1 &lt; --yk), or we assign it the value of a new draw from G0 scale, with d = .5 and 0 = 1 (bottom), 10 (middle) and 100 (top).
    Second panel: same, with 0 = 10 and d = 0 (bottom), .5 (middle) and .9 (top).
    Third panel: proportion of words appearing only once, as a function of the number of words drawn, with d = .5 and 0 = 1
