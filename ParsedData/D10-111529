er they should also perform in any task that requires access to the composite meaning, and thus that the results of the current evaluation should correlate with applied performance.
    More in detail, we evaluate here the composition methods (and the adjective and noun baselines) by computing, for each of them, the cosine of the test set AN vectors they generate (the &#8220;predicted&#8221; ANs) with the 41K vectors representing our extended vocabulary in semantic space, and looking at the position of the corresponding observed ANs (that were not used for training, in the supervised approaches) in the cosine-ranked lists.
    The lower the rank, the better the approximation.
    For efficiency reasons, we flatten out the ranks after the top 1,000 neighbors.
    The results are summarized in Table 3 by the median and the other quartiles, calculated across all 26,440 ANs in the test set.
    These measures (unlike mean and variance) are not affected by the cut-off after 1K neighbors.
    To put the reported re
