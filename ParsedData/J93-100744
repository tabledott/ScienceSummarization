    In a 10 million&#8212;word corpus, with about 60,000 different words, there are about 3.6 x 109 possible bigrams, 2.16 x 1014 trigrams, and 3 x 1033 7-grams.
    This rapidly gets out of hand.
    Choueka, for example, had to stop at length six.
    In contrast, the rigid noun phrases we retrieve are of arbitrary length and are retrieved very easily and in one pass.
    The method we use starts from bigrams and produces the biggest possible subsuming n-gram.
    It is based on the fact that if an n-gram is statistically significant, then the included bigrams must also be significant.
    For example, to identify &amp;quot;The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials,&amp;quot; a traditional n-gram method would compare it to the other 7-grams and determine that it is significant.
    In contrast, we start from an included significant bigram (for example, &amp;quot;Dow-30&amp;quot;) and we directly retrieve the surrounding n-grams.'
