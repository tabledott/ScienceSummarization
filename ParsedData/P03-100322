ctoids, we reran our system C on these 24 questions and then, we used the question-factoid pairs as the only resource for both training and testing as described earlier (System D).
    Table 5 shows the MRRs for systems C and D on the 24 q It is very interesting to see that system D outperforms significantly system C. This shows that, in our framework, in order to benefit from external databases, we do not need any additional machinery (question classifiers, answer type identifiers, wrapper selectors, SQL query generators, etc.)
    All we need is a one-time conversion of external structured resources to simple natural language factoids.
    The results in Table 5 also suggest that collecting natural language factoids is a useful research direction: if we collect all the factoids in the world, we could probably achieve much higher MRR scores on the entire TREC collection.
  
  
    In this paper, we proposed a noisy-channel model for QA that can accommodate within a unified framework the exploitation of a lar
