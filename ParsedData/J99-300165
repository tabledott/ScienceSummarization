empirical studies.
    The cost-based evaluation we focused on in this section refers to evaluation criteria that form an intrinsic part of the centering model.
    As a consequence, we have redefined Rule 2 of the Centering Constraints (Grosz, Joshi, and Weinstein 1995, 215) appropriately.
    We replaced the characterization of a preference for sequences of CONTINUE over sequences of RETAIN and, similarly, sequences of RETAIN over sequences of SHIFT by one in which cheap transitions are to be preferred over expensive ones.
  
  
    Approaches to anaphora resolution based on focus devices partly use the information status of discourse entities to determine the current discourse focus.
    However, a common area of criticism of these approaches is the diversity of data structures they require.
    These data structures are likely to hide the underlying linguistic regularities, because they promote the mix of preference and data structure considerations in the focusing algorithms.
    As an example, Sidner (1
