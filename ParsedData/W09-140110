bering.
    To resolve issues related to the mapping between proteins and related entities systematically, we introduced partial static relation annotation for relations such as Part-Whole, drawing in part on similar annotation of the BioInfer corpus (Pyysalo et al., 2007).
    For details of this part of the revision process, we refer to (Pyysalo et al., 2009).
    Figure 2 shows some challenging cases.
    In (b), the site GATA motifs is not identified as an argument of the binding event, because the protein containing it is not stated.
    In (c), among the two sites (PEBP2 site and promoter) of the gene GM-CSF, only the more specific one, PEBP2, is annotated.
    Alternative names for the same object are frequently introduced in biomedical texts, typically through apposition.
    This is illustrated in Figure 3(a), where the two expressions B cell transcription factor and BSAP are in apposition and refer to the same protein.
    Consequently, in this case the following two annotations represent the same e
