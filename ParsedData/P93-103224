 adjusted for higher recall, even at the expense of lower precision.
    When a seemingly incorrect subcategorization frame is listed, the lexicographer could then ask for the cues that led to the postulation of this frame, and proceed to verify or dismiss the examples presented.
    A final question is the applicability of the methods presented here to other languages.
    Assuming the existence of a part-of-speech lexicon for another language, Kupiec's tagger can be trivially modified to tag other languages (Kupiec 1992).
    The finite state parser described here depends heavily on the fairly fixed word order of English, and so precisely the same technique could only be employed with other fixed word order languages.
    However, while it is quite unclear how Brent's methods could be applied to a free word order language, with the method presented here, there is a clear path forward.
    Languages that have free word order employ either case markers or agreement affixes on the head to mark arguments.
