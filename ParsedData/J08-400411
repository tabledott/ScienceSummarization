kappa, such as percentage agreement with an expert and percentage agreement with the majority; see Carletta (1996) for discussion and criticism.3 All of the coefficients of agreement discussed in this article correct for chance on the basis of the same idea.
    First we find how much agreement is expected by chance: Let us call this value Ae.
    The value 1 &#8722; Ae will then measure how much agreement over and above chance is attainable; the value Ao &#8722; Ae will tell us how much agreement beyond chance was actually found.
    The ratio between Ao &#8722; Ae and 1&#8722; Ae will then tell us which proportion of the possible agreement beyond chance was actually observed.
    This idea is expressed by the following formula.
    The three best-known coefficients, S (Bennett, Alpert, and Goldstein 1954), 7r (Scott 1955), and x (Cohen 1960), and their generalizations, all use this formula; whereas Krippendorff&#8217;s &#945; is based on a related formula expressed in terms of disagreement (see Section 2.6)
