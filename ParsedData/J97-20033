practice (Aho, Sethi, and Ullman 1986).
    Finite automata now also constitute a rich chapter of theoretical computer science (Perrin 1990).
    Their recent applications in natural language processing, which range from the construction of lexical analyzers (Silverztein 1993) and the compilation of morphological and phonological rules (Kaplan and Kay 1994; Karttunen, Kaplan and Zaenen 1992) to speech processing (Mohri, Pereira, and Riley 1996) show the usefulness of finite-state machines in many areas.
    In this paper, we provide theoretical and algorithmic bases for the use and application of the devices that support very efficient programs: sequential transducers.
    We extend the idea of deterministic automata to transducers with deterministic input, that is, machines that produce output strings or weights in addition to (deterministically) accepting input.
    Thus, we describe methods consistent with the initial reasons for using finite-state machines, in particular the time efficiency of determinist
