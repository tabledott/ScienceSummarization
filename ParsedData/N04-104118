    Each of these instances will generate incorrect hyponyms such as grape is wine and milk chocolate is wine.
    This hyponym extraction task would likely serve well for evaluating the accuracy of lists of semantic classes.
    Table 5 shows that the hyponyms involving proper nouns are much more reliable than common nouns.
    Since WordNet contains poor coverage of proper nouns, these relationships could be useful to enrich it.
    Semantic extraction tasks are notoriously difficult to evaluate for recall.
    To approximate recall, we conducted two question answering (QA) tasks: answering definition questions and performing QA information retrieval.
    We chose the 50 definition questions that appeared in the QA track of TREC2003 (Voorhees, 2003).
    For example: &amp;quot;Who is Aaron Copland?&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;What is the Kama Sutra?&amp;quot; For each question we looked for at most five corresponding concepts in our hyponym list.
