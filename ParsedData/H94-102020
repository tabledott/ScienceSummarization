tructure.
  If at least one of the conjoined elements consists of more than one word, the coordination is made explicit.
  The example that follows shows two conjoined relative clauses; note that relative clauses are normally adjoined to the antecedent NP.
  (S (NP-SBJ Terry) (VP knew (NP (NP the person) (SBAR (SBAR (hg4NP-I who) (S (SP-SBJ T-l) (VP threw (NP the ball)))) and (SBAR (NHSP-2 who) (S (NP-SBJ T-2) (VP caught (NP i t ) ) ) ) ) ) ) Pred icate  Argument S t ructure : (hew Terry (person (and (threw *who* ba l l ) (caught *who* i t ) ) ) ) Conditional, temporal, and other such subordinate clauses, like other adjuncts, are normally attached at S-level.
  The phenomenon of gapping provides a major challenge to our attempt to provide annotation which is sufficient to allow the recovery of predicate argument for whatever structure is complete within a sentence.
  We have developed a simple notational mechanism, based on structural templates, which allows the predicate argument structure of gapped clauses
