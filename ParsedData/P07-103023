    Results on the three domains we considered indicate that, taken as an aggregate, the relations that are generated for a given domain paint a rather clear picture of the range of information pertinent to that domain.
    Moreover, all this was done using standard search engine methods on the web.
    No language-dependent tools were used (not even stemming); in fact, we reproduced many of our results using Google in Russian.
    The method depends on a number of numerical parameters that control the subtle tradeoff between quantity and quality of generated relations.
    There is certainly much room for tuning of these parameters.
    The concept and target words used in this paper are single words.
    Extending this to multiple-word expressions would substantially contribute to the applicability of our results.
    In this research we effectively disregard many relationships of an all-to-all nature.
    However, such relationships can often be very useful for ontology construction, since in many cases
