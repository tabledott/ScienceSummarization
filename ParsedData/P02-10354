f predicateargument relations in the f-structure of the parse selected by the stochastic model that match those in the gold standard annotation.
    Our parser plus stochastic disambiguator achieves 79% F-score under this evaluation regime.
    Furthermore, we employ another metric which maps predicate-argument relations in LFG fstructures to the dependency relations (henceforth the DR annotation scheme) proposed by Carroll et al. (1999).
    Evaluation with this metric measures the matches of dependency relations to Carroll et al.&#8217;s gold standard corpus.
    For a direct comparison of our results with Carroll et al.&#8217;s system, we computed an F-score that does not distinguish different types of dependency relations.
    Under this measure we obtain 76% F-score.
    This paper is organized as follows.
    Section 2 describes the Lexical-Functional Grammar, the constraint-based parser, and the robustness techniques employed in this work.
    In section 3 we present the details of the exponential mode
