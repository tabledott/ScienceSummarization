  Many users of Twitter also supply exact geographical coordinates from GPS-enabled devices (e.g., mobile phones),2 yielding geotagged text data.
    Text in computer-mediated communication is often more vernacular (Tagliamonte and Denis, 2008), and as such it is more likely to reveal the influence of geographic factors than text written in a more formal genre, such as news text (Labov, 1966).
    We evaluate our approach both qualitatively and quantitatively.
    We investigate the topics and regions that the model obtains, showing both common-sense results (place names and sports teams are grouped appropriately), as well as less-obvious insights about slang.
    Quantitatively, we apply our model to predict the location of unlabeled authors, using text alone.
    On this task, our model outperforms several alternatives, including both discriminative text regression and related latent-variable approaches.
