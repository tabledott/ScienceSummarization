l(var(1),and)), rtrace(r20,equal(var(2),and)), rtrace(r2,del(var(1),hope,and)), rtrace(r22,delb(var(0),and)).
    These rules delete the adjunct of the first conjunct (for testing), the adjunct of the second conjunct (by the end of the year), the rest of the second conjunct (Leary hopes to set requirements for a full system), and the conjunction itself (and).
    Evaluation of quality of sentence condensation systems, and of text summarization and simplification systems in general, has mostly been conducted as intrinsic evaluation by human experts.
    Recently, Papineni et al.&#8217;s (2001) proposal for an automatic evaluation of translation systems by measuring n-gram matches of the system output against reference examples has become popular for evaluation of summarization systems.
    In addition, an automatic evaluation method based on context-free deletion decisions has been proposed by Jing (2000).
    However, for summarization systems that employ a linguistic parser as an integral system component, i
