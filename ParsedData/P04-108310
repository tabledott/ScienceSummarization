he scope of this paper, however.
    The next section assumes that we have an MTG, probabilistic or not, as required by the semiring.
  
  
    A -MTG can guide a synchronous parser to infer the hidden structure of a -component multitext.
    Now suppose that we have a -MTG and an input multitext with only components, .
    When some of the component texts are missing, we can ask the parser to infer a -dimensional multitree that includes the missing components.
    The resulting multitree will cover the input components/dimensions among its dimensions.
    It will also express the output components/dimensions, along with their syntactic structures.
    Figure 5 shows Logic CT, which is a generalization of Logic C. Translator CT is any parser based on Logic CT.
    The items of Translator CT have a -dimensional label vector, as usual.
    However, their d-span vectors are only-dimensional, because it is not necessary to constrain absolute word positions in the output dimensions.
    Instead, we need only const
