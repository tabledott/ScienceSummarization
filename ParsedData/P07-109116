If no, then the entire input is treated as one single clause.
    Step 2 and step 3(a)(i) still follow the algorithm in section 4.
    Step 3(a)(ii) is trivial, but there is a subtle point about the calculation of language model score: the language model score of a translated clause is not independent from other clauses; it should take into account the last few words of the previous translated clause.
    The best translated clause T&#65533; (C0i) is selected in step 3(a)(iii) by equation 3.
    In step 4 the best translation Tj is
  
  
    Our experiments are about Chinese-to-English translation.
    The NIST MT-2005 test data set is used for evaluation.
    (Case-sensitive) BLEU-4 (Papineni et al., 2002) is used as the evaluation metric.
    The test set and development set of NIST MT-2002 are merged to form our development set.
    The training data for both reordering knowledge and translation table is the one for NIST MT-2005.
    The GIGAWORD corpus is used for training language model.
