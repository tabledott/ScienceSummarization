e overall &amp;quot;tree.&amp;quot; This metric is applied to arcs in the shortest path between nodes (word senses) to compute semantic distance.
    The hypothesis is that for a given set of terms occurring near each other in a text, choosing the senses that minimize the distance among them selects the correct senses.
    Sussna's disambiguation results are demonstrated to be significantly better than chance.
    His work is particularly interesting because it is one of the few to date that utilizes not only WordNet's IS-A hierarchy, but other relational links as well.
    Resnik (1995a) draws on his body of earlier work on WordNet, in which he explores a measure of semantic similarity for words in the WordNet hierarchy (Resnik 1993a, 1993b, 1995a).
    He computes the shared information content of words, which is a measure of the specificity of the concept that subsumes the words in the WordNet IS-A hierarchy&#8212;the more specific the concept that subsumes two or more words, the more semantically related
