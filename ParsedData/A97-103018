e pronouns, which we refer to as 'ambiguous operators'.
    In order to determine whether 'splitting' should occur, a name sequence containing an ambiguous operator is divided into three segments &#8212; the operator, the substring to its left and the substring to its right.
    The splitting process applies a set of heuristics based on patterns of capitalization, lexical features and the relative 'scope' of operators (see below) to name sequences containing these operators to determine whether or not they should be split into smaller names.
    We can describe the splitting heuristics as determining the scope of ambiguous operators, by analogy to the standard linguistic treatment of quantifiers.
    From Nominator's point of view, all three operator types behave in similar ways and often interact when they co-occur in the same name sequence, as in New York's MOMA and the Victoria and Albert Museum in London.
    The scope of ambiguous operators also interacts with the 'scope' of NP-heads, if we define the sc
