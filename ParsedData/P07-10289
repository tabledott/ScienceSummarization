us (BNC).
    For our experiments, we chose 100 frame-specific semantic roles at random, 20 each from five frequency bands: 50-100 annotated occurrences of the role, 100-200 occurrences, 200-500, 5001000, and more than 1000 occurrences.
    The annotated data for these 100 roles comprised 59,608 sentences, our primary corpus.
    To determine headwords of the semantic roles, the corpus was parsed using the Collins (1997) parser.
    Our generalization corpus is the BNC.
    It was parsed using Minipar (Lin, 1993), which is considerably faster than the Collins parser but failed to parse about a third of all sentences.
    Accordingly, the arguments r extracted from the generalization corpus are Minipar dependencies, except that paths through preposition nodes were collapsed, using the preposition as the dependency relation.
    We obtained parses for 5,941,811 sentences of the generalization corpus.
    The EM-based clustering model was computed with all of the FrameNet 1.3 data (139,439 sentences) as input.
