hors views.

    Of the AT research, only Martin's work has been implemented to my knowledge.
    Among the points raised are that metaphorical sentences exist that do not contain selection restriction violations and that metaphor requires interpretation in context.
    The much smaller metonymy literature stresses the selection restrictions view too.
    The TEAM and TACITUS systems both seem to process metonymics.
    The two main differences commonly noted between metonymy and metaphor are in their function (referential for metonymy and understanding with metaphor) and the kind of relationship established (contiguity in metonymy versus similarity in metaphor).

    In this section, the basic met* algorithm is outlined.
    The met* method is based on the selection restriction, also known as the preference.
