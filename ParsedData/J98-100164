    Earl (1973) used syntax exclusively for disambiguation in machine translation.
    In most WSD work to date, syntactic information is used in conjunction with other information.
    The use of selectional restrictions weighs heavily in AI-based work that relies on full parsing, frames, semantic networks, the application of selectional preferences, etc.
    (Hayes 1977a, 1997b; Wilks 1973 and 1975b; Hirst 1987).
