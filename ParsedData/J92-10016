al ambiguity.
    Although semantic context and selectional restrictions provide good cues to disambiguation, they are neither reliable enough, nor available quickly enough, to be used alone.
    The approach to disambiguation that we will take below combines many different, strong sources of information: syntactic tags, word frequencies, collocations, semantic context (clusters), selectional restrictions, and syntactic cues.
    The approach incorporates a number of innovations, including: Although improvements to our system are ongoing, it already interprets arbitrary text and makes coarse word sense selections reasonably well.
    (Section 6 will give some quantitative assessments.)
    No other system, to our knowledge, has been as successful.
    We will now review word sense discrimination and the determination of role relations.
    In Section 3, we discuss some sources of knowledge relevant to solving these problems, and, in Section 4, how TRUMP's semantic interpreter uses this knowledge to identify s
