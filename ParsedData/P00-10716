nt a more precise determinant for extraction.
    For the early work, it was determined that a Boolean discriminate would suffice provided that the operators AND and OR were implemented.
    It was also necessary to provide the ability to organize queries through the use of parentheses.
    We opted for the Boolean indexing as opposed to vector indexing (Buckley et al.1998) because Boolean indexing increases the recall at the expense of precision.
    That works well for us since we control the retrieval precision with the PARAGRAPH operator which provides document filtering.
    In addition, the Boolean indexing requires less processing time than vector indexing, and this becomes important when the collection size increases.
    To facilitate the identification of the document sources, the engine was required to put the document id in front of each line in the document.
    The index creation includes the following steps: normalize the SGML tags, eliminate extraneous characters, identify the words within eac
