e only operation we need of its parent distribution G&#960;(u) is to draw words from it too.
    Since G&#960;(u) is itself distributed according to a Pitman-Yor process, we can use another Chinese restaurant process to draw words from that.
    This is recursively applied until we need draws from the global mean distribution G0, which is easy since it is just uniform.
    We refer to this as the hierarchical Chinese restaurant process.
    Let us introduce some notations.
    For each context u we have a sequence of words xu1, xu2, .. . drawn i.i.d. from Gu and another sequence of words yu1, yu2, ... drawn i.i.d. from the parent distribution G&#960;(u).
    We use l to index draws from Gu and k to index the draws from G&#960;(u).
    Define tuwk = 1 if yuk takes on value w, and tuwk = 0 otherwise.
    Each word xul is assigned to one of the draws yuk from G&#960;(u).
    If yuk takes on value w define cuwk as the number of words xul drawn from Gu assigned to yuk, otherwise let cuwk = 0.
    Finally we denote
