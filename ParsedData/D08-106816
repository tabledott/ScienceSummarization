the earliest mention it contains.
    This helps break the symmetry among mentions, which otherwise produces multiple optima and makes learning unnecessarily harder.
    To encourage clustering, we impose an exponential prior on the number of non-empty clusters with weight &#8722;1.
    The above model only clusters mentions with the same head, and does not work well for pronouns.
    To address this, we introduce the predicate IsPrn(m), which is true iff the mention m is a pronoun, and adapt the head prediction rule as follows: This is always false when m is a pronoun, and thus applies only to non-pronouns.
    Pronouns tend to resolve with mentions that are semantically compatible with them.
    Thus we introduce predicates that represent entity type, number, and gender: Type(x, e!
    ), Number(x, n!
    ), Gender(x, g!
    ), where x can be either a cluster or mention, e E {Person,Organization,Location,Other}, n E {Singular,Plural} and g E {Male, Female, Neuter}.
    Many of these are known for pronouns,
