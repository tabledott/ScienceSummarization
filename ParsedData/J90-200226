anslation model that words are placed into the target sentence independently of one another.
    Clearly, a more realistic assumption must account for the fact that words form phrases in the target sentence that are translations of phrases in the source sentence and that the target words in these phrases will tend to stay together even if the phrase itself is moved around.
    We are working on a model in which the positions of the target words produced by a particular source word depend on the identity of the source word and on the positions of the target words produced by the previous source word.
    We are preparing a trigram language model that we hope will substantially improve the performance of the system.
    A useful information-theoretic measure of the complexity of a language with respect to a model is the perplexity as defined by Bahl et al. (1983).
    With the bigram model that we are currently using, the source text for our 1,000-word translation task has a perplexity of about 78.
    With the
