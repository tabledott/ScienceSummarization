alize representation f FTAG as follows.
  If we do nott consider adjoining at the node y, the formula for "y will be of the form (.. .t ,  1 Ab, A. .
  / Suppose the formula for the auxiliary tree # is of the form (t~oo~ A .
  bsoo,) tim tree obtained after adjunction at the node r I will the n be represente~ by the formula (...t, A (t,?
  bsoo,)  A N A .
  We would like to specify one formula with the tree % and use appropri- ate operation corresponding to adjunction by ~ or the case where we do not adjoin at ~.
  Imagining adjunction as function application where we~ consider auxiliary trees as functions, the representation f/3 is a function i say fz, of the form ~f .
  ( t ,oo ,  A.. .
  (blo, ,  ^  f)) To allow tile adjunetion of ~ at the node ~, we have to represent T by ( .
  t ,  A f#(bs)  ^ .
  Then, corresponding to adjunction, we use function application to obtain the required formula.
  But note that if we do not adioin at ~l, we would like to represent ")" by the formula ( .
  t ,  A b, A ~..) whi
