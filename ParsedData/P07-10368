abeled data pool.
    Part (a) of the figure shows the correct labeled assignment and part (b) shows the assignment labeled by a HMM trained on 30 labels.
    However, if we apply the constraint that state transition can occur only on punctuation marks, the same HMM model parameters will result in the correct labeling (a).
    Therefore, by adding the improved labeled assignment we can generate better training samples during semi-supervised learning.
    In fact, the punctuation marks are only some of the constraints that can be applied to this problem.
    The set of constraints we used in our experiments appears in Table 1.
    Note that some of the constraints are non-local and are very intuitive for people, yet it is very difficult to inject this knowledge into most models.
    The second problem we consider is extracting fields from advertisements (Grenager et al., 2005).
    The dataset consists of 8,767 advertisements for apartment rentals in the San Francisco Bay Area downloaded in June 2004 from the
