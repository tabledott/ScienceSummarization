e dependencies between the words of the sentence, i.e., of the predicate-argument and modification structure.
    When comparing this derivation structure to the dependency structure in Figure 2, the following problems become apparent.
    First, both adjectives depend on hotdog, while in the derivation structure small is a daughter of spicy.
    In addition, seem depends on claim (as does its nominal argument, he), and adore depends on seem.
    In the derivation structure, seem is a daughter of adore (the direction does not express the actual dependency), and claim is also a daughter of adore (though neither is an argument of the other).
    Schabes &amp; Shieber (1994) solve the first problem 'For clarity, we depart from standard TAG notational practice and annotate nodes with lexemes and arcs with grammatical function. by distinguishing between the adjunction of modifiers and of clausal complements.
    This gives us the derivation structure shown on the right in Figure 1.
    While this might provide a s
