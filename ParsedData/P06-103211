    4 A total of 24128 sentences from the news data were &#8220;lesioned&#8221; in this manner to create a set of 65826 sentence pairs.
    To create a balanced training set that would not introduce too many artifacts of the substitution (e.g., many should not always be recast as much just because that is the only mapping observed in the training data), we randomly created an equivalent number of identity-mapped pairs from the 346,000 examples, with each sentence mapping to itself.
    Training sets of various sizes up to 45,000 pairs were then randomly extracted from the lesioned and non-lesioned pairs so that data from both sets occurred in roughly equal proportions.
    Thus the 45K data set contains approximately 22,500 lesioned examples.
    An additional 1,000 randomly selected lesioned sentences were set aside for lambda training the SMT system&#8217;s ordering and replacement models.
