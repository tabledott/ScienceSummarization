sh and Slovene have parsing accuracies significantly below 80%, and these languages have relatively small training sets and/or are highly inflected with little to no word order constraints.
    Furthermore, these results show that a twostage system can achieve a relatively high performance.
    In fact, for every language our models perform significantly higher than the average performance for all the systems reported in Buchholz et al. (2006).
    For the remainder of the paper we provide a general error analysis across a wide set of languages plus a detailed error analysis of Spanish and Arabic.
  
  
    Our system has several components, including the ability to produce non-projective edges, sequential Japanese, Portuguese, Slovene, Spanish, Swedish and Turkish.
