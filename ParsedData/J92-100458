is reached, such as an upper bound on N. Whereas in the loosely coupled system the parser acts as a filter only on completed candidate solutions (Zue et al. 1991), the tightly coupled system allows the parser to discard partial theories that have no way of continuing.
    Following the Viterbi search, each partial theory is first extended by the parser to specify possible next words, which are then scored by the recognizer.
    We have not yet made use of TINA'S probabilities in adjusting the recognizer scores on the fly, but we have been able to incorporate linguistic scores to resort N-best outputs, giving a significant improvement in performance (Goodine et al. 1991).
    Ultimately we want to incorporate TINA's probabilities directly into the A* search, but it is as yet unclear how to provide an appropriate upper bound for the probability estimate of the unseen portion of the linguistic model.
    &#8226; Once a parser has produced an analysis of a particular sentence, the next step is to convert it to a
