  An Annotation Scheme For Free Word Order Languages
  
    We describe an annotation scheme and a tool developed for creating linguistically annotated corpora for non-configurational languages.
    Since the requirements for such a formalism differ from those posited for configurational languages, several features have been added, influencing the architecture of the scheme.
    The resulting scheme reflects a stratificational notion of language, and makes only minimal assumpabout the interrelation of the particu- &#8226;lar representational strata.
  
  
    The work reported in this paper aims at providing syntactically annotated corpora (treebanks') for stochastic grammar induction.
    In particular, we focus on several methodological issues concerning the annotation of non-configurational languages.
    In section 2, we examine the appropriateness of existing annotation schemes.
    On the basis of these considerations, we formulate several additional requirements.
    A formalism complying with these r
