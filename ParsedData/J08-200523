age, the classifier can also label an argument as ?null?
  (meaning ?not an argument?)
  to dis- card it.
  The features used here are the same as those used in the argument identification stage.
  However, when full parsing is available, an additional feature introduced by Xue and Palmer (2004) is used.
  
  The learning algorithm used for training the argument classifier and argument iden- tifier is a variation of the Winnow update rule incorporated in SNoW (Roth 1998; Carlson et al.
  1999), a multi-class classifier that is tailored for large scale learning tasks.
  SNoW learns a sparse network of linear functions, in which the targets (argument border predictions or argument type predictions, in this case) are represented as linear functions over a common feature space; multi-class decisions are done via a winner- take-all mechanism.
  It improves the basic Winnow multiplicative update rule with a regularization term, which has the effect of separating the data with a large margin separator (Dagan, Karov,
