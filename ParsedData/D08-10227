reordering between the two languages.
    So we say a fragmentation is well-formed with respect to an alignment if the root node of every tree fragment corresponds to a contiguous span on the target side; the intuition is that there is a &#8220;translational equivalence&#8221; between the subtree rooted at the node and the corresponding target span.
    For example, in Figure 3, each node is annotated with its corresponding English span, where the NP node maps to a noncontiguous one &#8220;Bush U with Sharon&#8221;.
    More formally, we need a precise formulation to handle the cases of one-to-many, many-to-one, and many-to-many alignment links.
    Given a sourcetarget sentence pair (u, T) with alignment a, the (target) span of node v is the set of target words aligned to leaf nodes yield(v) under node v: For example, in Figure 3, every node in the parse tree is annotated with its corresponding span below the node, where most nodes have contiguous spans except for the NP node which maps to a gapped phrase &#
