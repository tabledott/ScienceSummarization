e foreign one.
    This step of the process emphasizes recall rather than precision.
    For each foreign document, we do not attempt to find the best-matching English document, but rather a set of similar English documents.
    The subsequent components of the system are robust enough to filter out the extra noise introduced by the selection of additional (possibly bad) English documents.
    We perform document selection using the Lemur IR toolkit3 (Ogilvie and Callan 2001).
    We first index all the English documents into a database.
    For each foreign document, we take the top five translations of each of its words (according to our probabilistic dictionary) and create an English language query.
    The translation probabilities are only used to choose the word translations; they do not appear in the query.
    We use the query to run TF-IDF retrieval against the database, take the top 20 English documents returned by Lemur, and pair each of them with the foreign query document.
