re corresponding to the small red one 0 indicates that the attribute-value pair is of no assistance in singling out the intended referent.
  Given an intended referent and a set of entities from which the intended referent must be distin- guished, this notion is used to determine which set of properties should be used in building a descrip- tion which is both adequate and efficient.
  3 There remains the question of how the constituency of the set U of entities is determined: in the present work, we  take the context always to consist of the working set.
  This is the set of distinguishable enti- sstrictly speaking, this mechanism is only applicable in the form described here to those properties of an entity which are realizable by what are known as abJolute (or t~- tereect/ee or pred~tiee) adjectives (see, for example, Kamp (1975), Keenan and FaRm (1978)).
  This is acceptable in the current domain, where many of the adjectives used are derived from the verbs used to describe processes applied to entities.
