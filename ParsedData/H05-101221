 HMM algorithm and similarly MaxEnt should be rejected with a probability of 0.9e 6 over the GIZA++ algorithm.
			These significance tests indicate that the MaxEnt algorithm presented above is significantly better than either GIZA++ or HMM.
			Figure 2: An alignment showing a split link from an Arabic word.
	
	
			Once an alignment is obtained, phrases which sat isfy the inverse projection constraint are extracted(although earlier this constraint was called consis tent alignments (Och et al, 1999)).
			This constraint enforces that a sequence of source words align to a sequence of target words as defined by the lowest and highest target index, and when the target words are projected back to the source language through the alignment, the original source sequence is retrieved.
			Examination of the hand alignment training datashowed that this criteria is often violated for Arabic and English.
			Prepositional phrases with adjectives often require a split?
			for example, the align ment shown in Figure 2 has ?of
