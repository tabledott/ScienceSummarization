    We describe in this section our proposed generative model, which simultaneously generates a NL sentence and an MR structure.
    We denote a single NL word as w, a contiguous sequence of NL words as w, and a complete NL sentence as W. In the MR structure, we denote a semantic category as M. We denote a single MR production as ma, or Ma : p&#945;(Mb, Mc), where Ma is the semantic category for this production, p&#945; is the function symbol, and Mb, Mc are the child semantic categories.
    We denote ma as an MR structure rooted by an MR production ma, and mQ an MR structure for a complete sentence rooted by an MR production ma.
    The model generates a hybrid tree that represents a sentence W = w1 ... w2 ... paired with an MR structure mQ rooted by ma.
    Figure 2 shows part of a hybrid tree that is generated as follows.
    Given a semantic category Ma, we first pick an MR production ma that has the form Ma : p&#945;(Mb, Mc), which gives u
