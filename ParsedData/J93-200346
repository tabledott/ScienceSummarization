ing English phrase appears in the English string.
    The distortion probabilities of Model 3 do not account well for this tendency of phrases to move around as units.
    Movement of a long phrase will be much less likely than movement of a short phrase because each word must be moved independently.
    In Model 4, we modify our treatment of Pr (II,k = 74-1, 0(1) e) so as to alleviate this problem.
    Words that are connected to the empty cept do not usually form phrases, and so we continue to assume that these words are spread uniformly throughout the French string.
    As we have described, an alignment resolves an English string into a ceptual scheme consisting of a set of possibly overlapping cepts.
    Each of these cepts then accounts for one or more French words.
    In Model 3 the ceptual scheme for an alignment is determined by the fertilities of the words: a word is a cept if its fertility is greater than zero.
    The empty cept is a part of the ceptual scheme if 00 is greater than zero.
