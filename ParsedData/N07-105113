ining also gives us parameters for the grammars, but only the chain of projections is needed.
    Note that the projected estimates need not 1Whether or not the system has solutions depends on the parameters of the grammar.
    In particular, G may be improper, though the results of Chi (1999) imply that G will be proper if it is the maximum-likelihood estimate of a finite treebank.
    (and in general will not) recover the original parameters exactly, nor would we want them to.
    Instead they take into account any smoothing, substate drift, and so on which occurred by the final grammar.
    Starting from the base grammar, we run the projection process for each stage in the sequence, calculating &#960;i (chained incremental projections would also be possible).
    For the remainder of the paper, except where noted otherwise, all coarser grammars&#8217; estimates are these reconstructions, rather than those originally learned.
    As demonstrated by Charniak et al. (2006) parsing times can be greatly reduced
