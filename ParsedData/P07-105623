l of Chelba and Acero (2004) did not aid in adaptation.
    Finally we note that while Blitzer et al. (2006) did combine SCL with labeled target domain data, they only compared using the label of SCL or non-SCL source classifiers as features, following the work of Florian et al.
    (2004).
    By only adapting the SCLrelated part of the weight vector v, we are able to make better use of our small amount of unlabeled data than these previous techniques.
  
  
    Sentiment classification has seen a great deal of attention.
    Its application to many different domains of discourse makes it an ideal candidate for domain adaptation.
    This work addressed two important questions of domain adaptation.
    First, we showed that for a given source and target domain, we can significantly improve for sentiment classification the structural correspondence learning model of Blitzer et al. (2006).
    We chose pivot features using not only common frequency among domains but also mutual information with the source labe
