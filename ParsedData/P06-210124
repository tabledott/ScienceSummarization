 either, because initially -y Pz&#65533; 0, making equation (6) flat. more random restarts give better performance and a more monotonic learning curve&#8212;see Figure 4.)
    Minimum risk annealing did not always win on the training set, suggesting that its advantage is not superior minimization but rather superior generalization: under the risk criterion, multiple lowloss hypotheses per sentence can help guide the learner to the right part of parameter space.
    Although the components of the translation and language models interact in complex ways, the improvement on Finnish-English may be due in part to the higher weight that minimum risk annealing found for the word penalty.
    That system is therefore more likely to produce shorter output like i have taken note of your remarks and i also agree with that . than like this longer output from the minimum-error-trained system: i have taken note ofyour remarks and i shall also agree with all that the union.
    We annealed using our novel expected-BLEU appr
