1 This hierarchy is more or less identical to the NP accessibility hierarchy proposed by Keenan and Comrie (1977).
    Johnson (1977) uses a similar grammatical role hierarchy to specify a set of constraints on syntactic relations, including reflexive binding.
    Lappin (1985) employs it as a salience hierarchy to state a non-coreference constraint for pronouns.
    Guenthner and Lehmann (1983) use a similar salience ranking of grammatical roles to formulate rules of anaphora resolution.
    Centering approaches to anaphora resolution use similar hierarchies as well (Brennan, Friedman, and Pollard 1987; Walker, Iida, and Cote 1990).
    RAP has been implemented for both ESG and GSG (English and German Slot Grammars); we will limit ourselves here to a discussion of the English version.
    The differences between the two versions are at present minimal, primarily owing to the fact that we have devoted most of our attention to analysis of English.
    As with Slot Grammar systems in general (McCord 1989b, 1993
