ence resolution in our cluster-ranking framework.
    It is worth noting that researchers typically adopt a pipeline coreference architecture, performing discourse-new detection prior to coreference resolution and using the resulting information to prevent a coreference system from resolving mentions that are determined to be discourse-new (see Poesio et al. (2004) for an overview).
    As a result, errors in discourse-new detection could be propagated to the resolver, possibly leading to a deterioration of coreference performance (see Ng and Cardie (2002a)).
    Jointly learning discoursenew detection and coreference resolution can potentially address this error-propagation problem.
    In sum, we believe our work makes three main contributions to coreference resolution: Proposing a simple, yet effective coreference model.
    Our work advances the state-of-the-art in coreference resolution by bringing learningbased coreference systems to the next level of performance.
