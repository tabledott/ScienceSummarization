re meant to capture independent phonological generalizations.
    The grammar formalism also specifies how the effects of the different rules are to be combined together to account for any interactions between the generalizations.
    The simplest method of combination for rewriting rule grammars is for the rules to be arranged in an ordered sequence with the interpretation that the first rule applies to the input lexical string, the second rule applies to the output of the first rule, and so on.
    As we observed earlier, the typical practice is to place specialized rules with more elaborate context requirements earlier in the sequence so that they will override more general rules appearing later.
    The combined effect of having one rule operate on the output of another can be modeled by composing the string relations corresponding to each rule.
    If the string relations for two rules are regular, we know that their composition is also regular.
    The following result is then established by induction o
