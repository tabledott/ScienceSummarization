erminal verb node contains vocabulary entries that include settings for verb mode, and for person/number if the verb is finite.
    The plural form for nouns can be handled through a [ph ] morph for the sake of efficiency.
    This morph sets the value of number to plural, regardless of its prior setting.
    It is the job of a parent node to unify that setting with the value delivered by the left siblings of the noun.
    Some examples may help explain how the constraint mechanism works.
    Consider, for example, the ill-formed phrase &amp;quot;each boats.&amp;quot; Suppose the grammar has the three rules, ([np] [da] [noun]), ([noun] [root-noun]), and ([noun] -4 [root-noun] [pl]).
    The lexical item &amp;quot;each&amp;quot; sets the number to singular and passes this value to the [noun] node.
    The [noun] node blocks transfer of number to its children.
    &amp;quot;Boat&amp;quot; sets the number to singular, but the [pl] morph overrides this value, returning a plural value to the parent.
