sis when it is taken account of in the translation process by generating a target word or the &#8220;null&#8221; word e0 ).
    In Brown et al. (1993), two types of distortion probabilities are distinguished: (1) the leftmost word of a set of source words f aligned to the same target word e (which is called the &#8220;head&#8221;) is placed, and (2) the remaining source words are placed.
    Two separate distributions are used for these two cases.
    For placing the &#8220;head&#8221; the center function center(i) (Brown et al. [1993] uses the notation Oi) is used: the average position of the source words with which the target word ei_1 is aligned.
    The distortion probabilities are class-based: They depend on the word class J7(f) of a covered source word f as well as on the word class E(e) of the previously generated target word e. The classes are automatically trained (Brown et al. 1992).
    When the IBM-4 model parameters are used during search, an input sentence can be processed one source position at
