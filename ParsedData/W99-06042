    Each translated sentence was judged by a human examiner according to an error scale from 0.0 to 1.0.
    A score of 0.0 means that the translation is semantically and syntactically correct, a score of 0.5 means that a sentence is semantically correct but syntactically wrong and a score of 1.0 means that the sentence is semantically wrong.
    The human examiner was offered the translated sentences of the two approaches at the same As a result we expect a better possibility of reproduction.
    The results of the translation experiments using the single-word based approach and the alignment template approach on text input and on speech input are summarized in Table 2.
    The results are shown with and without the use of domain-specific preprocessing.
    The alignment template approach produces better translation results than the single-word based approach.
    From this we draw the conclusion that it is important to model word groups in source and target language.
    Considering the r
