l possible trees.
    Mellish et al. (1998) advocate stochastic search as an alternative to exhaustively examining the search space.
    Rather than requiring a global optimum to be found, they use a genetic algorithm to select a tree that is coherent enough for people to understand (local optimum).
    The problem of finding an acceptable ordering does not arise solely in concept-to-text generation but also in the emerging field of text-to-text generation (Barzilay, 2003).
    Examples of applications that require some form of text structuring, are single- and multidocument summarization as well as question answering.
    Note that these applications do not typically assume rich semantic knowledge organized in tree-like structures or communicative goals as is often the case in concept-to-text generation.
    Although in single document summarization the position of a sentence in a document can provide cues with respect to its ordering in the summary, this is not the case in multidocument summarization where
