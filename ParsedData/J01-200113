 of the grammatical morphemes of a language, aiming at identifying the stem(s) and the correct parsing; such is the case, for example, in Pacak and Pratt (1976), Koch, K&#252;stner, and Riidiger (1989), and Wothke and Schmidt (1992).
    With the exception of Harris's algorithm, the complexity of the algorithms is such as to make implementation for purposes of comparison prohibitively time-consuming.
    At the heart of the first approach, due to Harris, is the desire to place boundaries between letters (respectively, phonemes) in a word based on conditional entropy, in the following sense.
    We construct a device that generates a finite list of words, our corpus, letter by letter and with uniform probability, in such a way that at any point in its generation (having generated the first n letters 11 1213 .
    .
    In) we can inquire of it what the entropy is of the set consisting of the next letter of all the continuations it might make.
    (In current parlance, we would most naturally think of this as a
