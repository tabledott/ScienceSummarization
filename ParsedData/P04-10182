entions corefer; then a greedy procedure is followed to group mentions into entities.
    While this approach has yielded encouraging results, the way mentions are linked is arguably suboptimal in that an instant decision is made when considering whether two mentions are linked or not.
    In this paper, we propose to use the Bell tree to represent the process of forming entities from mentions.
    The Bell tree represents the search space of the coreference resolution problem&#8211; each leaf node corresponds to a possible coreference outcome.
    We choose to model the process from mentions to entities represented in the Bell tree, and the problem of coreference resolution is cast as finding the &#8220;best&#8221; path from the root node to leaves.
    A binary maximum entropy model is trained to compute the linking probability between a partial entity and a mention.
    The rest of the paper is organized as follows.
    In Section 2, we present how the Bell tree can be used to represent the process of crea
