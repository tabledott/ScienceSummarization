he moment, the false cue rates B, in my system have been set empirically.
    Brent (1992) discusses a method of determining values for the false cue rates automatically, and this technique or some similar form of automatic optimization could profitably be incorporated into my system.
  
  
    The program acquired a dictionary of 4900 subcategorizations for 3104 verbs (an average of 1.6 per verb).
    Post-editing would reduce this slightly (a few repeated typos made it in, such as acknowlege, a few oddities such as the spelling garontee as a 'Cajun' pronunciation of guarantee and a few cases of mistakes by the tagger which, for example, led it to regard lowlife as a verb several times by mistake).

    In general, all the verbs for which subcategorization frames were determined are in Webste
