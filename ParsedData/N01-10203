 uk=Ukrainian, po=Polish, sr=Serbian, ru=Russian The data sets used in these experiments were apthe same size as those used in the previous experiment 1100-1300 translation word Dictionaries for Russian and Ukrainian were converted into romanized pronunciation dictionaries.
    There are three observations which can be made from the multipath results.
    1.
    Adding more pathways usually results in an accuracy improvement.
    When there is a drop in accuracy on the cognate vocabulary by adding an additional bridge language there tends to be an improvement in accuracy on the full vocabulary due to significantly more cognate pathways (yielding greater coverage).
    2.
    It is difficult to substantially improve upon the performance of the single closest bridge language, especially when they are as close as enes-pt.
    Improvements on performance relative to the single best ranged from 2% to 20%.
    3.
    Several mediocre pathways can be combined to improve performance.
    Though it is always better to
