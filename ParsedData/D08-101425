refore provide the best results in English.
    Yet, as explained earlier, this was not the case.
  
  
    In this paper, we explored the use of machine translation for creating resources and tools for subjectivity analysis in other languages, by leveraging on the resources available in English.
    We introduced and evaluated three different approaches to generate subjectivity annotated corpora in a given target language, and exemplified the technique on Romanian and Spanish.
    The experiments show promising results, as they are comparable to those obtained using manually translated corpora.
    While the quality of the translation is a factor, machine translation offers an efficient and effective alternative in capturing the subjective semantics of a text, coming within 4% Fmeasure as compared to the results obtained using human translated corpora.
    In the future, we plan to explore additional language-specific clues, and integrate them into the subjectivity classifiers.
