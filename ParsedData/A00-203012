    Given a sentence to be analyzed, the search program must find the most likely semantic and syntactic interpretation.
    More precisely, it must find the most likely augmented parse tree.
    Although mathematically the model predicts tree elements in a top-down fashion, we search the space bottom-up using a chartbased search.
    The search is kept tractable through a combination of CKY-style dynamic programming and pruning of low probability elements.
    Whenever two or more constituents are equivalent relative to all possible later parsing decisions, we apply dynamic programming, keeping only the most likely constituent in the chart.
    Two constituents are considered equivalent if: threshold of the highest scoring constituent are maintained; all others are pruned.
    For purposes of pruning, and only for purposes of pruning, the prior probability of each constituent cate
