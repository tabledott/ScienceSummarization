 i appeared in the corpus and n is the total number of times that all the alternatives for the relation appeared in the corpus).
    For mathematical convenience we bound in p instead of p. Assuming that samples of the alternative relations are distributed normally, we get the following bound with confidence 1 &#8212; a: where Z is the confidence coefficient.
    We approximate the variance by the delta method (e.g.
    Johnson and Wichern (1982)): P2 /32 ni n2 We denote the right hand side (the bound) by Ba(ni, n2).
    In sentences with several relations, we consider the best two alternatives for each relation, and take the relation for which Ba is largest.
    If this Ba is less than a specified threshold then we do not choose between the alternatives.
    Otherwise, we choose the most frequent alternative to this relation and select the target words appearing in this alternative.
    We then eliminate all the other alternative translations for the selected words, and accordingly eliminate all the alternat
