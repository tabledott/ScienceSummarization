    Table 1 presents data for two judges.
    The rows correspond to the tags assigned by judge 1 and the columns correspond to the tags assigned by judge 2.
    Let nj denote the number of sentences that judge 1 classifies as i and judge 2 classifies as j, and let be the probability that a randomly selected sentence is categorized as i by judge 1 and j by judge 2.
    Then, the maximum likelihood estimate of fiii is 11-7-71.:+ , where n++ = Eii nii = 504.
    Table 1 shows a four-category data configuration, in which certainty ratings 0 and 1 are combined and ratings 2 and 3 are combined.
    Note that the analyses described in this section cannot be performed on the two-category data configuration (in which the certainty ratings are not considered), due to insufficient degrees of freedom (Bishop et al., 1975).
