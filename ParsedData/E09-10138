y.2 A key element in these previous attempts at adapting LDA for WSD is the tendency to remain at a high level, document-like, setting.
    In contrast, we make use of much smaller units of text (a few sentences, rather than a full document), and create an individual model for each (ambiguous) word type.
    Our induced senses are few in number (typically less than ten).
    This is in marked contrast to tens, and sometimes hundreds, of topics commonly used in document-modeling tasks.
    Unlike many conventional clustering methods (e.g., Purandare and Pedersen 2004; Sch&#168;utze 1998), our model is probabilistic; it specifies a probability distribution over possible values, which makes it easy to integrate and combine with other systems via mixture or product models.
    Furthermore, the Bayesian framework allows the incorporation of several information sources in a principled manner.
    Our model can easily handle an arbitrary number of feature classes (e.g., parts of speech, dependencies).
