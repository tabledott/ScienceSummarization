o extend this decision rule for the word penalty (WP) feature function, we simply obtain an additional term AWP for each word.
    The class-based 5-gram language model (CLM) can be included like the trigram language model.
    Note that all these feature functions decompose nicely into contributions for each produced target language word or for each covered source language word.
    This makes it possible to develop an efficient dynamic programming search algorithm.
    Not all feature functions have this nice property: For the conventional lexicon feature function (LEX), we obtain an additional term in our decision rule which depends on the full sentence.
    Therefore, this feature function will not be integrated in the dynamic programming search but instead will be used to rerank the set of candidate translations produced by the search.
    We have to structure the search space in a suitable way to search efficiently.
    In our search algorithm, we generate search hypotheses that correspond to prefixes o
