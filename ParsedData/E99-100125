d external evidence before making a decision about a named entity.
    Only in step 3 is information from the gazetteers used without context-checking.
    It is not immediately obvious from Figure 3 what exactly the impact is of these gazetteers.
    To try and answer this question, we ran our system over 70 articles of the muc competition in different modes; the remaining 30 articles were used to compile a limited gazetteer as described below and after that played no role in the experiments.
    Full gazetteers.
    We first ran the system again with the full gazetteers, i.e. the gazetteers used in the official muc system.
    There are minor differences in Recall and Precision compared to the official muc results, due to the fact that we were using a slightly different (smaller) corpus.
    No gazetteers.
    We then ran the system without any gazetteers.
    In this mode, the system can still use internal evidence (e.g. indicators such as &amp;quot;Mr&amp;quot; for people or &amp;quot;Ltd&amp;quot; for or
