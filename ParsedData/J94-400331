er than finding a confidence interval for /51/752, we will bound the log odds ratio, 111(j5i /152).
    Since the variance of the log odds ratio is independent of the mean, it converges to the normal distribution faster than the odds ratio itself (Agresti 1990).
    We use a one-tailed interval, as we want only to decide whether 111(151 rp'2) is greater than a specific threshold (i.e., we need only a lower bound for 1n(j51 /132)).
    Using this method, for each desired error probability 0 &lt; a &lt; 1, we may determine a value 13&#8222; and state that with a probability of at least 1 &#8212; a the true value, ln (pi /p2), is greater than Ba.
    The confidence interval of a random variable X with normal distribution is VvarX, where Z1_&#8222; is the confidence coefficient, which may be found in statistical tables, and var is the variance.
    In our case, the size of the confidence interval is In the appendix we approximate the variance by the following [ln151 + 1.
    P2 ni n2 The bound we get is thus Ba(n
