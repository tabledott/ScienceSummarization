sing the error criterion in both training and decoding.
    By doing so, the system can be optimized for the translation task instead of a criterion such as likelihood that is unrelated to the evaluation metric.
    Two popular techniques that incorporate the error criterion are Minimum Error Rate Training (MERT) (Och, 2003) and Minimum BayesRisk (MBR) decoding (Kumar and Byrne, 2004).
    These two techniques were originally developed for N-best lists of translation hypotheses and recently extended to translation lattices (Macherey et al., 2008; Tromble et al., 2008) generated by a phrase-based SMT system (Och and Ney, 2004).
    Translation lattices contain a significantly higher number of translation alternatives relative to Nbest lists.
    The extension to lattices reduces the runtimes for both MERT and MBR, and gives performance improvements from MBR decoding.
    SMT systems based on synchronous context free grammars (SCFG) (Chiang, 2007; Zollmann and Venugopal, 2006; Galley et al., 2006) have recently
