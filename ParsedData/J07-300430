was beyond the scope of our project, we modify our grammar slightly, and allow the algorithm to use instantiations of a special coordination rule schema, such as: This enables us to analyze the previous example as: In CCG, all language-specific information is associated with the lexical categories of words.
    There are many syntactic regularities associated with word classes, however, which may potentially generate a large number of lexical entries for each item in that class.
    One particularly frequent example of this is clausal adjuncts.
    Figure 3 illustrates how the basic algorithm described above leads to a proliferation of adjunct categories.
    For example, a past participle such as used would receive a different category in a reduced relative like Figure 3(a) from its standard category (S[pss]\NP)/(S[to]\NP).
    As a consequence, modifiers of used would also receive different categories depending on what occurrence of used they modify.
    This is undesirable, because we are only guaranteed t
