rain the cardinality of the output nonterminals, which is accomplished by the role templates in the term.
    Translator CT scans only the input components.
    Terminal productions with active output components are simply loaded from the grammar, and their LHSs are added to the chart without d-span information.
    Composition proceeds as before, except that there are no constraints on the role templates in the output dimensions &#8211; the role templates in are free variables.
    In summary, Logic CT differs from Logic C as follows: Items store no position information (d-spans) for the output components.
    For the output components, the Scan inferences are replaced by Load inferences, which are not constrained by the input.
    The Compose inference does not constrain the d-spans of the output components.
    (Though it still constrains their cardinality.)
    We have constructed a translator from a synchronous parser merely by relaxing some constraints on the output dimensions.
    Logic C is just Logic
