ses these markers top devalue values when retrieving a value from the matrix, @ results in the value being halved, % in the value being divided by eight (Marshall (1983), p. 149).
    Thus, the independent probability of each possible tag for a given word influences the choice of an optimal Such probabilities will be referred to as Probabilities, Other features have been added to the basic algorithm.
    For example, a good deal of suffix analysis is used in initial tagging.
    Also, the program filters its output, considering itself to have failed if the optimal tag assignment for a span is not &amp;quot;more than 90% probable&amp;quot;. cases it reorders tags rather than actually disambiguating.
    On long spans this criterion is effectively more stringent than on short spans.
    A more significant addition to the algorithm is that a number of tag triples associated with a have been introduced which may either upgrade or downgrade values in the tree computed from the one-step matrix.
    For example, the
