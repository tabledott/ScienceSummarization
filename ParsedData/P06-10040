  Minimum Cut Model For Spoken Lecture Segmentation
  
    We consider the task of unsupervised lecture segmentation.
    We formalize segmentation as a graph-partitioning task that optimizes the normalized cut criterion.
    Our approach moves beyond localized comparisons and takes into account longrange cohesion dependencies.
    Our results demonstrate that global analysis improves the segmentation accuracy and is robust in the presence of speech recognition errors.
  
  
    The development of computational models of text structure is a central concern in natural language processing.
    Text segmentation is an important instance of such work.
    The task is to partition a text into a linear sequence of topically coherent segments and thereby induce a content structure of the text.
    The applications of the derived representation are broad, encompassing information retrieval, question-answering and summarization.
    Not surprisingly, text segmentation has been extensively investigated over the last d
