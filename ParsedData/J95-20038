79) and Joshi and Weinstein (1981) provided initial results on the connection between changes in immediate focus and the complexity of inferences required to integrate a representation of the meaning of an individual utterance into a representation of the meaning of the discourse of which it was a part.
    To avoid confusion with previous uses of the term &amp;quot;focus&amp;quot; in linguistics, they introduced the centering terminology.
    Their notions of &amp;quot;forward-looking&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;backward-looking&amp;quot; centers correspond approximately to Sidner's potential foci and discourse focus.
    In all of this work, focusing, whether global or immediate, was seen to function to limit the inferences required for understanding utterances in a discourse.
    Grosz and Sidner were concerned with the inferences needed to interpret anaphoric expressions of various sorts (e.g. pronouns, definite descriptions, ellipsis).
    They used focusing to order candidates; as a result the need for sear
