e attained when more passes are allowed than are actually necessary.
    In order to evaluate the sensitivity of the algorithm to the lengths of the texts that are to be aligned, we applied it to text samples that ranged in length from 10 to 1000 sentences, and examined the accuracy of the WAT after the first pass; that is, more precisely, the number of word pairs in the WAT that are valid translations relative to the total number of word pairs with a similarity of not less than 0.7 (the measurements are cross-validated over different texts).
    The result is that this accuracy increases asymptotically to 1 with the text length, and is already higher than 80% for text length of 100 sentences (which sufficient to reach an almost perfect alignment in the end).
    Roughly speaking, the accuracy is almost 1 for texts longer than 150 sentences, and around 0.5 for text length in the lower range from 20 to 60.
    In other words, texts of a length of more than 150 sentences are suitable to be processed in this way
