tructure of this objective function is very similar to Roth and Yih&#8217;s, except that we do not utilize constraint costs in the objective function itself.
    Roth and Yih use these to make certain combinations impossible (like a location being an argument to a spouse of relation); we enforce such effects in the constraint equations instead.
    The joint objective function (5) does not constrain the assignment of the xhi,ji and yj variables to be consistent with one another.
    To enforce consistency, we add further constraints.
    In what follows, Mj is the set of all mentions preceding mention j in the document.
    Resolve only anaphors: if a pair of mentions hi, ji is coreferent (xhi,ji=1), then mention j must be anaphoric (yj=1).
    These constraints thus directly relate the two tasks.
    By formulating the problem this way, the decisions of the anaphoricity classifier are not taken on faith as they were with AC-CASCADE.
    Instead, we optimize over consideration of both possibilities in the obj
