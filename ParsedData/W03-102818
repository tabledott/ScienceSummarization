ure varies slightly for the unstemmed and the stemmed data, and for the two the corresponding value is used.
    Several runs were made for each representation, with the goal to maximise the performance as evaluated on the validation set: first the weights of the positive examples were adjusted, as the data set is unbalanced.
    A better performance was obtained when the positive examples in the training data outnumbered the negative ones.
    Thereafter experiments with bagging were performed, and also, runs with and without the POS tag feature were made.
    The results are presented next.
  
  
    In this section, the results obtained by the best performing model for each approach&#8212;as judged on the validation set&#8212;when run on the previously unseen test set are presented.
    It should, however, be noted that the number of possible runs is very large, by varying for example the number of classifiers generated by the ensemble technique.
    It might well be that better results are possible for an
