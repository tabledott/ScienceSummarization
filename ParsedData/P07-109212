int distribution for triangulated phrase-tables is defined in an analogous way to Equation (1).
    We expect that the standard phrase-table should be allocated a higher weight than triangulated phrase-tables, as it will be less noisy.
    The joint distribution is now conditionalised to yield p(s|t) and p(t|s), which are both used as features in the decoder.
    Note that the resulting conditional distribution will be drawn solely from one input distribution when the conditioning context is unseen in the remaining distributions.
    This may lead to an over-reliance on unreliable distributions, which can be ameliorated by smoothing (e.g., Foster et al. (2006)).
    As an alternative to linear interpolation, we also employ a weighted product for phrase-table combination: This has the same form used for log-linear training of SMT decoders (Och, 2003), which allows us to treat each distribution as a feature, and learn the mixing weights automatically.
    Note that we must individually smooth the component dist
