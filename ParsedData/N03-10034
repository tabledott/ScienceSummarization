n capture paraphrases that on the surface bear little resemblance but that, by the nature of the data, must be descriptions of the same information.
    Note that we also acquire paraphrases from each of the individual corpora; but the lack of clues as to sentence equivalence in single corpora means that we must be more conservative, only selecting as paraphrases items that are structurally very similar.
    Our approach has three main steps.
    First, working on each of the comparable corpora separately, we compute lattices &#8212; compact graph-based representations &#8212; to find commonalities within (automatically derived) groups of structurally similar sentences.
    Next, we identify pairs of lattices from the two different corpora that are paraphrases of each other; the identification process checks whether the lattices take similar arguments.
    Finally, given an input sentence to be paraphrased, we match it to a lattice and use a paraphrase from the matched lattice&#8217;s mate to generate an outp
