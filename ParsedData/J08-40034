he projective list-based algorithm turns out to be equally efficient in practice.
    Moreover, when the projective algorithms are used to implement pseudo-projective parsing, they sometimes become less efficient in parsing (but not in learning) than the non-projective list-based algorithm.
    Although most of the algorithms have been partially described in the literature before, this is the first comprehensive analysis and evaluation of the algorithms within a unified framework.
  
  
    Because parsers for natural language have to cope with a high degree of ambiguity and nondeterminism, they are typically based on different techniques than the ones used for parsing well-defined formal languages&#8212;for example, in compilers for programming languages.
    Thus, the mainstream approach to natural language parsing uses algorithms that efficiently derive a potentially very large set of analyses in parallel, typically making use of dynamic programming and well-formed substring tables or charts.
