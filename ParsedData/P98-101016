al, patterns.
    Table 2 shows the distribution of pattern length in the train data.
    We also did not attempt to extract passivevoice VO relations.
    The test procedure has two parameters: (a) maximum context size of a candidate, which limits what queries are performed on the memory, and (b) the threshold 9 used for establishing a matching tile, which determines how to make use of the query results.
    Recall and precision figures were obtained for various parameter values.
    Fo (van Rijsbergen, 1979), a common measure in information retrieval, was used as a single-figure measure of performance: We use # = 1 which gives no preference to either recall or precision.
    Table 3 summarizes the optimal parameter settings and results for NP, VO, and SV on the test set.
    In order to find the optimal values of the context size and threshold, we tried 0.1 &lt; 9 &lt; 0.95, and maximum context sizes of 1,2, and 3.
    Our experiments used 5-fold cross-validation on the training data to determine the optima
