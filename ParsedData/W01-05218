-head) child.
    (The head word of a parent is the same as the head word of its head child.)
    Because this is the only part of the model that involves pairs of words, it is also where the bulk of the parameters are found.
    The large number of possible pairs of words in the vocabulary make the training data necessarily sparse.
    In order to avoid assigning zero probability to unseen events, it is necessary to smooth the training data.
    The Collins model uses linear interpolation to estimate probabilities from empirical distributions of varying specificities: where P&#65533; represents the empirical distribution derived directly from the counts in the training data.
    The interpolation weights A1, A2 are chosen as a function of the number of examples seen for the conditioning events and the number of unique values seen for the predicted variable.
    Only the first distribution in this interpolation scheme involves pairs of words, and the third component is simply the probability of a word given i
