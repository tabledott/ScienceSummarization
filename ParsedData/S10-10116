hich sentences containing target word instances are tagged with OntoNotes (Hovy et al., 2006) senses.
    The texts come from various news sources including CNN, ABC and others.
  
  
    For the purposes of this section we provide an example (Table 3) in which a target word has 181 instances and 3 GS senses.
    A system has generated a clustering solution with 4 clusters covering all instances.
    Table 3 shows the number of common instances between clusters and GS senses.
    This section presents the measures of unsupervised evaluation, i.e V-Measure (Rosenberg and Hirschberg, 2007) and (2) paired F-Score (Artiles et al., 2009).
    Let w be a target word with N instances (data points) in the testing dataset.
    Let K = {Cj|j = 1... n} be a set of automatically generated clusters grouping these instances, and S = {Gi|i = 1... m} the set of gold standard classes containing the desirable groupings of w instances.
    V-Measure (Rosenberg and Hirschberg, 2007) assesses the quality of a clustering solution
