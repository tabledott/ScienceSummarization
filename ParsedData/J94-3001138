 regularities of the language but its lexical inventory as well, and its corresponding transducer would perform phonological recognition and lexical lookup in a single sequence of transitions.
    This is the sort of arrangement that Karttunen et al. (1992) discuss.
    Finally, we know that many language classes are closed under finitestate transductions or composition with regular relations&#8212;the images of context-free languages, for example, are context-free.
    It might therefore prove advantageous to seek ways of composing phonology and syntax to produce a new system with the same formal properties as syntax alone.
  
  
    We are particularly indebted to Danny Bobrow for helpful discussions in the early stages of the research on rewriting systems.
    Our understanding and analysis of two-level systems is based on very productive discussions with Lauri Karttunen and Kimmo Koskenniemi.
    We would like to thank John Maxwell, Mary Dalrymple, Andy Daniels, Chris Manning, and especially Kenneth Beesl
