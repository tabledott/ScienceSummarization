Synsets whose word senses overlap with a common TokenPOS.
			These edges have raw weights given by the number ofTokenPOS nodes shared by the Synsets.
			The intuition be hind adding these edges is that WordNet often divides the meanings of words into fine-grained senses with similarmeanings, so there is likely to be some semantic relation ship between Synsets sharing a common TokenPOS.
			The final graph has 422,831 nodes and 5,133,281 edges.
			This graph is very sparse; fewer than 1 in 10,000node pairs are directly connected.
			When only the un weighted WordNet relationship edges are considered, the largest degree of any node is ?city#n#1?
			with 667 edges (mostly connecting to particular cities), followed by ?law#n#2?
			with 602 edges (mostly connecting to alarge number of domain terms such as ?dissenting opinion?
			and ?freedom of speech?), and each node is on aver age connected to 1.7 other nodes.
			When the gloss-based edges are considered separately, the highest degree nodesare those with the long
