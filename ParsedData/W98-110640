extraction patterns and case frames achieved similar recall results, although the case frames missed seven correct extractions.
    However the case frames produced substantially fewer false hits, producing 82 fewer spurious extractions.
    Note that perpetrators exhibited by far the lowest precision.
    The reason is that the perpetrator slot received highest precedence among competing slots for unknown words.
    Changing the precedence scheme produces a bubble effect where many incorrect extractions shift to the primary default category.
    The case frames therefore have the potential for even higher precision if the unknown words are handled better.
    Expanding the semantic lexicon is one option, and additional work may suggest ways to choose slots for unknown words more intelligently.
  
  
    We have shown that conceptual case frames can be generated automatically using unannotated text as input, coupled with a few hours of manual review.
    Our results for the terrorism domain show that the case
