nt rule applications will have to cope explicitly with such dummy terminals.
    This method has been used in several published grammars [2, 4, 7], but in a large grammar it has the same (if not worse) problems of size and clarity as the previous method.
    It also suffers from a theoretical problem: in general, the language defined by such a grammar will contain extra sentences involving the dummy terminals.
    For parsing, however, no problem arises, because the input sentences are not supposed to contain dummy terminals.
    These inadequacies of MGs were the main motivation for the development of XGs.
  
  
    To describe left extraposition, we need to relate non-contiguous parts of a sentence.
    But neither DCGs nor MGs have means of representing such a relationship by specific grammar rules.
    Rather; the relationship can only be described implicitly, by adding extra information to many unrelated rules in the grammar.
    That is, one cannot look at a grammar and find a set of rules specific to t
