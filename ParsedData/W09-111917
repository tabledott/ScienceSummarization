e why MUC7 test set benefits from nonlocal features much less than MUC7 development set.
    Our key conclusion is that no single approach is better than the rest and that the approaches are complimentary- their combination is the most stable and best performing.
  
  
    As we have illustrated in the introduction, NER is a knowledge-intensive task.
    In this section, we discuss two important knowledge resources&#8211; gazetteers and unlabeled text.
    Recent successful semi-supervised systems (Ando and Zhang, 2005; Suzuki and Isozaki, 2008) have illustrated that unlabeled text can be used to improve the performance of NER systems.
    In this work, we analyze a simple technique of using word clusters generated from unlabeled text, which has been shown to improve performance of dependency parsing (Koo et al., 2008), Chinese word segmentation (Liang, 2005) and NER (Miller et al., 2004).
    The technique is based on word class models, pioneered by (Brown et al., 1992), which hierarchically The approach is
