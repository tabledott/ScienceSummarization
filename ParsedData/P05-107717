ing formula: where CSreal,i and CScalc,i are the cosine similarity scores calculated using the traditional (equation 1) and randomized (equation 4) technique respectively. i is the index over all pairs of elements that have C5real,Z &gt;= 0.15 We calculate the error (errora,,) for various values of d, the total number of unit random vectors r used in the process.
    The results are reported in Table 26.
    As we generate more random vectors, the error rate decreases.
    For example, generating 10 random vectors gives us a cosine error of 0.4432 (which is a large number since cosine similarity ranges from 0 to 1.)
    However, generation of more random vectors leads to reduction in error rate as seen by the values for 1000 (0.0493) and 10000 (0.0156).
    But as we generate more random vectors the time taken by the algorithm also increases.
    We choose d = 3000 random vectors as our optimal (time-accuracy) cut off.
    It is also very interesting to note that by using only 3000 bits for each of the 655,49
