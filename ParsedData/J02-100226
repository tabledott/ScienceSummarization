ed here, with the results remaining nearly identical.
    For these tests, the mean segment size was held constant at 25 for each set of reference segments, in order to produce distributions of segment size with the same means but different variances.
    The four ranges of segment sizes were (20, 30), (15, 35), (10, 40), and (5, 45).
    The results of these tests are shown in Table 1.
    The tests used the following types of experimental segmentations: The results indicate that variation in segment size does make a difference, but not a very big one.
    (As we will show, the differences are similar when we use a smaller probability of false negative/positive occurrence.)
    The Pk value for the (20, 30) range with FN segmentation is on average 0.245, and it decreases to 0.223 for the (5, 45) range.
    Similarly, the FP segmentation decreases from 0.128 for the (20, 30) range to 0.107 for the (5, 45) range, and the FNP segmentation decreases from 0.317 for the (20, 30) range to 0.268 for the (5, 45) rang
