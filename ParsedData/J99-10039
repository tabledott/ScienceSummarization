1977).
    Gale and Church (1991a) began with a less structured model and proceeded to estimate its parameters through a series of approximations.
    Given the set A of all possible alignments, the maximum-likelihood alignment is = a r g meTic Pr (AILI , .
    (1) Gale and Church first assumed that the probability of any aligned segment pair is independent of any other segment pair: Next, they assumed that the only feature of u, and v, that influences the probability of Gale and Church empirically estimated the distributions Pr(d(u,, vi) la,) and Pr(a1) from a hand-aligned training bitext and then used dynamic programming to solve Equation 5.
    The length-based alignment algorithms work remarkably well on language pairs like French/English and German/English, considering how little information they use.
    However, length correlations are not as high when either of the languages involved does not use a phonetically based alphabet (e.g., Chinese).
    Even in language pairs where the length correlation is
