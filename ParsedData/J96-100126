d fifty-fifth sentences of our corpus (not necessarily in that order and perhaps with other words intervening), then in our sample collection, XG takes the value &amp;quot;1&amp;quot; for the fifth and fifty-fifth sentences and &amp;quot;0&amp;quot; for all other sentences in the corpus.
    Furthermore, for the measurement of correlation between a word group G in the source language and another word group H in the target language, we map the paired sentences in our corpus to a collection of paired samples for the random variables XG and XH.
    This modeling process allows us to use correlation metrics between paired samples of random variables (XG and Xx) to measure the correlation between word groups (G and H) across languages.
    There are several ways to measure the correlation of two such random variables.
    One measure frequently used in information retrieval is the Dice coefficient (Dice 1945; Sorensen 1948; Salton and McGill 1983; Frakes and Baeza-Yates 1992).
    It is defined as where p(X, Y), p
