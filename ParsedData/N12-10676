 from the example sentence is shown in Figure 2.
    Our goal is to find the sequence of edits ei with the maximum overlap with the gold standard.
    Let L = (V, E) be the edit lattice graph from the last section.
    We change the cost of each edge whose corsystem feeds a word into PB-SMT pipeline . responding edit has a match in the gold standard to &#8722;(u + 1) &#215; |E|.
    An edit e matches a gold edit g iff they have the same offsets and e&#8217;s correction is included in g: Then, we perform a single-source shortest path search with negative edge weights from the start to the end vertex1.
    This can be done efficiently, for example with the Bellman-Ford algorithm (Cormen et al., 2001).
    As the lattice is acyclic, the algorithm is guaranteed to terminate and return a shortest path.
    Theorem 1.
    The set of edits corresponding to the shortest path has the maximum overlap with the gold standard annotation.
    Proof.
    Let e = e1, ... , ek be the edit sequence corresponding to the shortes
