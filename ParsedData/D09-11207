    This system yields a rather low 48.9 pairwise F1 (see BASE-FLAT in Table 2).
    There are many, primarily recall, errors made choosing antecedents for all mention types which we will address by adding syntactic and semantic constraints.
    In this section, we enrich the syntactic representation and information in our system to improve results.
    We first focus on fixing the pronoun antecedent choices.
    A common error arose from the use of mention head distance as a poor proxy for discourse salience.
    For instance consider the example in Figure 1, the mention America is closest to its in flat mention distance, but syntactically Nintendo ofAmerica holds a more prominent syntactic position relative to the pronoun which, as Hobbs (1977) argues, is key to discourse salience.
    Mapping Mentions to Parse Nodes: In order to use the syntactic position of mentions to determine anaphoricity, we must associate each mention in the document with a parse tree node.
    We parse all document sentences with
