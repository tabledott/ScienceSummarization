esenting the grammatical category of an expression and its subconstituents.
    Terminal symbols are introduced into rules by enclosing them in list brackets, for example sbar/S --&gt; [that] , s/S.
    Such rules can be translated into Prolog directly using a difference list encoding of string positions; we assume readers are familiar with this technique (Pereira and Shieber, 1985).
    Because we concentrate on the relationship between expressions in a language and their logical forms, we will assume that the category terms have both a syntactic and a semantic component.
    In particular, the infix function symbol / will be used to form categories of the form Syn/Sem where Syn is the syntactic category of the expression and Sem is an encoding of its semantics as a logical form; the previous rule uses this notation, for example.
    From a DCG perspective, all the rules involve the single nonterminal /, with the given intended interpretation.
    Furthermore, the representation of grammars that we will post
