perparameters of the corresponding Dirichlet distributions: Because the Dirichlet distribution is conjugate to the multinomial distribution, it is possible to integrate out the rule probabilities &#952;, producing the &#8220;collapsed sampler&#8221; described in Johnson et al. (2007a).
    In our experiments we chose an uniform prior Qr = 1 for all rules r E R. As Table 1 shows, integrating out &#952; only has a major effect on results when the adaptor hyperparameters themselves are not sampled, and even then it did not have a large effect on the collocation-syllable adaptor grammar.
    This is not too surprising: because the Onset, Nucleus and Coda adaptors in this grammar learn the probabilities of these building blocks of words, the phoneme probabilities (which is most of what &#952; encodes) play less important a role.
    As far as we know, there are no conjugate priors for the adaptor hyperparameters aX or bX (which corresponds to &#945;X in a Chinese Restaurant Process), so it is not possible to integ
