he previous experiment using perfect CEs: we observe big improvements across the board.
    This should not be surprising since the experimental setting is quite close to that for perfect CEs: this experiment also presumes knowledge of when a CE is part of an annotated coreference chain.
    Nevertheless, we see that anaphoricity infomation is important.
    First, good anaphoricity identification should reduce the set of extracted CEs making it closer to the set of annotated CEs.
    Second, further improvements in MUC score for the ACE data sets over the runs using perfect CEs (box 5) reveal that accurately determining anaphoricity can lead to substantial improvements in MUC score.
    ACE data includes annotations for singleton CEs, so knowling whether an annotated CE is anaphoric divulges additional information.
    Conclusion #4: An accurate anaphoricity determination component can lead to substantial improvement in coreference resolution performance.
