    Examining the word fidanzato for the &#8220;No LP&#8221; and &#8220;With LP&#8221; models is particularly instructive.
    As Figure 1 shows, this word has no high-confidence alignment in the Italian-English bitext.
    As a result, its POS tag needs to be induced in the &#8220;No LP&#8221; case, while the 11A word level paired-t-test is significant at p &lt; 0.01 for Danish, Greek, Italian, Portuguese, Spanish and Swedish, and p &lt; 0.05 for Dutch. correct tag is available as a constraint feature in the &#8220;With LP&#8221; case.
  
  
    We have shown the efficacy of graph-based label propagation for projecting part-of-speech information across languages.
    Because we are interested in applying our techniques to languages for which no labeled resources are available, we paid particular attention to minimize the number of free parameters and used the same hyperparameters for all language pairs.
    Our results suggest that it is poss
