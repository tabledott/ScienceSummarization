    Contrary to general search schemes (e.g., beam search), which do not guarantee optimality, the linear programming approach provides an efficient way to finding the optimal solution.
    The key advantage of the linear programming formulation is its generality and flexibility; in particular, it supports the ability to incorporate classifiers learned in other contexts, &#8220;hints&#8221; supplied and decision time constraints, and reason with all these for the best global prediction.
    In sharp contrast with the typically used pipeline framework, our formulation does not blindly trust the results of some classifiers, and therefore is able to overcome mistakes made by classifiers with the help of constraints.
    Our experiments have demonstrated these advantages by considering the interaction between entity and relation classifiers.
    In fact, more classifiers can be added and used within the same framework.
    For example, if coreference resolution is available, it is possible to incorporate it
