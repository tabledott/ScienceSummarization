 done professionally, we observed a number of errors.
    These errors ranged from minor typographical mistakes (I was terrible... instead of It was terrible... ) to more serious errors of incorrect verb choices and nonsensical constructions.
    An example of the latter is the French sentence (translated from German): Il a gratt&#180;e une planche de b&#180;eton, perdit des pi`eces du v&#180;ehicule.
    (He scraped against a concrete crash barrier and lost parts of the car.)
    Here, the French verb gratter is incorrect, and the phrase planche de b&#180;eton does not make any sense.
    We did not quantify errors, but collected a number of examples during the course of the manual evaluation.
    These errors were present in the data available to all the systems and therefore did not bias the results, but we suggest that next year a manual review of the professionally-collected translations be taken prior to releasing the data in order to correct mistakes and provide feedback to the translation agency.
