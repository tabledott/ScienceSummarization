d approaches that make use of syntax do not lead to better performance.
    In fact, imposing syntactic restrictions on phrases, as used in recently proposed syntax-based translation models [Yamada and Knight, 2001], proves to be harmful.
    Our experiments also show, that small phrases of up to three words are sufficient for obtaining high levels of accuracy.
    Performance differs widely depending on the methods used to build the phrase translation table.
    We found extraction heuristics based on word alignments to be better than a more principled phrase-based alignment method.
    However, what constitutes the best heuristic differs from language pair to language pair and varies with the size of the training corpus.
  
  
    In order to compare different phrase extraction methods, we designed a uniform framework.
    We present a phrase translation model and decoder that works with any phrase translation table.
    The phrase translation model is based on the noisy channel model.
    We use Bayes rule
