ition, period, or colon; rules that contain WH tags; rules that begin/end with a verb or adverb; rules that contain pronouns with any other tags; rules that contain misplaced commas or quotes; rules that end with adjectives.
    Rules covered under any of these classes were omitted from the human-pruned rule sets used in the experiments of Section 4.
  
  
    To evaluate the treebank approach to base NP identification, we created two base NP corpora.
    Each is derived from the Penn Treebank WSJ.
    The first corpus attempts to duplicate the base NPs used the Ramshaw &amp; Marcus (R&amp;M) study.
    The second corpus contains slightly less complicated base NPs &#8212; base NPs that are better suited for use with our sentence analyzer, Empire.'
    By evaluating on both corpora, we can measure the effect of noun phrase complexity on the treebank approach to base NP identification.
    In particular, we hypothesize that the treebank approach will be most appropriate when the base NPs are sufficiently simple
