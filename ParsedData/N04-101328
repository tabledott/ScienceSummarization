of the named entities.
    These are parsed by the grammar as described in section 2.
    We used manual named entity markup for this experiment because our intent is to measure parsing technology independent of either the time or errors of an automatic named-entity extractor.
    However, in other experiments with an automatic finite-state extractor, we have found that the time for named-entity recognition is negligible (on the order of seconds across the entire corpus) and makes relatively few errors, so that the results reported here are good approximations of what might be expected in more realistic situations.
    As input to the Collins parser, we used the part-ofspeech tagged version of section 23 that was provided with the parser.
    From this we extracted the 700 sentences in the PARC 700.
    We then modified them to produce named entity input so that the parses would match the PARC 700.
    This was done by putting underscores between the parts of the named entity and changing the final part of sp
