part of speech and each arc labeled with a grammatical function.
    In the following, we will restrict our attention to unlabeled dependency graphs, i.e. graphs without labeled arcs, but the results will apply to labeled dependency graphs as well.
    We will also restrict ourselves to projective dependency graphs (Mel&#8217;cuk, 1988).
    Formally, we define these structures in the following way: We write wz &lt; wj to express that wz precedes wj in the string W (i.e., i &lt; j); we write wz &#8212;* wj to say that there is an arc from wz to wj; we use &#8212;** to denote the reflexive and transitive closure of the arc relation; and we use H and H* for the corresponding undirected relations, i.e. wz H wj iff wz &#8212;* wj or wj &#8212;* wz.
    2.
    A dependency graph D = (W, A) is wellformed iff the five conditions given in Figure 2 are satisfied.
    The task of mapping a string W = w1&#183; &#183; &#183;wn to a dependency graph satisfying these conditions is what we call dependency parsing.
