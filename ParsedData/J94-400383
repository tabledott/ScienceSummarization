count as many parameters as possible in each ambiguous case, but it is less important to test for detailed statistical significance, or to worry about the mutual effects of sense selections for adjacent words.
    In most of the above-mentioned papers, experimental results are reported for a small set of up to 12 preselected words, usually with two or three senses per word.
    In the current paper we have evaluated our method using a random set of example sentences, with no a priori selection of the words.
    This standard evaluation method, which is commonly used for other natural language processing tasks, provides a direct prediction for the expected success rate of the method when employed in a practical application.
    To compare results on different test data, it is useful to compare the precision of the disambiguation method with some a priori figure that reflects the degree of ambiguity in the text.
    Reporting the number of senses per example word corresponds to the expected success rate of rand
