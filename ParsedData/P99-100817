hines at our disposal, so still larger corpora would not be out of the question.
    Finally, as noted above, Hearst [2] tried to find parts in corpora but did not achieve good results.
    She does not say what procedures were used, but assuming that the work closely paralleled her work on hyponyms, we suspect that our relative success was due to our very large corpus and the use of more refined statistical measures for ranking the output.
