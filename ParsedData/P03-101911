ssible but time consuming.
    The situation gets even worse when a trigram language model is used.
    Therefore, pruning techniques are obligatory to reduce the translation time.
    Pruning is applied to hypotheses that translate the same subsequence fjr jl of the source sentence.
    We use pruning in the following two ways.
    The first pruning technique is histogram pruning: we restrict the number of translation hypotheses per sequence fjr jl .
    For each sequence fjr jl , we keep only a fixed number of translation hypotheses.
    The second pruning technique is threshold pruning: the idea is to remove all hypotheses that have a low probability relative to the best hypothesis.
    Therefore, we introduce a threshold pruning parameter q, with 0 &lt; q &lt; 1.
    Let Q3&#65533;l,jr denote the maximum probability of all translation hypotheses for fjr Applying these pruning techniques the computational costs can be reduced significantly with almost no loss in translation quality.
