n be had when document level decisions are modeled (JointStructured).
    In many cases, these improvements are highly statistically significant.
    On the document level, performance can also be improved by incorporating sentence level decisions &#8211; though these improvements are not consistent.
    This inconsistency may be a result of the model overfitting on the small set of training data.
    We suspect this because the document level error rate is a slight improvement in performance suggesting on the Mp3 training set converges to zero much that an iterative approach might be beneficial.
    That more rapidly for the Joint-Structured model than the is, a system could start by classifying documents, Document-Classifier.
    This suggests that the Joint- use the document information to classify sentences, Structured model might be relying too much on use the sentence information to classify documents, the sentence level sentiment features &#8211; in order to and repeat until convergence.
    However, e
