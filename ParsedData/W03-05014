tening the sentence; there is no statistical model, which means we do not require any prior training on a large corpus of story/headline pairs.
    Linguistically motivated heuristics have been used by (McKeown et al, 2002) to distinguish constituents of parse trees which can be removed without affecting grammaticality or correctness.
    GLEANS (Daum&#233; et al, 2002) uses parsing and named entity tagging to fill values in headline templates.
    Consider the following excerpt from a news story: In this case, the words in bold form a fluent and accurate headline for the story.
    Italicized words are deleted based on information provided in a parse-tree representation of the sentence.
  
  
    Our approach is based on the selection of words from the original story, in the order that they appear in the story, and allowing for morphological variation.
    To determine the feasibility of our headline-generation approach, we first attempted to apply our &#8220;select-wordsin-order&#8221; technique by hand.
