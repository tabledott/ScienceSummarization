ypothesize that the large set of morphological features of Hebrew words, should be modeled by a compact morpheme model, based on the segmented words (into prefix, baseform, and suffix).
    Our main result is that best performance is obtained when learning segmentation and morpheme tagging in one step, which is made possible by an appropriate text representation.
  
  
    Several works have dealt with Hebrew tagging in the past decade.
    In Hebrew, morphological analysis requires complex processing according to the rules of Hebrew word formation.
    The task of a morphological analyzer is to produce all possible analyses for a given word.
    Recent analyzers provide good performance and documentation of this process (Yona and Wintner, 2005; Segal, 2000).
    Morphological analyzers rely on a dictionary, and their performance is, therefore, impacted by the occurrence of unknown words.
    The task of a morphological disambiguation system is to pick the most likely analysis produced by an analyzer in the c
