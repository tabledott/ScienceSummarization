as a predicate may require a certain role but allow it to be null instantiated.
    Our system for choosing the most likely overall assignment of roles for all the frame elements of a sentence uses an approximation that we derive beginning with the true probability of the optimal role assignment r*: where P(r1...n I t,f1...n) represents the probability of an overall assignment of roles ri to each of the n constituents of a sentence, given the target word t and the various features fi of each of the constituents.
    In the first step we apply Bayes&#8217; rule to this and in the second we make the assumption that the features of the various constituents of a sentence are independent given the target word and each constituent&#8217;s role and discard the term P(f1...n  |t), which is constant with respect to r: We estimate the prior over frame element assignments as the probability of the frame element groups, represented with the set operator {}: and finally discard the feature prior P(fi  |t) as being constan
