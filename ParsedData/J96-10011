    Collocations are notoriously difficult for non-native speakers to translate, primarily because they are opaque and cannot be translated on a word-by-word basis.
    We describe a program named Champollion which, given a pair of parallel corpora in two different languages and a list of collocations in one of them, automatically produces their translations.
    Our goal is to provide a tool for compiling bilingual lexical information above the word level in multiple languages, for different domains.
    The algorithm we use is based on statistical methods and produces p-word translations of n-word collocations in which n and p need not be the same.
    For example, Champollion translates make .
    .
    . decision, employment equity, and stock market into prendre .
    .
    . decision, equite en matiere d'emploi, and bourse respectively.
    Testing Champollion on three years' worth of the Hansards corpus yielded the French tran
