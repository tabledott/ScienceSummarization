 from a lexical anchor to its maximal projection.
    Since the direct object of kor has wh-moved out of its clause, the d-edge connecting it to the maximal projection of its verb has no SIC.
    The d-edge connecting the maximal projection of baasaan to the Aux component, however, has a SIC that allows only VP[wh: +, top: -] nodes to be inserted.
    The derivation proceeds as follows.
    We first subsert the embedded clause tree into the matrix clause tree.
    After that, we subsert the nominal arguments and function words.
    The derived structure is shown in Figure 8.
    The associated SA-tree is the desired, semantically motivated, dependency structure: the embedded clause depends on the matrix clause.
    In this section, we have discussed examples where the elementary objects have been obtained by projecting from lexical items.
    In these cases, we overcome both the problems with TAG considered in Section 1.
    The SICs considered here enforce the same notion of projection that was used in obtai
