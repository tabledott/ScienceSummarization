 since there would be correspondingly more derivations for each tree.
    Now, the desired one to one relationship holds: for every derivation in the new STSG there is an isomorphic derivation in the PCFG with equal probability.
    Thus, summing over all derivations of a tree in the STSG yields the same probability as summing over all the isomorphic derivations in the PCFG.
    Thus, every STSG tree would be produced by the PCFG with equal probability.
    It follows trivially from this that no extra trees are produced by the PCFG.
    Since the total probability of the trees produced by the STSG is 1, and the PCFG produces these trees with the same probability, no probability is &amp;quot;left over&amp;quot; for any other trees.
    There are several different evaluation metrics one could use for finding the best parse.
    In the section covering previous research, we considered the most probable derivation and the most probable parse tree.
    There is one more metric we could consider.
