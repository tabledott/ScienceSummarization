ng two directional (asymmetric) scores: the coverage of each word?s features by the other.
			The coverage of u by v is measured by: Cover(u, v) = ? f?F u ?F v w u (f) ? f?F u w u (f) The average can be arithmetic or harmonic: WeedsA(u, v) = 1 2 [Cover(u, v) + Cover(v, u)] WeedsH(u, v) = 2 ? Cover(u, v) ? Cover(v, u) Cover(u, v) + Cover(v, u) Weeds et al also used pmi for feature weights.
			Binary rule learning algorithms adopted suchlexical similarity approaches for learning rules between templates, where the features of each tem plate are its variable instantiations in a corpus, such as {X=?SCO?, Y =?IBM?}
			for the example in Section 1.
			Some works focused on learningrules from comparable corpora, containing com parable documents such as different news articles from the same date on the same topic (Barzilay and Lee, 2003; Ibrahim et al, 2003).
			Such corpora are highly informative for identifying variations of the same meaning, since, typically, when variableinstantiations are shared across comparable
