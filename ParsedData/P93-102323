sted our system on a 8.2 million word corpus of stock market reports from the Associated Press news wire.
    A subset of 21 of the adjectives in the corpus (Figure 2) was selected for practical reasons (mainly for keeping the evaluation task tractable).
    We selected adjectives that have one modified noun in common (problem) to ensure some semantic relatedness, and we included only adjectives that occurred frequently so that our similarity measure would be meaningful.
    The partition produced by the system for 9 clusters appears in Figure 3.
    Before presenting a formal evaluation of the results, we note that this partition contains interesting data.
    First, the results contain two clusters of gradable adjectives which fall in the same scale.
    Groups 5 and 8 contain adjectives that indicate the size, or scope, of a problem; by augmenting the system with tests to identify when an adjective is gradable, we could separate out these two groups from other potential scales, and perhaps consider combini
