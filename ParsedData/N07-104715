s search space while it has access to the same number of local features in the grapheme side.
    We propose to apply a supervised HMM method embedded with local classification to find the most likely sequence of phonemes given a word.
    An HMM is a statistical model that combines the observation likelihood (probability ofphonemes given letters) and transition likelihood (probability of current phoneme given previous phonemes) to predict each phoneme.
    Our approach differs from a basic Hidden Markov Model for letter-to-phoneme system (Taylor, 2005) that formulates grapheme sequences as observation states and phonemes as hidden states.
    The basic HMM system for L2P does not provide good performance on the task because it lacks context information on the grapheme side.
    In fact, a pronunciation depends more on graphemes than on the neighboring phonemes; therefore, the transition probability (language model) should affect the prediction decisions only when there is more than one possible phoneme that
