 the French data, can be used to calculate P(wiiti) as: Inspection of the raw projected tag data shows the need for an improved estimation of P(t1w).
    Temporarily excluding the case of compound alignments (e.g.
    NNS(,), Table 1 shows the observed frequency distributions of English tags projected onto four French words from 1-to-1 alignments, for the core N/V/J/R/I POS tags.
    Note that the total probability mass assigned to potentially correct tags (in bold) is relatively low, with fairly broad misassignment to incorrect tags for the given word.
    At the core tag level in particular, we observe empirically that words in French have a strong tendency to have only 1 possible core POS tag, and very rarely have more than 2.
    Even in English, with relatively high P(POSIw) ambiguity, only 0.37% of the tokens in the Brown Corpus are not covered by a word type's two most frequent core tags, and in French the percentage drops to 0.03%.
    Thus we employ an aggressive re-estimation in favor of this bias,
