tions are generated.
    An examplem: There is no Cb(4a) because no element of the preceding utterance is realized in (4a).
    The pronoun &amp;quot;them&amp;quot; in (4b) co-specifies &amp;quot;deer&amp;quot; but the BFP-algorithm generates two readings both of which are marked by a RETAIN transition.
    (4) a. Jim pulled the burlap sacks off the deer b. and Liz looked at them.
    In general, the strength of the centering model is that it is possible to use the Cb(U1) as the most preferred antecedent for a pronoun in U.
    In my model this effect is achieved by the preference for hearer-old discourse entities.
    Whenever this preference is misleading both approaches give wrong results.
    Since the Cb is defined strictly local while hearer-old discourse entities are defined global, my model produces less errors.
    In my model the preference is available immediately while the BFPalgorithm can use its preference not before the second utterance has been processed.
    The more global definition of hear
