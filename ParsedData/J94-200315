  The purpose of centering as part of a computational model  of discourse interpre- tation is to model  ATTENTIONAL STATE in discourse in order to control inference (Joshi and Kuhn 1979; Joshi and Weinstein 1981).
  3 Our approach to model ing attentional state is to explore aspects of the correlation between syntax and discourse function.
  This assumes that there are language conventions about discourse salience and that conversants attempt o maintain a sense of shared context.
  2 While native speakers understandably found some of these xamples "stilted" or "awkward," they were still able to give their judgments based on the information that was provided in the discourses.
  3 Recent work in situation theory proposes to control computation with a similar notion of background information i  terms of constants of the situation that thus are not explicitly realized in an utterance (Nakashima 1990).
  The situation-theoretic work does not as yet
