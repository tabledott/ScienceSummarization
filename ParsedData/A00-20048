).
    Given the quality of an algorithm is task dependent, the following experiments focus on the relative performance.
    Our evaluation strategy is a variant of that described in (Reynar, 1998, 71-73) and the TDT segmentation task (Allan et al., 1998).
    We assume a good algorithm is one that finds the most prominent topic boundaries.
    An artificial test corpus of 700 samples is used to assess the accuracy and speed performance of segmentation algorithms.
    A sample is a concatenation of ten text segments.
    A segment is the first n sentences of a randomly selected document from the Brown corpus'.
    A sample is characterised by the range of n. The corpus was generated by an automatic procedure5.
    Table 1 presents the corpus statistics. p(erroriref, hyp, k) = p(misslref, hyp, diff, k)p(diffl ref, k)+ (6) p(fairef, hyp, same, k)p(samelref, k) Speed performance is measured by the average number of CPU seconds required to process a test sample6.
    Segmentation accuracy is measured by the error
