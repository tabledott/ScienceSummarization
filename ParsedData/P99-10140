  Inducing A Semantically Annotated Lexicon Via EM-Based Clustering
  
    We present a technique for automatic induction of slot annotations for subcategorization frames, based on induction of hidden classes in the EM framework of statistical estimation.
    The models are empirically evalutated by a general decision test.
    Induction of slot labeling for subcategorization frames is accomplished by a further application of EM, and applied experimentally on frame observations derived from parsing large corpora.
    We outline an interpretation of the learned representations as theoretical-linguistic decompositional lexical entries.
  
  
    An important challenge in computational linguistics concerns the construction of large-scale computational lexicons for the numerous natural languages where very large samples of language use are now available.
    Resnik (1993) initiated research into the automatic acquisition of semantic selectional restrictions.
    Ribas (1994) presented an approach which takes int
