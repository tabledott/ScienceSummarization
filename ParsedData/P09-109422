 similar to our paraphrase generation process.
    Besides, they also used paraphrase patterns extracted from bilingual parallel corpora (like our PT-4) as a kind of rewriting resource.
    However, as most other sentence compression methods, their method allows information loss after compression, which means that the generated sentences are not necessarily paraphrases of the source sentences.
    Sentence Simplification: Carroll et al. (1999) has proposed an automatic text simplification method for language-impaired readers.
    Their method contains two main parts, namely the lexical simplifier and syntactic simplifier.
    The former one focuses on replacing words with simpler synonyms, while the latter is designed to transfer complex syntactic structures into easy ones (e.g., replacing passive sentences with active forms).
    Our method is, to some extent, simpler than Carroll et al.&#8217;s, since our method does not contain syntactic simplification strategies.
    We will try to address sentence restru
