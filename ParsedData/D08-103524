    2006).
    This dataset includes transcripts of 75 multi-party meetings, of which 25 are annotated for segment boundaries.
    For text, we introduce a dataset in which each document is a chapter selected from a medical textbook (Walker et al., 1990).7 The task is to divide each chapter into the sections indicated by the author.
    This dataset contains 227 chapters, with 1136 sections (an average of 5.00 per chapter).
    Each chapter contains an average of 140 sentences, giving an average of 28 sentences per segment.
    Metrics All experiments are evaluated in terms of the commonly-used Pk (Beeferman et al., 1999) and WindowDiff (WD) (Pevzner and Hearst, 2002) scores.
    Both metrics pass a window through the document, and assess whether the sentences on the edges of the window are properly segmented with respect to each other.
    WindowDiff is stricter in that it requires that the number of intervening segments between the two sentences be identical in the hypothesized and the reference se
