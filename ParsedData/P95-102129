 a E D and let 7 be the result of subserting or sister-adjoining the d-trees 7',.
    &#8226; 7k into a where 71, ,-y, are all in T1... ,(G), with the subsertions taking place at different substitution nodes in a as the footnote.
    Only substitutable components of -y1,...,-yk can be substituted in these subsertions.
    Only the new components of 7 that came from a are marked as substitutable in 7.
    Let r1, , kbe the SA-trees for 71, , 7k, respectively.
    The SA-tree 7 for 7 has root labelled by the name for a and k subtrees 71, , 7k.
    The edge from the root of r to the root of the subtree 7i is labelled by i (1 &lt; i &lt; k) defined as follows.
    Suppose that 7i was subserted into a and the root of ri is labelled by the name of some a' E D. Only components of a' will have been marked as substitutable in 7.
    Thus, in this subsertion some component ai(j) will have been substituted at a node in a with address n. In this case, the label 1 is the pair (j, n).
    Alternatively, 7i will have 'Due t
