 would surely lead to interesting results.
    But it is unlikely that they would lead to much better sets of associations among sentences than are to be found in the SATs that our present program produces, and it was mainly these results that we were interested in from the outset.
    The other avenues we have mentioned concern improvements in the WAT which, for us, was always a secondary interest.
  
  
    We present an algorithm for aligning texts with their translations that is based only on internal evidence.
    The relaxation process rests on a notion of which word in one text corresponds to which word in the other text that is essentially based on the similarity of their distributions.
    It exploits a partial alignment of the word level to induce a maximum likelihood alignment of the sentence level, which is in turn used, in the next iteration, to refine the word level estimate.
    The algorithm appears to converge to the correct sentence alignment in only a few iterations.
