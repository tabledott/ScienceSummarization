hat the missing object unifies with the modified NP, and we obtain the desired dependencies: This analysis of movement in terms of functors over incomplete constituents allows CCG to use the same category for the verb when its arguments are extracted as when they are in situ.
    This includes not only relative clauses and wh-questions, but also piedpiping, tough movement, topicalization, and clefts.
    For our translation algorithm, the *T* traces are essential: They indicate the presence of a long-range dependency for a particular argument of the verb, and allow us to use a mechanism similar to GPSG&#8217;s slash-feature passing (Gazdar et al. 1985), so that long-range dependencies are represented in the gold-standard dependency structures of the test and training data.
    This is crucial to correctly inducing and evaluating grammars and parsers for any expressive formalism, including TAG, GPSG, HPSG, LFG, and MPG.
    A detailed description of this mechanism and of our treatment of other constructions th
