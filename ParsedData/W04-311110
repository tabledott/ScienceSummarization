y references (e.g. this variation); and 3) it provides a single structure capable of capturing the breadth of variation specifications (e.g.
    A- T point mutation at base pair 47, A48- G or t(11;14)(q13;32)).
    Malignancy The guidelines for malignancy annotation are under development.
    We are planning to define it in a manner analogous to variation, whereby a Malignancy is composed of various attribute types (such as developmental stage, behavior, topographic site, and morphology).
    In the CYP Inhibition annotation task we are tagging three types of entities: Each category has its own questions and uncertainties.
    Names like CYP2C19 and cytochrome P450 enzymes proclaim their membership, but there are many aliases and synonyms that do not proclaim themselves, such as 17,20-lyase.
    We are compiling a list of such names.
    Other substances is a potentially huge and vaguelydelimited set, which in the current corpus includes grapefruit juice and red wine as well as more obviously biochemical enti
