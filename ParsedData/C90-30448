  This step divides into two sub-steps; the main composing step and validity checking.
  In the main composing step, there is no ambi- guity with one exception.
  Because an add- command [a,&lt;ID&gt;,&lt;ME&gt;] specifies only the parent node(&lt;ID&gt;) to add the tree(&lt;ME&gt;), there are some choices in composing English word- dependency trees.
  In this step, all possibilities are generated.
  Validity of the composed word-dependency trees are checked using syntactic categories.
  Validity is checked in every parent-children unit.
  For example, in the above target word- dependency tree, [v, [p,p] ] , [p,  [prom ], [p, [n] ], In, [aux] ] .
  A unit is valid if there is a unit which has the same category pattern in t
