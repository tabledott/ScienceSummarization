    In this work, we mainly consider the GEOQUERY domain, where a query language based on Prolog is used to query a database on U.S. geography (Zelle and Mooney, 1996).
    The query language consists of logical forms augmented with meta-predicates for concepts such as smallest and count.
    Figure 1 shows two sample logical forms and their English glosses.
    Throughout this paper, we use the notation x1, x2,... for logical variables.
    Although Prolog logical forms are the main focus of this paper, our algorithm makes minimal assumptions about the target MRL.
    The only restriction on the MRL is that it be defined by an unambiguous context-free grammar (CFG) that divides a logical form into subformulas (and terms into subterms).
    Figure 2(a) shows a sample parse tree of a logical form, where each CFG production corresponds to a subformula.
  
  
    Our work is based on the WASP semantic parsing algorithm (Wong and Mooney, 2006), which translates NL sentences into MRs using an SCFG.
