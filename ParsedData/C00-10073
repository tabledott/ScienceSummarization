ealiza- tion stages.
  The structure of the paper is as tbllows.
  In Section 2, we present he underlying rammat- ical tbrmalism, lexicalized tree-adjoining gram- mar (LTAG).
  In Section 3, we describe the ar- chitecture of the system, and some of the mod- ules.
  In Section 4 we discuss three experiments.
  In Section 5 we colnpare our work to that of Langkilde and Knight (1998a).
  We conclude with a summary of on-going work.
  2 Modeling Syntax In order to model syntax, we use an existing wide-coverage grammar of English, the XTAG grammar developed at the University of Peru&gt; sylvania (XTAG-Gronp, 1999).
  XTAG is a tree~ adjoining grammar (TAG) (Joshi, 1987a).
