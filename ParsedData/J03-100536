for further consideration only hypotheses with a probability close to the maximum probability.
    The number of surviving hypotheses is controlled by four kinds of thresholds: For the coverage and the cardinality pruning, the probability Qe,(e, C, j) is adjusted to take into account the uncovered source sentence positions C&#175; = {1, ... , J}\C.
    To make this adjustment, for a source word f at an uncovered source position, we precompute an upper bound &#175;p(f) for the product of language model and lexicon probability: The above optimization is carried out only over the word trigrams (e, e', e'') that have actually been seen in the training data.
    Additionally, the observation pruning described below is applied to the possible translations e of a source word f. The upper bound is used in the beam search concept to increase the comparability between hypotheses covering different coverage sets.
    Even more benefit from the upper bound &#175;p(f) can be expected if the distortion and the fertility pr
