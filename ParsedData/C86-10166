(1 f set )  (2 f se t  sub ject ) ) ((2 f se t  form) f in i te ) ) The first specit~cation is an analogue of an I.F~; T = annotat ion;  the S node inher i ts  its feature set from the VP.
  In addition, N[ is VPs subject and vps feature set contains the feature [form: finite].
  I) IATI{ compiles this rule to the following graph.
  (From now on, we shal l  omit the two non-const i tuent  a tr ibutes,  arity and labels, fi-om our display.)
  ~cat - -S O--  - .

  / / fo r i~f in i te fset  ~C.suba~ct"-~ [ 1 As the graph shows, the feature set of the S-node is the same as VPS feature set.
  The NP const i tuent  has been unified with the subject in the feature set of the S and the vp.
  2.2 Specif icat ions In the above rule, the cat feature is interpreted by [) PATR as a const ra int  on the manner  in which the const i tuent  can be instant iated.
  More constra ints  can be added by annotat ing  the rule with specifications.
