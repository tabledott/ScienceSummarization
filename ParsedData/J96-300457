propose a surname-driven, non-stochastic, rule-based system for identifying personal names.'
    Wang, Li, and Chang also compare their performance with Chang et al. 's system.
    Fortunately, we were able to obtain a copy of the full set of sentences from Chang et al. on which Wang, Li, and Chang tested their system, along with the output of their system!'
    In what follows we will discuss all cases from this set where our performance on names differs from that of Wang, Li, and Chang.
    Examples are given in Table 4.
    In these examples, the names identified by the two systems (if any) are underlined; the sentence with the correct segmentation is boxed!'
    The differences in performance between the two systems relate directly to three issues, which can be seen as differences in the tuning of the models, rather than representing differences in the capabilities of the model per se.
    The first issue relates to the completeness of the base lexicon.
    The Wang, Li, and Chang system fails on fragment
