e instructed the subjects to resolve conflicts according- to a preference ranking, i.e., to choose a class with higher preference when two classes seemed equally applicable.
    The ranking was (from most preferred to least preferred): 1) anaphoric (same head), 2) larger situation/unfamiliar, and 3) associative.
    The annotators were given one text to familiarize themselves with the task before starting with the annotation proper. annotator (henceforth, Annotator A) are shown in Table 2, and those of the second annotator (henceforth, Annotator B) in Table 3.
    As the tables indicate, the annotators assigned approximately the same percentage of definite descriptions to each of the five classes as we did; however, the classes do not always include the same elements.
    This can be gathered by the confusion matrix in Table 4, where an entry mx,y indicates the number of definite descriptions assigned to class x by subject A and to class y by subject B.
