distribution of the entire MWE, and Vallada Moir&#180;on &amp; Tiedemann (2006), who use a word-alignment strategy to identify non-compositional MWEs making use of parallel texts.
    Schone &amp; Jurafsky (2001) applied LSA to MWE identification, althought they did not focus on distinguishing compositional from non-compositional MWEs.
    Lin&#8217;s goal, like ours, was to discriminate noncompositional MWEs from compositional MWEs.
    His method was to compare the mutual information measure of the constituents parts of an MWE with the mutual information of similar expressions obtained by substituting one of the constituents with a related word obtained by thesaurus lookup.
    The hope was that a significant difference between these measures, as in the case of red tape (mutual information: 5.87) compared to yellow tape (3.75) or orange tape (2.64), would be characteristic of non-compositional MWEs.
    Although intuitively appealing, Lin&#8217;s algorithm only achieves precision and recall of 15.7% and 13.
