ince TAG allows for a notion of derivation independent from the trees that are derived, a precise mathematical definition of the SLTAG derivation must be given.
			For this purpose, we use stochastic linear in- dexed grammars (SLIG) to formally express SLTAGs derivations.
			Linear Indexed grammar (LIG) (Alto, 1968; Gazdar, 1985) is a rewriting system in which the non-terminal symbols are augmented with a stack, in addition to rewriting non-terminals, the rules of the grammar can have the effect of pushing or popping symbols on top of tile stacks that are associated with each non-terminal symbol.
			A specific rule is triggered by the non-termlnal on the left hand side of the rule and the top element of its associated stack.
			The productions of a LIG are restricted to copy the stack corresponding to tile non-terminal being rewrit- ten to at most one stack associated with a non-terminal symbol on tile right hand side of the production?
			In tile following, \[..p\] refers to a possibly unbounded stack whose
