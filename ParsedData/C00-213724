  5One examI)le is the RANDU routine on the IBM360 (Forsythe t al., 1977, See.
  We run the 1048576 shuttles a seeond time and colnpare the two sets of results.
  We also use tile same shutttes to calcu- late the statistical significance for the recall metric, and compare this significance value with the significance value found for recall analytically by the sign test.
  An example of using randomization is to com- pare two different methods on finding modifier relations ill the same test set,.
  The results on the test; set, are: Method ~ ~  Precision F-score t i _l_556t  I 49.5% 47.5% Zl: 64.1% 35.2% Two questions being tested are whether the ap- parent ilnt)rovement in reca.ll and F-score f!rom using method I is significant.
  Also being tested is whether the apparent imt)rovenmnt; in pleci- sion flom using method Ii is significant.
