probability that the former is a transliteration of the latter.
    Thresholding this probability would lead to a phonetic cognate matching predicate for English/Japanese bitexts.
    The threshold would need to be optimized together with SIMR's other parameters, the same way the LCSR threshold is currently optimized (see Section 5).
    Cognates are more common in bitexts from more similar language pairs, and from text genres where more word borrowing occurs, such as technical texts.
    In the nontechnical Canadian Hansards (parliamentary debate transcripts published in English and in French), an LCSR cutoff of .58 finds cognates for roughly one quarter of all text tokens.
    Even distantly related languages like English and Czech will share a large number of orthographic cognates in the form of proper nouns, numerals, and punctuation.
    When one or both of the languages involved is written in pictographs, cognates can still be found among punctuation and numerals.
    However, these kinds of cognates ar
