pus that we used was the German-English section of the Europarl corpus, version 2 (Koehn, 2002).
    We produced automatic alignments for it with the Giza++ toolkit (Och and Ney, 2003).
    Because we wanted to test our method independently of the quality of word alignment algorithms, we also developed a gold standard of word alignments for the set of phrases that we wanted to paraphrase.
    The gold standard alignments were created by highlighting all occurrences of the English phrase to paraphrase and manually aligning it with its German equivalent by correcting the automatic alignment, as shown in Figure 3a.
    All occurrences of its German equivalents were then highlighted, and aligned with their English translations (Figure 3b).
    The other words in the sentences were left with their automatic alignments.
    We evaluated the accuracy of each of the paraphrases that was extracted from the manually aligned data, as well as the top ranked paraphrases from the experimental conditions detailed below in S
