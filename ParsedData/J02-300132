ry is used in the subject position of the subordinate clause and is co-indexed with the NP Congress in the direct-object position of the main clause.
    The empty category, however, is not used in the statistical model of the parser or shown in its output and is also not used by the FrameNet annotation, which would mark the NP Congress as a frame element of raise in this example.
    Thus, the value of our path feature from the target word raise to the frame element Congress would be VBTVPTVPTSTVPtNP, and from the target word of persuaded the path to Congress would be the standard direct-object path VBTVPtNP.

    Our parser output, however, does not include this additional information, but rather simpl
