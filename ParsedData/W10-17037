pleting at least 3 screens, whose P(A) with others (see 3.2) is less than 0.33.
    Out of seven such annotators, four were affiliated with shared task teams.
    The other three had no apparent affiliation, and so we discarded their data, less than 5% of the total data.
    6Whenever an annotator appears to have spent more than ten minutes on a single screen, we assume they left their station and left the window open, rather than actually needing more than ten minutes.
    In those cases, we assume the time spent to be ten minutes.
    Each screen for this task involved judging translations of three consecutive source segments.
    For each source segment, the annotator was shown the outputs of five submissions.
    For each of the language pairs, there were more than 5 submissions.
    We did not attempt to get a complete ordering over the systems, and instead relied on random selection and a reasonably large sample size to make the comparisons fair.
    Relative ranking is our official evaluation metric.
