n Safety Board&#8217;s aviation accident database (Accidents).
    Both corpora have documents of comparable length&#8212;the average number of sentences is 10.4 and 11.5, respectively.
    For each set, we used 100 source articles with up to 20 randomly generated permutations for training.5 A similar method was used to obtain the test data.
    Table 4 shows the size of the training and test corpora used in our experiments.
    We held out 10 documents (i.e., 200 pairwise rankings) from the training data for development purposes.
    Features and Parameter Settings.
    In order to investigate the contribution of linguistic knowledge on model performance we experimented with a variety of grid representations resulting in different parameterizations of the feature space from which our model is learned.
    We focused on three sources of linguistic knowledge&#8212;syntax, coreference resolution, and salience&#8212;which play a prominent role in entity-based analyses of disBarzilay and Lapata Modeling Local Coh
