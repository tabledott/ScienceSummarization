			Labeler quality: if the labelers have low quality, combine them might not bring much im provement (Sheng et al, 2008).
			In our case, each source is treated as a labeler; ? Number of labels provided by the labelers:if the labels are informative, i.e., the prob ability of them being correct is higher than 0.5, the more the number of labels, the higher is the performance of a classifier built from them (Sheng et al, 2008); ? Labeler bias: the labeled data provided by the labelers might be only a subset of the real data distribution.
			For instance, labelers might be interested in only providing labels that they are more confident about;?
			Different labeler bias: if labelers make simi lar mistakes, the combination of them might not bring much improvement.
			We provide an empirical analysis of these datasets to address these points.
			First, we measurethe polarity detection quality of a source by calcu lating the probability p of a label from this source being correct.
			We us
