itation contexts).
    To test if such a simple approach would be enough, we performed a text categorization experiment, using the Rainbow implementation of a naive Bayes term frequency times inverse document frequency (TF*IDF) method (McCallum 1997) and considering each sentence as a &#8220;document.&#8221; The result was a classification performance of K = .30; the classifier nearly always chooses OWN and OTHER segments.
    The rare but important categories AIM, BACKGROUND, CONTRAST, and BASIS could be retrieved only with low precision and recall.
    Therefore, text classification methods do not provide a solution to our problem.
    This is not surprising, given that the definition of our task has little to do with the distribution of &#8220;content-bearing&#8221; words and phrases, much less so than the related task of topic segmentation (Morris and Hirst 1991; Hearst 1997; Choi 2000), or Saggion and Lapalme&#8217;s (2000) approach to the summarization of scientific articles, which relies on scientific
