y the word client belongs to WordNet?s consumer class.
			The cluster is ranked very low because WordNet failed to consider words like patient, tenant and renter as consumers.
			Table 3 shows that even the lowest ranking CBC clusters are fairly coherent.
			The features associated with each cluster can be used to classify previously unseen words into one or more existing clusters.
			Table 4 shows the clusters containing the word cell that are discovered by various clustering algorithms from S13403.
			The underlined words represent the words that belong to the cell class in WordNet.
			The CBC cluster corresponds almost exactly to WordNet?s cell class.
			K-means and Buckshot produced fairly coherent clusters.
			The cluster constructed by Bisecting K-means is obviously of inferior quality.
			This is consistent with the fact that Bisecting K-means has a much lower score on S13403 compared to CBC, K means and Buckshot.
