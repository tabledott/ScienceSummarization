nditional relation of an analysis given an example is considered relevant, whereas in maximum likelihood estimation the joint probability of the training data to best describe observations is maximized.
    Since the discriminative task is kept in mind during estimation, discriminative methods can yield improved performance.
    In our case, discriminative criteria cannot be defined directly with respect to &#8220;correct labels&#8221; or &#8220;gold standard&#8221; parses since the WSJ annotations are not sufficient to disambiguate the more complex LFG parses.
    However, instead of retreating to unsupervised estimation techniques or creating small LFG treebanks by hand, we use the labeled bracketing of the WSJ training sections to guide discriminative estimation.
    That is, discriminative criteria are defined with respect to the set ofparses consistent with the WSJ annotations.1 The objective function in our approach, denoted by P(&#955;), is the joint of the negative log-likelihood &#8722;L(&#955;) and
