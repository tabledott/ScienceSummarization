			would all be ex tracted by the ?&lt;subj&gt; complained?
			pattern.Each extraction pattern has frequency and prob ability values produced by AutoSlog-SE, hence we create four IE pattern-based features for each token xi: SourcePatt-Freq, SourceExtr-Freq, SourcePatt-Prob, and SourceExtr-Prob, where the frequency values are divided into threeranges: {0, 1, 2+} and the probability values are di vided into five ranges of equal size.
	
	
			We used the Multi-Perspective Question Answering (MPQA) corpus4 for our experiments.
			This corpus 4The MPQA corpus can be freely obtained at http://nrrc.mitre.org/NRRC/publications.htm.consists of 535 documents that have been manually annotated with opinion-related information in cluding direct and indirect sources.
