    One of the disadvantages of the cross-validation training methodology, which averages performance across a large number of random test sets, is that we do not have performance data for each verb, nor for each class of verbs.
    In another set of experiments, we used the same C5.0 system, but employed a single hold-out training and testing methodology.
    In this approach, we hold out a single verb vector as the test case, and train the system on the remaining 58 cases.
    We then test the resulting classifier on the single hold-out case, and record the assigned class for that verb.
    This procedure is repeated for each of the 59 verbs.
    As noted above, the single hold-out methodology has the benefit of yielding both classification results on each individual verb, and an overall accuracy rate (the average results across all 59 trials).
    Moreover, the results on individual verbs provide the data necessary for determining accuracy for each verb class.
    This allows us to determine the contr
