211;4 and a single predicate for lengths greater than 4.
    Titlecase applies to words with an initial uppercase letter followed by all lowercase (e.g.
    Mr).
    Mixedcase applies to words with mixed lower- and uppercase (e.g.
    CityBank).
    The length predicates encode the number of characters in the word from 1 to 15, with a single predicate for lengths greater than 15.
    The next set of contextual predicates encode extra information about NE tags in the current context.
    The memory NE tag predicate (see e.g.
    Malouf (2002)) records the NE tag that was most recently assigned to the current word.
    The use of beam-search tagging means that tags can only be recorded from previous sentences.
    This memory is cleared at the beginning of each document.
    The unigram predicates (see e.g.
    Tsukamoto et al. (2002)) encode the most probable tag for the next words in the window.
    The unigram probabilities are relative frequencies obtained from the training data.
