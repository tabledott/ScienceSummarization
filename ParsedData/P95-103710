lation estimates a model P(flhi 112 .
    &#8226; &#8226; hn-1) by using a linear combination of empirical models P(fihki hk, . h,.
    ), where m &lt; n and k1_1 &lt; ki &lt; n for all i &lt; m. For example, a model P(f Ihi h2h3) might be interpolated as follows: where E Ai (hi h2h3) = 1 for all histories hi h2h3.
    The optimal values for the Ai functions can be estimated using the forward-backward algorithm (Baum, 1972).
    A decision-tree model can be represented by an interpolated n-gram model as follows.
    A leaf node in a decision tree can be represented by the sequence of question answers, or history values, which leads the decision tree to that leaf.
    Thus, a leaf node defines a probability distribution based on values of those questions: P(f Ihkihh .
    .
    . hk..), where m &lt; n and ki_I &lt; k &lt; n, and where hk, is the answer to one of the questions asked on the path from the root to the leaf.'
    But this is the same as one of the terms in the interpolated n-gram model.
    So, a d
