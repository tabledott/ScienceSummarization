ined by the experimenter and are dependent on the use of the retrieved collocations.
    As described in Smadja (1991), for language generation we found that (lco, k1, Lio) = (1, I, 10) gave good results, but for other tasks different thresholds might be preferable.
    In general, the lower the threshold the more data are accepted, the higher the recall, and the lower the precision of the results.
    Section 10 describes an evaluation of the results produced with the above thresholds.
    More formally, a peak, or lexical relation containing w, at this point is defined as a tuple (wi, distance, strength, spread , j) verifying the following set of inequalities: Some example results are given in Table 4.
    As shown in Smadja (1991), the whole first stage of Xtract as described above can be performed in 0(S log S) time, in which S is the size of the corpus.
    The third step of counting frequencies and maintaining the data structure dominates the whole process and as pointed out by Ken Church (personal comm
