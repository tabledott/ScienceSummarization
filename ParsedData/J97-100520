pect to control-based discourse segments, Walker and Whittaker (1990) showed that shifts of attentional state (Grosz and Sidner 1986) occurred when shifts in control were accepted by all dialogue participants.
    In sum, relatively few studies correlate linguistic devices with empirically justified discourse segmentations.
    Quantitative evaluations of the correlations include the use of statistical measures and information retrieval metrics.
    As discussed in Section 4, we derive discourse segmentations based on the statistical significance of the agreement among our subjects.
    In contrast to studies investigating a single feature, we investigate three types of linguistic devices&#8212;referential noun phrases, prosody, and cue phrases.
    In addition, we are concerned with the extra step of developing segmentation algorithms rather than with the demonstration of statistical correlations.
    We first develop algorithms using each type of linguistic device in isolation, motivated by existing hypothe
