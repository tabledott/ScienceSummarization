ize the actions of others.
    This will be further discussed in the following section.
    Actions model ways of changing the world.
    As with the operators in STRIPS (Fikes and Nilsson [1971]), the actions can be grouped into families represented by action schemas, which can be viewed as parameterized procedure definitions.
    An action schema consists of a name, a set of parameters with constraints and a set of labelled formulas in the following classes: Effects: Conditions that become true after the execution of the procedure.
    Body: a set of partially ordered goal states that must be achieved in the course of executing the procedure.
    In the examples given here, there will never be more than one goal state in a body.
    Preconditions: Conditions necessary to the successful execution of the procedure.
    We distinguish for voluntary actions a want precondition: the agent must want to perform the action, i.e. he must want the other preconditions to obtain, and the effects to become true through
