sh side, but no words on the source Chinese side.
    Sample syntaxbased insertion rules are: We notice that our decoder, however, frequently fails to insert words like is and are, which often have no equivalent in the Chinese source.
    We also notice that the-insertion rules sometimes have a good effect, as in the translation &#8220;in the bloom of youth,&#8221; but other times have a bad effect, as in &#8220;people seek areas of the conspiracy.&#8221; Each time the decoder uses (or fails to use) an insertion rule, it incurs some risk.
    There is no guarantee that the interaction of the rule probabilities and the language model provides the best way to manage this risk.
    We therefore provide MIRA with a feature for each of the most common English words appearing in insertion rules, e.g., insert-the and insert-is.
    There are 35 such features.
    We now turn to features that make use of source-side context.
    Although these features capture dependencies that cross boundaries between rules, they ar
