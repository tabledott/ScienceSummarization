  Cloeuru under  K le~ne gt.m~ Let G t =, (iI,At,NI,S1) be a TAG generating L t. We can show that we can construct a TAG G such that L(G) - .
  Let S be a symbol not in N t, and let N m N I U {S}.
  We let the set [ of initial trees of G be (re} .
  where t e is the tree shown in Fig 4.3~.
  The set o( auxiliary tree, A is defined u A = {t~A / t t ?
  The tree tlA is u shown in Fig 4.3b, with the coustraintm on the root of each tlA being the null adjoining constraint, an constraint~ on the foot, and the constraints on the nodes of the snbtreee t t of the tre~ ttA being the same sm thee for the corresponding nodes in the inithd tree t t of G I.
  To see why L(G) ,m Lt*, consider x ~ L(G).
  Obviously, the tree derived (whose frontier is given by x ) must be of the form ~howu in Fig 4.3?, where each t t is a sententinJ tree in GI~UCh t I E D(ti), for zn initial tree t i in G t. Thus,
