    Our work lies between these two directions; we attempt to discover parallelism at the level of fragments, which are longer than one word but shorter than a document.
    Thus, the previous research most relevant to this paper is that aimed at mining comparable corpora for parallel sentences.
    The earliest efforts in this direction are those of Zhao and Vogel (2002) and Utiyama and Isahara (2003).
    Both methods extend algorithms designed to perform sentence alignment of parallel texts: they use dynamic programming to do sentence alignment of documents hypothesized to be similar.
    These approaches are only applicable to corpora which are at most &#8220;noisy-parallel&#8221;, i.e. contain documents which are fairly similar, both in content and in sentence ordering.
    Munteanu and Marcu (2005) analyze sentence pairs in isolation from their context, and classify them as parallel or non-parallel.
    They match each source document with several target ones, and classify all possible senten
