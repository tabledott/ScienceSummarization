    There were, however, five cases where the judgments were unclear.
    These five were not scored.
    See Appendix C for details.
    Results The results of these comparisons are summarized in Table 6 (tensed clause) and Table 7 (infinitive).
    Each row shows the performance of the hypothesis-testing procedure for a different estimate p_s of the error-rate 7r_s.
    The first column shows the negative logarithm of p,, which is varied from 5 (1 error in 32 occurrences) to 13 (1 error in 8192 occurrences).
    The second column shows p&#8222; in decimal notation.
    The next four columns show the number of true positives (TP)-verbs judged +S both by machine and by hand; false positives (FP)-verbs judged -1-S by machine, -S by hand; true negatives (TN)-verbs judged -S both by machine and by hand; and false negatives (FN)-verbs judged -S by machine, -FS by hand.
    The numbers represent distinct verbs, not occurrences.
    The seventh column shows the number of verbs that were misclassified (MC)-the s
