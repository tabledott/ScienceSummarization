st ten words long and drawn from reviews or plot summaries of movies released post-2001, which prevents overlap with the polarity dataset.
    Subjectivity detectors As noted above, we can use our default polarity classifiers as &#8220;basic&#8221; sentencelevel subjectivity detectors (after retraining on the subjectivity dataset) to produce extracts of the original reviews.
    We also create a family of cut-based subjectivity detectors; these take as input the set of sentences appearing in a single document and determine the subjectivity status of all the sentences simultaneously using per-item and pairwise relationship information.
    Specifically, for a given document, we use the construction in Section 2.2 to build a graph wherein the source s and sink t correspond to the class of subjective and objective sentences, respectively, and each internal node vi corresponds to the document&#8217;s ith sentence si.
    We can set the individual scores ind1(si) to PrNB sub (si) and ind2(si) to 1 &#8722; PrNB sub
