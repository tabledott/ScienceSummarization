cision, recall and F1, results are slightly higher.
    Compared to state of the art results (50.05 % PCS in (anonymous reference) for the abstracts subcorpus), the system achieves an error reduction of 32.07 %, which shows that the system architecture presented in this paper leads to more accurate results.
    Evaluating the system in terms of a more relaxed measure (PCS-2) does not reflect a significant increase in its performance.
    This suggests that when a scope is incorrectly predicted, main content tokens are also incorrectly left out of the scope or added.
    An alternative to the PCS-2 measure would be to mark in the corpus the relevant negated content words and evaluate if they are under the scope.
    Results also show that the system is portable to different types of documents, although performance varies depending on the characteristics of the corpus.
    Clinical reports are easier to process than papers and abstracts, which can be explained by several factors.
    One factor is the length of
