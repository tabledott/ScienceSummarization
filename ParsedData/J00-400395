    Lexical and commonsense knowledge play three important roles in Sidner's system: they are used to track focus, to resolve bridging descriptions and larger situation uses, and to evaluate interpretive hypotheses, discarding those that seem implausible.
    Only recently have robust knowledge-based methods for some of these tasks begun to appear, and their performance is still not very good, as seen above in our discussion of using WordNet as a semantic network;33 as for checking the plausibility of a hypothesis on the basis of causal knowledge about the world, we now have a much better theoretical grasp of how such inferences could be made (see, for example, Hobbs et al. [1993] and Lascarides and Asher [1993]), but we are still quite a long way from a general inference engine.
    We also found that some of Sidner's resolution rules are too restrictive.
    For example, her Cospecification rule 1 prescribes that definite description and focus
