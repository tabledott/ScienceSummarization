k converted from Penn Treebank Section 23.
    This number expresses &#8220;lexical coverage&#8221; in the strong sense defined by Hockenmaier and Steedman (2002).
    In this notion of &#8220;coverage,&#8221; this lexicon has 84.1% sentential coverage, where this means that the lexicon can assign correct lexical entries to all of the words in a sentence.
    Although the parser might produce parse results for uncovered sentences, these parse results cannot be completely correct.
    The data for the training of the disambiguation models was the HPSG treebank derived from Sections 02&#8211;21 of the Wall Street Journal portion of the Penn Treebank, that is, the same set used for lexicon extraction.
    For training of the disambiguation models, we eliminated sentences of 40 words or more and sentences for which the parser could not produce the correct parses.
    The resulting training set consists of 33,604 sentences (when n = 10 and c = 0.95; see Section 5.4 for details).
