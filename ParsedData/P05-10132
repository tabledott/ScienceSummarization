ncy parser for Turkish by Oflazer (2003).
    This is in contrast to dependency treebanks, e.g.
    Prague Dependency Treebank (Haji&#711;c et al., 2001b), Danish Dependency Treebank (Kromann, 2003), and the METU Treebank of Turkish (Oflazer et al., 2003), which generally allow annotations with nonprojective dependency structures.
    The fact that projective dependency parsers can never exactly reproduce the analyses found in non-projective treebanks is often neglected because of the relative scarcity of problematic constructions.
    While the proportion of sentences containing non-projective dependencies is often 15&#8211;25%, the total proportion of non-projective arcs is normally only 1&#8211;2%.
    As long as the main evaluation metric is dependency accuracy per word, with state-of-the-art accuracy mostly below 90%, the penalty for not handling non-projective constructions is almost negligible.
    Still, from a theoretical point of view, projective parsing of non-projective structures has the drawback
