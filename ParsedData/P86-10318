uctural parallelism in anaphora interpretation.
    Then I will propose an additional dimension of the shared property called the &amp;quot;speaker identification&amp;quot; property.
    The revised constraint referring to both dimensions accounts for a group of counterexamples to the initial formulation found in Japanese discourse.
    It also sheds light on what is involved in interpreting perception reports in both languages.
    Before starting the discussion, I would like to comment on the nature of the data used here.
    I will mostly use constructed discourse sequences where the role played by commonsense inferences or special linguistic devices (such as stress and intonation) for guiding pronoun interpretations is minimal.
    All examples in this paper are to be read with flat intonation with unstressed pronouns.
    These limitations are in order to identify the grammatically-based default order that gives rise to preferred interpretations in neutral contexts.
    Note that this default order alone
