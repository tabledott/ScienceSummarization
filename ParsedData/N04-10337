entence length.
    In combination with the scaling factor this results in a constant cost per produced target language word.
    With this feature, we are able to adjust the sentence length.
    If we set a negative scaling factor, longer sentences are more penalized than shorter ones, and the system will favor shorter translations.
    Alternatively, by using a positive scaling factors, the system will favor longer translations.
    Similar to the word penalty, the phrase penalty feature results in a constant cost per produced phrase.
    The phrase penalty is used to adjust the average length of the phrases.
    A negative weight, meaning real costs per phrase, results in a preference for longer phrases.
    A positive weight, meaning a bonus per phrase, results in a preference for shorter phrases.
    We are using relative frequencies to estimate the phrase translation probabilities.
    Most of the longer phrases are seen only once in the training corpus.
    Therefore, pure relative frequencies overesti
