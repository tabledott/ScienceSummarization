 acquired Overture&#8221;, the system can use the known entailment relation to conclude that this phrase really indicates the desired answer.
    More examples of entailment relations, acquired by our method, can be found in Table 1 (section 4).
    To perform such inferences at a broad scale, applications need to possess a large knowledge base (KB) of entailment patterns.
    We estimate such a KB should contain from between a handful to a few dozens of relations per meaning, which may sum to a few hundred thousands of relations for a broad domain, given that a typical lexicon includes tens of thousands of words.
    Our research goal is to approach unsupervised acquisition of such a full scale KB.
    We focus on developing methods that acquire entailment relations from the Web, the largest available resource.
    To this end substantial improvements are needed in order to promote scalability relative to current Webbased approaches.
    In particular, we address two major goals: reducing dramatically the co
