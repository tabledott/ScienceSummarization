lation: 1Note that due to the corpus-level holistic nature of the BLEU score it is not trivial to compute the optimal set of oracle translations.
    We use a greedy search algorithm for the oracle translations that might find only a local optimum.
    Empirically, we do not observe a dependence on the starting point, hence we believe that this does not pose a significant problem. n-best list.
    The avBLEUr3 scores are computed with respect to three reference translations averaged over the four different choices of holding out one reference.
    The first method provides the theoretical upper bound of what BLEU score can be obtained by rescoring a given nbest list.
    Using this method with a 1000-best list, we obtain oracle translations that outperform the BLEU score of the human translations.
    The oracle translations achieve 113% against the human BLEU score on the test data (Table 1), while the first best translations obtain 79.2% against the human BLEU score.
    The second method uses a different r
