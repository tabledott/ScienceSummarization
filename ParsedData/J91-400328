uage will essentially be generated by the recursive principles of our semantic theory.
    One level of semantic description involves an event-based interpretation of a word or phrase.
    I will call this level the event structure of a word (cf.
    Pustejovsky 1991; Moens and Steedman 1988).
    The event structure of a word is one level of the semantic specification for a lexical item, along with its argument structure, qualia structure, and inheritance structure.
    Because it is recursively defined on the syntax, it is also a property of phrases and sentences.'
    I will assume a sortal distinction between three classes of events: states (es), processes (eP), and transitions (eT ) .
    Unlike most previous sortal classifications for events, I will adopt a subeventual analysis or predicates, as argued in Pustejovsky (1991) and independently proposed in Croft (1991).
    In this view, an event sort such as eT may be decomposed into two sequentially structured subevents, (e&amp;quot;, ss).
