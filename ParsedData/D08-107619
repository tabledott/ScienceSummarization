n G. The additivity of the cost function and the articulation point allow us to split the costs for any path from s to t into two portions: the first portion can be attributed to G1 and must be a line inside P1; the remainder can be attributed to G2 and must therefore be a line inside P2.
    Hence, the total costs for any path in G1can be bounded by the convex hull of the superposition of P1 and P2.
    This convex hull is again a convex polygon which consists of at most N1 + N2 edges, and therefore, the number of cost minimizing paths in G1' (and thus also in G) is upper bounded by NiN2.&#65533; &#10065; Corollary: The upper envelope for a phrase lattice Gf~p = (Vf, Efq) consists of at most |IEf |I line segments.
    This bound can even be refined and one obtains (proof omitted) |19 1 &#8212; I V I + 2.
    Both bounds are tight.
    This result may seem somewhat surprising as it states that, independent of the choice of the direction along which the line optimization is performed, the structure of the erro
