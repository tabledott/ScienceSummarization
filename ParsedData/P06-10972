s and the associated baselines.
    In Section 3, we present iteratively our contributions that eventually lead to absolute increases in alignment quality of 4.8% for French/English and 4.8% for Arabic/English, as measured using F-measure for large word alignment tasks.
    These contributions pertain to the casting of the training procedure in the discriminative framework (Section 3.1); the IBM model extensions and modified search procedure for the Viterbi alignments (Section 3.2); and the interleaved, minimum error/maximum likelihood, training algorithm (Section 4).
    In Section 5, we assess the impact that our improved alignments have on MT quality.
    We conclude with a comparison of our work with previous research on discriminative training for word alignment and a short discussion of semi-supervised learning.
  
  
    We conduct experiments on alignment and translation tasks using Arabic/English and French/English data sets (see Table 1 for details).
    Both sets have training data and two gold sta
