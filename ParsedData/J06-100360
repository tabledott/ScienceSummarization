olving only the first stage, and detection (D), involving both stages, as follows: Suspicion: PS = number of correct suspects number of suspects (21) RS = number of correct suspects number of malapropisms in text (22) FS = 2 ?
  RS PS + RS (23) Detection: PD = number of true alarms number of alarms (24) RD = number of true alarms number of malapropisms in text (25) FD = 2 ?
  RD PD + RD (26) The precision, recall, and F values are computed as the mean values of these statistics across our collection of 481 articles, which constitute a random sample from the population of all WSJ articles.
  All the comparisons that we make below, except for comparisons to baseline, are performed with the Bonferroni multiple-comparison technique (Agresti and Finlay 1997), with an overall significance level of .05.
