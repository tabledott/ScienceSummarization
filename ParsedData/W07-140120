    The accuracy achieved by the participating systems ranges from 49% to 80% (considering the best run of each group), while most of the systems obtained a score in between 59% and 66%.
    One submission, Hickl and Bensley achieved 80% accuracy, scoring 8% higher than the second system (Tatu and Moldovan, 72%), and obtaining the best absolute result achieved in the three RTE challenges.
    As far as the per-task results are concerned, the trend registered in RTE-2 was confirmed, in that there was a marked difference in the performances obtained in different task settings.
    In fact, the average accuracy achieved in the QA setting (0.71) was 20 points higher than that achieved in the IE setting (0.52); the average accuracy in the IR and Sum settings was 0.66 and 0.58 respectively.
    In RTE-2 the best results were achieved in SUM, while the lower score was always recorded in IE.
    As already pointed out by Bar-Haim (2006), these differences should be further inv
