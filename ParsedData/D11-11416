    For instance, tweets often start with a verb (where the subject &#8216;I&#8217; is implied), as in: &#8220;watchng american dad.&#8221; To overcome these differences in style and vocabulary, we manually annotated a set of 800 tweets (16K tokens) with tags from the Penn TreeBank tag set for use as in-domain training data for our POS tagging system, T-POS.4 We add new tags for the Twitter specific phenomena: retweets, @usernames, #hashtags, and urls.
    Note that words in these categories can be tagged with 100% accuracy using simple regular expressions.
    To ensure fair comparison in Table 2, we include a postprocessing step which tags these words appropriately for all systems.
    To help address the issue of OOV words and lexical variations, we perform clustering to group together words which are distributionally similar (Brown et al., 1992; Turian et al., 2010).
    In particular, we perform hierarchical cluste
