8); adding features designed to deal with coordination; and adding distance to the dependency features.
    Some of these extensions, such as increased lexicalization and generating a lexical category at its maximal projection, improved performance, whereas others, such as the coordination and distance features, reduced performance.
    Hockenmaier (2003a) conjectures that the reduced performance is due to the problem of data sparseness, which becomes particularly severe for the generative model when the number of features is increased.
    The best performing model outperforms that of Clark, Hockenmaier, and Steedman (2002), recovering CCG predicate&#8211;argument dependencies with an overall F-score of around 84% using a similar evaluation.
    Hockenmaier (2003b) presents another generative model of normal-form derivations, which is based on the dependencies in the predicate&#8211;argument structure, including long-range dependencies, rather than the dependencies defined by the local trees in the derivatio
