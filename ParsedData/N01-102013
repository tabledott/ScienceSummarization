0 word pairs, while the others contained 900 pairs.
    10(9)fold cross-validation experiments were performed in each case.
    The number of training pairs for the adaptive methods which remained after filtering out unlikely cognate pairs ranged from 621 (for Spanish) to 232 (for Romanian).
    For the purpose of evaluation, we constrained the candidate test set to have exactly one translation per source word.
    However, this property was not used to improve candidate alignment (e.g. via the pigeonhole principle).
    Table 1 shows results for different candidate distance functions for Spanish-Portuguese and FrenchPortuguese translation induction.
    The metrics depicted in the first three lines, namely Levenshtein distance (L), the HMM fenonic model (H), and the stochastic transducer (S), were previously described in Section 2.
    The other three methods are variants of Levenshtein distance where the costs for edit operations have been modified.
    In L-V, the substitution operations between vowels are
