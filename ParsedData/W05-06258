    In training, SNoW&#8217;s default parameters were used with the exception of the separator thickness 1.5, the use of average weight vector, and 5 training cycles.
    The parameters are optimized on the development set.
    Training for each system took about 6 hours.
    The evaluation on both test sets which included running Overall results on the development and test sets are shown in Table 1.
    Table 2 shows the results of individual systems and the improvement gained by the joint inference on the development set.
  
  
    We present an implementation of SRL system which composed of four stages&#8212;1) pruning, 2) argument identification, 3) argument classification, and 4) inference.
    The inference provides a natural way to take the output of multiple argument classifiers and combines them into a coherent predicate-argument output.
    Significant improvement in overall SRL performance through this inference is illustrated.
