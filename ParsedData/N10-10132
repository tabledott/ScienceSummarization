nt, while the meaning of a word clearly depends on context.
    The word club in &#8220;The caveman picked up the club&#8221; is similar to bat in &#8220;John hit the robber with a bat,&#8221; but not in &#8220;The bat flew out of the cave.&#8221; We present a new resource-lean vector-space model that represents a word&#8217;s meaning by a set of distinct &#8220;sense specific&#8221; vectors.
    The similarity of two isolated words A and B is defined as the minimum distance between one of A&#8217;s vectors and one of B&#8217;s vectors.
    In addition, a context-dependent meaning for a word is determined by choosing one of the vectors in its set based on minimizing the distance to the vector representing the current context.
    Consequently, the model supports judging the similarity of both words in isolation and words in context.
    The set of vectors for a word is determined by unsupervised word sense discovery (WSD) (Sch&#168;utze, 1998), which clusters the contexts in which a word appears.
