 the UNIQUE fillers match words (of the appropriate parts of speech) that are unique in the test data.
    Table 4 shows the results of testing the fixed-n-gram and the ugen-n-gram patterns identified as described above on the four data sets composing OP1.
    The freq columns give total frequencies, and the +prec columns show the improvements in precision from the baseline.
    The number of words in each data set and baseline precisions are given at the bottom of the table.
    For all n-gram features besides the fixed-4-grams and ugen-4-grams, the proportion of features in opinion pieces is significantly greater than the proportion of features in nonopinion pieces.3 The question arises, how much overlap is there between instances of fixed-n-grams and instances of ugen-n-grams?
    In the test data of Table 4, there are a total of 8,577 fixed-n-grams instances.
    Only 59 of these, fewer than 1% are contained (wholly or in part) in ugen-n-gram instances.
    This small intersection set shows that two diffe
