nts to say in English and then translates mentally into French before actually saying it.
    The task of the translation system is to recover the original English, E, from the observed French, F. While this may seem a bit far-fetched, it differs little in principle from using English as an interlingua or as a meaning representation language.
    As before, one minimizes one's chance of error by choosing E according to the formula: = argmaxPr(E) Pr(F E) As before, the parameters of the model are estimated by computing various statistics over large samples of text.
    The prior probability, Pr(E), is estimated in exactly the same way as discussed above for the speech recognition application.
    The parameters of the channel model, Pr(F I E), are estimated from a parallel text that has been aligned by an automatic procedure that figures out which parts of the source text correspond to which parts of the target text.
    See Brown et al. (1993) for more details on the estimation of the parameters.
