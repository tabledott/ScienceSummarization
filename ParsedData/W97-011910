rsely, we need a larger segment size if seed word frequency is low.
    Consequently, we use the paragraph as the segment size for our experiment on Wall Street Journal/Nikkei Corpus since all the seed words are mid-frequency content words.
    We computed all binary vectors of the 1,416 seed words w, where the i-th dimension of the vector is 1 if the seed word occurs in the i-th paragraph in the text, zero otherwise.
    We use a smaller segment size &#8212; between any two punctuations &#8212; for the segment size for the Wall Street Journal English/English corpus since many of the seed words are frequent.
    Next, Pr(wz = 1) is computed for all unknown words z in both texts.
    The WoRM vectors are then sorted according to W(wz, w,i).
    The most correlated seed word w&#8222;.
    ; will have the top scoring W(wz, As an example, using 307 seed word pairs in the WSJ/WSJ corpus, we obtain the following most correlated seed words with debentures in two different years of Wall Street Journal as shown in Fig
