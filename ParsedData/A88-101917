y, the parser probably also has to accept &amp;quot;bird&amp;quot; as an intransitive verb, since there is nothing syntactically wrong with: These part of speech assignments aren't wrong; they are just extremely improbable.
  
  
    Consider once again the sentence, &amp;quot;I see a bird.&amp;quot; The problem is to find an assignment of parts of speech to words that optimizes both lexical and contextual probabilities, both of which are estimated from the Tagged Brown Corpus.
    The lexical probabilities are estimated from the following frequencies: (PPSS = pronoun; NP = proper noun; VB = verb; U11 = intellection; IN = preposition; AT = article; NN = noun) The lexical probabilities are estimated in the obvious way.
    For example, the probability that &amp;quot;I&amp;quot; is a pronoun, Prob(PPSS I &amp;quot;I&amp;quot;), is estimated as the freq(PPSS I &amp;quot;I&amp;quot;)/freq(&amp;quot;I&amp;quot;) or 5837/5838.
    The probability that &amp;quot;see&amp;quot; is a verb is estimated to be 771/772.
