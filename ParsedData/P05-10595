the parse tree.
    For instance, the probability of the parse in Figure 1 is: It is important to note that besides the bottomlevel word-pairing rules, the other rules are all nonlexical, which means the structural alignment component of the model is not sensitive to the lexical contents of subtrees.
    Although the ITG model can effectively restrict the space of alignment to make polynomial time parsing algorithms possible, the preference for inverted or straight rules only passively reflect the need of bottom level word alignment.
    We are interested in investigating how much help it would be if we strengthen the structural alignment component by making the orientation choices dependent on the real lexical pairs that are passed up from the bottom.
    The first step of lexicalization is to associate a lexical pair with each nonterminal.
    The head word pair generation rules are designed for this purpose: The word pair e/f is representative of the lexical content of X in the two languages.
