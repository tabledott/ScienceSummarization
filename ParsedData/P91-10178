al lexicon which maps each Hebrew sense separately into its possible translations, similar to a Hebrew-Hebrew-English lexicon (like the Oxford English-English-Hebrew dictionary (Hornby et al., 1986)).
    In some cases, different senses of a Hebrew word map to the same word also in English.
    In these cases, the lexical relations of each sense cannot be identified in an English corpus, and a third language is required to distinguish among these senses.
    As a long term vision, one can imagine a multilingual corpora based system, which exploits the differences between languages to automatically acquire knowledge about word senses.
    As explained above, this knowledge would be crucial for lexical disambiguation, and will also help to refine other types of knowledge acquired from large corporal.
  
  
    The ambiguity of a word is determined by the number of distinct, non-equivalent representations into which the word can be mapped (Van Eynde et al., 1982).
    In the case of machine translation the ambig
