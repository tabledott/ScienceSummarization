 there is no coreference link in these clusters.
    Also, it tends to underpenalize partitions with overly large clusters.
    To address these problems, two coreference scoring programs have been developed: B3 (Bagga and Baldwin, 1998) and CEAF (Luo, 2005).
    Note that both scorers have only been defined for the case where the key partition has the same set of NPs as the response partition.
    To apply these scorers to automatically extracted NPs, different methods have been proposed (see Rahman and Ng (2009) and Stoyanov et al. (2009)).
    Since coreference is a clustering task, any general-purpose method for evaluating a response partition against a key partition (e.g., Kappa (Carletta, 1996)) can be used for coreference scoring (see Popescu-Belis et al. (2004)).
    In practice, these general-purpose methods are typically used to provide scores that complement those obtained via the three coreference scorers discussed above.
    It is worth mentioning that there is a trend towards evaluating a resolv
