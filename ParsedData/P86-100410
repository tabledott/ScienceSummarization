ntic analysis is a set of PARTIALLY instantiated Semantic predicates which is similar to a frame representation.
    To produce this representation, the semantic components share access to a knowledge base, the DOMAIN MODEL, that contains generic descriptions of the domain elements corresponding to the lexical entries.
    The model includes a detailed representation of the types of assemblies that these elements can occur in.
    The semantic components are designed to work independently of the particular model, and rely on an interface to ensure a welldefined interaction with the domain model.
    The domain model, noun phrase semantics and clause semantics are all explained in more detail in the following three subsections.
    The domain currently being modelled by SDC is the Maintenance Report domain.
    The texts being analyzed are actual maintenance reports as they are called into the Burroughs Telephone Tracking System by the field engineers and typed in by the telephone operator.
    These reports g
