by some number of hidden topics that are shared across multiple documents.
    They then build a linear segmentation by adding a switching variable to indicate whether the topic distribution for each sentence is identical to that of its predecessor.
    Unlike Purver et al., we do not assume a dataset in which topics are shared across multiple documents; indeed, our model can be applied to single documents individually.
    Additionally, the inference procedure of Purver et al. requires sampling multiple layers of hidden variables.
    In contrast, our inference procedure leverages the nature of linear segmentation to search only in the space of segmentation points.
    The relationship between discourse structure and cue phrases has been studied extensively; for an early example of computational work on this topic, see (Grosz, 1977).
    Passonneau and Litman (1993) were the first to investigate the relationship between cue phrases and linear segmentation.
    More recently, cue phrases have been applied to
