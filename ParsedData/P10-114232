idate antecedent by measuring its distance from the anaphoric NP to be resolved or determining whether it is in a prominent grammatical role (e.g., subject).
    A notable exception is Iida et al. (2009), who train a ranker to rank the candidate antecedents for an anaphoric pronoun by their salience.
    It is worth noting that Tetreault (2005) has employed Grosz and Sidner&#8217;s (1986) discourse theory and Veins Theory (Ide and Cristea, 2000) to identify and remove candidate antecedents that are not referentially accessible to an anaphoric pronoun in his heuristic pronoun resolvers.
    It would be interesting to incorporate this idea into a learning-based resolver.
    There are also features that do not fall into any of the preceding categories.
    For example, a memorization feature is a word pair composed of the head nouns of the two NPs involved in an instance (Bengtson and Roth, 2008).
    Memorization features have been used as binary-valued features indicating the presence or absence of their word
