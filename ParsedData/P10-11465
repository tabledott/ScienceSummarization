ewritten with a tree sequence of equal length (see Figure 3a).
    This extra flexibility effectively makes the analysis (1) available to us.
    Any STSSG can be converted into an equivalent STSG via the creation of virtual nodes (see Figure 3b): for every elementary tree sequence with roots X1, ... , Xn, create a new root node with a that differ only in their nonterminal labels, only the most-frequent rule is kept, and its count is the total count of all the rules.
    This means that there is a one-to-one correspondence between the rules extracted by fuzzy tree-to-tree extraction and hierarchical string-to-string extraction.
    Fuzzy tree-to-tree extraction (like string-to-string extraction) generates many times more rules than exact tree-to-tree extraction does.
    In Figure 2, we observed that the flat structure of the Chinese IP prevented exact tree-to-tree extraction from extracting a rule containing just part of the IP, for example: Fuzzy tree-to-tree extraction allows any of these to be the source
