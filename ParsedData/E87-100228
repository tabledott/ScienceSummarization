e of traditional wisdom.
    It also counter to one of the intuitions autosegmental phonology which would have it that particular phonological features can be represented on at most one lexical tier, or tape.
    The intuition is that these tiers or tapes each contain a record or a particular kind of 9 gesture; the hearer's point of view, it is as though they contained a record of the signal received from a receptor that was attuned only to certain features.
    If we wish to maintain this model, there are presumably two alternatives open to us.
    Both involve assuming that roots are represented on at least two tapes in parallel, with the consonants separate from the vowel.
    According to one alternative, the root vowel would be written on the same tape as the vocalism; according to the other, it would be on a tape of its own.
    Unfortunately, neither alternative makes for a particularly happy solution.
    No problem arises from the proposal that a given morpheme should, in general, be represented on m
