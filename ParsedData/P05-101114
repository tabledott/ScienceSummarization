E&#65533; and (POS, LE&#65533; (24,847 features).
    Our results cannot be strictly compared with other grammar formalisms because each formalism represents predicate-argument dependencies differently; for reference, our results are competitive with the corresponding measures reported for Combinatory Categorial Grammar (CCG) (LP/LR = 86.6/86.3) (Clark and Curran, 2004b).
    Different from the results of CCG and PCFG (Collins, 1999; Charniak, 2000), the recall was clearly lower than precision.
    This results from the HPSG grammar having stricter feature constraints and the parser not being able to produce parse results for around one percent of the sentences.
    To improve recall, we need techniques of robust processing with HPSG. duced in Section 4.
    In all of the following experiments, we show the accuracy for the test set (&lt; 40 words) only.
    Table 4 revealed that our simple method of filtering caused a fatal bias in training data when a preliminary distribution was used only for filtering.
