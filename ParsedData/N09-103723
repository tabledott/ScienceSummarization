n Islamic Jihad as an organization and not a person.
    The baseline parser also incorrectly added an extra level of structure to the person name Osama Bin Laden, while the joint model found the correct structure.
  
  
    A pioneering antecedent for our work is (Miller et al., 2000), who trained a Collins-style generative parser (Collins, 1997) over a syntactic structure augmented with the template entity and template relations annotations for the MUC-7 shared task.
    Their sentence augmentations were similar to ours, but they did not make use of features due to the generative nature of their model.
    This approach was not followed up on in other work, presumably because around this time nearly all the activity in named entity and relation extraction moved to the use of discriminative sequence models, which allowed the flexible specification of feature templates that are very useful for these tasks.
    The present model is able to bring together both these lines of work, by integrating the strengths o
