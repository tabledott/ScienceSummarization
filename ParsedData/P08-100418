 assesses the ability of O-CRF to locate instances of relationships when the number of relationships is large and their identity is unknown.
    We show that without any relation-specific input, OCRF extracts binary relationships with high precision and a recall that nearly doubles that of O-NB.
    Sections 5.2 and 5.3 compare O-CRF to traditional and hybrid RE when the goal is to locate instances of a small set of known target relations.
    We find that while single-relation extraction, as embodied by R1-CRF, achieves comparatively higher levels of recall, it takes hundreds, and sometimes thousands, of labeled examples per relation, for R1CRF to approach the precision obtained by O-CRF, which is self-trained without any relation-specific input.
    We also show that the combination of unlexicalized, open extraction in O-CRF and lexicalized, supervised extraction in R1-CRF improves precision and F-measure compared to a standalone RE system.
    This section contrasts the performance of O-CRF with that of O-
