rdlevel alignments and paired dependency structures are constructed simultaneously.
    The English-Basque example (1) illustrates: if the English word buy is aligned to the Basque word erosi and gift is aligned to opari, the creation of the head-modifier relationship between buy and gift is accompanied by the creation of a corresponding head-modifier relationship between erosi and opari.
    Let us formalize this intuitive idea about corresponding syntactic relationships in the following more general way:
  
  
    (DCA): Given a pair of sentences E and F that are (literal) translations of each other with syntactic structures TreeE and TreeF, if nodes E and YE of TreeE are aligned with nodes xF and YF of TreeF, respectively, and if syntactic relationship R(x E, YE) holds in TreeE, then R(x F , YF) holds in TreeF.
    Here, R(x , y) may specify a head-modifier relationship between words in a dependency tree, or a sisterhood relationship between nonterminals in a constituency tree.
    As stated, the DCA amoun
