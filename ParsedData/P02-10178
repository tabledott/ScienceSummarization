 choose a bracketing B according to some distribution P(B) and then generate the sentence given that bracketing: Given B, we fill in each span independently.
    The context and yield of each span are independent of each other, and generated conditionally on the constituency Bij of that span.
    The distribution P(&#945;ij |Bij) is a pair of multinomial distributions over the set of all possible yields: one for constituents (Bij = c) and one for distituents (Bij = d).
    Similarly for P(xij |Bij) and contexts.
    The marginal probability assigned to the sentence S is given by summing over all possible bracketings of S: P(S) = Y-B P(B)P(S|B).2 To induce structure, we run EM over this model, treating the sentences S as observed and the bracketings B as unobserved.
    The parameters 2 of 2Viewed as a model generating sentences, this model is deficient, placing mass on yield and context choices which will not tile into a valid sentence, either because specifications for positions conflict or because yields of
