ore robust knowledge sources is to note that the recall limitations of CogNIAC for the class of pronouns/data considered are due to insufficient filtering mechanisms on candidate antecedents.
    There is not a need to expand the space of candidate antecedents with additional knowledge, but rather eliminate semantically plausible antecedents with constraints from verb knowledge and other sources of constraints currently not available to the system.
    However, there are classes of coreference that require strong knowledge representation to assemble the initial set of candidate antecedents.
    This includes the realm of inferred definites &amp;quot;I went to the house and opened the door&amp;quot; and synonymy between definite common nouns as in &amp;quot;the tax' and 'the levy.
    Hobbs 1976 ultimately rejects the Naive Algorithm as a stand-alone solution to the pronoun resolution problem.
    In that rejection he states: The naive algorithm does not work.
    Anyone can think of examples where it fails.
