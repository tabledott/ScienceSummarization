e adjacency model compares words 1-2 to words 2-3.
    Lauer (1995) has demonstrated superior performance of the dependency model using a test set of 244 (216 unique) noun compounds drawn from Grolier&#8217;s encyclopedia.
    This data has been used to evaluate most research since.
    He uses Roget&#8217;s thesaurus to smooth words into semantic classes, and then calculates association between classes based on their counts in a &#8220;training set&#8221; also drawn from Grolier&#8217;s.
    He achieves 80.7% accuracy using POS tags to indentify bigrams in the training set.
    Lapata and Keller (2004) derive estimates from web counts, and only compare at a lexical level, achieving 78.7% accuracy.
    Nakov and Hearst (2005) also use web counts, but incorporate additional counts from several variations on simple bigram queries, including queries for the pairs of words concatenated or joined by a hyphen.
    This results in an impressive 89.3% accuracy.
