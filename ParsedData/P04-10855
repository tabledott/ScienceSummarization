reements, and adjacency pairs provide a means of acquiring this knowledge.
    An adjacency pair is said to consist of two parts (later referred to as A and B) that are ordered, adjacent, and produced by different speakers.
    The first part makes the second one immediately relevant, as a question does with an answer, or an offer does with an acceptance.
    Extensive work in conversational analysis uses a less restrictive definition of adjacency pair that does not impose any actual adjacency requirement; this requirement is problematic in many respects (Levinson, 1983).
    Even when APs are not directly adjacent, the same constraints between pairs and mechanisms for selecting the next speaker remain in place (e.g. the case of embedded question and answer pairs).
    This relaxation on a strict adjacency requirement is particularly important in interactions of multiple speakers since other speakers have more opportunities to insert utterances between the two elements of the AP construction (e.g. interrupted
