nteresting to note that the path feature performs better when not conditioned on the domain.
    The head word, however, seems to be more domain-specific: although coverage declines when the context is restricted to the semantic domain, accuracy improves.
    This seems to indicate that the identity of certain role fillers is domainspecific, but that the syntax/semantics correspondence captured by the path feature is more general, as predicted by theories of syntactic linking.
    As general as they are, the semantic domains of the current FrameNet database cover only a small portion of the language.
    The domains are defined at the level of, for example, COMMUNICATION and EMOTION; a list of the 12 domains in our corpus is given in Table 1.
    Whether generalization is possible across domains is an important question for a general language-understanding system.
    For these experiments, a jackknifing protocol similar to that of the previous section was used, this time holding out one entire domain at a ti
