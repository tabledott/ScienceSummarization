s of rule equivalence classes and nonterminal equivalence classes.
    Suppose R&#175; is the set of rule equivalence classes and JV&#175; is the set of nonterminal equivalence classes.
    Since all rules in an equivalence class r&#175; have the same probability (condition 1), and since all the nonterminals in an equivalence class N&#175; E JV&#175; have the same distribution over rule equivalence classes (condition 1 and 3), we can define the set of rule equivalence classes R&#175;N&#175; associated with a nonterminal equivalence class &#175;N, and a vector &#952;&#175; of probabilities, indexed by rule equivalence classes r&#175; E R&#175; . &#952;&#175;N&#175; refers to the subvector of &#952;&#175; associated with nonterminal equivalence class &#175;N, indexed by r&#175; E R&#175;&#175;N.
    Since rules in the same equivalence class have the same probability, In order to perform smoothing, we will find useful a class of PCFGs in which the probabilities of certain rules are required to be the same.
