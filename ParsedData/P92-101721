cture and contingent distributional regularities, or, to put it in another way, it gives some evidence for the importance of nondistributional regularities in language, which in the case of bracketed training have been supplied indirectly by the linguists carrying out the bracketing.
    Also of practical importance, the new algorithm can have better time complexity for bracketed text.
    In the best situation, that of a training set with full binary-branching bracketing, the time for each iteration is in fact linear on the total length of the set.
    These preliminary investigations could be extended in several ways.
    First, it is important to determine the sensitivity of the training algorithm to the initial probability assignments and training corpus, as well as to lack or misplacement of brackets.
    We have started experiments in this direction, but reasonable statistical models of bracket elision and misplacement are lacking.
    Second, we would like to extend our experiments to larger terminal v
