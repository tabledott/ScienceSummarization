    Example 1 makes reference to the formal role, while 3 refers to the constitutive role.
    Example 2, however, can refer to either the telic or the agentive aspects given above.
    The utility of such knowledge for information retrieval is readily apparent.
    This theory claims that noun meanings should make reference to related concepts and the relations into which they enter.
    The qualia structure, thus, can be viewed as a kind of generic template for structuring this knowledge.
    Such information about how nouns relate to other lexical items and their concepts might prove to be much more useful in full-text information retrieval than what has come from standard statistical techniques.
    To illustrate how such semantic structuring might be useful, consider the general class of artifact nouns.
    A generative view of the lexicon predicts that by classifying an element into a particular category, we can generate many aspects of its semantic structure, and hence, its synta
