			The output from the learning algo rithm is a combinatory categorial grammar (CCG),together with parameters that define a log-linear distribution over parses under the grammar.
			Experi ments show that the approach gives high accuracy on two database-query problems, introduced by Zelle and Mooney (1996) and Tang and Mooney (2000).
			The use of a detailed grammatical formalism such as CCG has the advantage that it allows a system tohandle quite complex semantic effects, such as co ordination or scoping phenomena.
			In particular, it allows us to leverage the considerable body of work on semantics within these formalisms, for example see Carpenter (1997).
			However, a grammar based on a formalism such as CCG can be somewhat rigid, and this can cause problems when a system is faced with spontaneous, unedited natural
