opted to new translation directions.
    The beam search procedure has been successfully tested on the Uerbmobil task (German to English, 8,000-word vocabulary) and on the Canadian Hansards task (French to English, 100,000-word vocabulary).
    For the medium-sized Uerbmobil task, a sentence can be translated in a few seconds, only a small number of search errors occur, and there is no performance degradation as measured by the word error criterion used in this article.
  
  
    This article is about a search procedure for statistical machine translation (MT).
    The task of the search procedure is to find the most likely translation given a source sentence and a set of model parameters.
    Here, we will use a trigram language model and the translation model presented in Brown et al. (1993).
    Since the number of possible translations of a given source sentence is enormous, we must find the best output without actually generating the set of all possible translations; instead we would like to focus on the
