ere is a trade-off between the locality of features and the cost of estimation.
    That is, larger context features might contribute to higher accuracy, while they inflate the size of feature forests and increase the cost of parameter estimation.
    Sampling techniques (Rosenfeld 1997; Chen and Rosenfeld 1999b; Osborne 2000; Malouf and van Noord 2004) allow us to define any features on complete structures without any constraints.
    However, they force us to employ approximation methods for tractable computation.
    The effectiveness of those techniques therefore relies on convergence speed and approximation errors, which may vary depending on the characteristics of target problems and features.
    It is an open research question whether dynamic programming or sampling can deliver a better balance of estimation efficiency and accuracy.
    The answer will differ in different problems.
    When most effective features can be represented locally in tractablesize feature forests, dynamic programming methods
