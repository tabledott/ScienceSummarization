 normalization.
    In this section, we discuss the three components of our method: modeling, training and decoding for SMS text normalization.
    The SMS normalization model is based on the source channel model (Shannon, 1948).
    Assuming that an English sentence e, of length N is &#8220;corrupted&#8221; by a noisy channel to produce a SMS message s, of length M, the English sentence e, could be recovered through a posteriori distribution for a channel target text given the source text P s , and a prior distribution for (  |e) the channel source text .
    Assuming that one SMS word is mapped exactly to one English word in the channel model under an alignment A , we need to conP(sm|ea m ) (Brown et al. 1993).
    The channel en as in the following equation If we include the word &#8220;null&#8221; in the English vocabulary, the above model can fully address the deletion and substitution transformations, but inadequate to address the insertion transformation.
    For example, the lingoes &#8220;duno&#8221;
