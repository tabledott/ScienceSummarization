eatures and unification is reduced from its role in context-free based systems.
			Only finite-valued features are needed, with the possible exception of a feature whose value encodes an expression's logical form.
			In removing the conslz'uction of logical forms from the duties delegateA to features, we can maintain a strictly finiteovalued-- and therefore formally dispensable---feature system Ibr TAGs.
			As a side note, we mention a ramification of the syn- chronous TAG analysis concerning the claim of Ka- plan and Zaenen (1989) that the paths over which long-distance dependencies operate (in the f-structure of lexieal-functional grammatical theory) form a regu- lar language.
			Vijay-Shanker and Joshi (1989) provide an argument that this claim follows from several as- sumptions concerning how a feature system for TAGs might be constrained.
			Vijay-Shanker (personal commu- nication) has noted that by placing a simple assumption on the elementary trees in the logical form component of a synchronous TAG, th
