			How else could one formulate the rules of functional application.
			The implementation f this facility through Stuart Shieber, however, raised interesting problems in connection with the prediction aspect of the Earley-parser.
			Original Earley prediction works on category symbols.
			An answer to these problems was presented by Shieber (1985) who proposed to do Earley prediction on the basis of some finite quotient of all constituent DAGs which can be specified by the grammar writer.
			Another example for the influence of the CUG efforts on the development of PATR is a new template notation introduced by Lauri Karttunen in his Interlisp-D version of PATR.
			Since categorial grammars exhibit an extensive embedding of categories within other categories, it is useful to unify templates not only with the whole lexical DAG but also with its categorial subgraphs.
			The @-notation permits this use of templates (Karttunen, 1986)3
