ared ALEK's performance to a widely used grammar checker, the one incorporated in Microsoft's Word97.
    We created files of sentences used for the three development words concentrate, interest, and knowledge, and manually corrected any errors outside the local context around the target before checking them with Word97.
    The performance for concentrate showed overall precision of 0.89 and recall of 0.07.
    For interest, precision was 0.85 with recall of 0.11.
    In sentences containing knowledge, precision was 0.99 and recall was 0.30.
    Word97 correctly detected the ungrammaticality of knowledges as well as a knowledge, while it avoided flagging a knowledge of.
    In summary, Word97's precision in error detection is impressive, but the lower recall values indicate that it is responding to fewer error types than does ALEK.
    In particular, Word97 is not sensitive to inappropriate selection of prepositions for these three words (e.g., *have knowledge on history, *to concentrate at science).
