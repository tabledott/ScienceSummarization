ting the degree that two words, a word and its neighbour, occur in similar contexts.
    From inspection, one can see that the ordered neighbours of such a thesaurus relate to the different senses of the target word.
    For example, the neighbours of star in a dependency-based thesaurus provided by Lin 1 has the ordered list of neighbours: superstar, player, teammate, actor early in the list, but one can also see words that are related to another sense of star e.g. galaxy, sun, world and planet further down the list.
    We expect that the quantity and similarity of the neighbours pertaining to different senses will reflect the dominance of the sense to which they pertain.
    This is because there will be more relational data for the more prevalent senses compared to the less frequent senses.
    In this paper we describe and evaluate a method for ranking senses of nouns to obtain the predominant sense of a word using the neighbours from automatically acquired thesauruses.
