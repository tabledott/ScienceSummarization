nt is broken off into a separate initial tree, leaving a substitution node, and an adjunct is broken off into a separate modifier tree.
    A different rule is used for extracting auxiliary trees; see (Chiang, 2000) for details.
    Xia (1999) describes a similar process, and in fact our rules for the Xinhua corpus are based on hers.
    The primary language-dependent component that had to be changed in both models was the head table, used to determine heads when training.
    We modified the head rules described in (Xia, 1999) for the Xinhua corpus and substituted these new rules into both models.
    The (Chiang, 2000) model had the following additional modifications. was eliminated, causing parts of speech for unknown words to be predicted solely on the head relations in the model.
    &#8226; The default beam size in the probabilistic CKY parsing algorithm was widened.
    The default beam pruned away chart entries whose scores were not within a factor of e-5 of the top-ranked subtree; this settings and l
