ssification.
    The approach has the effect of &#8220;smoothing&#8221; the learning curves.
    During the bootstrapping process of smoothed co-training, the classifier at each iteration is replaced with a majority voting scheme applied to all classifiers constructed at previous iterations.
    2) The feature distributions of the translated text and the natural text in the same language are still different due to the inaccuracy of the machine translation service.
    We will employ the structural correspondence learning (SCL) domain adaption algorithm used in (Blitzer et al., 2007) for linking the translated text and the natural text.
