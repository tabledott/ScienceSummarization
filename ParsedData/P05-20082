04) found that performance increased to 87.2% when considering only those portions of the text deemed to be subjective.
    However, Engstr&#168;om (2004) showed that the bagof-features approach is topic-dependent.
    A classifier trained on movie reviews is unlikely to perform as well on (for example) reviews of automobiles.
    Turney (2002) noted that the unigram unpredictable might have a positive sentiment in a movie review (e.g. unpredictable plot), but could be negative in the review of an automobile (e.g. unpredictable steering).
    In this paper, we demonstrate how the models are also domain-dependent &#8212; how a classifier trained on product reviews is not effective when evaluating the sentiment of newswire articles, for example.
    Furthermore, we show how the models are temporally-dependent &#8212; how classifiers are biased by the trends of sentiment apparent during the time-period represented by the training data.
    We propose a novel source of training data based on the language used in
