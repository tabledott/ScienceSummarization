e context of text classification (Joachims, 1998).
    Additionally, rank preference techniques (Joachims, 2002) allow us to explicitly learn an optimal ranking model of text quality.
    Learning a ranking directly, rather than fitting a classifier score to a grade point scale after training, is both a more generic approach to the task and one which exploits the labelling information in the training data efficiently and directly.
    Techniques such as LSA (Landauer and Foltz, 1998) measure, in addition to writing competence, the semantic relevance of a text written in response to a given prompt.
    However, although our corpus of manually-marked texts was produced by learners of English in response to prompts eliciting free-text answers, the marking criteria are primarily based on the accurate use of a range of different linguistic constructions.
    For this reason, we believe that an approach which directly measures linguistic competence will be better suited to ESOL text assessment, and will have the ad
