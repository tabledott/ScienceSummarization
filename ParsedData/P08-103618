AS model induces a distribution over the rated aspects which can be used to accurately predict whether a text fragment is relevant to an aspect or not.
    To perform qualitative experiments we used a set of reviews of hotels taken from TripAdvisor.com7 that contained 10,000 reviews (109,024 sentences, 2,145,313 words in total).
    Every review was rated with at least three aspects: service, location and rooms.
    Each rating is an integer from 1 to 5.
    The dataset was tokenized and sentence split automatically.
    We ran the sampling chain for 700 iterations to produce a sample.
    Distributions of words in each topic were estimated as the proportion of words assigned to each topic, taking into account topic model priors 0gl and 0loc.
    The sliding windows were chosen to cover 3 sentences for all the experiments.
    All the priors were chosen to be equal to 0.1.
    We used 15 local topics and 30 global topics.
    In the model, the first three local topics were associated to the rating classifiers
