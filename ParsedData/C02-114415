			dist(C, A) is the number of operations performed using the above transformation rules on C. a b e c d e a c d b e b a c d e a b c d e A) B) C) D) E) Figure 2.
			An example of applying the transformation rules to three clusters.
			A) The classes in the answer key; B) the clusters to be transformed; C) the sets used to reconstruct the classes (Rule 1); D) the sets after three merge operations (Step 2); E) the sets after one move operation (Step 3).
			Figure 2 shows an example.
			In D) the cluster containing e could have been merged with either set (we arbitrarily chose the second).
			The total number of operations is 4.
	
	
			We generated clusters from a news corpus using CBC and compared them with classes extracted from WordNet (Miller 1990).
