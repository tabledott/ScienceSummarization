8212;was still significantly past our theoretical reach, and he suggests finally that the next weaker position is a not unreasonable one to expect of linguistic theory: that it be able to pass judgment on which of two grammars is superior with respect to a given corpus.
    That position is, of course, exactly the position taken by the MDL framework, which offers no help in coming up with analyses, but which is excellent at judging the relative merits of two analyses of a single corpus of data.
    In this paper, we have seen this point throughout, for we have carefully distinguished between heuristics, which propose possible analyses and modifications of analyses, on the one hand, and the MDL measurement, which makes the final judgment call, deciding whether to accept a modification proposed by the heuristics, on the other.
    On so much, the early generative grammar of LSLT and MDL agree.
    But they disagree with regard to two points, and on these points, MDL makes clearer, more explicit claims, and both
