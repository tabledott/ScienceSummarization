of recent syntactic theories which give up the context-free constituent backbone, cf.
    (McCawley, 1987), (Dowty, 1989), (Reape, 1993), (Kathol and Pollard, 1995).
    These approaches provide an adequate explanation for several issues problematic for phrase-structure grammars (clause union, extraposition, diverse second-position phenomena).
    Argument structure can be represented in terms of unordered trees (with crossing branches).
    In order to reduce their ambiguity potential, rather simple, 'flat' trees should be employed, while more information can be expressed by a rich system of function labels.
    Furthermore, the required theory-independence means that the form of syntactic trees should not reflect theory-specific assumptions, e.g. every syntactic structure has a unique head.
    Thus, notions such as head should be distinguished at the level of syntactic functions rather than structures.
    This requirement speaks against the traditional sort of dependency trees, in which heads a,re represe
