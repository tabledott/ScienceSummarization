symbol pairs that must be rehearsed in the course of accepting each of them.
    Kaplan has been able to put a more formal construction on this in the following way Let the empty symbols appearing in the pairs labeling any transition in the transducers be replaced by some ordinary symbol not otherwise part of the alphabet.
    The new set of transducers derived in way clearly do not accept the same tapes as the original ones did, but there is an algorithm for constructing a single finite-state transducer that will accept the intersection of the pairs they all accept.
    Suppose, now, that this configuration of parallel transducers is put in series with two other standard transducers, one which carries the real empty symbol onto its surrogate, and everything else onto itself, and another transducer that carries the surrogate onto the real empty symbol, then the resulting configuration accepts just the desired set of languages, all of which are also acceptable by single transducers that can be algorithmically
