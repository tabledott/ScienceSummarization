t results obtained using semi-supervised taggers (S&#248;gaard, 2011).
    Table 4 shows the results for the Chinese Penn Treebank CTB 5.1 together with related work.
    In experiments with the development set, we could confirm the results from the Chinese CoNLL data set and obtained the best results with the same settings (k = 3, &#945; = 0.1).
    With bi = 40, UAS improves by 0.25 and POS by 0.30, and the TLAS improvement is again highly significant (p &lt; 0.01, paired t-test).
    We get the highest UAS, 81.42, with a beam of 80 and added graph features, in which case POS accuracy increases from 92.81 to 93.24.
    Since our tagger was not optimized for Chinese, we have lower baseline results for the tagger than both Li et al. (2011) and Hatori et al.
    (2011) but still manage to achieve the highest reported UAS.
    The speed of the joint tagger and dependency parser is quite reasonable with about 0.4 seconds per sentence on the WSJ-PTB test set, given that we perform tagging and labeled parsing with
