(Marchand and Damper, 2005).
    We plan to explore other sequence prediction approaches, such as discriminative training methods (Collins, 2004), and sequence tagging with Support Vector Machines (SVM-HMM) (Altun et al., 2003) to incorporate more features (context information) into the phoneme generation model.
    We are also interested in applying our approach to other related areas such as morphology and transliteration.
  
  
    We would like to thank Susan Bartlett, Colin Cherry, and other members of the Natural Language Processing research group at University of Alberta for their helpful comments and suggestions.
