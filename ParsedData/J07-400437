ture (Charniak 1997; Goodman 1997; Collins 2003).
    A CCG binary derivation tree is generated top-down, with the probability of generating particular child nodes being conditioned on some limited context from the previously generated structure.
    Hockenmaier&#8217;s parser uses rule instantiations read off CCGbank (see Section 3.3) and some of these will be instances of type-raising and composition; hence the parser can produce non-normal-form derivations.
    However, because the parsing model is estimated over normal-form derivations, any non-normal-form derivations will receive low probabilities and are unlikely to be returned as the most probable parse.
    Hockenmaier (2003a) compares a number of generative models, starting with a baseline model based on a PCFG.
    Various extensions to the baseline are considered: increasing the amount of lexicalization; generating a lexical category at its maximal projection; conditioning the probability of a rule instantiation on the grandparent node (Johnson 199
