 k permitted source positions.
    Only towards the end of the sentence this is reduced to the number of remaining uncovered source positions.
    Let n denote the length of the input sequence and let rn denote the permitted number of permutations with the IBM constraints.
    Then, we obtain: Typically, k is set to 4.
    In this case, we obtain an asymptotic upper and lower bound of 4n, i.e. rn &#8712; o(4n).
    In Tab.
    1, the ratio of the number of permitted reorderings for the discussed constraints is listed as a function of the sentence length.
    We see that for longer sentences the ITG constraints allow for more reorderings than the IBM constraints.
    For sentences of length 10 words, there are about twice as many reorderings for the ITG constraints than for the IBM constraints.
    This ratio steadily increases.
    For longer sentences, the ITG constraints allow for much more flexibility than the IBM constraints.
  
  
    Now, let us get back to more practical aspects.
