dependencies based on the common goal of getting across the message effectively.
    The dependency features can be used in noisy contexts and are robust to the effects of other ill-formed words, as they do not rely on contiguity.
    For example, uz &#8220;use&#8221; in i did #tt uz me and yu, dependencies can capture relationships like aux(use-4, do-2), which is beyond the capabilities of the language model due to the hashtag being treated as a correct OOV word.
  
  
    The aim of our experiments is to compare the effectiveness of different methodologies over text messages, based on two datasets: (1) an SMS corpus (Choudhury et al., 2007); and (2) a novel Twitter dataset developed as part of this research, based on a random sampling of 549 English tweets.
    The English tweets were annotated by three independent annotators.
    All OOV words were pre-identified, and the annotators were requested to determine: (a) whether each OOV word was ill-formed or not; and (b) what the standard form was for ill-form
