il it has proposed n (= 15 in our experiment) candidates.
    The ith candidate is regarded as occurring at &amp;quot;Hobbs distance&amp;quot; dH = i.
    Then the probability P(dH = ila) is simply: We use I x I to denote the number of times x is observed in our training set.
    After we have identified the correct antecedents it is a simple counting procedure to compute P(plwa) where wo is in the correct antecedent for the pronoun p (Note the pronouns are grouped by their gender): When there are multiple relevant words in the antecedent we apply the likelihood test designed by Dunning (1993) on all the words in the candidate NP.
    Given our limited data, the Dunning test tells which word is the most informative, call it w, and we then use P(Piw.7)&#8226; The referents range from being mentioned only once to begin mentioned 120 times in the training examples.
    Instead of computing the probability for each one of them we group them into &amp;quot;buckets&amp;quot;, so that ma is the bucket for the number
