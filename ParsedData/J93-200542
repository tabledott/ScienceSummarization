ve] predicates.
    These are semantic n-grams rather than direct interpretations of the prepositions.
    What these expressions in effect indicate is the range of semantic environments they will appear in.
    That is, in sentences like those in Example 16, the force of the relational nouns agreement and talks is that they are unsaturated for the predicate bringing about this relation.
    In 17, on the other hand, the NPs headed by agreement and talks are saturated in this respect.
    If our hypothesis is correct, we expect that verbs governing nominals collocated with a with-phrase will be mostly those predicates referring to the agentive quale of the nominal.
    This is because the with-phrase is unsaturated as a predicate, and acts to identify the agent of the verb as its argument (cf.
    Nilsen (1973)).
    This is confirmed by our data, shown in Figure 6.
    Conversely, verbs governing nominals collocating with a between-phrase will not refer to the agentive since the phrase is saturated already.
