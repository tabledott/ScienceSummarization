w them to decide which extraction patterns and category words to keep.
    This is the only part of the process that involves human interaction.
    Next, the extraction patterns are applied to the texts to generate a semantic profile for each pattern.
    The semantic profile shows the semantic categories that were extracted by each pattern, based on the head noun of each extraction.
    Figure 3 shows the semantic profile for the pattern &amp;quot;attack on &lt;nounphrase&gt;&amp;quot; .
    PFreq is the number of times that the extraction pattern fired, SFreq is the number of times that the pattern extracted the given semantic category, and Prob is the estimated probability of the pattern extracting the given semantic category (SFreq/PFreq).
    Note that many extractions will not be labeled with any semantic category if the head noun is unknown (i.e., not in the semantic lexicon).
    Figure 3 shows that attacks are often carried out on buildings, civilians, dates, government officials, locations, militar
