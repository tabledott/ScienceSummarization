ially informative categories unidentified.
    Hence, the utility of named entity information is limited.
    In addition, instances to be detected are mainly restricted to (sequences of) proper nouns.
    Word sense disambiguation (WSD) is the task of deciding the intended sense for ambiguous words in context.
    With respect to NER, WSD lies at the other end of the semantic tagging spectrum, since the dictionary defines tens of thousand of very specific word senses, including NER categories.
    Wordnet (Fellbaum, 1998)1, possibly the most used resource for WSD, defines word senses for verbs, common and proper nouns.
    Word sense disambiguation, at this level of granularity, is a complex task which resisted all attempts of robust broad-coverage solutions.
    Many distinctions are too subtle to be captured automatically, and the magnitude of the class space &#8211; several orders larger than NER&#8217;s &#8211; makes it hard to approach the problem with sophisticated, but scalable, machine learning metho
