    Although this might not seem like a lot of category words, 25-45 words is enough to produce a reasonable core semantic lexicon.
    For example, the words judged as 5's for each category are shown in Figure 9.
    Figure 9 illustrates an important benefit of the corpus-based approach.
    By sifting through a large text corpus, the algorithm can find many relevant category words that a user would probably not enter in a semantic lexicon on their own.
    For example, suppose a user wanted to build a dictionary of Vehicle words.
    Most people would probably define words such as car, truck, plane, and automobile.
    But it is doubtful that most people would think of words like gunships, fighter, carrier, and ambulances.
    The corpus-based algorithm is especially good at identifying words that are common in the text corpus even though they might not be commonly used in general.
    As another example, specific types of weapons (e.g., M-16, AR-15, M-60, or M-7
