buted to that synset.
    Although entity has a higher probability on the TCM, compared to matter, which is above the correct sense of letter,6 the ratio of prior probabilities for the synset containing letter7 under entity is 0.001, whereas that for the synset under matter is 0.226.
    This gives a probability of 0.009 x 0.226 = 0.002 for the noun class probability given the verb class (with maximum probability) and grammatical context.
    This is the highest probability for any of the synsets of letter, and so in this case the correct sense is selected.
    Verbs and adjectives are disambiguated using TCMs to give estimates for p(nc|vc,gr) and p(nc|ac,gr), respectively.
    These are combined with prior estimates for p(nc|gr) and p(vc|gr) (or p(ac|gr)) using Bayes&#8217; rule to give: and for adjective&#8211;noun relations: The prior distributions for p(nc|gr), p(vc|gr) and p(ac|adjnoun) are obtained during the training phase.
    For the prior distribution over NC, the frequency credit of each noun in th
