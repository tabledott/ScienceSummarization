 word token, so that the substituting synonym is appropriate given the context.
    For example, in the following sentence we would like to use strategy, rather than dodge, as a substitute for scheme: A recent government study singled out the scheme as an example to others.
    We are also investigating the disambiguation of verb senses in running text before subcategorization information for the verbs is acquired, in order to produce a subcategorization lexicon specific to sense (Preiss and Korhonen 2002).
    For example, if subcategorization were acquired specific to sense, rather than verb form, then distinct senses of fire could have different subcategorization entries: Selectional preferences could also then be acquired automatically from sense-tagged data in an iterative approach (McCarthy 2001).
  
  
    We acquire selectional preferences from automatically preprocessed and parsed text during a training phase.
    The parser is applied to the test data as well in the runtime phase to identify grammat
