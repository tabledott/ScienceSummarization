  5.2 BaseNP Training Algorithm For stand-alone tool development, the Ramshaw &amp; Marcus IOB bracketing framework and a fast transformation-based learning sys- tem (Ngai and Florian, 2001) were applied to the noisy baseNP- projected data described above.
  As with POS tagger induction, bracketer induction is improved by focusing training on the highest quality projected data and ex- cluding regions with the strongest indications of word-alignment error.
  Thus sentences with the lowest 25% of model-3 alignment scores were excluded from training, as were sentences where pro- jected bracketings overlapped and conflicted (also an indicator of alignment errors).
  Data with lower-confidence POS tagging were not filtered,&lt; however, as this filtering reduces robustness when the stand-alone bracketers are applied to noisy tagger output.
  Addi- tional details are provided in Yarowsky and Ngai (2001).
