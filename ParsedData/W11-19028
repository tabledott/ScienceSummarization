ire cluster becomes singular or plural, which allows it to match other mentions that are both singular and plural.
    Please see (Raghunathan et al., 2010) for more details.
    The core of our coreference resolution system is an incremental extension of the system described in Raghunathan et al. (2010).
    Our core model includes two new sieves that address nominal mentions and are inserted based on their precision in a held-out corpus (see Table 1 for the complete list of sieves deployed in our system).
    Since these two sieves use 3We initialize the clusters as singletons and grow them progressively in each sieve.
    Ordered sieves simple lexical constraints without semantic information, we consider them part of the baseline model.
    Relaxed String Match: This sieve considers two nominal mentions as coreferent if the strings obtained by dropping the text following their head words are identical, e.g., [Clinton] and [Clinton, whose term ends in January].
    Proper Head Word Match: This sieve marks t
