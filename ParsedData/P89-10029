ration process only in the case of semantically monotonic grammars &#8212; those grammars in which the semantic component of each right-hand-side nonterminal subsumes some portion of the semantic component of the left-hand-side.
    The semantic monotonicity constraint itself is quite restrictive.
    Although it is intuitively plausible that the semantic content of subconstituents ought to play a role in the semantics of their combination&#8212;this is just a kind of compositionality claim&#8212;there are certain cases in which reasonable linguistic analyses might violate this intuition.
    In general, these cases arise when a particular lexical item is stipulated to occur, the stipulation being either lexical (as in the case of particles or idioms) or grammatical (as in the case of expletive expressions).
    Second, the left-to-right scheduling of Earley parsing, geared as it is toward the structure of the string rather than that of its meaning, is inherently more appropriate for parsing than generation.2
